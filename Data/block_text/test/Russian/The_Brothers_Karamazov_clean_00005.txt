It wo n't come to that . '' 
`` But why are you trembling ? 
Let me tell you ; he may be honest , our Mitya -LRB- he is stupid , but honest -RRB- , but he 's -- a sensualist . 
That 's the very definition and inner essence of him . 
It 's your father has handed him on his low sensuality . 
Do you know , I simply wonder at you , Alyosha , how you can have kept your purity . 
You 're a Karamazov too , you know ! 
In your family sensuality is carried to a disease . 
But now , these three sensualists are watching one another , with their knives in their belts . 
The three of them are knocking their heads together , and you may be the fourth . '' 
`` You are mistaken about that woman . 
Dmitri -- despises her , '' said Alyosha , with a sort of shudder . 
`` Grushenka ? 
No , brother , he does n't despise her . 
Since he has openly abandoned his betrothed for her , he does n't despise her . 
There 's something here , my dear boy , that you do n't understand yet . 
A man will fall in love with some beauty , with a woman 's body , or even with a part of a woman 's body -LRB- a sensualist can understand that -RRB- , and he 'll abandon his own children for her , sell his father and mother , and his country , Russia , too . 
If he 's honest , he 'll steal ; if he 's humane , he 'll murder ; if he 's faithful , he 'll deceive . 
Pushkin , the poet of women 's feet , sung of their feet in his verse . 
Others do n't sing their praises , but they ca n't look at their feet without a thrill -- and it 's not only their feet . 
Contempt 's no help here , brother , even if he did despise Grushenka . 
He does , but he ca n't tear himself away . '' 
`` I understand that , '' Alyosha jerked out suddenly . 
`` Really ? 
Well , I dare say you do understand , since you blurt it out at the first word , '' said Rakitin , malignantly . 
`` That escaped you unawares , and the confession 's the more precious . 
So it 's a familiar subject ; you 've thought about it already , about sensuality , I mean ! 
Oh , you virgin soul ! 
You 're a quiet one , Alyosha , you 're a saint , I know , but the devil only knows what you 've thought about , and what you know already ! 
You are pure , but you 've been down into the depths ... . 
I 've been watching you a long time . 
You 're a Karamazov yourself ; you 're a thorough Karamazov -- no doubt birth and selection have something to answer for . 
You 're a sensualist from your father , a crazy saint from your mother . 
Why do you tremble ? 
Is it true , then ? 
Do you know , Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along . 
` I 'll pull off his cassock , ' she says . 
You ca n't think how she keeps begging me to bring you . 
I wondered why she took such an interest in you . 
Do you know , she 's an extraordinary woman , too ! '' 
`` Thank her and say I 'm not coming , '' said Alyosha , with a strained smile . 
`` Finish what you were saying , Misha . 
I 'll tell you my idea after . '' 
`` There 's nothing to finish . 
It 's all clear . 
It 's the same old tune , brother . 
If even you are a sensualist at heart , what of your brother , Ivan ? 
He 's a Karamazov , too . 
What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is that you 're all sensual , grasping and crazy ! 
Your brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke , for some idiotic , unknown motive of his own , though he 's an atheist , and he admits it 's a fraud himself -- that 's your brother Ivan . 
He 's trying to get Mitya 's betrothed for himself , and I fancy he 'll succeed , too . 
And what 's more , it 's with Mitya 's consent . 
For Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her , and escape to Grushenka . 
And he 's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness . 
Observe that . 
Those are the most fatal people ! 
Who the devil can make you out ? 
He recognizes his vileness and goes on with it ! 
Let me tell you , too , the old man , your father , is standing in Mitya 's way now . 
He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka . 
His mouth waters at the sight of her . 
It 's simply on her account he made that scene in the cell just now , simply because Miüsov called her an ` abandoned creature . ' 
He 's worse than a tom‐cat in love . 
At first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns and in some other shady business , but now he has suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her . 
He keeps pestering her with his offers , not honorable ones , of course . 
And they 'll come into collision , the precious father and son , on that path ! 
But Grushenka favors neither of them , she 's still playing with them , and teasing them both , considering which she can get most out of . 
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he would n't marry her , and maybe he 'll turn stingy in the end , and keep his purse shut . 
That 's where Mitya 's value comes in ; he has no money , but he 's ready to marry her . 
Yes , ready to marry her ! 
to abandon his betrothed , a rare beauty , Katerina Ivanovna , who 's rich , and the daughter of a colonel , and to marry Grushenka , who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant , Samsonov , a coarse , uneducated , provincial mayor . 
Some murderous conflict may well come to pass from all this , and that 's what your brother Ivan is waiting for . 
It would suit him down to the ground . 
He 'll carry off Katerina Ivanovna , for whom he is languishing , and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand . 
That 's very alluring to start with , for a man of no consequence and a beggar . 
And , take note , he wo n't be wronging Mitya , but doing him the greatest service . 
For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week , when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern , cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed , Katya , but that his brother Ivan , he was the man who deserved her . 
And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan . 
She 's hesitating between the two of them already . 
And how has that Ivan won you all , so that you all worship him ? 
He is laughing at you , and enjoying himself at your expense . '' 
`` How do you know ? 
How can you speak so confidently ? '' 
Alyosha asked sharply , frowning . 
`` Why do you ask , and are frightened at my answer ? 
It shows that you know I 'm speaking the truth . '' 
`` You do n't like Ivan . 
Ivan would n't be tempted by money . '' 
`` Really ? 
And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna ? 
It 's not only the money , though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction . '' 
`` Ivan is above that . 
He would n't make up to any one for thousands . 
It is not money , it 's not comfort Ivan is seeking . 
Perhaps it 's suffering he is seeking . '' 
`` What wild dream now ? 
Oh , you -- aristocrats ! '' 
`` Ah , Misha , he has a stormy spirit . 
His mind is in bondage . 
He is haunted by a great , unsolved doubt . 
He is one of those who do n't want millions , but an answer to their questions . '' 
`` That 's plagiarism , Alyosha . 
You 're quoting your elder 's phrases . 
Ah , Ivan has set you a problem ! '' 
cried Rakitin , with undisguised malice . 
His face changed , and his lips twitched . 
`` And the problem 's a stupid one . 
It is no good guessing it . 
Rack your brains -- you 'll understand it . 
His article is absurd and ridiculous . 
And did you hear his stupid theory just now : if there 's no immortality of the soul , then there 's no virtue , and everything is lawful . 
-LRB- And by the way , do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out : ` I will remember ! ' -RRB- 
An attractive theory for scoundrels ! 
-- -LRB- I 'm being abusive , that 's stupid . -RRB- 
Not for scoundrels , but for pedantic poseurs , ` haunted by profound , unsolved doubts . ' 
He 's showing off , and what it all comes to is , ` on the one hand we can not but admit ' and ` on the other it must be confessed ! ' 
His whole theory is a fraud ! 
Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality . 
It will find it in love for freedom , for equality , for fraternity . '' 
Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat , but , suddenly , as though remembering something , he stopped short . 
`` Well , that 's enough , '' he said , with a still more crooked smile . 
`` Why are you laughing ? 
Do you think I 'm a vulgar fool ? '' 
`` No , I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool . 
You are clever but ... never mind , I was silly to smile . 
I understand your getting hot about it , Misha . 
I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself ; I 've suspected that for a long time , brother , that 's why you do n't like my brother Ivan . 
Are you jealous of him ? '' 
`` And jealous of her money , too ? 
Wo n't you add that ? '' 
`` I 'll say nothing about money . 
I am not going to insult you . '' 
`` I believe it , since you say so , but confound you , and your brother Ivan with you . 
Do n't you understand that one might very well dislike him , apart from Katerina Ivanovna . 
And why the devil should I like him ? 
He condescends to abuse me , you know . 
Why have n't I a right to abuse him ? '' 
`` I never heard of his saying anything about you , good or bad . 
He does n't speak of you at all . '' 
`` But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna 's he was abusing me for all he was worth -- you see what an interest he takes in your humble servant . 
And which is the jealous one after that , brother , I ca n't say . 
He was so good as to express the opinion that , if I do n't go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and do n't become a monk , I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer , that I shall write for the next ten years , and in the end become the owner of the magazine , and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic side , with a socialistic tinge , with a tiny gloss of socialism , but keeping a sharp look out all the time , that is , keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the fools . 
According to your brother 's account , the tinge of socialism wo n't hinder me from laying by the proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some Jew , till at the end of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing offices to it , and let out the upper stories to lodgers . 
He has even chosen the place for it , near the new stone bridge across the Neva , which they say is to be built in Petersburg . '' 
`` Ah , Misha , that 's just what will really happen , every word of it , '' cried Alyosha , unable to restrain a good‐humored smile . 
`` You are pleased to be sarcastic , too , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` No , no , I 'm joking , forgive me . 
I 've something quite different in my mind . 
But , excuse me , who can have told you all this ? 
You ca n't have been at Katerina Ivanovna 's yourself when he was talking about you ? '' 
`` I was n't there , but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was ; and I heard him tell it with my own ears ; if you want to know , he did n't tell me , but I overheard him , unintentionally , of course , for I was sitting in Grushenka 's bedroom and I could n't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch was in the next room . '' 
`` Oh , yes , I 'd forgotten she was a relation of yours . '' 
`` A relation ! 
That Grushenka a relation of mine ! '' 
cried Rakitin , turning crimson . 
`` Are you mad ? 
You 're out of your mind ! '' 
`` Why , is n't she a relation of yours ? 
I heard so . '' 
`` Where can you have heard it ? 
You Karamazovs brag of being an ancient , noble family , though your father used to run about playing the buffoon at other men 's tables , and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor . 
I may be only a priest 's son , and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you , but do n't insult me so lightly and wantonly . 
I have a sense of honor , too , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I could n't be a relation of Grushenka , a common harlot . 
I beg you to understand that ! '' 
Rakitin was intensely irritated . 
`` Forgive me , for goodness ' sake , I had no idea ... besides ... how can you call her a harlot ? 
Is she ... that sort of woman ? '' 
Alyosha flushed suddenly . 
`` I tell you again , I heard that she was a relation of yours . 
You often go to see her , and you told me yourself you 're not her lover . 
I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her ! 
Does she really deserve it ? '' 
`` I may have reasons of my own for visiting her . 
That 's not your business . 
But as for relationship , your brother , or even your father , is more likely to make her yours than mine . 
Well , here we are . 
You 'd better go to the kitchen . 
Hullo ! 
what 's wrong , what is it ? 
Are we late ? 
They ca n't have finished dinner so soon ! 
Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again ? 
No doubt they have . 
Here 's your father and your brother Ivan after him . 
They 've broken out from the Father Superior 's . 
And look , Father Isidor 's shouting out something after them from the steps . 
And your father 's shouting and waving his arms . 
I expect he 's swearing . 
Bah , and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage . 
You see , he 's going . 
And there 's old Maximov running ! 
-- there must have been a row . 
There ca n't have been any dinner . 
Surely they 've not been beating the Father Superior ! 
Or have they , perhaps , been beaten ? 
It would serve them right ! '' 
There was reason for Rakitin 's exclamations . 
There had been a scandalous , an unprecedented scene . 
It had all come from the impulse of a moment . 
Miüsov , as a man of breeding and delicacy , could not but feel some inward qualms , when he reached the Father Superior 's with Ivan : he felt ashamed of having lost his temper . 
He felt that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch , Fyodor Pavlovitch , too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima 's cell , and so to have forgotten himself . 
`` The monks were not to blame , in any case , '' he reflected , on the steps . 
`` And if they 're decent people here -LRB- and the Father Superior , I understand , is a nobleman -RRB- why not be friendly and courteous with them ? 
I wo n't argue , I 'll fall in with everything , I 'll win them by politeness , and ... and ... show them that I 've nothing to do with that Æsop , that buffoon , that Pierrot , and have merely been taken in over this affair , just as they have . '' 
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery , and relinquish his claims to the wood‐cutting and fishery rights at once . 
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable , and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were . 
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father Superior 's dining‐room , though , strictly speaking , it was not a dining room , for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether ; they were , however , much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima 's . 
But there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either . 
The furniture was of mahogany , covered with leather , in the old‐fashioned style of 1820 ; the floor was not even stained , but everything was shining with cleanliness , and there were many choice flowers in the windows ; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was , of course , the beautifully decorated table . 
The cloth was clean , the service shone ; there were three kinds of well‐baked bread , two bottles of wine , two of excellent mead , and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery , and famous in the neighborhood . 
There was no vodka . 
Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes : fish‐soup made of sterlets , served with little fish patties ; then boiled fish served in a special way ; then salmon cutlets , ice pudding and compote , and finally , blanc‐mange . 
Rakitin found out about all these good things , for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen , where he already had a footing . 
He had a footing everywhere , and got information about everything . 
He was of an uneasy and envious temper . 
He was well aware of his own considerable abilities , and nervously exaggerated them in his self‐conceit . 
He knew he would play a prominent part of some sort , but Alyosha , who was attached to him , was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable , and quite unconscious of being so himself , considering , on the contrary , that because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity . 
Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced him in that . 
Rakitin , of course , was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner , to which Father Iosif , Father Païssy , and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited . 
They were already waiting when Miüsov , Kalganov , and Ivan arrived . 
The other guest , Maximov , stood a little aside , waiting also . 
The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests . 
He was a tall , thin , but still vigorous old man , with black hair streaked with gray , and a long , grave , ascetic face . 
He bowed to his guests in silence . 
But this time they approached to receive his blessing . 
Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand , but the Father Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute . 
But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple‐hearted and complete manner , kissing his hand as peasants do . 
`` We must apologize most humbly , your reverence , '' began Miüsov , simpering affably , and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone . 
`` Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited , Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality , and not without reason . 
In the reverend Father Zossima 's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his son , and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ... in fact , quite unseemly ... as '' -- he glanced at the monks -- `` your reverence is , no doubt , already aware . 
And therefore , recognizing that he had been to blame , he felt sincere regret and shame , and begged me , and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch , to convey to you his apologies and regrets . 
In brief , he hopes and desires to make amends later . 
He asks your blessing , and begs you to forget what has taken place . '' 
As he uttered the last word of his tirade , Miüsov completely recovered his self‐complacency , and all traces of his former irritation disappeared . 
He fully and sincerely loved humanity again . 
The Father Superior listened to him with dignity , and , with a slight bend of the head , replied : `` I sincerely deplore his absence . 
Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us , and we him . 
Pray be seated , gentlemen . '' 
He stood before the holy image , and began to say grace , aloud . 
All bent their heads reverently , and Maximov clasped his hands before him , with peculiar fervor . 
It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank . 
It must be noted that he really had meant to go home , and really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happened , after his disgraceful behavior in the elder 's cell . 
Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps . 
But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner . 
Yet his creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel , and he had hardly got into it , when he suddenly stopped short . 
He remembered his own words at the elder 's : `` I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all , and that they all take me for a buffoon ; so I say let me play the buffoon , for you are , every one of you , stupider and lower than I. '' He longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness . 
He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked , `` Why do you hate so and so , so much ? '' 
And he had answered them , with his shameless impudence , `` I 'll tell you . 
He has done me no harm . 
But I played him a dirty trick , and ever since I have hated him . '' 
Remembering that now , he smiled quietly and malignantly , hesitating for a moment . 
His eyes gleamed , and his lips positively quivered . 
`` Well , since I have begun , I may as well go on , '' he decided . 
His predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed in the following words , `` Well , there is no rehabilitating myself now . 
So let me shame them for all I am worth . 
I will show them I do n't care what they think -- that 's all ! '' 
He told the coachman to wait , while with rapid steps he returned to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior 's . 
He had no clear idea what he would do , but he knew that he could not control himself , and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity , but only to obscenity , to nothing criminal , nothing for which he could be legally punished . 
In the last resort , he could always restrain himself , and had marveled indeed at himself , on that score , sometimes . 
He appeared in the Father Superior 's dining‐room , at the moment when the prayer was over , and all were moving to the table . 
Standing in the doorway , he scanned the company , and laughing his prolonged , impudent , malicious chuckle , looked them all boldly in the face . 
`` They thought I had gone , and here I am again , '' he cried to the whole room . 
For one moment every one stared at him without a word ; and at once every one felt that something revolting , grotesque , positively scandalous , was about to happen . 
Miüsov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage . 
All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly . 
`` No ! 
this I can not endure ! '' 
he cried . 
`` I absolutely can not ! 
and ... I certainly can not ! '' 
The blood rushed to his head . 
He positively stammered ; but he was beyond thinking of style , and he seized his hat . 
`` What is it he can not ? '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , `` that he absolutely can not and certainly can not ? 
Your reverence , am I to come in or not ? 
Will you receive me as your guest ? '' 
`` You are welcome with all my heart , '' answered the Superior . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
he added , `` I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your dissensions , and to be united in love and family harmony -- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table . '' 
`` No , no , it is impossible ! '' 
cried Miüsov , beside himself . 
`` Well , if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch , it is impossible for me , and I wo n't stop . 
That is why I came . 
I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now . 
If you will go away , Pyotr Alexandrovitch , I will go away too , if you remain , I will remain . 
You stung him by what you said about family harmony , Father Superior , he does not admit he is my relation . 
That 's right , is n't it , von Sohn ? 
Here 's von Sohn . 
How are you , von Sohn ? '' 
`` Do you mean me ? '' 
muttered Maximov , puzzled . 
`` Of course I mean you , '' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
`` Who else ? 
The Father Superior could not be von Sohn . '' 
`` But I am not von Sohn either . 
I am Maximov . '' 
`` No , you are von Sohn . 
Your reverence , do you know who von Sohn was ? 
It was a famous murder case . 
He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you -- he was killed and robbed , and in spite of his venerable age , he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van , and while they were nailing him up , the harlots sang songs and played the harp , that is to say , the piano . 
So this is that very von Sohn . 
He has risen from the dead , has n't he , von Sohn ? '' 
`` What is happening ? 
What 's this ? '' 
voices were heard in the group of monks . 
`` Let us go , '' cried Miüsov , addressing Kalganov . 
`` No , excuse me , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly , taking another step into the room . 
`` Allow me to finish . 
There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon , Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
Miüsov , my relation , prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincérité in his words , but I prefer in mine plus de sincérité que de noblesse , and -- damn the noblesse ! 
That 's right , is n't it , von Sohn ? 
Allow me , Father Superior , though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon , yet I am the soul of honor , and I want to speak my mind . 
Yes , I am the soul of honor , while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else . 
I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind . 
My son , Alexey , is here , being saved . 
I am his father ; I care for his welfare , and it is my duty to care . 
While I 've been playing the fool , I have been listening and having a look on the sly ; and now I want to give you the last act of the performance . 
You know how things are with us ? 
As a thing falls , so it lies . 
As a thing once has fallen , so it must lie for ever . 
Not a bit of it ! 
I want to get up again . 
Holy Father , I am indignant with you . 
Confession is a great sacrament , before which I am ready to bow down reverently ; but there in the cell , they all kneel down and confess aloud . 
Can it be right to confess aloud ? 
It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in secret : then only your confession will be a mystery , and so it was of old . 
But how can I explain to him before every one that I did this and that ... well , you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal ! 
No , Fathers , one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants , I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod , and I shall take my son , Alexey , home . '' 
We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak spot . 
There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached the Archbishop -LRB- not only regarding our monastery , but in others where the institution of elders existed -RRB- that too much respect was paid to the elders , even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior , that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere . 
But the spirit of folly , which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch , and was bearing him on the current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy , prompted him with this old slander . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it , and he could not even put it sensibly , for on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder 's cell , so that he could not have seen anything of the kind . 
He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders . 
But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade , he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense , and at once longed to prove to his audience , and above all to himself , that he had not been talking nonsense . 
And , though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would be adding more and more absurdity , he could not restrain himself , and plunged forward blindly . 
`` How disgraceful ! '' 
cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch . 
`` Pardon me ! '' 
said the Father Superior . 
`` It was said of old , ` Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me . 
And hearing it I have said to myself : it is the correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul . ' 
And so we humbly thank you , honored guest ! '' 
and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow . 
`` Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniousness and stock phrases ! 
Old phrases and old gestures . 
The old lies and formal prostrations . 
We know all about them . 
A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart , as in Schiller 's Robbers . 
I do n't like falsehood , Fathers , I want the truth . 
But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud ! 
Father monks , why do you fast ? 
Why do you expect reward in heaven for that ? 
Why , for reward like that I will come and fast too ! 
No , saintly monk , you try being virtuous in the world , do good to society , without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people 's expense , and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you 'll find that a bit harder . 
I can talk sense , too , Father Superior . 
What have they got here ? '' 
He went up to the table . 
`` Old port wine , mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers . 
Fie , fie , fathers ! 
That is something beyond gudgeon . 
Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out , he he he ! 
And who has provided it all ? 
The Russian peasant , the laborer , brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand , wringing it from his family and the tax‐gatherer ! 
You bleed the people , you know , holy fathers . '' 
`` This is too disgraceful ! '' 
said Father Iosif . 
Father Païssy kept obstinately silent . 
Miüsov rushed from the room , and Kalganov after him . 
`` Well , Father , I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch ! 
I am not coming to see you again . 
You may beg me on your knees , I sha n't come . 
I sent you a thousand roubles , so you have begun to keep your eye on me . 
He he he ! 
No , I 'll say no more . 
I am taking my revenge for my youth , for all the humiliation I endured . '' 
He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling . 
`` This monastery has played a great part in my life ! 
It has cost me many bitter tears . 
You used to set my wife , the crazy one , against me . 
You cursed me with bell and book , you spread stories about me all over the place . 
Enough , fathers ! 
This is the age of Liberalism , the age of steamers and railways . 
Neither a thousand , nor a hundred roubles , no , nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me ! '' 
It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his life , and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it . 
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion , that he was for one moment almost believing it himself . 
He was so touched he was almost weeping . 
But at that very instant , he felt that it was time to draw back . 
The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie , and again spoke impressively : `` It is written again , ` Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own , be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee . ' 
And so will we . '' 
`` Tut , tut , tut ! 
Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole . 
Bethink yourselves , Fathers , I will go . 
But I will take my son , Alexey , away from here for ever , on my parental authority . 
Ivan Fyodorovitch , my most dutiful son , permit me to order you to follow me . 
Von Sohn , what have you to stay for ? 
Come and see me now in the town . 
It is fun there . 
It is only one short verst ; instead of lenten oil , I will give you sucking‐pig and kasha . 
We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it ... . 
I 've cloudberry wine . 
Hey , von Sohn , do n't lose your chance . '' 
He went out , shouting and gesticulating . 
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha . 
`` Alexey ! '' 
his father shouted , from far off , catching sight of him . 
`` You come home to me to‐day , for good , and bring your pillow and mattress , and leave no trace behind . '' 
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot , watching the scene in silence . 
Meanwhile , Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage , and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good‐by to Alyosha . 
But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode . 
Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage . 
He ran up , panting , afraid of being too late . 
Rakitin and Alyosha saw him running . 
He was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which Ivan 's left foot was still resting , and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in . 
`` I am going with you ! '' 
he kept shouting , laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face . 
`` Take me , too . '' 
`` There ! '' 
cried Fyodor Pavlovitch , delighted . 
`` Did I not say he was von Sohn . 
It is von Sohn himself , risen from the dead . 
Why , how did you tear yourself away ? 
What did you vonsohn there ? 
And how could you get away from the dinner ? 
You must be a brazen‐faced fellow ! 
I am that myself , but I am surprised at you , brother ! 
Jump in , jump in ! 
Let him pass , Ivan . 
It will be fun . 
He can lie somewhere at our feet . 
Will you lie at our feet , von Sohn ? 
Or perch on the box with the coachman . 
Skip on to the box , von Sohn ! '' 
But Ivan , who had by now taken his seat , without a word gave Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying . 
It was quite by chance he did not fall . 
`` Drive on ! '' 
Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman . 
`` Why , what are you doing , what are you about ? 
Why did you do that ? '' 
Fyodor Pavlovitch protested . 
But the carriage had already driven away . 
Ivan made no reply . 
`` Well , you are a fellow , '' Fyodor Pavlovitch said again . 
After a pause of two minutes , looking askance at his son , `` Why , it was you got up all this monastery business . 
You urged it , you approved of it . 
Why are you angry now ? '' 
`` You 've talked rot enough . 
You might rest a bit now , '' Ivan snapped sullenly . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes . 
`` A drop of brandy would be nice now , '' he observed sententiously , but Ivan made no response . 
`` You shall have some , too , when we get home . '' 
Ivan was still silent . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes . 
`` But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery , though you will dislike it so much , most honored Karl von Moor . '' 
Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously , and turning away stared at the road . 
And they did not speak again all the way home . 
The Karamazovs ' house was far from being in the center of the town , but it was not quite outside it . 
It was a pleasant‐looking old house of two stories , painted gray , with a red iron roof . 
It was roomy and snug , and might still last many years . 
There were all sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases . 
There were rats in it , but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them . 
`` One does n't feel so solitary when one 's left alone in the evening , '' he used to say . 
It was his habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone . 
The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there , although there was a kitchen in the house ; he did not like the smell of cooking , and , winter and summer alike , the dishes were carried in across the courtyard . 
The house was built for a large family ; there was room for five times as many , with their servants . 
But at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan . 
And in the lodge there were only three servants : old Grigory , and his old wife Marfa , and a young man called Smerdyakov . 
Of these three we must say a few words . 
Of old Grigory we have said something already . 
He was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his object , if once he had been brought by any reasons -LRB- and they were often very illogical ones -RRB- to believe that it was immutably right . 
He was honest and incorruptible . 
His wife , Marfa Ignatyevna , had obeyed her husband 's will implicitly all her life , yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs . 
She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small savings . 
But Grigory decided then , once for all , that `` the woman 's talking nonsense , for every woman is dishonest , '' and that they ought not to leave their old master , whatever he might be , for `` that was now their duty . '' 
`` Do you understand what duty is ? '' 
he asked Marfa Ignatyevna . 
`` I understand what duty means , Grigory Vassilyevitch , but why it 's our duty to stay here I never shall understand , '' Marfa answered firmly . 
`` Well , do n't understand then . 
But so it shall be . 
And you hold your tongue . '' 
And so it was . 
They did not go away , and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a small sum for wages , and paid it regularly . 
Grigory knew , too , that he had an indisputable influence over his master . 
It was true , and he was aware of it . 
Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon , yet , though his will was strong enough `` in some of the affairs of life , '' as he expressed it , he found himself , to his surprise , extremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies . 
He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them . 
There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out . 
And that 's not easy without a trustworthy man , and Grigory was a most trustworthy man . 
Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory 's intervention , and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture . 
But it was n't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of . 
There were graver occasions , and very subtle and complicated ones , when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted , which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a moment . 
It was almost a morbid condition . 
Corrupt and often cruel in his lust , like some noxious insect , Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes , in moments of drunkenness , overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form . 
`` My soul 's simply quaking in my throat at those times , '' he used to say . 
At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand , in the lodge if not in the room , a strong , faithful man , virtuous and unlike himself , who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his secrets , but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that , not to oppose him , above all , not to reproach him or threaten him with anything , either in this world or in the next , and , in case of need , to defend him -- from whom ? 
From somebody unknown , but terrible and dangerous . 
What he needed was to feel that there was another man , an old and tried friend , that he might call him in his sick moments merely to look at his face , or , perhaps , exchange some quite irrelevant words with him . 
And if the old servant were not angry , he felt comforted , and if he were angry , he was more dejected . 
It happened even -LRB- very rarely however -RRB- that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him for a moment .
