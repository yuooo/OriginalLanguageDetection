The friends who to-morrow will forget me or , worse , will utter goodness knows what falsehoods about me ; the women who , while embracing another , will laugh at me in order not to arouse his jealousy of the deceased -- let them go ! 
Out of the storm of life I have borne away only a few ideas -- and not one feeling . 
For a long time now I have been living , not with my heart , but with my head . 
I weigh , analyse my own passions and actions with severe curiosity , but without sympathy . 
There are two personalities within me : one lives -- in the complete sense of the word -- the other reflects and judges him ; the first , it may be , in an hour 's time , will take farewell of you and the world for ever , and the second -- the second ? 
... Look , doctor , do you see those three black figures on the cliff , to the right ? 
They are our antagonists , I suppose ? '' 
... We pushed on . 
In the bushes at the foot of the cliff three horses were tethered ; we tethered ours there too , and then we clambered up the narrow path to the ledge on which Grushnitski was awaiting us in company with the captain of dragoons and his other second , whom they called Ivan Ignatevich . 
His surname I never heard . 
`` We have been expecting you for quite a long time , '' said the captain of dragoons , with an ironical smile . 
I drew out my watch and showed him the time . 
He apologized , saying that his watch was fast . 
There was an embarrassing silence for a few moments . 
At length the doctor interrupted it . 
`` It seems to me , '' he said , turning to Grushnitski , `` that as you have both shown your readiness to fight , and thereby paid the debt due to the conditions of honour , you might be able to come to an explanation and finish the affair amicably . '' 
`` I am ready , '' I said . 
The captain winked to Grushnitski , and the latter , thinking that I was losing courage , assumed a haughty air , although , until that moment , his cheeks had been covered with a dull pallor . 
For the first time since our arrival he lifted his eyes on me ; but in his glance there was a certain disquietude which evinced an inward struggle . 
`` Declare your conditions , '' he said , `` and anything I can do for you , be assured '' ... `` These are my conditions : you will this very day publicly recant your slander and beg my pardon '' ... `` My dear sir , I wonder how you dare make such a proposal to me ? '' 
`` What else could I propose ? '' 
... `` We will fight . '' 
I shrugged my shoulders . 
`` Be it so ; only , bethink you that one of us will infallibly be killed . '' 
`` I hope it will be you '' ... `` And I am so convinced of the contrary '' ... He became confused , turned red , and then burst out into a forced laugh . 
The captain took his arm and led him aside ; they whispered together for a long time . 
I had arrived in a fairly pacific frame of mind , but all this was beginning to drive me furious . 
The doctor came up to me . 
`` Listen , '' he said , with manifest uneasiness , `` you have surely forgotten their conspiracy ! 
... I do not know how to load a pistol , but in this case ... You are a strange man ! 
Tell them that you know their intention -- and they will not dare ... What sport ! 
To shoot you like a bird '' ... `` Please do not be uneasy , doctor , and wait awhile ... I shall arrange everything in such a way that there will be no advantage on their side . 
Let them whisper '' ... `` Gentlemen , this is becoming tedious , '' I said to them loudly : `` if we are to fight , let us fight ; you had time yesterday to talk as much as you wanted to . '' 
`` We are ready , '' answered the captain . 
`` Take your places , gentlemen ! 
Doctor , be good enough to measure six paces '' ... `` Take your places ! '' 
repeated Ivan Ignatevich , in a squeaky voice . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
I said . 
`` One further condition . 
As we are going to fight to the death , we are bound to do everything possible in order that the affair may remain a secret , and that our seconds may incur no responsibility . 
Do you agree ? '' 
... `` Quite . '' 
`` Well , then , this is my idea . 
Do you see that narrow ledge on the top of the perpendicular cliff on the right ? 
It must be thirty fathoms , if not more , from there to the bottom ; and , down below , there are sharp rocks . 
Each of us will stand right at the extremity of the ledge -- in such manner even a slight wound will be mortal : that ought to be in accordance with your desire , as you yourselves have fixed upon six paces . 
Whichever of us is wounded will be certain to fall down and be dashed to pieces ; the doctor will extract the bullet , and , then , it will be possible very easily to account for that sudden death by saying it was the result of a fall . 
Let us cast lots to decide who shall fire first . 
In conclusion , I declare that I will not fight on any other terms . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
said the captain after an expressive glance at Grushnitski , who nodded his head in token of assent . 
Every moment he was changing countenance . 
I had placed him in an embarrassing position . 
Had the duel been fought upon the usual conditions , he could have aimed at my leg , wounded me slightly , and in such wise gratified his vengeance without overburdening his conscience . 
But now he was obliged to fire in the air , or to make himself an assassin , or , finally , to abandon his base plan and to expose himself to equal danger with me . 
I should not have liked to be in his place at that moment . 
He took the captain aside and said something to him with great warmth . 
His lips were blue , and I saw them trembling ; but the captain turned away from him with a contemptuous smile . 
`` You are a fool , '' he said to Grushnitski rather loudly . 
`` You ca n't understand a thing ! 
... Let us be off , then , gentlemen ! '' 
The precipice was approached by a narrow path between bushes , and fragments of rock formed the precarious steps of that natural staircase . 
Clinging to the bushes we proceeded to clamber up . 
Grushnitski went in front , his seconds behind him , and then the doctor and I. `` I am surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pressing my hand vigorously . 
`` Let me feel your pulse ! 
... Oho ! 
Feverish ! 
... But nothing noticeable on your countenance ... only your eyes are gleaming more brightly than usual . '' 
Suddenly small stones rolled noisily right under our feet . 
What was it ? 
Grushnitski had stumbled ; the branch to which he was clinging had broken off , and he would have rolled down on his back if his seconds had not held him up . 
`` Take care ! '' 
I cried . 
`` Do not fall prematurely : that is a bad sign . 
Remember Julius Caesar ! '' 
AND now we had climbed to the summit of the projecting cliff . 
The ledge was covered with fine sand , as if on purpose for a duel . 
All around , like an innumerable herd , crowded the mountains , their summits lost to view in the golden mist of the morning ; and towards the south rose the white mass of Elbruz , closing the chain of icy peaks , among which fibrous clouds , which had rushed in from the east , were already roaming . 
I walked to the extremity of the ledge and gazed down . 
My head nearly swam . 
At the foot of the precipice all seemed dark and cold as in a tomb ; the moss-grown jags of the rocks , hurled down by storm and time , were awaiting their prey . 
The ledge on which we were to fight formed an almost regular triangle . 
Six paces were measured from the projecting corner , and it was decided that whichever had first to meet the fire of his opponent should stand in the very corner with his back to the precipice ; if he was not killed the adversaries would change places . 
I determined to relinquish every advantage to Grushnitski ; I wanted to test him . 
A spark of magnanimity might awake in his soul -- and then all would have been settled for the best . 
But his vanity and weakness of character had perforce to triumph ! 
... I wished to give myself the full right to refrain from sparing him if destiny were to favour me . 
Who would not have concluded such an agreement with his conscience ? 
`` Cast the lot , doctor ! '' 
said the captain . 
The doctor drew a silver coin from his pocket and held it up . 
`` Tail ! '' 
cried Grushnitski hurriedly , like a man suddenly aroused by a friendly nudge . 
`` Head , '' I said . 
The coin spun in the air and fell , jingling . 
We all rushed towards it . 
`` You are lucky , '' I said to Grushnitski . 
`` You are to fire first ! 
But remember that if you do not kill me I shall not miss -- I give you my word of honour . '' 
He flushed up ; he was ashamed to kill an unarmed man . 
I looked at him fixedly ; for a moment it seemed to me that he would throw himself at my feet , imploring forgiveness ; but how to confess so base a plot ? 
... One expedient only was left to him -- to fire in the air ! 
I was convinced that he would fire in the air ! 
One consideration alone might prevent him doing so -- the thought that I would demand a second duel . 
`` Now is the time ! '' 
the doctor whispered to me , plucking me by the sleeve . 
`` If you do not tell them now that we know their intentions , all is lost . 
Look , he is loading already ... If you will not say anything , I will '' ... `` On no account , doctor ! '' 
I answered , holding him back by the arm . 
`` You will spoil everything . 
You have given me your word not to interfere ... What does it matter to you ? 
Perhaps I wish to be killed '' ... He looked at me in astonishment . 
`` Oh , that is another thing ! 
... Only do not complain of me in the other world '' ... Meanwhile the captain had loaded his pistols and given one to Grushnitski , after whispering something to him with a smile ; the other he gave to me . 
I placed myself in the corner of the ledge , planting my left foot firmly against the rock and bending slightly forward , so that , in case of a slight wound , I might not fall over backwards . 
Grushnitski placed himself opposite me and , at a given signal , began to raise his pistol . 
His knees shook . 
He aimed right at my forehead ... Unutterable fury began to seethe within my breast . 
Suddenly he dropped the muzzle of the pistol and , pale as a sheet , turned to his second . 
`` I can not , '' he said in a hollow voice . 
`` Coward ! '' 
answered the captain . 
A shot rang out . 
The bullet grazed my knee . 
Involuntarily I took a few paces forward in order to get away from the edge as quickly as possible . 
`` Well , my dear Grushnitski , it is a pity that you have missed ! '' 
said the captain . 
`` Now it is your turn , take your stand ! 
Embrace me first : we shall not see each other again ! '' 
They embraced ; the captain could scarcely refrain from laughing . 
`` Do not be afraid , '' he added , glancing cunningly at Grushnitski ; `` everything in this world is nonsense ... Nature is a fool , fate a turkeyhen , and life a copeck ! '' 
-LSB- 31 -RSB- After that tragic phrase , uttered with becoming gravity , he went back to his place . 
Ivan Ignatevich , with tears , also embraced Grushnitski , and there the latter remained alone , facing me . 
Ever since then , I have been trying to explain to myself what sort of feeling it was that was boiling within my breast at that moment : it was the vexation of injured vanity , and contempt , and wrath engendered at the thought that the man now looking at me with such confidence , such quiet insolence , had , two minutes before , been about to kill me like a dog , without exposing himself to the least danger , because had I been wounded a little more severely in the leg I should inevitably have fallen over the cliff . 
For a few moments I looked him fixedly in the face , trying to discern thereon even a slight trace of repentance . 
But it seemed to me that he was restraining a smile . 
`` I should advise you to say a prayer before you die , '' I said . 
`` Do not worry about my soul any more than your own . 
One thing I beg of you : be quick about firing . '' 
`` And you do not recant your slander ? 
You do not beg my forgiveness ? 
... Bethink you well : has your conscience nothing to say to you ? '' 
`` Mr. Pechorin ! '' 
exclaimed the captain of dragoons . 
`` Allow me to point out that you are not here to preach ... Let us lose no time , in case anyone should ride through the gorge and we should be seen . '' 
`` Very well . 
Doctor , come here ! '' 
The doctor came up to me . 
Poor doctor ! 
He was paler than Grushnitski had been ten minutes before . 
The words which followed I purposely pronounced with a pause between each -- loudly and distinctly , as the sentence of death is pronounced : `` Doctor , these gentlemen have forgotten , in their hurry , no doubt , to put a bullet in my pistol . 
I beg you to load it afresh -- and properly ! '' 
`` Impossible ! '' 
cried the captain , `` impossible ! 
I loaded both pistols . 
Perhaps the bullet has rolled out of yours ... That is not my fault ! 
And you have no right to load again ... No right at all . 
It is altogether against the rules , I shall not allow it '' ... `` Very well ! '' 
I said to the captain . 
`` If so , then you and I shall fight on the same terms '' ... He came to a dead stop . 
Grushnitski stood with his head sunk on his breast , embarrassed and gloomy . 
`` Let them be ! '' 
he said at length to the captain , who was going to pull my pistol out of the doctor 's hands . 
`` You know yourself that they are right . '' 
In vain the captain made various signs to him . 
Grushnitski would not even look . 
Meanwhile the doctor had loaded the pistol and handed it to me . 
On seeing that , the captain spat and stamped his foot . 
`` You are a fool , then , my friend , '' he said : `` a common fool ! 
... You trusted to me before , so you should obey me in everything now ... But serve you right ! 
Die like a fly ! '' 
... He turned away , muttering as he went : `` But all the same it is absolutely against the rules . '' 
`` Grushnitski ! '' 
I said . 
`` There is still time : recant your slander , and I will forgive you everything . 
You have not succeeded in making a fool of me ; my self-esteem is satisfied . 
Remember -- we were once friends '' ... His face flamed , his eyes flashed . 
`` Fire ! '' 
he answered . 
`` I despise myself and I hate you . 
If you do not kill me I will lie in wait for you some night and cut your throat . 
There is not room on the earth for both of us '' ... I fired . 
When the smoke had cleared away , Grushnitski was not to be seen on the ledge . 
Only a slender column of dust was still eddying at the edge of the precipice . 
There was a simultaneous cry from the rest . 
`` Finita la commedia ! '' 
I said to the doctor . 
He made no answer , and turned away with horror . 
I shrugged my shoulders and bowed to Grushnitski 's seconds . 
AS I descended by the path , I observed Grushnitski 's bloodstained corpse between the clefts of the rocks . 
Involuntarily , I closed my eyes . 
Untying my horse , I set off home at a walking pace . 
A stone lay upon my heart . 
To my eyes the sun seemed dim , its beams were powerless to warm me . 
I did not ride up to the village , but turned to the right , along the gorge . 
The sight of a man would have been painful to me : I wanted to be alone . 
Throwing down the bridle and letting my head fall on my breast , I rode for a long time , and at length found myself in a spot with which I was wholly unfamiliar . 
I turned my horse back and began to search for the road . 
The sun had already set by the time I had ridden up to Kislovodsk -- myself and my horse both utterly spent ! 
My servant told me that Werner had called , and he handed me two notes : one from Werner , the other ... from Vera . 
I opened the first ; its contents were as follows : `` Everything has been arranged as well as could be ; the mutilated body has been brought in ; and the bullet extracted from the breast . 
Everybody is convinced that the cause of death was an unfortunate accident ; only the Commandant , who was doubtless aware of your quarrel , shook his head , but he said nothing . 
There are no proofs at all against you , and you may sleep in peace ... if you can ... . 
Farewell ! '' 
... For a long time I could not make up my mind to open the second note ... What could it be that she was writing to me ? 
... My soul was agitated by a painful foreboding . 
Here it is , that letter , each word of which is indelibly engraved upon my memory : `` I am writing to you in the full assurance that we shall never see each other again . 
A few years ago on parting with you I thought the same . 
However , it has been Heaven 's will to try me a second time : I have not been able to endure the trial , my frail heart has again submitted to the well-known voice ... You will not despise me for that -- will you ? 
This letter will be at once a farewell and a confession : I am obliged to tell you everything that has been treasured up in my heart since it began to love you . 
I will not accuse you -- you have acted towards me as any other man would have acted ; you have loved me as a chattel , as a source of joys , disquietudes and griefs , interchanging one with the other , without which life would be dull and monotonous . 
I have understood all that from the first ... But you were unhappy , and I have sacrificed myself , hoping that , some time , you would appreciate my sacrifice , that some time you would understand my deep tenderness , unfettered by any conditions . 
A long time has elapsed since then : I have fathomed all the secrets of your soul ... and I have convinced myself that my hope was vain . 
It has been a bitter blow to me ! 
But my love has been grafted with my soul ; it has grown dark , but has not been extinguished . 
`` We are parting for ever ; yet you may be sure that I shall never love another . 
Upon you my soul has exhausted all its treasures , its tears , its hopes . 
She who has once loved you can not look without a certain disdain upon other men , not because you have been better than they , oh , no ! 
but in your nature there is something peculiar -- belonging to you alone , something proud and mysterious ; in your voice , whatever the words spoken , there is an invincible power . 
No one can so constantly wish to be loved , in no one is wickedness ever so attractive , no one 's glance promises so much bliss , no one can better make use of his advantages , and no one can be so truly unhappy as you , because no one endeavours so earnestly to convince himself of the contrary . 
`` Now I must explain the cause of my hurried departure ; it will seem of little importance to you , because it concerns me alone . 
`` This morning my husband came in and told me about your quarrel with Grushnitski . 
Evidently I changed countenance greatly , because he looked me in the face long and intently . 
I almost fainted at the thought that you had to fight a duel to-day , and that I was the cause of it ; it seemed to me that I should go mad ... But now , when I am able to reason , I am sure that you remain alive : it is impossible that you should die , and I not with you -- impossible ! 
My husband walked about the room for a long time . 
I do not know what he said to me , I do not remember what I answered ... Most likely I told him that I loved you ... I only remember that , at the end of our conversation , he insulted me with a dreadful word and left the room . 
I heard him ordering the carriage ... I have been sitting at the window three hours now , awaiting your return ... But you are alive , you can not have died ! 
... The carriage is almost ready ... Good-bye , good-bye ! 
... I have perished -- but what matter ? 
If I could be sure that you will always remember me -- I no longer say love -- no , only remember ... Good-bye , they are coming ! 
... I must hide this letter . 
`` You do not love Mary , do you ? 
You will not marry her ? 
Listen , you must offer me that sacrifice . 
I have lost everything in the world for you '' ... Like a madman I sprang on the steps , jumped on my Circassian horse which was being led about the courtyard , and set off at full gallop along the road to Pyatigorsk . 
Unsparingly I urged on the jaded horse , which , snorting and all in a foam , carried me swiftly along the rocky road . 
The sun had already disappeared behind a black cloud , which had been resting on the ridge of the western mountains ; the gorge grew dark and damp . 
The Podkumok , forcing its way over the rocks , roared with a hollow and monotonous sound . 
I galloped on , choking with impatience . 
The idea of not finding Vera in Pyatigorsk struck my heart like a hammer . 
For one minute , again to see her for one minute , to say farewell , to press her hand ... I prayed , cursed , wept , laughed ... No , nothing could express my anxiety , my despair ! 
... Now that it seemed possible that I might be about to lose her for ever , Vera became dearer to me than aught in the world -- dearer than life , honour , happiness ! 
God knows what strange , what mad plans swarmed in my head ... Meanwhile I still galloped , urging on my horse without pity . 
And , now , I began to notice that he was breathing more heavily ; he had already stumbled once or twice on level ground ... I was five versts from Essentuki -- a Cossack village where I could change horses . 
All would have been saved had my horse been able to hold out for another ten minutes . 
But suddenly , in lifting himself out of a little gulley where the road emerges from the mountains at a sharp turn , he fell to the ground . 
I jumped down promptly , I tried to lift him up , I tugged at his bridle -- in vain . 
A scarcely audible moan burst through his clenched teeth ; in a few moments he expired . 
I was left on the steppe , alone ; I had lost my last hope . 
I endeavoured to walk -- my legs sank under me ; exhausted by the anxieties of the day and by sleeplessness , I fell upon the wet grass and burst out crying like a child . 
For a long time I lay motionless and wept bitterly , without attempting to restrain my tears and sobs . 
I thought my breast would burst . 
All my firmness , all my coolness , disappeared like smoke ; my soul grew powerless , my reason silent , and , if anyone had seen me at that moment , he would have turned aside with contempt . 
When the night-dew and the mountain breeze had cooled my burning brow , and my thoughts had resumed their usual course , I realized that to pursue my perished happiness would be unavailing and unreasonable . 
What more did I want ? 
-- To see her ? 
-- Why ? 
Was not all over between us ? 
A single , bitter , farewell kiss would not have enriched my recollections , and , after it , parting would only have been more difficult for us . 
Still , I am pleased that I can weep . 
Perhaps , however , the cause of that was my shattered nerves , a night passed without sleep , two minutes opposite the muzzle of a pistol , and an empty stomach . 
It is all for the best . 
That new suffering created within me a fortunate diversion -- to speak in military style . 
To weep is healthy , and then , no doubt , if I had not ridden as I did and had not been obliged to walk fifteen versts on my way back , sleep would not have closed my eyes on that night either . 
I returned to Kislovodsk at five o'clock in the morning , threw myself on my bed , and slept the sleep of Napoleon after Waterloo . 
By the time I awoke it was dark outside . 
I sat by the open window , with my jacket unbuttoned -- and the mountain breeze cooled my breast , still troubled by the heavy sleep of weariness . 
In the distance beyond the river , through the tops of the thick lime trees which overshadowed it , lights were glancing in the fortress and the village . 
Close at hand all was calm . 
It was dark in Princess Ligovski 's house . 
The doctor entered ; his brows were knit ; contrary to custom , he did not offer me his hand . 
`` Where have you come from , doctor ? '' 
`` From Princess Ligovski 's ; her daughter is ill -- nervous exhaustion ... That is not the point , though . 
This is what I have come to tell you : the authorities are suspicious , and , although it is impossible to prove anything positively , I should , all the same , advise you to be cautious . 
Princess Ligovski told me to-day that she knew that you fought a duel on her daughter 's account . 
That little old man -- what 's his name ? 
-- has told her everything . 
He was a witness of your quarrel with Grushnitski in the restaurant . 
I have come to warn you . 
Good-bye . 
Maybe we shall not meet again : you will be banished somewhere . '' 
He stopped on the threshold ; he would gladly have pressed my hand ... and , had I shown the slightest desire to embrace him , he would have thrown himself upon my neck ; but I remained cold as a rock -- and he left the room . 
That is just like men ! 
They are all the same : they know beforehand all the bad points of an act , they help , they advise , they even encourage it , seeing the impossibility of any other expedient -- and then they wash their hands of the whole affair and turn away with indignation from him who has had the courage to take the whole burden of responsibility upon himself . 
They are all like that , even the best-natured , the wisest ... NEXT morning , having received orders from the supreme authority to betake myself to the N -- Fortress , I called upon Princess Ligovski to say good-bye . 
She was surprised when , in answer to her question , whether I had not anything of special importance to tell her , I said I had come to wish her good-bye , and so on . 
`` But I must have a very serious talk with you . '' 
I sat down in silence . 
It was clear that she did not know how to begin ; her face grew livid , she tapped the table with her plump fingers ; at length , in a broken voice , she said : `` Listen , Monsieur Pechorin , I think that you are a gentleman . '' 
I bowed . 
`` Nay , I am sure of it , '' she continued , `` although your behaviour is somewhat equivocal , but you may have reasons which I do not know ; and you must now confide them to me . 
You have protected my daughter from slander , you have fought a duel on her behalf -- consequently you have risked your life ... Do not answer . 
I know that you will not acknowledge it because Grushnitski has been killed '' -- she crossed herself . 
`` God forgive him -- and you too , I hope ... That does not concern me ... I dare not condemn you because my daughter , although innocently , has been the cause . 
She has told me everything ... everything , I think . 
You have declared your love for her ... She has admitted hers to you . '' 
-- Here Princess Ligovski sighed heavily . 
-- `` But she is ill , and I am certain that it is no simple illness ! 
Secret grief is killing her ; she will not confess , but I am convinced that you are the cause of it ... Listen : you think , perhaps , that I am looking for rank or immense wealth -- be undeceived , my daughter 's happiness is my sole desire . 
Your present position is unenviable , but it may be bettered : you have means ; my daughter loves you ; she has been brought up in such a way that she will make her husband a happy man . 
I am wealthy , she is my only child ... Tell me , what is keeping you back ? 
... You see , I ought not to be saying all this to you , but I rely upon your heart , upon your honour -- remember she is my only daughter ... my only one '' ... She burst into tears . 
`` Princess , '' I said , `` it is impossible for me to answer you ; allow me to speak to your daughter , alone '' ... `` Never ! '' 
she exclaimed , rising from her chair in violent agitation . 
`` As you wish , '' I answered , preparing to go away . 
She fell into thought , made a sign to me with her hand that I should wait a little , and left the room . 
Five minutes passed . 
My heart was beating violently , but my thoughts were tranquil , my head cool . 
However assiduously I sought in my breast for even a spark of love for the charming Mary , my efforts were of no avail ! 
Then the door opened , and she entered . 
Heavens ! 
How she had changed since I had last seen her -- and that but a short time ago ! 
When she reached the middle of the room , she staggered . 
I jumped up , gave her my arm , and led her to a chair . 
I stood facing her . 
We remained silent for a long time ; her large eyes , full of unutterable grief , seemed to be searching in mine for something resembling hope ; her wan lips vainly endeavoured to smile ; her tender hands , which were folded upon her knees , were so thin and transparent that I pitied her . 
`` Princess , '' I said , `` you know that I have been making fun of you ? 
... You must despise me . '' 
A sickly flush suffused her cheeks . 
`` Consequently , '' I continued , `` you can not love me '' ... She turned her head away , leaned her elbows on the table , covered her eyes with her hand , and it seemed to me that she was on the point of tears . 
`` Oh , God ! '' 
she said , almost inaudibly . 
The situation was growing intolerable . 
Another minute -- and I should have fallen at her feet . 
`` So you see , yourself , '' I said in as firm a voice as I could command , and with a forced smile , `` you see , yourself , that I can not marry you . 
Even if you wished it now , you would soon repent . 
My conversation with your mother has compelled me to explain myself to you so frankly and so brutally . 
I hope that she is under a delusion : it will be easy for you to undeceive her . 
You see , I am playing a most pitiful and ugly role in your eyes , and I even admit it -- that is the utmost I can do for your sake . 
However bad an opinion you may entertain of me , I submit to it ... You see that I am base in your sight , am I not ? 
... Is it not true that , even if you have loved me , you would despise me from this moment ? '' 
... She turned round to me . 
She was pale as marble , but her eyes were sparkling wondrously . 
`` I hate you '' ... she said . 
I thanked her , bowed respectfully , and left the room . 
An hour afterwards a postal express was bearing me rapidly from Kislovodsk . 
A few versts from Essentuki I recognized near the roadway the body of my spirited horse . 
The saddle had been taken off , no doubt by a passing Cossack , and , in its place , two ravens were sitting on the horse 's back . 
I sighed and turned away ... And now , here in this wearisome fortress , I often ask myself , as my thoughts wander back to the past : why did I not wish to tread that way , thrown open by destiny , where soft joys and ease of soul were awaiting me ? 
... No , I could never have become habituated to such a fate ! 
I am like a sailor born and bred on the deck of a pirate brig : his soul has grown accustomed to storms and battles ; but , once let him be cast upon the shore , and he chafes , he pines away , however invitingly the shady groves allure , however brightly shines the peaceful sun . 
The livelong day he paces the sandy shore , hearkens to the monotonous murmur of the onrushing waves , and gazes into the misty distance : lo ! 
yonder , upon the pale line dividing the blue deep from the grey clouds , is there not glancing the longed-for sail , at first like the wing of a seagull , but little by little severing itself from the foam of the billows and , with even course , drawing nigh to the desert harbour ?
