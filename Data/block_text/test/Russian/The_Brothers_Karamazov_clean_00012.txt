She ran out to Alyosha in the hall . 
`` Did you get my letter about the new miracle ? '' 
She spoke rapidly and nervously . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Did you show it to every one ? 
He restored the son to his mother ! '' 
`` He is dying to‐day , '' said Alyosha . 
`` I have heard , I know , oh , how I long to talk to you , to you or some one , about all this . 
No , to you , to you ! 
And how sorry I am I ca n't see him ! 
The whole town is in excitement , they are all suspense . 
But now -- do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now ? '' 
`` Ah , that 's lucky , '' cried Alyosha . 
`` Then I shall see her here . 
She told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to‐day . '' 
`` I know , I know all . 
I 've heard exactly what happened yesterday -- and the atrocious behavior of that -- creature . 
C'est tragique , and if I 'd been in her place I do n't know what I should have done . 
And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what do you think of him ? 
-- my goodness ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , I am forgetting , only fancy ; your brother is in there with her , not that dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday , but the other , Ivan Fyodorovitch , he is sitting with her talking ; they are having a serious conversation . 
If you could only imagine what 's passing between them now -- it 's awful , I tell you it 's lacerating , it 's like some incredible tale of horror . 
They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see . 
They both recognize it and revel in it . 
I 've been watching for you ! 
I 've been thirsting for you ! 
It 's too much for me , that 's the worst of it . 
I 'll tell you all about it presently , but now I must speak of something else , the most important thing -- I had quite forgotten what 's most important . 
Tell me , why has Lise been in hysterics ? 
As soon as she heard you were here , she began to be hysterical ! '' 
`` Maman , it 's you who are hysterical now , not I , '' Lise 's voice caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side . 
Her voice sounded as though she wanted to laugh , but was doing her utmost to control it . 
Alyosha at once noticed the crack , and no doubt Lise was peeping through it , but that he could not see . 
`` And no wonder , Lise , no wonder ... your caprices will make me hysterical too . 
But she is so ill , Alexey Fyodorovitch , she has been so ill all night , feverish and moaning ! 
I could hardly wait for the morning and for Herzenstube to come . 
He says that he can make nothing of it , that we must wait . 
Herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it . 
As soon as you approached the house , she screamed , fell into hysterics , and insisted on being wheeled back into this room here . '' 
`` Mamma , I did n't know he had come . 
It was n't on his account I wanted to be wheeled into this room . '' 
`` That 's not true , Lise , Yulia ran to tell you that Alexey Fyodorovitch was coming . 
She was on the look‐out for you . '' 
`` My darling mamma , it 's not at all clever of you . 
But if you want to make up for it and say something very clever , dear mamma , you 'd better tell our honored visitor , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that he has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened yesterday and although every one is laughing at him . '' 
`` Lise , you go too far . 
I declare I shall have to be severe . 
Who laughs at him ? 
I am so glad he has come , I need him , I ca n't do without him . 
Oh , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I am exceedingly unhappy ! '' 
`` But what 's the matter with you , mamma , darling ? '' 
`` Ah , your caprices , Lise , your fidgetiness , your illness , that awful night of fever , that awful everlasting Herzenstube , everlasting , everlasting , that 's the worst of it ! 
Everything , in fact , everything ... . 
Even that miracle , too ! 
Oh , how it has upset me , how it has shattered me , that miracle , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
And that tragedy in the drawing‐room , it 's more than I can bear , I warn you . 
I ca n't bear it . 
A comedy , perhaps , not a tragedy . 
Tell me , will Father Zossima live till to‐morrow , will he ? 
Oh , my God ! 
What is happening to me ? 
Every minute I close my eyes and see that it 's all nonsense , all nonsense . '' 
`` I should be very grateful , '' Alyosha interrupted suddenly , `` if you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with . 
I have hurt it , and it 's very painful . '' 
Alyosha unbound his bitten finger . 
The handkerchief was soaked with blood . 
Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her eyes . 
`` Good heavens , what a wound , how awful ! '' 
But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha 's finger through the crack , she flung the door wide open . 
`` Come , come here , '' she cried , imperiously . 
`` No nonsense now ! 
Good heavens , why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time ? 
He might have bled to death , mamma ! 
How did you do it ? 
Water , water ! 
You must wash it first of all , simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain , and keep it there , keep it there ... . 
Make haste , mamma , some water in a slop‐basin . 
But do make haste , '' she finished nervously . 
She was quite frightened at the sight of Alyosha 's wound . 
`` Should n't we send for Herzenstube ? '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
`` Mamma , you 'll be the death of me . 
Your Herzenstube will come and say that he can make nothing of it ! 
Water , water ! 
Mamma , for goodness ' sake go yourself and hurry Yulia , she is such a slowcoach and never can come quickly ! 
Make haste , mamma , or I shall die . '' 
`` Why , it 's nothing much , '' cried Alyosha , frightened at this alarm . 
Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it . 
`` Some lint , mamma , for mercy 's sake , bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds , what 's it called ? 
We 've got some . 
You know where the bottle is , mamma ; it 's in your bedroom in the right‐hand cupboard , there 's a big bottle of it there with the lint . '' 
`` I 'll bring everything in a minute , Lise , only do n't scream and do n't fuss . 
You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it . 
Where did you get such a dreadful wound , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Madame Hohlakov hastened away . 
This was all Lise was waiting for . 
`` First of all , answer the question , where did you get hurt like this ? '' 
she asked Alyosha , quickly . 
`` And then I 'll talk to you about something quite different . 
Well ? '' 
Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother 's absence was precious for her , Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible . 
Lise clasped her hands at his story . 
`` How can you , and in that dress too , associate with schoolboys ? '' 
she cried angrily , as though she had a right to control him . 
`` You are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that , a perfect boy ! 
But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it , for there 's some mystery in it . 
Now for the second thing , but first a question : does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things , but talking sensibly ? '' 
`` Of course not , and I do n't feel much pain now . '' 
`` That 's because your finger is in the water . 
It must be changed directly , for it will get warm in a minute . 
Yulia , bring some ice from the cellar and another basin of water . 
Now she is gone , I can speak ; will you give me the letter I sent you yesterday , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch -- be quick , for mamma will be back in a minute and I do n't want -- '' `` I have n't got the letter . '' 
`` That 's not true , you have . 
I knew you would say that . 
You 've got it in that pocket . 
I 've been regretting that joke all night . 
Give me back the letter at once , give it me . '' 
`` I 've left it at home . '' 
`` But you ca n't consider me as a child , a little girl , after that silly joke ! 
I beg your pardon for that silliness , but you must bring me the letter , if you really have n't got it -- bring it to‐day , you must , you must . '' 
`` To‐day I ca n't possibly , for I am going back to the monastery and I sha n't come and see you for the next two days -- three or four perhaps -- for Father Zossima -- '' `` Four days , what nonsense ! 
Listen . 
Did you laugh at me very much ? '' 
`` I did n't laugh at all . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Because I believed all you said . '' 
`` You are insulting me ! '' 
`` Not at all . 
As soon as I read it , I thought that all that would come to pass , for as soon as Father Zossima dies , I am to leave the monastery . 
Then I shall go back and finish my studies , and when you reach the legal age we will be married . 
I shall love you . 
Though I have n't had time to think about it , I believe I could n't find a better wife than you , and Father Zossima tells me I must marry . '' 
`` But I am a cripple , wheeled about in a chair , '' laughed Lise , flushing crimson . 
`` I 'll wheel you about myself , but I 'm sure you 'll get well by then . '' 
`` But you are mad , '' said Lise , nervously , `` to make all this nonsense out of a joke ! 
Here 's mamma , very à propos , perhaps . 
Mamma , how slow you always are , how can you be so long ! 
And here 's Yulia with the ice ! '' 
`` Oh , Lise , do n't scream , above all things do n't scream . 
That scream drives me ... How can I help it when you put the lint in another place ? 
I 've been hunting and hunting -- I do believe you did it on purpose . '' 
`` But I could n't tell that he would come with a bad finger , or else perhaps I might have done it on purpose . 
My darling mamma , you begin to say really witty things . '' 
`` Never mind my being witty , but I must say you show nice feeling for Alexey Fyodorovitch 's sufferings ! 
Oh , my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , what 's killing me is no one thing in particular , not Herzenstube , but everything together , that 's what is too much for me . '' 
`` That 's enough , mamma , enough about Herzenstube , '' Lise laughed gayly . 
`` Make haste with the lint and the lotion , mamma . 
That 's simply Goulard 's water , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I remember the name now , but it 's a splendid lotion . 
Would you believe it , mamma , on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street , and it was a boy bit his finger , is n't he a child , a child himself ? 
Is he fit to be married after that ? 
For only fancy , he wants to be married , mamma . 
Just think of him married , would n't it be funny , would n't it be awful ? '' 
And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle , looking slyly at Alyosha . 
`` But why married , Lise ? 
What makes you talk of such a thing ? 
It 's quite out of place -- and perhaps the boy was rabid . '' 
`` Why , mamma ! 
As though there were rabid boys ! '' 
`` Why not , Lise , as though I had said something stupid ! 
Your boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near him . 
How well she has bandaged it , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! 
I could n't have done it . 
Do you still feel the pain ? '' 
`` It 's nothing much now . '' 
`` You do n't feel afraid of water ? '' 
asked Lise . 
`` Come , that 's enough , Lise , perhaps I really was rather too quick talking of the boy being rabid , and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here , Alexey Fyodorovitch , she simply rushed at me , she 's dying to see you , dying ! '' 
`` Ach , mamma , go to them yourself . 
He ca n't go just now , he is in too much pain . '' 
`` Not at all , I can go quite well , '' said Alyosha . 
`` What ! 
You are going away ? 
Is that what you say ? '' 
`` Well , when I 've seen them , I 'll come back here and we can talk as much as you like . 
But I should like to see Katerina Ivanovna at once , for I am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as I can . '' 
`` Mamma , take him away quickly . 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , do n't trouble to come and see me afterwards , but go straight back to your monastery and a good riddance . 
I want to sleep , I did n't sleep all night . '' 
`` Ah , Lise , you are only making fun , but how I wish you would sleep ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
`` I do n't know what I 've done ... . 
I 'll stay another three minutes , five if you like , '' muttered Alyosha . 
`` Even five ! 
Do take him away quickly , mamma , he is a monster . '' 
`` Lise , you are crazy . 
Let us go , Alexey Fyodorovitch , she is too capricious to‐day . 
I am afraid to cross her . 
Oh , the trouble one has with nervous girls ! 
Perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you . 
How quickly you have made her sleepy , and how fortunate it is ! '' 
`` Ah , mamma , how sweetly you talk ! 
I must kiss you for it , mamma . '' 
`` And I kiss you too , Lise . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' Madame Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly , speaking in a rapid whisper . 
`` I do n't want to suggest anything , I do n't want to lift the veil , you will see for yourself what 's going on . 
It 's appalling . 
It 's the most fantastic farce . 
She loves your brother , Ivan , and she is doing her utmost to persuade herself she loves your brother , Dmitri . 
It 's appalling ! 
I 'll go in with you , and if they do n't turn me out , I 'll stay to the end . '' 
But in the drawing‐room the conversation was already over . 
Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited , though she looked resolute . 
At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered , Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave . 
His face was rather pale , and Alyosha looked at him anxiously . 
For this moment was to solve a doubt , a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha . 
During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna , and , what was more , that he meant `` to carry her off '' from Dmitri . 
Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous , though it worried him extremely . 
He loved both his brothers , and dreaded such rivalry between them . 
Meantime , Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival , and that it was a great assistance to him , Dmitri . 
In what way did it assist him ? 
To marry Grushenka ? 
But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible . 
Besides all this , Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri ; but he had only believed it till the evening before . 
He had fancied , too , that she was incapable of loving a man like Ivan , and that she did love Dmitri , and loved him just as he was , in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion . 
But during yesterday 's scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him . 
The word `` lacerating , '' which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered , almost made him start , because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had cried out `` Laceration , laceration , '' probably applying it to his dream . 
He had been dreaming all night of the previous day 's scene at Katerina Ivanovna 's . 
Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov 's blunt and persistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan , and only deceived herself through some sort of pose , from `` self‐laceration , '' and tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied duty of gratitude . 
`` Yes , '' he thought , `` perhaps the whole truth lies in those words . '' 
But in that case what was Ivan 's position ? 
Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna 's must dominate , and she could only dominate some one like Dmitri , and never a man like Ivan . 
For Dmitri might at last submit to her domination `` to his own happiness '' -LRB- which was what Alyosha would have desired -RRB- , but Ivan -- no , Ivan could not submit to her , and such submission would not give him happiness . 
Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan . 
And now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing‐room . 
Another idea , too , forced itself upon him : `` What if she loved neither of them -- neither Ivan nor Dmitri ? '' 
It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month . 
`` What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions ? '' 
he thought reproachfully , after such doubts and surmises . 
And yet it was impossible not to think about it . 
He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his brothers ' lives and that a great deal depended upon it . 
`` One reptile will devour the other , '' Ivan had pronounced the day before , speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri . 
So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as a reptile , and perhaps had long done so . 
Was it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna ? 
That phrase had , of course , escaped Ivan unawares yesterday , but that only made it more important . 
If he felt like that , what chance was there of peace ? 
Were there not , on the contrary , new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family ? 
And with which of them was Alyosha to sympathize ? 
And what was he to wish for each of them ? 
He loved them both , but what could he desire for each in the midst of these conflicting interests ? 
He might go quite astray in this maze , and Alyosha 's heart could not endure uncertainty , because his love was always of an active character . 
He was incapable of passive love . 
If he loved any one , he set to work at once to help him . 
And to do so he must know what he was aiming at ; he must know for certain what was best for each , and having ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both . 
But instead of a definite aim , he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides . 
`` It was lacerating , '' as was said just now . 
But what could he understand even in this `` laceration '' ? 
He did not understand the first word in this perplexing maze . 
Seeing Alyosha , Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan , who had already got up to go , `` A minute ! 
Stay another minute ! 
I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely . 
Do n't go away , '' she added , addressing Madame Hohlakov . 
She made Alyosha sit down beside her , and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite , by Ivan . 
`` You are all my friends here , all I have in the world , my dear friends , '' she began warmly , in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of suffering , and Alyosha 's heart warmed to her at once . 
`` You , Alexey Fyodorovitch , were witness yesterday of that abominable scene , and saw what I did . 
You did not see it , Ivan Fyodorovitch , he did . 
What he thought of me yesterday I do n't know . 
I only know one thing , that if it were repeated to‐day , this minute , I should express the same feelings again as yesterday -- the same feelings , the same words , the same actions . 
You remember my actions , Alexey Fyodorovitch ; you checked me in one of them '' ... -LRB- as she said that , she flushed and her eyes shone -RRB- . 
`` I must tell you that I ca n't get over it . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
I do n't even know whether I still love him . 
I feel pity for him , and that is a poor sign of love . 
If I loved him , if I still loved him , perhaps I should n't be sorry for him now , but should hate him . '' 
Her voice quivered , and tears glittered on her eyelashes . 
Alyosha shuddered inwardly . 
`` That girl is truthful and sincere , '' he thought , `` and she does not love Dmitri any more . '' 
`` That 's true , that 's true , '' cried Madame Hohlakov . 
`` Wait , dear . 
I have n't told you the chief , the final decision I came to during the night . 
I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one -- for me , but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it -- nothing . 
It will be so all my life . 
My dear , kind , ever‐faithful and generous adviser , the one friend I have in the world , Ivan Fyodorovitch , with his deep insight into the heart , approves and commends my decision . 
He knows it . '' 
`` Yes , I approve of it , '' Ivan assented , in a subdued but firm voice . 
`` But I should like Alyosha , too -LRB- Ah ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , forgive my calling you simply Alyosha -RRB- , I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch , too , to tell me before my two friends whether I am right . 
I feel instinctively that you , Alyosha , my dear brother -LRB- for you are a dear brother to me -RRB- , '' she said again ecstatically , taking his cold hand in her hot one , `` I foresee that your decision , your approval , will bring me peace , in spite of all my sufferings , for , after your words , I shall be calm and submit -- I feel that . '' 
`` I do n't know what you are asking me , '' said Alyosha , flushing . 
`` I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than my own ! 
... But I know nothing about such affairs , '' something impelled him to add hurriedly . 
`` In such affairs , Alexey Fyodorovitch , in such affairs , the chief thing is honor and duty and something higher -- I do n't know what -- but higher perhaps even than duty . 
I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart , and it compels me irresistibly . 
But it may all be put in two words . 
I 've already decided , even if he marries that -- creature , '' she began solemnly , `` whom I never , never can forgive , even then I will not abandon him . 
Henceforward I will never , never abandon him ! '' 
she cried , breaking into a sort of pale , hysterical ecstasy . 
`` Not that I would run after him continually , get in his way and worry him . 
Oh , no ! 
I will go away to another town -- where you like -- but I will watch over him all my life -- I will watch over him all my life unceasingly . 
When he becomes unhappy with that woman , and that is bound to happen quite soon , let him come to me and he will find a friend , a sister ... . 
Only a sister , of course , and so for ever ; but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister , who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him . 
I will gain my point . 
I will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me , without reserve , '' she cried , in a sort of frenzy . 
`` I will be a god to whom he can pray -- and that , at least , he owes me for his treachery and for what I suffered yesterday through him . 
And let him see that all my life I will be true to him and the promise I gave him , in spite of his being untrue and betraying me . 
I will -- I will become nothing but a means for his happiness , or -- how shall I say ? 
-- an instrument , a machine for his happiness , and that for my whole life , my whole life , and that he may see that all his life ! 
That 's my decision . 
Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me . '' 
She was breathless . 
She had perhaps intended to express her idea with more dignity , art and naturalness , but her speech was too hurried and crude . 
It was full of youthful impulsiveness , it betrayed that she was still smarting from yesterday 's insult , and that her pride craved satisfaction . 
She felt this herself . 
Her face suddenly darkened , an unpleasant look came into her eyes . 
Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy . 
His brother Ivan made it worse by adding : `` I 've only expressed my own view , '' he said . 
`` From any one else , this would have been affected and overstrained , but from you -- no . 
Any other woman would have been wrong , but you are right . 
I do n't know how to explain it , but I see that you are absolutely genuine and , therefore , you are right . '' 
`` But that 's only for the moment . 
And what does this moment stand for ? 
Nothing but yesterday 's insult . '' 
Madame Hohlakov obviously had not intended to interfere , but she could not refrain from this very just comment . 
`` Quite so , quite so , '' cried Ivan , with peculiar eagerness , obviously annoyed at being interrupted , `` in any one else this moment would be only due to yesterday 's impression and would be only a moment . 
But with Katerina Ivanovna 's character , that moment will last all her life . 
What for any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting burdensome , grim perhaps , but unflagging duty . 
And she will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled . 
Your life , Katerina Ivanovna , will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings , your own heroism , and your own suffering ; but in the end that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design . 
Yes , proud it certainly is , and desperate in any case , but a triumph for you . 
And the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else . '' 
This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention ; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with intention . 
`` Oh , dear , how mistaken it all is ! '' 
Madame Hohlakov cried again . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , you speak . 
I want dreadfully to know what you will say ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , and burst into tears . 
Alyosha got up from the sofa . 
`` It 's nothing , nothing ! '' 
she went on through her tears . 
`` I 'm upset , I did n't sleep last night . 
But by the side of two such friends as you and your brother I still feel strong -- for I know -- you two will never desert me . '' 
`` Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow -- perhaps to‐morrow -- and to leave you for a long time -- And , unluckily , it 's unavoidable , '' Ivan said suddenly . 
`` To‐morrow -- to Moscow ! '' 
her face was suddenly contorted ; `` but -- but , dear me , how fortunate ! '' 
she cried in a voice suddenly changed . 
In one instant there was no trace left of her tears . 
She underwent an instantaneous transformation , which amazed Alyosha . 
Instead of a poor , insulted girl , weeping in a sort of `` laceration , '' he saw a woman completely self possessed and even exceedingly pleased , as though something agreeable had just happened . 
`` Oh , not fortunate that I am losing you , of course not , '' she corrected herself suddenly , with a charming society smile . 
`` Such a friend as you are could not suppose that . 
I am only too unhappy at losing you . '' 
She rushed impulsively at Ivan , and seizing both his hands , pressed them warmly . 
`` But what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position . 
You can speak with complete openness to Agafya , but spare dear auntie . 
You will know how to do that . 
You ca n't think how wretched I was yesterday and this morning , wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter -- for one can never tell such things in a letter ... . 
Now it will be easy for me to write , for you will see them and explain everything . 
Oh , how glad I am ! 
But I am only glad of that , believe me . 
Of course , no one can take your place ... . 
I will run at once to write the letter , '' she finished suddenly , and took a step as though to go out of the room . 
`` And what about Alyosha and his opinion , which you were so desperately anxious to hear ? '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov . 
There was a sarcastic , angry note in her voice . 
`` I had not forgotten that , '' cried Katerina Ivanovna , coming to a sudden standstill , `` and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment ? '' 
she added , with warm and bitter reproachfulness . 
`` What I said , I repeat . 
I must have his opinion . 
More than that , I must have his decision ! 
As he says , so it shall be . 
You see how anxious I am for your words , Alexey Fyodorovitch ... . 
But what 's the matter ? '' 
`` I could n't have believed it . 
I ca n't understand it ! '' 
Alyosha cried suddenly in distress . 
`` What ? 
What ? '' 
`` He is going to Moscow , and you cry out that you are glad . 
You said that on purpose ! 
And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but sorry to be -- losing a friend . 
But that was acting , too -- you were playing a part -- as in a theater ! '' 
`` In a theater ? 
What ? 
What do you mean ? '' 
exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna , profoundly astonished , flushing crimson , and frowning . 
`` Though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him , you persist in telling him to his face that it 's fortunate he is going , '' said Alyosha breathlessly . 
He was standing at the table and did not sit down . 
`` What are you talking about ? 
I do n't understand . '' 
`` I do n't understand myself ... . 
I seemed to see in a flash ... I know I am not saying it properly , but I 'll say it all the same , '' Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice . 
`` What I see is that perhaps you do n't love Dmitri at all ... and never have , from the beginning ... . 
And Dmitri , too , has never loved you ... and only esteems you ... . 
I really do n't know how I dare to say all this , but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody here will tell the truth . '' 
`` What truth ? '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , and there was an hysterical ring in her voice . 
`` I 'll tell you , '' Alyosha went on with desperate haste , as though he were jumping from the top of a house . 
`` Call Dmitri ; I will fetch him -- and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan 's and join your hands . 
For you 're torturing Ivan , simply because you love him -- and torturing him , because you love Dmitri through ` self‐laceration ' -- with an unreal love -- because you 've persuaded yourself . '' 
Alyosha broke off and was silent . 
`` You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot -- that 's what you are ! '' 
Katerina Ivanovna snapped . 
Her face was white and her lips were moving with anger . 
Ivan suddenly laughed and got up . 
His hat was in his hand . 
`` You are mistaken , my good Alyosha , '' he said , with an expression Alyosha had never seen in his face before -- an expression of youthful sincerity and strong , irresistibly frank feeling . 
`` Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for me ! 
She has known all the time that I cared for her -- though I never said a word of my love to her -- she knew , but she did n't care for me . 
I have never been her friend either , not for one moment ; she is too proud to need my friendship . 
She kept me at her side as a means of revenge . 
She revenged with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting . 
For even that first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult -- that 's what her heart is like ! 
She has talked to me of nothing but her love for him . 
I am going now ; but , believe me , Katerina Ivanovna , you really love him . 
And the more he insults you , the more you love him -- that 's your ` laceration . ' 
You love him just as he is ; you love him for insulting you . 
If he reformed , you 'd give him up at once and cease to love him . 
But you need him so as to contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity . 
And it all comes from your pride . 
Oh , there 's a great deal of humiliation and self‐abasement about it , but it all comes from pride ... . 
I am too young and I 've loved you too much . 
I know that I ought not to say this , that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you , and it would be less offensive for you . 
But I am going far away , and shall never come back ... . 
It is for ever . 
I do n't want to sit beside a ` laceration . ' 
... But I do n't know how to speak now . 
I 've said everything ... . 
Good‐by , Katerina Ivanovna ; you ca n't be angry with me , for I am a hundred times more severely punished than you , if only by the fact that I shall never see you again . 
Good‐by ! 
I do n't want your hand . 
You have tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment . 
I shall forgive you later , but now I do n't want your hand . 
` Den Dank , Dame , begehr ich nicht , ' '' he added , with a forced smile , showing , however , that he could read Schiller , and read him till he knew him by heart -- which Alyosha would never have believed . 
He went out of the room without saying good‐by even to his hostess , Madame Hohlakov . 
Alyosha clasped his hands . 
`` Ivan ! '' 
he cried desperately after him . 
`` Come back , Ivan ! 
No , nothing will induce him to come back now ! '' 
he cried again , regretfully realizing it ; `` but it 's my fault , my fault . 
I began it ! 
Ivan spoke angrily , wrongly . 
Unjustly and angrily . 
He must come back here , come back , '' Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically . 
Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room . 
`` You have done no harm . 
You behaved beautifully , like an angel , '' Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha . 
`` I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going . '' 
Her face beamed with delight , to the great distress of Alyosha , but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned . 
She had two hundred‐rouble notes in her hand . 
`` I have a great favor to ask of you , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she began , addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice , as though nothing had happened . 
`` A week -- yes , I think it was a week ago -- Dmitri Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action -- a very ugly action . 
There is a low tavern here , and in it he met that discharged officer , that captain , whom your father used to employ in some business . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his temper with this captain , seized him by the beard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it , in that insulting fashion . 
And I am told that his son , a boy , quite a child , who is at the school here , saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for his father , appealing to every one to defend him , while every one laughed . 
You must forgive me , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I can not think without indignation of that disgraceful action of his ... one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his anger ... and in his passions ! 
I ca n't describe it even ... . 
I ca n't find my words . 
I 've made inquiries about his victim , and find he is quite a poor man . 
His name is Snegiryov . 
He did something wrong in the army and was discharged . 
I ca n't tell you what . 
And now he has sunk into terrible destitution , with his family -- an unhappy family of sick children , and , I believe , an insane wife . 
He has been living here a long time ; he used to work as a copying clerk , but now he is getting nothing . 
I thought if you ... that is I thought ... I do n't know . 
I am so confused . 
You see , I wanted to ask you , my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , to go to him , to find some excuse to go to them -- I mean to that captain -- oh , goodness , how badly I explain it ! 
-- and delicately , carefully , as only you know how to '' -LRB- Alyosha blushed -RRB- , `` manage to give him this assistance , these two hundred roubles . 
He will be sure to take it ... . 
I mean , persuade him to take it ... . 
Or , rather , what do I mean ? 
You see it 's not by way of compensation to prevent him from taking proceedings -LRB- for I believe he meant to -RRB- , but simply a token of sympathy , of a desire to assist him from me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's betrothed , not from himself ... . 
But you know ... . 
I would go myself , but you 'll know how to do it ever so much better . 
He lives in Lake Street , in the house of a woman called Kalmikov ... . 
For God 's sake , Alexey Fyodorovitch , do it for me , and now ... now I am rather ... tired . 
Good by ! '' 
She turned and disappeared behind the portière so quickly that Alyosha had not time to utter a word , though he wanted to speak . 
He longed to beg her pardon , to blame himself , to say something , for his heart was full and he could not bear to go out of the room without it . 
But Madame Hohlakov took him by the hand and drew him along with her . 
In the hall she stopped him again as before . 
`` She is proud , she is struggling with herself ; but kind , charming , generous , '' she exclaimed , in a half‐whisper . 
`` Oh , how I love her , especially sometimes , and how glad I am again of everything ! 
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , you did n't know , but I must tell you , that we all , all -- both her aunts , I and all of us , Lise , even -- have been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite Dmitri , who takes no notice of her and does not care for her , and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch -- such an excellent and cultivated young man , who loves her more than anything in the world . 
We are in a regular plot to bring it about , and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account . '' 
`` But she has been crying -- she has been wounded again , '' cried Alyosha . 
`` Never trust a woman 's tears , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
I am never for the women in such cases . 
I am always on the side of the men . '' 
`` Mamma , you are spoiling him , '' Lise 's little voice cried from behind the door . 
`` No , it was all my fault . 
I am horribly to blame , '' Alyosha repeated unconsoled , hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his indiscretion . 
`` Quite the contrary ; you behaved like an angel , like an angel . 
I am ready to say so a thousand times over . '' 
`` Mamma , how has he behaved like an angel ? '' 
Lise 's voice was heard again . 
`` I somehow fancied all at once , '' Alyosha went on as though he had not heard Lise , `` that she loved Ivan , and so I said that stupid thing ... . 
What will happen now ? '' 
`` To whom , to whom ? '' 
cried Lise . 
`` Mamma , you really want to be the death of me . 
I ask you and you do n't answer . '' 
At the moment the maid ran in . 
`` Katerina Ivanovna is ill ... . 
She is crying , struggling ... hysterics . '' 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
cried Lise , in a tone of real anxiety . 
`` Mamma , I shall be having hysterics , and not she ! '' 
`` Lise , for mercy 's sake , do n't scream , do n't persecute me . 
At your age one ca n't know everything that grown‐up people know .
