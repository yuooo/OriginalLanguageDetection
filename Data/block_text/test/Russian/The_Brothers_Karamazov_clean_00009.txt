I 'll show you a little wench there . 
I 've had my eye on her a long time . 
She 's still running about bare‐foot . 
Do n't be afraid of bare‐footed wenches -- do n't despise them -- they 're pearls ! '' 
And he kissed his hand with a smack . 
`` To my thinking , '' he revived at once , seeming to grow sober the instant he touched on his favorite topic . 
`` To my thinking ... Ah , you boys ! 
You children , little sucking‐pigs , to my thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life -- that 's been my rule ! 
Can you understand that ? 
How could you understand it ? 
You 've milk in your veins , not blood . 
You 're not out of your shells yet . 
My rule has been that you can always find something devilishly interesting in every woman that you would n't find in any other . 
Only , one must know how to find it , that 's the point ! 
That 's a talent ! 
To my mind there are no ugly women . 
The very fact that she is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you understand that ? 
Even in vieilles filles , even in them you may discover something that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them . 
Bare‐footed girls or unattractive ones , you must take by surprise . 
Did n't you know that ? 
You must astound them till they 're fascinated , upset , ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut . 
It 's a jolly good thing that there always are and will be masters and slaves in the world , so there always will be a little maid of‐all‐work and her master , and you know , that 's all that 's needed for happiness . 
Stay ... listen , Alyosha , I always used to surprise your mother , but in a different way . 
I paid no attention to her at all , but all at once , when the minute came , I 'd be all devotion to her , crawl on my knees , kiss her feet , and I always , always -- I remember it as though it were to‐day -- reduced her to that tinkling , quiet , nervous , queer little laugh . 
It was peculiar to her . 
I knew her attacks always used to begin like that . 
The next day she would begin shrieking hysterically , and this little laugh was not a sign of delight , though it made a very good counterfeit . 
That 's the great thing , to know how to take every one . 
Once Belyavsky -- he was a handsome fellow , and rich -- used to like to come here and hang about her -- suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence . 
And she -- such a mild sheep -- why , I thought she would have knocked me down for that blow . 
How she set on me ! 
` You 're beaten , beaten now , ' she said . 
` You 've taken a blow from him . 
You have been trying to sell me to him , ' she said ... ` And how dared he strike you in my presence ! 
Do n't dare come near me again , never , never ! 
Run at once , challenge him to a duel ! ' 
... I took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses . 
The holy Fathers prayed her back to reason . 
But I swear , by God , Alyosha , I never insulted the poor crazy girl ! 
Only once , perhaps , in the first year ; then she was very fond of praying . 
She used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out of her room then . 
I 'll knock that mysticism out of her , thought I ! 
` Here , ' said I , ` you see your holy image . 
Here it is . 
Here I take it down . 
You believe it 's miraculous , but here , I 'll spit on it directly and nothing will happen to me for it ! ' 
... When she saw it , good Lord ! 
I thought she would kill me . 
But she only jumped up , wrung her hands , then suddenly hid her face in them , began trembling all over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap . 
Alyosha , Alyosha , what 's the matter ? '' 
The old man jumped up in alarm . 
From the time he had begun speaking about his mother , a change had gradually come over Alyosha 's face . 
He flushed crimson , his eyes glowed , his lips quivered . 
The old sot had gone spluttering on , noticing nothing , till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha . 
Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha . 
He jumped up from his seat exactly as his mother was said to have done , wrung his hands , hid his face in them , and fell back in his chair , shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent , silent weeping . 
His extraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man . 
`` Ivan , Ivan ! 
Water , quickly ! 
It 's like her , exactly as she used to be then , his mother . 
Spurt some water on him from your mouth , that 's what I used to do to her . 
He 's upset about his mother , his mother , '' he muttered to Ivan . 
`` But she was my mother , too , I believe , his mother . 
Was she not ? '' 
said Ivan , with uncontrolled anger and contempt . 
The old man shrank before his flashing eyes . 
But something very strange had happened , though only for a second ; it seemed really to have escaped the old man 's mind that Alyosha 's mother actually was the mother of Ivan too . 
`` Your mother ? '' 
he muttered , not understanding . 
`` What do you mean ? 
What mother are you talking about ? 
Was she ? 
... Why , damn it ! 
of course she was yours too ! 
Damn it ! 
My mind has never been so darkened before . 
Excuse me , why , I was thinking , Ivan ... . 
He he he ! '' 
He stopped . 
A broad , drunken , half‐senseless grin overspread his face . 
At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall , there were violent shouts , the door was flung open , and Dmitri burst into the room . 
The old man rushed to Ivan in terror . 
`` He 'll kill me ! 
He 'll kill me ! 
Do n't let him get at me ! '' 
he screamed , clinging to the skirt of Ivan 's coat . 
Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri . 
They had been struggling with him in the passage , refusing to admit him , acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before . 
Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him , Grigory ran round the table , closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments , and stood before the closed doors , stretching wide his arms , prepared to defend the entrance , so to speak , with the last drop of his blood . 
Seeing this , Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory . 
`` Then she 's there ! 
She 's hidden there ! 
Out of the way , scoundrel ! '' 
He tried to pull Grigory away , but the old servant pushed him back . 
Beside himself with fury , Dmitri struck out , and hit Grigory with all his might . 
The old man fell like a log , and Dmitri , leaping over him , broke in the door . 
Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room , huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
`` She 's here ! '' 
shouted Dmitri . 
`` I saw her turn towards the house just now , but I could n't catch her . 
Where is she ? 
Where is she ? '' 
That shout , `` She 's here ! '' 
produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
All his terror left him . 
`` Hold him ! 
Hold him ! '' 
he cried , and dashed after Dmitri . 
Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor , but still seemed stunned . 
Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father . 
In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash : it was a large glass vase -- not an expensive one -- on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it . 
`` At him ! '' 
shouted the old man . 
`` Help ! '' 
Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back . 
`` Why do you run after him ? 
He 'll murder you outright , '' Ivan cried wrathfully at his father . 
`` Ivan ! 
Alyosha ! 
She must be here . 
Grushenka 's here . 
He said he saw her himself , running . '' 
He was choking . 
He was not expecting Grushenka at the time , and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself . 
He was trembling all over . 
He seemed frantic . 
`` But you 've seen for yourself that she has n't come , '' cried Ivan . 
`` But she may have come by that other entrance . '' 
`` You know that entrance is locked , and you have the key . '' 
Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing‐room . 
He had , of course , found the other entrance locked , and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's pocket . 
The windows of all the rooms were also closed , so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch , as soon as he saw him again . 
`` He 's been stealing money in my bedroom . '' 
And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri . 
But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples , tugged at them , and flung him with a crash on the floor . 
He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face . 
The old man moaned shrilly . 
Ivan , though not so strong as Dmitri , threw his arms round him , and with all his might pulled him away . 
Alyosha helped him with his slender strength , holding Dmitri in front . 
`` Madman ! 
You 've killed him ! '' 
cried Ivan . 
`` Serve him right ! '' 
shouted Dmitri breathlessly . 
`` If I have n't killed him , I 'll come again and kill him . 
You ca n't protect him ! '' 
`` Dmitri ! 
Go away at once ! '' 
cried Alyosha commandingly . 
`` Alexey ! 
You tell me . 
It 's only you I can believe ; was she here just now , or not ? 
I saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane . 
I shouted , she ran away . '' 
`` I swear she 's not been here , and no one expected her . '' 
`` But I saw her ... . 
So she must ... I 'll find out at once where she is ... . 
Good‐by , Alexey ! 
Not a word to Æsop about the money now . 
But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say , ` He sends his compliments to you ! ' 
Compliments , his compliments ! 
Just compliments and farewell ! 
Describe the scene to her . '' 
Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him in an arm‐chair . 
His face was covered with blood , but he was conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri 's cries . 
He was still fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house . 
Dmitri looked at him with hatred as he went out . 
`` I do n't repent shedding your blood ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Beware , old man , beware of your dream , for I have my dream , too . 
I curse you , and disown you altogether . '' 
He ran out of the room . 
`` She 's here . 
She must be here . 
Smerdyakov ! 
Smerdyakov ! '' 
the old man wheezed , scarcely audibly , beckoning to him with his finger . 
`` No , she 's not here , you old lunatic ! '' 
Ivan shouted at him angrily . 
`` Here , he 's fainting ! 
Water ! 
A towel ! 
Make haste , Smerdyakov ! '' 
Smerdyakov ran for water . 
At last they got the old man undressed , and put him to bed . 
They wrapped a wet towel round his head . 
Exhausted by the brandy , by his violent emotion , and the blows he had received , he shut his eyes and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow . 
Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing‐room . 
Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase , while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor . 
`` Should n't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed , too ? '' 
Alyosha said to him . 
`` We 'll look after him . 
My brother gave you a terrible blow -- on the head . '' 
`` He 's insulted me ! '' 
Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly . 
`` He 's ` insulted ' his father , not only you , '' observed Ivan with a forced smile . 
`` I used to wash him in his tub . 
He 's insulted me , '' repeated Grigory . 
`` Damn it all , if I had n't pulled him away perhaps he 'd have murdered him . 
It would n't take much to do for Æsop , would it ? '' 
whispered Ivan to Alyosha . 
`` God forbid ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Why should He forbid ? '' 
Ivan went on in the same whisper , with a malignant grimace . 
`` One reptile will devour the other . 
And serve them both right , too . '' 
Alyosha shuddered . 
`` Of course I wo n't let him be murdered as I did n't just now . 
Stay here , Alyosha , I 'll go for a turn in the yard . 
My head 's begun to ache . '' 
Alyosha went to his father 's bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour . 
The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha , evidently remembering and meditating . 
All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement . 
`` Alyosha , '' he whispered apprehensively , `` where 's Ivan ? '' 
`` In the yard . 
He 's got a headache . 
He 's on the watch . '' 
`` Give me that looking‐glass . 
It stands over there . 
Give it me . '' 
Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking‐glass which stood on the chest of drawers . 
The old man looked at himself in it ; his nose was considerably swollen , and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise . 
`` What does Ivan say ? 
Alyosha , my dear , my only son , I 'm afraid of Ivan . 
I 'm more afraid of Ivan than the other . 
You 're the only one I 'm not afraid of ... '' `` Do n't be afraid of Ivan either . 
He is angry , but he 'll defend you . '' 
`` Alyosha , and what of the other ? 
He 's run to Grushenka . 
My angel , tell me the truth , was she here just now or not ? '' 
`` No one has seen her . 
It was a mistake . 
She has not been here . '' 
`` You know Mitya wants to marry her , to marry her . '' 
`` She wo n't marry him . '' 
`` She wo n't . 
She wo n't . 
She wo n't . 
She wo n't on any account ! '' 
The old man fairly fluttered with joy , as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him . 
In his delight he seized Alyosha 's hand and pressed it warmly to his heart . 
Tears positively glittered in his eyes . 
`` That image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now , '' he said . 
`` Take it home and keep it for yourself . 
And I 'll let you go back to the monastery ... . 
I was joking this morning , do n't be angry with me . 
My head aches , Alyosha ... . 
Alyosha , comfort my heart . 
Be an angel and tell me the truth ! '' 
`` You 're still asking whether she has been here or not ? '' 
Alyosha said sorrowfully . 
`` No , no , no . 
I believe you . 
I 'll tell you what it is : you go to Grushenka yourself , or see her somehow ; make haste and ask her ; see for yourself , which she means to choose , him or me . 
Eh ? 
What ? 
Can you ? '' 
`` If I see her I 'll ask her , '' Alyosha muttered , embarrassed . 
`` No , she wo n't tell you , '' the old man interrupted , `` she 's a rogue . 
She 'll begin kissing you and say that it 's you she wants . 
She 's a deceitful , shameless hussy . 
You must n't go to her , you must n't ! '' 
`` No , father , and it would n't be suitable , it would n't be right at all . '' 
`` Where was he sending you just now ? 
He shouted ` Go ' as he ran away . '' 
`` To Katerina Ivanovna . '' 
`` For money ? 
To ask her for money ? '' 
`` No . 
Not for money . '' 
`` He 's no money ; not a farthing . 
I 'll settle down for the night , and think things over , and you can go . 
Perhaps you 'll meet her ... . 
Only be sure to come to me to‐morrow in the morning . 
Be sure to . 
I have a word to say to you to‐morrow . 
Will you come ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` When you come , pretend you 've come of your own accord to ask after me . 
Do n't tell any one I told you to . 
Do n't say a word to Ivan . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
`` Good‐by , my angel . 
You stood up for me , just now . 
I shall never forget it . 
I 've a word to say to you to‐morrow -- but I must think about it . '' 
`` And how do you feel now ? '' 
`` I shall get up to‐morrow and go out , perfectly well , perfectly well ! '' 
Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway . 
He was sitting writing something in pencil in his note‐book . 
Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up , was conscious , and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery . 
`` Alyosha , I should be very glad to meet you to‐morrow morning , '' said Ivan cordially , standing up . 
His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha . 
`` I shall be at the Hohlakovs ' to‐morrow , '' answered Alyosha , `` I may be at Katerina Ivanovna 's , too , if I do n't find her now . '' 
`` But you 're going to her now , anyway ? 
For that ` compliments and farewell , ' '' said Ivan smiling . 
Alyosha was disconcerted . 
`` I think I quite understand his exclamations just now , and part of what went before . 
Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he -- well , in fact -- takes his leave of her ? '' 
`` Brother , how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` One ca n't tell for certain . 
Perhaps in nothing : it may all fizzle out . 
That woman is a beast . 
In any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house . '' 
`` Brother , let me ask one thing more : has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live ? '' 
`` Why bring in the question of worth ? 
The matter is most often decided in men 's hearts on other grounds much more natural . 
And as for rights -- who has not the right to wish ? '' 
`` Not for another man 's death ? '' 
`` What even if for another man 's death ? 
Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps can not help living so . 
Are you referring to what I said just now -- that one reptile will devour the other ? 
In that case let me ask you , do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Æsop 's blood , murdering him , eh ? '' 
`` What are you saying , Ivan ? 
Such an idea never crossed my mind . 
I do n't think Dmitri is capable of it , either . '' 
`` Thanks , if only for that , '' smiled Ivan . 
`` Be sure , I should always defend him . 
But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case . 
Good‐by till to‐morrow . 
Do n't condemn me , and do n't look on me as a villain , '' he added with a smile . 
They shook hands warmly as they had never done before . 
Alyosha felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him , and that he had certainly done this with some definite motive . 
Alyosha left his father 's house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it . 
His mind too seemed shattered and unhinged , while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day . 
He felt something bordering upon despair , which he had never known till then . 
Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal , insoluble question : How would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman ? 
Now he had himself been a witness of it , he had been present and seen them face to face . 
Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy , terribly , completely unhappy : there was trouble awaiting him . 
It appeared too that there were other people concerned , far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before . 
There was something positively mysterious in it , too . 
Ivan had made a step towards him , which was what Alyosha had been long desiring . 
Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it . 
And these women ? 
Strange to say , that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna 's in the greatest embarrassment ; now he felt nothing of the kind . 
On the contrary , he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her . 
Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than before . 
The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably , and Dmitri , feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope , might sink to any depth . 
He had , moreover , told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father . 
It was by now seven o'clock , and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by Katerina Ivanovna . 
Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts . 
One of them , a woman of little education , was that aunt of her half‐sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her in her father 's house when she came from boarding‐school . 
The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence , though in straitened circumstances . 
It was said that they both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna , and that she only kept them with her as chaperons . 
Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one but her benefactress , the general 's widow , who had been kept by illness in Moscow , and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account of all her doings . 
When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to him to take his name up , it was evident that they were already aware of his arrival . 
Possibly he had been noticed from the window . 
At least , Alyosha heard a noise , caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling skirts . 
Two or three women , perhaps , had run out of the room . 
Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement . 
He was conducted however to the drawing‐room at once . 
It was a large room , elegantly and amply furnished , not at all in provincial style . 
There were many sofas , lounges , settees , big and little tables . 
There were pictures on the walls , vases and lamps on the tables , masses of flowers , and even an aquarium in the window . 
It was twilight and rather dark . 
Alyosha made out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa , where people had evidently just been sitting ; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate , cakes , a glass saucer with blue raisins , and another with sweetmeats . 
Alyosha saw that he had interrupted visitors , and frowned . 
But at that instant the portière was raised , and with rapid , hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in , holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight . 
At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table . 
`` Thank God ! 
At last you have come too ! 
I 've been simply praying for you all day ! 
Sit down . '' 
Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna 's beauty when , three weeks before , Dmitri had first brought him , at Katerina Ivanovna 's special request , to be introduced to her . 
There had been no conversation between them at that interview , however . 
Supposing Alyosha to be very shy , Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him . 
Alyosha had been silent , but he had seen a great deal very clearly . 
He was struck by the imperiousness , proud ease , and self‐confidence of the haughty girl . 
And all that was certain , Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it . 
He thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine , especially with her pale , even rather sallow , longish face . 
But in those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might well be passionately in love , but which perhaps could not be loved for long . 
He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when , after the visit , his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed . 
`` You 'll be happy with her , but perhaps -- not tranquilly happy . '' 
`` Quite so , brother . 
Such people remain always the same . 
They do n't yield to fate . 
So you think I sha n't love her for ever . '' 
`` No ; perhaps you will love her for ever . 
But perhaps you wo n't always be happy with her . '' 
Alyosha had given his opinion at the time , blushing , and angry with himself for having yielded to his brother 's entreaties and put such `` foolish '' ideas into words . 
For his opinion had struck him as awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it . 
He felt ashamed too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman . 
It was with the more amazement that he felt now , at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him , that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken . 
This time her face was beaming with spontaneous good‐natured kindliness , and direct warm‐hearted sincerity . 
The `` pride and haughtiness , '' which had struck Alyosha so much before , was only betrayed now in a frank , generous energy and a sort of bright , strong faith in herself . 
Alyosha realized at the first glance , at the first word , that all the tragedy of her position in relation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her ; that she perhaps already knew everything , positively everything . 
And yet , in spite of that , there was such brightness in her face , such faith in the future . 
Alyosha felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts . 
He was conquered and captivated immediately . 
Besides all this , he noticed at her first words that she was in great excitement , an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy . 
`` I was so eager to see you , because I can learn from you the whole truth -- from you and no one else . '' 
`` I have come , '' muttered Alyosha confusedly , `` I -- he sent me . '' 
`` Ah , he sent you ! 
I foresaw that . 
Now I know everything -- everything ! '' 
cried Katerina Ivanovna , her eyes flashing . 
`` Wait a moment , Alexey Fyodorovitch , I 'll tell you why I 've been so longing to see you . 
You see , I know perhaps far more than you do yourself , and there 's no need for you to tell me anything . 
I 'll tell you what I want from you . 
I want to know your own last impression of him . 
I want you to tell me most directly , plainly , coarsely even -LRB- oh , as coarsely as you like ! -RRB- 
, what you thought of him just now and of his position after your meeting with him to‐day . 
That will perhaps be better than if I had a personal explanation with him , as he does not want to come to me . 
Do you understand what I want from you ? 
Now , tell me simply , tell me every word of the message he sent you with -LRB- I knew he would send you -RRB- . '' 
`` He told me to give you his compliments -- and to say that he would never come again -- but to give you his compliments . '' 
`` His compliments ? 
Was that what he said -- his own expression ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word , perhaps he did not use the right word ? '' 
`` No ; he told me precisely to repeat that word . 
He begged me two or three times not to forget to say so . '' 
Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly . 
`` Help me now , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
Now I really need your help . 
I 'll tell you what I think , and you must simply say whether it 's right or not . 
Listen ! 
If he had sent me his compliments in passing , without insisting on your repeating the words , without emphasizing them , that would be the end of everything ! 
But if he particularly insisted on those words , if he particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me , then perhaps he was in excitement , beside himself . 
He had made his decision and was frightened at it . 
He was n't walking away from me with a resolute step , but leaping headlong . 
The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply bravado . '' 
`` Yes , yes ! '' 
cried Alyosha warmly . 
`` I believe that is it . '' 
`` And , if so , he 's not altogether lost . 
I can still save him . 
Stay ! 
Did he not tell you anything about money -- about three thousand roubles ? '' 
`` He did speak about it , and it 's that more than anything that 's crushing him . 
He said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now , '' Alyosha answered warmly , feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother . 
`` But do you know about the money ? '' 
he added , and suddenly broke off . 
`` I 've known of it a long time ; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire , and heard long ago that the money had not arrived . 
He had n't sent the money , but I said nothing . 
Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money . 
My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn , and who was his true friend . 
No , he wo n't recognize that I am his truest friend ; he wo n't know me , and looks on me merely as a woman . 
I 've been tormented all the week , trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand . 
Let him feel ashamed of himself , let him be ashamed of other people 's knowing , but not of my knowing . 
He can tell God everything without shame . 
Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake ? 
Why , why does n't he know me ? 
How dare he not know me after all that has happened ? 
I want to save him for ever . 
Let him forget me as his betrothed . 
And here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes . 
Why , he was n't afraid to be open with you , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
How is it that I do n't deserve the same ? '' 
The last words she uttered in tears . 
Tears gushed from her eyes . 
`` I must tell you , '' Alyosha began , his voice trembling too , `` what happened just now between him and my father . '' 
And he described the whole scene , how Dmitri had sent him to get the money , how he had broken in , knocked his father down , and after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and farewell . 
`` He went to that woman , '' Alyosha added softly . 
`` And do you suppose that I ca n't put up with that woman ? 
Does he think I ca n't ? 
But he wo n't marry her , '' she suddenly laughed nervously . 
`` Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov ? 
It 's passion , not love . 
He wo n't marry her because she wo n't marry him . '' 
Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely . 
`` He may marry her , '' said Alyosha mournfully , looking down . 
`` He wo n't marry her , I tell you . 
That girl is an angel . 
Do you know that ? 
Do you know that ? '' 
Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary warmth . 
`` She is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures . 
I know how bewitching she is , but I know too that she is kind , firm and noble . 
Why do you look at me like that , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? 
Perhaps you are wondering at my words , perhaps you do n't believe me ? 
Agrafena Alexandrovna , my angel ! '' 
she cried suddenly to some one , peeping into the next room , `` come in to us . 
This is a friend . 
This is Alyosha . 
He knows all about our affairs . 
Show yourself to him . '' 
`` I 've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me , '' said a soft , one might even say sugary , feminine voice . 
The portière was raised and Grushenka herself , smiling and beaming , came up to the table . 
A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha . 
He fixed his eyes on her and could not take them off . 
Here she was , that awful woman , the `` beast , '' as Ivan had called her half an hour before . 
And yet one would have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary , a good‐natured , kind woman , handsome certainly , but so like other handsome ordinary women ! 
It is true she was very , very good‐looking with that Russian beauty so passionately loved by many men . 
She was a rather tall woman , though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna , who was exceptionally tall . 
She had a full figure , with soft , as it were , noiseless , movements , softened to a peculiar over‐sweetness , like her voice . 
She moved , not like Katerina Ivanovna , with a vigorous , bold step , but noiselessly . 
Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor . 
She sank softly into a low chair , softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress , and delicately nestling her milk‐white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl . 
She was twenty‐two years old , and her face looked exactly that age . 
She was very white in the face , with a pale pink tint on her cheeks . 
The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad , and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward . 
Her upper lip was thin , but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full , and looked pouting . 
But her magnificent , abundant dark brown hair , her sable‐colored eyebrows and charming gray‐blue eyes with their long lashes would have made the most indifferent person , meeting her casually in a crowd in the street , stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after . 
What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature . 
There was a childlike look in her eyes , a look of childish delight .
