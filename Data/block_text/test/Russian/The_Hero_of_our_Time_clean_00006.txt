... Her mother pays no attention , because he is not a man who is in a position to marry . 
Behold the logic of mothers ! 
I have caught two or three tender glances -- this must be put a stop to . 
Yesterday , for the first time , Vera made her appearance at the well ... She has never gone out of doors since we met in the grotto . 
We let down our tumblers at the same time , and as she bent forward she whispered to me : `` You are not going to make the Ligovskis ' acquaintance ? 
... It is only there that we can meet '' ... A reproach ! 
... How tiresome ! 
But I have deserved it ... By the way , there is a subscription ball tomorrow in the saloon of the restaurant , and I will dance the mazurka with Princess Mary . 
THE saloon of the restaurant was converted into the assembly room of a Nobles ' Club . 
The company met at nine o'clock . 
Princess Ligovski and her daughter were amongst the latest to make their appearance . 
Several of the ladies looked at Princess Mary with envy and malevolence , because she dresses with taste . 
Those who look upon themselves as the aristocracy of the place concealed their envy and attached themselves to her train . 
What else could be expected ? 
Wherever there is a gathering of women , the company is immediately divided into a higher and a lower circle . 
Beneath the window , amongst a crowd of people , stood Grushnitski , pressing his face to the pane and never taking his eyes off his divinity . 
As she passed by , she gave him a hardly perceptible nod . 
He beamed like the sun ... The first dance was a polonaise , after which the musicians struck up a waltz . 
Spurs began to jingle , and skirts to rise and whirl . 
I was standing behind a certain stout lady who was overshadowed by rose-coloured feathers . 
The magnificence of her dress reminded me of the times of the farthingale , and the motley hue of her by no means smooth skin , of the happy epoch of the black taffeta patch . 
An immense wart on her neck was covered by a clasp . 
She was saying to her cavalier , a captain of dragoons : `` That young Princess Ligovski is a most intolerable creature ! 
Just fancy , she jostled against me and did not apologise , but even turned round and stared at me through her lorgnette ! 
... C'est impayable ! 
... And what has she to be proud of ? 
It is time somebody gave her a lesson '' ... `` That will be easy enough , '' replied the obliging captain , and he directed his steps to the other room . 
I went up to Princess Mary immediately , and , availing myself of the local customs which allowed one to dance with a stranger , I invited her to waltz with me . 
She was scarcely able to keep from smiling and letting her triumph be seen ; but quickly enough she succeeded in assuming an air of perfect indifference and even severity . 
Carelessly she let her hand fall upon my shoulder , inclined her head slightly to one side , and we began to dance . 
I have never known a waist more voluptuous and supple ! 
Her fresh breath touched my face ; at times a lock of hair , becoming separated from its companions in the eddy of the waltz , glided over my burning cheek ... I made three turns of the ballroom -LRB- she waltzes surprisingly well -RRB- . 
She was out of breath , her eyes were dulled , her half-open lips were scarcely able to whisper the indispensable : `` merci , monsieur . '' 
After a few moments ' silence I said to her , assuming a very humble air : `` I have heard , Princess , that although quite unacquainted with you , I have already had the misfortune to incur your displeasure ... that you have considered me insolent . 
Can that possibly true ? '' 
`` Would you like to confirm me in that opinion now ? '' 
she answered , with an ironical little grimace -- very becoming , however , to her mobile countenance . 
`` If I had the audacity to insult you in any way , then allow me to have the still greater audacity to beg your pardon ... And , indeed , I should very much like to prove to you that you are mistaken in regard to me '' ... `` You will find that a rather difficult task '' ... `` But why ? '' 
... `` Because you never visit us and , most likely , there will not be many more of these balls . '' 
`` That means , '' I thought , `` that their doors are closed to me for ever . '' 
`` You know , Princess , '' I said to her , with a certain amount of vexation , `` one should never spurn a penitent criminal : in his despair he may become twice as much a criminal as before ... and then '' ... Sudden laughter and whispering from the people around us caused me to turn my head and to interrupt my phrase . 
A few paces away from me stood a group of men , amongst them the captain of dragoons , who had manifested intentions hostile to the charming Princess . 
He was particularly well pleased with something or other , and was rubbing his hands , laughing and exchanging meaning glances with his companions . 
All at once a gentleman in an evening-dress coat and with long moustaches and a red face separated himself from the crowd and directed his uncertain steps straight towards Princess Mary . 
He was drunk . 
Coming to a halt opposite the embarrassed Princess and placing his hands behind his back , he fixed his dull grey eyes upon her , and said in a hoarse treble : `` Permettez ... but what is the good of that sort of thing here ... All I need say is : I engage you for the mazurka '' ... `` Very well ! '' 
she replied in a trembling voice , throwing a beseeching glance around . 
Alas ! 
Her mother was a long way off , and not one of the cavaliers of her acquaintance was near . 
A certain aide-de-camp apparently saw the whole scene , but he concealed himself behind the crowd in order not to be mixed up in the affair . 
`` What ? '' 
said the drunken gentleman , winking to the captain of dragoons , who was encouraging him by signs . 
`` Do you not wish to dance then ? 
... All the same I again have the honour to engage you for the mazurka ... You think , perhaps , that I am drunk ! 
That is all right ! 
... I can dance all the easier , I assure you '' ... I saw that she was on the point of fainting with fright and indignation . 
I went up to the drunken gentleman , caught him none too gently by the arm , and , looking him fixedly in the face , requested him to retire . 
`` Because , '' I added , `` the Princess promised long ago to dance the mazurka with me . '' 
`` Well , then , there 's nothing to be done ! 
Another time ! '' 
he said , bursting out laughing , and he retired to his abashed companions , who immediately conducted him into another room . 
I was rewarded by a deep , wondrous glance . 
The Princess went up to her mother and told her the whole story . 
The latter sought me out among the crowd and thanked me . 
She informed me that she knew my mother and was on terms of friendship with half a dozen of my aunts . 
`` I do not know how it has happened that we have not made your acquaintance up to now , '' she added ; `` but confess , you alone are to blame for that . 
You fight shy of everyone in a positively unseemly way . 
I hope the air of my drawingroom will dispel your spleen ... Do you not think so ? '' 
I uttered one of the phrases which everybody must have ready for such an occasion . 
The quadrilles dragged on a dreadfully long time . 
At last the music struck up from the gallery , Princess Mary and I took up our places . 
I did not once allude to the drunken gentleman , or to my previous behaviour , or to Grushnitski . 
The impression produced upon her by the unpleasant scene was gradually dispelled ; her face brightened up ; she jested very charmingly ; her conversation was witty , without pretensions to wit , vivacious and spontaneous ; her observations were sometimes profound ... In a very involved sentence I gave her to understand that I had liked her for a long time . 
She bent her head and blushed slightly . 
`` You are a strange man ! '' 
she said , with a forced laugh , lifting her velvet eyes upon me . 
`` I did not wish to make your acquaintance , '' I continued , `` because you are surrounded by too dense a throng of adorers , in which I was afraid of being lost to sight altogether . '' 
`` You need not have been afraid ; they are all very tiresome '' ... `` All ? 
Not all , surely ? '' 
She looked fixedly at me as if endeavouring to recollect something , then blushed slightly again and finally pronounced with decision : `` All ! '' 
`` Even my friend , Grushnitski ? '' 
`` But is he your friend ? '' 
she said , manifesting some doubt . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` He , of course , does not come into the category of the tiresome '' ... `` But into that of the unfortunate ! '' 
I said , laughing . 
`` Of course ! 
But do you consider that funny ? 
I should like you to be in his place '' ... `` Well ? 
I was once a cadet myself , and , in truth , it was the best time of my life ! '' 
`` Is he a cadet , then ? '' 
... she said rapidly , and then added : `` But I thought '' ... `` What did you think ? '' 
... `` Nothing ! 
Who is that lady ? '' 
Thereupon the conversation took a different direction , and it did not return to the former subject . 
And now the mazurka came to an end and we separated -- until we should meet again . 
The ladies drove off in different directions . 
I went to get some supper , and met Werner . 
`` Aha ! '' 
he said : `` so it is you ! 
And yet you did not wish to make the acquaintance of Princess Mary otherwise than by saving her from certain death . '' 
`` I have done better , '' I replied . 
`` I have saved her from fainting at the ball '' ... `` How was that ? 
Tell me . '' 
`` No , guess ! 
-- O , you who guess everything in the world ! '' 
ABOUT seven o'clock in the evening , I was walking on the boulevard . 
Grushnitski perceived me a long way off , and came up to me . 
A sort of ridiculous rapture was shining in his eyes . 
He pressed my hand warmly , and said in a tragic voice : `` I thank you , Pechorin ... You understand me ? '' 
`` No ; but in any case it is not worth gratitude , '' I answered , not having , in fact , any good deed upon my conscience . 
`` What ? 
But yesterday ! 
Have you forgotten ? 
... Mary has told me everything '' ... `` Why ! 
Have you everything in common so soon as this ? 
Even gratitude ? '' 
... `` Listen , '' said Grushnitski very earnestly ; `` pray do not make fun of my love , if you wish to remain my friend ... You see , I love her to the point of madness ... and I think -- I hope -- she loves me too ... I have a request to make of you . 
You will be at their house this evening ; promise me to observe everything . 
I know you are experienced in these matters , you know women better than I. . . 
Women ! 
Women ! 
Who can understand them ? 
Their smiles contradict their glances , their words promise and allure , but the tone of their voice repels ... At one time they grasp and divine in a moment our most secret thoughts , at another they can not understand the clearest hints ... Take Princess Mary , now : yesterday her eyes , as they rested upon me , were blazing with passion ; to-day they are dull and cold '' ... `` That is possibly the result of the waters , '' I replied . 
`` You see the bad side of everything ... materialist , '' he added contemptuously . 
`` However , let us talk of other matters . '' 
And , satisfied with his bad pun , he cheered up . 
At nine o'clock we went to Princess Ligovski 's together . 
Passing by Vera 's windows , I saw her looking out . 
We threw a fleeting glance at each other . 
She entered the Ligovskis ' drawing-room soon after us . 
Princess Ligovski presented me to her , as a relation of her own . 
Tea was served . 
The guests were numerous , and the conversation was general . 
I endeavoured to please the Princess , jested , and made her laugh heartily a few times . 
Princess Mary , also , was more than once on the point of bursting out laughing , but she restrained herself in order not to depart from the role she had assumed . 
She finds languor becoming to her , and perhaps she is not mistaken . 
Grushnitski appears to be very glad that she is not infected by my gaiety . 
After tea we all went into the drawingroom . 
`` Are you satisfied with my obedience , Vera ? '' 
I said as I was passing her . 
She threw me a glance full of love and gratitude . 
I have grown accustomed to such glances ; but at one time they constituted my felicity . 
The Princess seated her daughter at the pianoforte , and all the company begged her to sing . 
I kept silence , and , taking advantage of the hubbub , I went aside to the window with Vera , who wished to say something of great importance to both of us ... It turned out to be -- nonsense ... Meanwhile my indifference was vexing Princess Mary , as I was able to make out from a single angry , gleaming glance which she cast at me ... Oh ! 
I understand the method of conversation wonderfully well : mute but expressive , brief but forceful ! 
... She began to sing . 
She has a good voice , but she sings badly ... However , I was not listening . 
Grushnitski , on the contrary , leaning his elbows on the grand piano , facing her , was devouring her with his eyes and saying in an undertone every minute : `` Charmant ! 
Delicieux ! '' 
`` Listen , '' said Vera to me , `` I do not wish you to make my husband 's acquaintance , but you must , without fail , make yourself agreeable to the Princess ; that will be an easy task for you : you can do anything you wish . 
It is only here that we shall see each other '' ... `` Only here ? '' 
... She blushed and continued : `` You know that I am your slave : I have never been able to resist you ... and I shall be punished for it , you will cease to love me ! 
At least , I want to preserve my reputation ... not for myself -- that you know very well ! 
... Oh ! 
I beseech you : do not torture me , as before , with idle doubts and feigned coldness ! 
It may be that I shall die soon ; I feel that I am growing weaker from day to day ... And , yet , I can not think of the future life , I think only of you ... You men do not understand the delights of a glance , of a pressure of the hand ... but as for me , I swear to you that , when I listen to your voice , I feel such a deep , strange bliss that the most passionate kisses could not take its place . '' 
Meanwhile , Princess Mary had finished her song . 
Murmurs of praise were to be heard all around . 
I went up to her after all the other guests , and said something rather carelessly to her on the subject of her voice . 
She made a little grimace , pouting her lower lip , and dropped a very sarcastic curtsey . 
`` That is all the more flattering , '' she said , `` because you have not been listening to me at all ; but perhaps you do not like music ? '' 
... `` On the contrary , I do ... After dinner , especially . '' 
`` Grushnitski is right in saying that you have very prosaic tastes ... and I see that you like music in a gastronomic respect . '' 
`` You are mistaken again : I am by no means an epicure . 
I have a most wretched digestion . 
But music after dinner puts one to sleep , and to sleep after dinner is healthful ; consequently I like music in a medicinal respect . 
In the evening , on the contrary , it excites my nerves too much : I become either too melancholy or too gay . 
Both are fatiguing , where there is no positive reason for being either sorrowful or glad . 
And , moreover , melancholy in society is ridiculous , and too great gaiety is unbecoming '' ... She did not hear me to the end , but went away and sat beside Grushnitski , and they entered into a sort of sentimental conversation . 
Apparently the Princess answered his sage phrases rather absent-mindedly and inconsequently , although endeavouring to show that she was listening to him with attention , because sometimes he looked at her in astonishment , trying to divine the cause of the inward agitation which was expressed at times in her restless glance ... But I have found you out , my dear Princess ! 
Have a care ! 
You want to pay me back in the same coin , to wound my vanity -- you will not succeed ! 
And if you declare war on me , I will be merciless ! 
In the course of the evening , I purposely tried a few times to join in their conversation , but she met my remarks rather coldly , and , at last , I retired in pretended vexation . 
Princess Mary was triumphant , Grushnitski likewise . 
Triumph , my friends , and be quick about it ! 
... You will not have long to triumph ! 
... It can not be otherwise . 
I have a presentiment ... On making a woman 's acquaintance I have always unerringly guessed whether she would fall in love with me or not . 
The remaining part of the evening I spent at Vera 's side , and talked to the full about the old days ... Why does she love me so much ? 
In truth , I am unable to say , all the more so because she is the only woman who has understood me perfectly , with all my petty weaknesses and evil passions ... Can it be that wickedness is so attractive ? 
... Grushnitski and I left the house together . 
In the street he took my arm , and , after a long silence , said : `` Well ? '' 
`` You are a fool , '' I should have liked to answer . 
But I restrained myself and only shrugged my shoulders . 
ALL these days I have not once departed from my system . 
Princess Mary has come to like talking to me ; I have told her a few of the strange events of my life , and she is beginning to look on me as an extraordinary man . 
I mock at everything in the world , especially feelings ; and she is taking alarm . 
When I am present , she does not dare to embark upon sentimental discussions with Grushnitski , and already , on a few occasions , she has answered his sallies with a mocking smile . 
But every time that Grushnitski comes up to her I assume an air of meekness and leave the two of them together . 
On the first occasion , she was glad , or tried to make it appear so ; on the second , she was angry with me ; on the third -- with Grushnitski . 
`` You have very little vanity ! '' 
she said to me yesterday . 
`` What makes you think that I find Grushnitski the more entertaining ? '' 
I answered that I was sacrificing my own pleasure for the sake of the happiness of a friend . 
`` And my pleasure , too , '' she added . 
I looked at her intently and assumed a serious air . 
After that for the whole day I did not speak a single word to her ... In the evening , she was pensive ; this morning , at the well , more pensive still . 
When I went up to her , she was listening absent-mindedly to Grushnitski , who was apparently falling into raptures about Nature , but , so soon as she perceived me , she began to laugh -- at a most inopportune moment -- pretending not to notice me . 
I went on a little further and began stealthily to observe her . 
She turned away from her companion and yawned twice . 
Decidedly she had grown tired of Grushnitski -- I will not talk to her for another two days . 
I OFTEN ask myself why I am so obstinately endeavouring to win the love of a young girl whom I do not wish to deceive , and whom I will never marry . 
Why this woman-like coquetry ? 
Vera loves me more than Princess Mary ever will . 
Had I regarded the latter as an invincible beauty , I should perhaps have been allured by the difficulty of the undertaking ... However , there is no such difficulty in this case ! 
Consequently , my present feeling is not that restless craving for love which torments us in the early days of our youth , flinging us from one woman to another until we find one who can not endure us . 
And then begins our constancy -- that sincere , unending passion which may be expressed mathematically by a line falling from a point into space -- the secret of that endlessness lying only in the impossibility of attaining the aim , that is to say , the end . 
From what motive , then , am I taking all this trouble ? 
-- Envy of Grushnitski ? 
Poor fellow ! 
He is quite undeserving of it . 
Or , is it the result of that ugly , but invincible , feeling which causes us to destroy the sweet illusions of our neighbour in order to have the petty satisfaction of saying to him , when , in despair , he asks what he is to believe : `` My friend , the same thing happened to me , and you see , nevertheless , that I dine , sup , and sleep very peacefully , and I shall , I hope , know how to die without tears and lamentations . '' 
There is , in sooth , a boundless enjoyment in the possession of a young , scarce-budded soul ! 
It is like a floweret which exhales its best perfume at the kiss of the first ray of the sun . 
You should pluck the flower at that moment , and , breathing its fragrance to the full , cast it upon the road : perchance someone will pick it up ! 
I feel within me that insatiate hunger which devours everything it meets upon the way ; I look upon the sufferings and joys of others only from the point of view of their relation to myself , regarding them as the nutriment which sustains my spiritual forces . 
I myself am no longer capable of committing follies under the influence of passion ; with me , ambition has been repressed by circumstances , but it has emerged in another form , because ambition is nothing more nor less than a thirst for power , and my chief pleasure is to make everything that surrounds me subject to my will . 
To arouse the feeling of love , devotion and awe towards oneself -- is not that the first sign , and the greatest triumph , of power ? 
To be the cause of suffering and joy to another -- without in the least possessing any definite right to be so -- is not that the sweetest food for our pride ? 
And what is happiness ? 
-- Satisfied pride . 
Were I to consider myself the best , the most powerful man in the world , I should be happy ; were all to love me , I should find within me inexhaustible springs of love . 
Evil begets evil ; the first suffering gives us the conception of the satisfaction of torturing another . 
The idea of evil can not enter the mind without arousing a desire to put it actually into practice . 
`` Ideas are organic entities , '' someone has said . 
The very fact of their birth endows them with form , and that form is action . 
He in whose brain the most ideas are born accomplishes the most . 
From that cause a genius , chained to an official desk , must die or go mad , just as it often happens that a man of powerful constitution , and at the same time of sedentary life and simple habits , dies of an apoplectic stroke . 
Passions are naught but ideas in their first development ; they are an attribute of the youth of the heart , and foolish is he who thinks that he will be agitated by them all his life . 
Many quiet rivers begin their course as noisy waterfalls , and there is not a single stream which will leap or foam throughout its way to the sea . 
That quietness , however , is frequently the sign of great , though latent , strength . 
The fulness and depth of feelings and thoughts do not admit of frenzied outbursts . 
In suffering and in enjoyment the soul renders itself a strict account of all it experiences and convinces itself that such things must be . 
It knows that , but for storms , the constant heat of the sun would dry it up ! 
It imbues itself with its own life -- pets and punishes itself like a favourite child . 
It is only in that highest state of self-knowledge that a man can appreciate the divine justice . 
On reading over this page , I observe that I have made a wide digression from my subject ... But what matter ? 
... You see , it is for myself that I am writing this diary , and , consequently anything that I jot down in it will in time be a valuable reminiscence for me . . . . . . 
Grushnitski has called to see me to-day . 
He flung himself upon my neck ; he has been promoted to be an officer . 
We drank champagne . 
Doctor Werner came in after him . 
`` I do not congratulate you , '' he said to Grushnitski . 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Because the soldier 's cloak suits you very well , and you must confess that an infantry uniform , made by one of the local tailors , will not add anything of interest to you ... Do you not see ? 
Hitherto , you have been an exception , but now you will come under the general rule . '' 
`` Talk away , doctor , talk away ! 
You will not prevent me from rejoicing . 
He does not know , '' added Grushnitski in a whisper to me , `` how many hopes these epaulettes have lent me ... Oh ! 
... Epaulettes , epaulettes ! 
Your little stars are guiding stars ! 
No ! 
I am perfectly happy now ! '' 
`` Are you coming with us on our walk to the hollow ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` I ? 
Not on any account will I show myself to Princess Mary until my uniform is finished . '' 
`` Would you like me to inform her of your happiness ? '' 
`` No , please , not a word ... I want to give her a surprise '' ... `` Tell me , though , how are you getting on with her ? '' 
He became embarrassed , and fell into thought ; he would gladly have bragged and told lies , but his conscience would not let him ; and , at the same time , he was ashamed to confess the truth . 
`` What do you think ? 
Does she love you ? '' 
... `` Love me ? 
Good gracious , Pechorin , what ideas you do have ! 
... How could she possibly love me so soon ? 
... And a well-bred woman , even if she is in love , will never say so '' ... `` Very well ! 
And , I suppose , in your opinion , a well-bred man should also keep silence in regard to his passion ? '' 
... `` Ah , my dear fellow ! 
There are ways of doing everything ; often things may remain unspoken , but yet may be guessed '' ... `` That is true ... But the love which we read in the eyes does not pledge a woman to anything , whilst words ... Have a care , Grushnitski , she is befooling you ! '' 
`` She ? '' 
he answered , raising his eyes heavenward and smiling complacently . 
`` I am sorry for you , Pechorin ! '' 
... He took his departure . 
In the evening , a numerous company set off to walk to the hollow . 
In the opinion of the learned of Pyatigorsk , the hollow in question is nothing more nor less than an extinct crater . 
It is situated on a slope of Mount Mashuk , at the distance of a verst from the town , and is approached by a narrow path between brushwood and rocks . 
In climbing up the hill , I gave Princess Mary my arm , and she did not leave it during the whole excursion . 
Our conversation commenced with slander ; I proceeded to pass in review our present and absent acquaintances ; at first I exposed their ridiculous , and then their bad , sides . 
My choler rose . 
I began in jest , and ended in genuine malice . 
At first she was amused , but afterwards frightened . 
`` You are a dangerous man ! '' 
she said . 
`` I would rather perish in the woods under the knife of an assassin than under your tongue ... In all earnestness I beg of you : when it comes into your mind to speak evil of me , take a knife instead and cut my throat . 
I think you would not find that a very difficult matter . '' 
`` Am I like an assassin , then ? '' 
... `` You are worse '' ... I fell into thought for a moment ; then , assuming a deeply moved air , I said : `` Yes , such has been my lot from very childhood ! 
All have read upon my countenance the marks of bad qualities , which were not existent ; but they were assumed to exist -- and they were born . 
I was modest -- I was accused of slyness : I grew secretive . 
I profoundly felt both good and evil -- no one caressed me , all insulted me : I grew vindictive . 
I was gloomy -- other children merry and talkative ; I felt myself higher than they -- I was rated lower : I grew envious . 
I was prepared to love the whole world -- no one understood me : I learned to hate . 
My colourless youth flowed by in conflict with myself and the world ; fearing ridicule , I buried my best feelings in the depths of my heart , and there they died . 
I spoke the truth -- I was not believed : I began to deceive . 
Having acquired a thorough knowledge of the world and the springs of society , I grew skilled in the science of life ; and I saw how others without skill were happy , enjoying gratuitously the advantages which I so unweariedly sought . 
Then despair was born within my breast -- not that despair which is cured at the muzzle of a pistol , but the cold , powerless despair concealed beneath the mask of amiability and a good-natured smile . 
I became a moral cripple . 
One half of my soul ceased to exist ; it dried up , evaporated , died , and I cut it off and cast it from me . 
The other half moved and lived -- at the service of all ; but it remained unobserved , because no one knew that the half which had perished had ever existed . 
But , now , the memory of it has been awakened within me by you , and I have read you its epitaph . 
To many , epitaphs in general seem ridiculous , but to me they do not ; especially when I remember what reposes beneath them . 
I will not , however , ask you to share my opinion . 
If this outburst seems absurd to you , I pray you , laugh ! 
I forewarn you that your laughter will not cause me the least chagrin . '' 
At that moment I met her eyes : tears were welling in them . 
Her arm , as it leaned upon mine , was trembling ; her cheeks were aflame ; she pitied me ! 
Sympathy -- a feeling to which all women yield so easily , had dug its talons into her inexperienced heart . 
During the whole excursion she was preoccupied , and did not flirt with anyone -- and that is a great sign ! 
We arrived at the hollow ; the ladies left their cavaliers , but she did not let go my arm . 
The witticisms of the local dandies failed to make her laugh ; the steepness of the declivity beside which she was standing caused her no alarm , although the other ladies uttered shrill cries and shut their eyes . 
On the way back , I did not renew our melancholy conversation , but to my idle questions and jests she gave short and absent-minded answers . 
`` Have you ever been in love ? '' 
I asked her at length . 
She looked at me intently , shook her head and again fell into a reverie . 
It was evident that she was wishing to say something , but did not know how to begin . 
Her breast heaved ... And , indeed , that was but natural ! 
A muslin sleeve is a weak protection , and an electric spark was running from my arm to hers . 
Almost all passions have their beginning in that way , and frequently we are very much deceived in thinking that a woman loves us for our moral and physical merits ; of course , these prepare and predispose the heart for the reception of the holy flame , but for all that it is the first touch that decides the matter . 
`` I have been very amiable to-day , have I not ? '' 
Princess Mary said to me , with a forced smile , when we had returned from the walk . 
We separated . 
She is dissatisfied with herself . 
She accuses herself of coldness ... Oh , that is the first , the chief triumph ! 
To-morrow , she will be feeling a desire to recompense me . 
I know the whole proceeding by heart already -- that is what is so tiresome ! 
I HAVE seen Vera to-day . 
She has begun to plague me with her jealousy . 
Princess Mary has taken it into her head , it seems , to confide the secrets of her heart to Vera : a happy choice , it must be confessed ! 
`` I can guess what all this is leading to , '' said Vera to me . 
`` You had better simply tell me at once that you are in love with her . '' 
`` But supposing I am not in love with her ? '' 
`` Then why run after her , disturb her , agitate her imagination ! 
... Oh , I know you well ! 
Listen -- if you wish me to believe you , come to Kislovodsk in a week 's time ; we shall be moving thither the day after to-morrow . 
Princess Mary will remain here longer . 
Engage lodgings next door to us . 
We shall be living in the large house near the spring , on the mezzanine floor . 
Princess Ligovski will be below us , and next door there is a house belonging to the same landlord , which has not yet been taken ... Will you come ? '' 
... I gave my promise , and this very same day I have sent to engage the lodgings . 
Grushnitski came to me at six o'clock and announced that his uniform would be ready to-morrow , just in time for him to go to the ball in it . 
`` At last I shall dance with her the whole evening through ... And then I shall talk to my heart 's content , '' he added . 
`` When is the ball ? '' 
`` Why , to-morrow ! 
Do you not know , then ? 
A great festival -- and the local authorities have undertaken to organize it '' ... `` Let us go to the boulevard '' ... `` Not on any account , in this nasty cloak '' ... `` What ! 
Have you ceased to love it ? '' 
... I went out alone , and , meeting Princess Mary I asked her to keep the mazurka for me . 
She seemed surprised and delighted . 
`` I thought that you would only dance from necessity as on the last occasion , '' she said , with a very charming smile ... She does not seem to notice Grushnitski 's absence at all . 
`` You will be agreeably surprised to-morrow , '' I said to her . 
`` At what ? '' 
`` That is a secret ... You will find it out yourself , at the ball . '' 
I finished up the evening at Princess Ligovski 's ; there were no other guests present except Vera and a certain very amusing , little old gentleman . 
I was in good spirits , and improvised various extraordinary stories . 
Princess Mary sat opposite me and listened to my nonsense with such deep , strained , and even tender attention that I grew ashamed of myself . 
What had become of her vivacity , her coquetry , her caprices , her haughty mien , her contemptuous smile , her absentminded glance ? 
... Vera noticed everything , and her sickly countenance was a picture of profound grief . 
She was sitting in the shadow by the window , buried in a wide arm-chair ... I pitied her . 
Then I related the whole dramatic story of our acquaintanceship , our love -- concealing it all , of course , under fictitious names . 
So vividly did I portray my tenderness , my anxieties , my raptures ; in so favourable a light did I exhibit her actions and her character , that involuntarily she had to forgive me for my flirtation with Princess Mary . 
She rose , sat down beside us , and brightened up ... and it was only at two o'clock in the morning that we remembered that the doctors had ordered her to go to bed at eleven . 
HALF an hour before the ball , Grushnitski presented himself to me in the full splendour of the uniform of the Line infantry . 
Attached to his third button was a little bronze chain , on which hung a double lorgnette . 
Epaulettes of incredible size were bent backwards and upwards in the shape of a cupid 's wings ; his boots creaked ; in his left hand he held cinnamon-coloured kid gloves and a forage-cap , and with his right he kept every moment twisting his frizzled tuft of hair up into tiny curls . 
Complacency and at the same time a certain diffidence were depicted upon his face . 
His festal appearance and proud gait would have made me burst out laughing , if such a proceeding had been in accordance with my intentions . 
He threw his cap and gloves on the table and began to pull down the skirts of his coat and to put himself to rights before the looking-glass . 
An enormous black handkerchief , which was twisted into a very high stiffener for his cravat , and the bristles of which supported his chin , stuck out an inch over his collar . 
It seemed to him to be rather small , and he drew it up as far as his ears . 
As a result of that hard work -- the collar of his uniform being very tight and uncomfortable -- he grew red in the face . 
`` They say you have been courting my princess terribly these last few days ? '' 
he said , rather carelessly and without looking at me . '' 
` Where are we fools to drink tea ! ' '' 
-LSB- 271 -RSB- I answered , repeating a pet phrase of one of the cleverest rogues of past times , once celebrated in song by Pushkin . 
`` Tell me , does my uniform fit me well ? 
... Oh , the cursed Jew ! 
... How it cuts me under the armpits ! 
... Have you got any scent ? '' 
`` Good gracious , what more do you want ? 
You are reeking of rose pomade as it is . '' 
`` Never mind . 
Give me some '' ... He poured half a phial over his cravat , his pocket-handkerchief , his sleeves . 
`` You are going to dance ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I think not . '' 
`` I am afraid I shall have to lead off the mazurka with Princess Mary , and I scarcely know a single figure '' ... `` Have you asked her to dance the mazurka with you ? '' 
`` Not yet '' ... `` Mind you are not forestalled '' ... `` Just so , indeed ! '' 
he said , striking his forehead . 
`` Good-bye ... I will go and wait for her at the entrance . '' 
He seized his forage-cap and ran . 
Half an hour later I also set off . 
The street was dark and deserted . 
Around the assembly rooms , or inn -- whichever you prefer -- people were thronging . 
The windows were lighted up , the strains of the regimental band were borne to me on the evening breeze . 
I walked slowly ; I felt melancholy . 
`` Can it be possible , '' I thought , `` that my sole mission on earth is to destroy the hopes of others ? 
Ever since I began to live and to act , it seems always to have been my fate to play a part in the ending of other people 's dramas , as if , but for me , no one could either die or fall into despair ! 
I have been the indispensable person of the fifth act ; unwillingly I have played the pitiful part of an executioner or a traitor . 
What object has fate had in this ? 
... Surely , I have not been appointed by destiny to be an author of middle-class tragedies and family romances , or to be a collaborator with the purveyor of stories -- for the ` Reader 's Library , ' -LSB- 272 -RSB- for example ? 
... How can I tell ? 
... Are there not many people who , in beginning life , think to end it like Lord Byron or Alexander the Great , and , nevertheless , remain Titular Councillors -LSB- 273 -RSB- all their days ? '' 
Entering the saloon , I concealed myself in a crowd of men , and began to make my observations . 
Grushnitski was standing beside Princess Mary and saying something with great warmth . 
She was listening to him absent-mindedly and looking about her , her fan laid to her lips . 
Impatience was depicted upon her face , her eyes were searching all around for somebody . 
I went softly behind them in order to listen to their conversation . 
`` You torture me , Princess ! '' 
Grushnitski was saying . 
`` You have changed dreadfully since I saw you last '' ... `` You , too , have changed , '' she answered , casting a rapid glance at him , in which he was unable to detect the latent sneer . 
`` I ! 
Changed ? 
... Oh , never ! 
You know that such a thing is impossible ! 
Whoever has seen you once will bear your divine image with him for ever . '' 
`` Stop '' ... `` But why will you not let me say to-night what you have so often listened to with condescension -- and just recently , too ? '' 
... `` Because I do not like repetitions , '' she answered , laughing . 
`` Oh ! 
I have been bitterly mistaken ! 
... I thought , fool that I was , that these epaulettes , at least , would give me the right to hope ... No , it would have been better for me to have remained for ever in that contemptible soldier 's cloak , to which , probably , I was indebted for your attention '' ... `` As a matter of fact , the cloak is much more becoming to you '' ... At that moment I went up and bowed to Princess Mary . 
She blushed a little , and went on rapidly : `` Is it not true , Monsieur Pechorin , that the grey cloak suits Monsieur Grushnitski much better ? '' 
... `` I do not agree with you , '' I answered : `` he is more youthful-looking still in his uniform . '' 
That was a blow which Grushnitski could not bear : like all boys , he has pretensions to being an old man ; he thinks that the deep traces of passions upon his countenance take the place of the lines scored by Time . 
He cast a furious glance at me , stamped his foot , and took himself off . 
`` Confess now , '' I said to Princess Mary : `` that although he has always been most ridiculous , yet not so long ago he seemed to you to be interesting ... in the grey cloak ? '' 
... She cast her eyes down and made no reply . 
Grushnitski followed the Princess about during the whole evening and danced either with her or vis-a-vis . 
He devoured her with his eyes , sighed , and wearied her with prayers and reproaches . 
After the third quadrille she had begun to hate him . 
`` I did not expect this from you , '' he said , coming up to me and taking my arm . 
`` What ? '' 
`` You are going to dance the mazurka with her ? '' 
he asked in a solemn tone . 
`` She admitted it '' ... `` Well , what then ? 
It is not a secret , is it '' ? 
`` Of course not ... I ought to have expected such a thing from that chit -- that flirt ... I will have my revenge , though ! '' 
`` You should lay the blame on your cloak , or your epaulettes , but why accuse her ? 
What fault is it of hers that she does not like you any longer ? '' 
... `` But why give me hopes ? '' 
`` Why did you hope ? 
To desire and to strive after something -- that I can understand ! 
But who ever hopes ? '' 
`` You have won the wager , but not quite , '' he said , with a malignant smile . 
The mazurka began . 
Grushnitski chose no one but the Princess , other cavaliers chose her every minute : obviously a conspiracy against me -- all the better ! 
She wants to talk to me , they are preventing her -- she will want to twice as much . 
I squeezed her hand once or twice ; the second time she drew it away without saying a word . 
`` I shall sleep badly to-night , '' she said to me when the mazurka was over . 
`` Grushnitski is to blame for that . '' 
`` Oh , no ! '' 
And her face became so pensive , so sad , that I promised myself that I would not fail to kiss her hand that evening . 
The guests began to disperse . 
As I was handing Princess Mary into her carriage , I rapidly pressed her little hand to my lips . 
The night was dark and nobody could see . 
I returned to the saloon very well satisfied with myself . 
The young men , Grushnitski amongst them , were having supper at the large table . 
As I came in , they all fell silent : evidently they had been talking about me . 
Since the last ball many of them have been sulky with me , especially the captain of dragoons ; and now , it seems , a hostile gang is actually being formed against me , under the command of Grushnitski . 
He wears such a proud and courageous air ... I am very glad ; I love enemies , though not in the Christian sense . 
They amuse me , stir my blood . 
To be always on one 's guard , to catch every glance , the meaning of every word , to guess intentions , to crush conspiracies , to pretend to be deceived and suddenly with one blow to overthrow the whole immense and laboriously constructed edifice of cunning and design -- that is what I call life . 
During supper Grushnitski kept whispering and exchanging winks with the captain of dragoons . 
VERA and her husband left this morning for Kislovodsk . 
I met their carriage as I was walking to Princess Ligovski 's . 
Vera nodded to me : reproach was in her glance . 
Who is to blame , then ? 
Why will she not give me an opportunity of seeing her alone ? 
Love is like fire -- if not fed it dies out . 
Perchance , jealousy will accomplish what my entreaties have failed to do . 
I stayed a whole hour at Princess Ligovski 's . 
Mary has not been out , she is ill . 
In the evening she was not on the boulevard . 
The newly formed gang , armed with lorgnettes , has in very fact assumed a menacing aspect . 
I am glad that Princess Mary is ill ; they might be guilty of some impertinence towards her . 
Grushnitski goes about with dishevelled locks , and wears an appearance of despair : he is evidently afflicted , as a matter of fact ; his vanity especially has been injured . 
But , you see , there are some people in whom even despair is diverting ! 
... On my way home I noticed that something was lacking . 
I have not seen her ! 
She is ill ! 
Surely I have not fallen in love with her in real earnest ? 
... What nonsense ! 
AT eleven o'clock in the morning -- the hour at which Princess Ligovski is usually perspiring in the Ermolov baths -- I walked past her house . 
Princess Mary was sitting pensively at the window ; on seeing me she sprang up . 
I entered the ante-room , there was nobody there , and , availing myself of the freedom afforded by the local customs , I made my way , unannounced , into the drawing-room . 
Princess Mary 's charming countenance was shrouded with a dull pallor . 
She was standing by the pianoforte , leaning one hand on the back of an arm-chair ; her hand was very faintly trembling . 
I went up to her softly and said : `` You are angry with me ? '' 
... She lifted a deep , languid glance upon me and shook her head . 
Her lips were about to utter something , but failed ; her eyes filled with tears ; she sank into the arm-chair and buried her face in her hands . 
`` What is the matter with you ? '' 
I said , taking her hand . 
`` You do not respect me ! 
... Oh , leave me ! '' 
... I took a few steps ... She drew herself up in the chair , her eyes sparkled . 
I stopped still , took hold of the handle of the door , and said : `` Forgive me , Princess . 
I have acted like a madman ... It will not happen another time ; I shall see to that ... But how can you know what has been taking place hitherto within my soul ? 
That you will never learn , and so much the better for you . 
Farewell . ''
