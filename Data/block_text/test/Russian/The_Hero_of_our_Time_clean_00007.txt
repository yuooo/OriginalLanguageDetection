As I was going out , I seemed to hear her weeping . 
I wandered on foot about the environs of Mount Mashuk till evening , fatigued myself terribly and , on arriving home , flung myself on my bed , utterly exhausted . 
Werner came to see me . 
`` Is it true , '' he asked , `` that you are going to marry Princess Mary ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` The whole town is saying so . 
All my patients are occupied with that important piece of news ; but you know what these patients are : they know everything . '' 
`` This is one of Grushnitski 's tricks , '' I said to myself . 
`` To prove the falsity of these rumours , doctor , I may mention , as a secret , that I am moving to Kislovodsk to-morrow '' ... `` And Princess Mary , too ? '' 
`` No , she remains here another week '' ... `` So you are not going to get married ? '' 
... `` Doctor , doctor ! 
Look at me ! 
Am I in the least like a bridegroom , or any such thing ? '' 
`` I am not saying so ... But you know there are occasions ... '' he added , with a crafty smile -- `` in which an honourable man is obliged to marry , and there are mothers who , to say the least , do not prevent such occasions ... And so , as a friend , I should advise you to be more cautious . 
The air of these parts is very dangerous . 
How many handsome young men , worthy of a better fate , have I not seen departing from here straight to the altar ! 
... Would you believe me , they were even going to find a wife for me ! 
That is to say , one person was -- a lady belonging to this district , who had a very pale daughter . 
I had the misfortune to tell her that the latter 's colour would be restored after wedlock , and then with tears of gratitude she offered me her daughter 's hand and the whole of her own fortune -- fifty souls , -LSB- 28 -RSB- I think . 
But I replied that I was unfit for such an honour . '' 
Werner left , fully convinced that he had put me on my guard . 
I gathered from his words that various ugly rumours were already being spread about the town on the subject of Princess Mary and myself : Grushnitski shall smart for this ! 
I HAVE been in Kislovodsk three days now . 
Every day I see Vera at the well and out walking . 
In the morning , when I awake , I sit by my window and direct my lorgnette at her balcony . 
She has already been dressed long ago , and is waiting for the signal agreed upon . 
We meet , as though unexpectedly , in the garden which slopes down from our houses to the well . 
The life-giving mountain air has brought back her colour and her strength . 
Not for nothing is Narzan called the `` Spring of Heroes . '' 
The inhabitants aver that the air of Kislovodsk predisposes the heart to love and that all the romances which have had their beginning at the foot of Mount Mashuk find their consummation here . 
And , in very fact , everything here breathes of solitude ; everything has an air of secrecy -- the thick shadows of the linden avenues , bending over the torrent which falls , noisy and foaming , from flag to flag and cleaves itself a way between the mountains now becoming clad with verdure -- the mist-filled , silent ravines , with their ramifications straggling away in all directions -- the freshness of the aromatic air , laden with the fragrance of the tall southern grasses and the white acacia -- the never-ceasing , sweetly-slumberous babble of the cool brooks , which , meeting at the end of the valley , flow along in friendly emulation , and finally fling themselves into the Podkumok . 
On this side , the ravine is wider and becomes converted into a verdant dell , through which winds the dusty road . 
Every time I look at it , I seem to see a carriage coming along and a rosy little face looking out of the carriage-window . 
Many carriages have already driven by -- but still there is no sign of that particular one . 
The village which lies behind the fortress has become populous . 
In the restaurant , built upon a hill a few paces distant from my lodgings , lights are beginning to flash in the evening through the double row of poplars ; noise and the jingling of glasses resound till late at night . 
In no place are such quantities of Kakhetian wine and mineral waters drunk as here . 
`` And many are willing to mix the two , But that is a thing I never do . '' 
Every day Grushnitski and his gang are to be found brawling in the inn , and he has almost ceased to greet me . 
He only arrived yesterday , and has already succeeded in quarrelling with three old men who were going to take their places in the baths before him . 
Decidedly , his misfortunes are developing a warlike spirit within him . 
AT last they have arrived . 
I was sitting by the window when I heard the clattering of their carriage . 
My heart throbbed ... What does it mean ? 
Can it be that I am in love ? 
... I am so stupidly constituted that such a thing might be expected of me . 
I dined at their house . 
Princess Ligovski looked at me with much tenderness , and did not leave her daughter 's side ... a bad sign ! 
On the other hand , Vera is jealous of me in regard to Princess Mary -- however , I have been striving for that good fortune . 
What will not a woman do in order to chagrin her rival ? 
I remember that once a woman loved me simply because I was in love with another woman . 
There is nothing more paradoxical than the female mind ; it is difficult to convince a woman of anything ; they have to be led into convincing themselves . 
The order of the proofs by which they demolish their prejudices is most original ; to learn their dialectic it is necessary to overthrow in your own mind every scholastic rule of logic . 
For example , the usual way : `` This man loves me ; but I am married : therefore I must not love him . '' 
The woman 's way : `` I must not love him , because I am married ; but he loves me -- therefore '' ... A few dots here , because reason has no more to say . 
But , generally , there is something to be said by the tongue , and the eyes , and , after these , the heart -- if there is such a thing . 
What if these notes should one day meet a woman 's eye ? 
`` Slander ! '' 
she will exclaim indignantly . 
Ever since poets have written and women have read them -LRB- for which the poets should be most deeply grateful -RRB- women have been called angels so many times that , in very truth , in their simplicity of soul , they have believed the compliment , forgetting that , for money , the same poets have glorified Nero as a demigod ... It would be unreasonable were I to speak of women with such malignity -- I who have loved nothing else in the world -- I who have always been ready to sacrifice for their sake ease , ambition , life itself ... But , you see , I am not endeavouring , in a fit of vexation and injured vanity , to pluck from them the magic veil through which only an accustomed glance can penetrate . 
No , all that I say about them is but the result of `` A mind which coldly hath observed , A heart which bears the stamp of woe . '' 
-LSB- 29 -RSB- Women ought to wish that all men knew them as well as I because I have loved them a hundred times better since I have ceased to be afraid of them and have comprehended their little weaknesses . 
By the way : the other day , Werner compared women to the enchanted forest of which Tasso tells in his `` Jerusalem Delivered . '' 
-LSB- 30 -RSB- `` So soon as you approach , '' he said , `` from all directions terrors , such as I pray Heaven may preserve us from , will take wing at you : duty , pride , decorum , public opinion , ridicule , contempt ... You must simply go straight on without looking at them ; gradually the monsters disappear , and , before you , opens a bright and quiet glade , in the midst of which blooms the green myrtle . 
On the other hand , woe to you if , at the first steps , your heart trembles and you turn back ! '' 
THIS evening has been fertile in events . 
About three versts from Kislovodsk , in the gorge through which the Podkumok flows , there is a cliff called the Ring . 
It is a naturally formed gate , rising upon a lofty hill , and through it the setting sun throws its last flaming glance upon the world . 
A numerous cavalcade set off thither to gaze at the sunset through the rock-window . 
To tell the truth , not one of them was thinking about the sun . 
I rode beside Princess Mary . 
On the way home , we had to ford the Podkumok . 
Mountain streams , even the smallest , are dangerous ; especially so , because the bottom is a perfect kaleidoscope : it changes every day owing to the pressure of the current ; where yesterday there was a rock , to-day there is a cavity . 
I took Princess Mary 's horse by the bridle and led it into the water , which came no higher than its knees . 
We began to move slowly in a slanting direction against the current . 
It is a well-known fact that , in crossing rapid streamlets , you should never look at the water , because , if you do , your head begins to whirl directly . 
I forgot to warn Princess Mary of that . 
We had reached the middle and were right in the vortex , when suddenly she reeled in her saddle . 
`` I feel ill ! '' 
she said in a faint voice . 
I bent over to her rapidly and threw my arm around her supple waist . 
`` Look up ! '' 
I whispered . 
`` It is nothing ; just be brave ! 
I am with you . '' 
She grew better ; she was about to disengage herself from my arm , but I clasped her tender , soft figure in a still closer embrace ; my cheek almost touched hers , from which was wafted flame . 
`` What are you doing to me ? 
... Oh , Heaven ! '' 
... I paid no attention to her alarm and confusion , and my lips touched her tender cheek . 
She shuddered , but said nothing . 
We were riding behind the others : nobody saw us . 
When we made our way out on the bank , the horses were all put to the trot . 
Princess Mary kept hers back ; I remained beside her . 
It was evident that my silence was making her uneasy , but I swore to myself that I would not speak a single word -- out of curiosity . 
I wanted to see how she would extricate herself from that embarrassing position . 
`` Either you despise me , or you love me very much ! '' 
she said at length , and there were tears in her voice . 
`` Perhaps you want to laugh at me , to excite my soul and then to abandon me ... That would be so base , so vile , that the mere supposition ... Oh , no ! '' 
she added , in a voice of tender trustfulness ; `` there is nothing in me which would preclude respect ; is it not so ? 
Your presumptuous action ... I must , I must forgive you for it , because I permitted it ... Answer , speak , I want to hear your voice ! '' 
... There was such womanly impatience in her last words that , involuntarily , I smiled ; happily it was beginning to grow dusk ... I made no answer . 
`` You are silent ! '' 
she continued ; `` you wish , perhaps , that I should be the first to tell you that I love you . '' 
... I remained silent . 
`` Is that what you wish ? '' 
she continued , turning rapidly towards me ... . 
There was something terrible in the determination of her glance and voice . 
`` Why ? '' 
I answered , shrugging my shoulders . 
She struck her horse with her riding-whip and set off at full gallop along the narrow , dangerous road . 
It all happened so quickly that I was scarcely able to overtake her , and then only by the time she had joined the rest of the company . 
All the way home she was continually talking and laughing . 
There was something feverish in her movements ; not once did she look in my direction . 
Everybody observed her unusual gaiety . 
Princess Ligovski rejoiced inwardly as she looked at her daughter . 
However , the latter simply has a fit of nerves : she will spend a sleepless night , and will weep . 
This thought affords me measureless delight : there are moments when I understand the Vampire ... And yet I am reputed to be a good fellow , and I strive to earn that designation ! 
On dismounting , the ladies went into Princess Ligovski 's house . 
I was excited , and I galloped to the mountains in order to dispel the thoughts which had thronged into my head . 
The dewy evening breathed an intoxicating coolness . 
The moon was rising from behind the dark summits . 
Each step of my unshod horse resounded hollowly in the silence of the gorges . 
I watered the horse at the waterfall , and then , after greedily inhaling once or twice the fresh air of the southern night . 
I set off on my way back . 
I rode through the village . 
The lights in the windows were beginning to go out ; the sentries on the fortress-rampart and the Cossacks in the surrounding pickets were calling out in drawling tones to one another . 
In one of the village houses , built at the edge of a ravine , I noticed an extraordinary illumination . 
At times , discordant murmurs and shouting could be heard , proving that a military carouse was in full swing . 
I dismounted and crept up to the window . 
The shutter had not been made fast , and I could see the banqueters and catch what they were saying . 
They were talking about me . 
The captain of dragoons , flushed with wine , struck the table with his fist , demanding attention . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
he said , `` this wo n't do ! 
Pechorin must be taught a lesson ! 
These Petersburg fledglings always carry their heads high until they get a slap in the face ! 
He thinks that because he always wears clean gloves and polished boots he is the only one who has ever lived in society . 
And what a haughty smile ! 
All the same , I am convinced that he is a coward -- yes , a coward ! '' 
`` I think so too , '' said Grushnitski . 
`` He is fond of getting himself out of trouble by pretending to be only having a joke . 
I once gave him such a talking to that anyone else in his place would have cut me to pieces on the spot . 
But Pechorin turned it all to the ridiculous side . 
I , of course , did not call him out because that was his business , but he did not care to have anything more to do with it . '' 
`` Grushnitski is angry with him for having captured Princess Mary from him , '' somebody said . 
`` That 's a new idea ! 
It is true I did run after Princess Mary a little , but I left off at once because I do not want to get married ; and it is against my rules to compromise a girl . '' 
`` Yes , I assure you that he is a coward of the first water , I mean Pechorin , not Grushnitski -- but Grushnitski is a fine fellow , and , besides , he is my true friend ! '' 
the captain of dragoons went on . 
`` Gentlemen ! 
Nobody here stands up for him ? 
Nobody ? 
So much the better ! 
Would you like to put his courage to the test ? 
It would be amusing '' ... `` We would ; but how ? '' 
`` Listen here , then : Grushnitski in particular is angry with him -- therefore to Grushnitski falls the chief part . 
He will pick a quarrel over some silly trifle or other , and will challenge Pechorin to a duel ... Wait a bit ; here is where the joke comes in ... He will challenge him to a duel ; very well ! 
The whole proceeding -- challenge , preparations , conditions -- will be as solemn and awe-inspiring as possible -- I will see to that . 
I will be your second , my poor friend ! 
Very well ! 
Only here is the rub ; we will put no bullets in the pistols . 
I can answer for it that Pechorin will turn coward -- I will place them six paces apart , devil take it ! 
Are you agreed , gentlemen ? '' 
`` Splendid idea ! 
... Agreed ! 
... And why not ? '' 
... came from all sides . 
`` And you , Grushnitski ? '' 
Tremblingly I awaited Grushnitski 's answer . 
I was filled with cold rage at the thought that , but for an accident , I might have made myself the laughing-stock of those fools . 
If Grushnitski had not agreed , I should have thrown myself upon his neck ; but , after an interval of silence , he rose from his place , extended his hand to the captain , and said very gravely : `` Very well , I agree ! '' 
It would be difficult to describe the enthusiasm of that honourable company . 
I returned home , agitated by two different feelings . 
The first was sorrow . 
`` Why do they all hate me ? '' 
I thought -- `` why ? 
Have I affronted anyone ? 
No . 
Can it be that I am one of those men the mere sight of whom is enough to create animosity ? '' 
And I felt a venomous rage gradually filling my soul . 
`` Have a care , Mr. Grushnitski ! '' 
I said , walking up and down the room : `` I am not to be jested with like this ! 
You may pay dearly for the approbation of your foolish comrades . 
I am not your toy ! '' 
... I got no sleep that night . 
By daybreak I was as yellow as an orange . 
In the morning I met Princess Mary at the well . 
`` You are ill ? '' 
she said , looking intently at me . 
`` I did not sleep last night . '' 
`` Nor I either ... I was accusing you ... perhaps groundlessly . 
But explain yourself , I can forgive you everything '' ... `` Everything ? '' 
... `` Everything ... only speak the truth ... and be quick ... You see , I have been thinking a good deal , trying to explain , to justify , your behaviour . 
Perhaps you are afraid of opposition on the part of my relations ... that will not matter . 
When they learn '' ... Her voice shook . 
`` I will win them over by entreaties . 
Or , is it your own position ? 
... But you know that I can sacrifice everything for the sake of the man I love ... Oh , answer quickly -- have pity ... You do not despise me -- do you ? '' 
She seized my hand . 
Princess Ligovski was walking in front of us with Vera 's husband , and had not seen anything ; but we might have been observed by some of the invalids who were strolling about -- the most inquisitive gossips of all inquisitive folk -- and I rapidly disengaged my hand from her passionate pressure . 
`` I will tell you the whole truth , '' I answered . 
`` I will not justify myself , nor explain my actions : I do not love you . '' 
Her lips grew slightly pale . 
`` Leave me , '' she said , in a scarcely audible voice . 
I shrugged my shoulders , turned round , and walked away . 
I SOMETIMES despise myself ... Is not that the reason why I despise others also ? 
... I have grown incapable of noble impulses ; I am afraid of appearing ridiculous to myself . 
In my place , another would have offered Princess Mary son coeur et sa fortune ; but over me the word `` marry '' has a kind of magical power . 
However passionately I love a woman , if she only gives me to feel that I have to marry her -- then farewell , love ! 
My heart is turned to stone , and nothing will warm it anew . 
I am prepared for any other sacrifice but that ; my life twenty times over , nay , my honour I would stake on the fortune of a card ... but my freedom I will never sell . 
Why do I prize it so highly ? 
What is there in it to me ? 
For what am I preparing myself ? 
What do I hope for from the future ? 
... In truth , absolutely nothing . 
It is a kind of innate dread , an inexplicable prejudice ... There are people , you know , who have an unaccountable dread of spiders , beetles , mice ... Shall I confess it ? 
When I was but a child , a certain old woman told my fortune to my mother . 
She predicted for me death from a wicked wife . 
I was profoundly struck by her words at the time : an irresistible repugnance to marriage was born within my soul ... Meanwhile , something tells me that her prediction will be realized ; I will try , at all events , to arrange that it shall be realized as late in life as possible . 
YESTERDAY , the conjurer Apfelbaum arrived here . 
A long placard made its appearance on the door of the restaurant , informing the most respected public that the above-mentioned marvellous conjurer , acrobat , chemist , and optician would have the honour to give a magnificent performance on the present day at eight o'clock in the evening , in the saloon of the Nobles ' Club -LRB- in other words , the restaurant -RRB- ; tickets -- two rubles and a half each . 
Everyone intends to go and see the marvellous conjurer ; even Princess Ligovski has taken a ticket for herself , in spite of her daughter being ill . 
After dinner to-day , I walked past Vera 's windows ; she was sitting by herself on the balcony . 
A note fell at my feet : `` Come to me at ten o'clock this evening by the large staircase . 
My husband has gone to Pyatigorsk and will not return before to-morrow morning . 
My servants and maids will not be at home ; I have distributed tickets to all of them , and to the princess 's servants as well . 
I await you ; come without fail . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
I said to myself , `` so then it has turned out at last as I thought it would . '' 
At eight o'clock I went to see the conjurer . 
The public assembled before the stroke of nine . 
The performance began . 
On the back rows of chairs I recognized Vera 's and Princess Ligovski 's menservants and maids . 
They were all there , every single one . 
Grushnitski , with his lorgnette , was sitting in the front row , and the conjurer had recourse to him every time he needed a handkerchief , a watch , a ring and so forth . 
For some time past , Grushnitski has ceased to bow to me , and to-day he has looked at me rather insolently once or twice . 
It will all be remembered to him when we come to settle our scores . 
Before ten o'clock had struck , I stood up and went out . 
It was dark outside , pitch dark . 
Cold , heavy clouds were lying on the summit of the surrounding mountains , and only at rare intervals did the dying breeze rustle the tops of the poplars which surrounded the restaurant . 
People were crowding at the windows . 
I went down the mountain and , turning in under the gate , I hastened my pace . 
Suddenly it seemed to me that somebody was following my steps . 
I stopped and looked round . 
It was impossible to make out anything in the darkness . 
However , out of caution , I walked round the house , as if taking a stroll . 
Passing Princess Mary 's windows , I again heard steps behind me ; a man wrapped in a cloak ran by me . 
That rendered me uneasy , but I crept up to the flight of steps , and hastily mounted the dark staircase . 
A door opened , and a little hand seized mine ... `` Nobody has seen you ? '' 
said Vera in a whisper , clinging to me . 
`` Nobody . '' 
`` Now do you believe that I love you ? 
Oh ! 
I have long hesitated , long tortured myself ... But you can do anything you like with me . '' 
Her heart was beating violently , her hands were cold as ice . 
She broke out into complaints and jealous reproaches . 
She demanded that I should confess everything to her , saying that she would bear my faithlessness with submission , because her sole desire was that I should be happy . 
I did not quite believe that , but I calmed her with oaths , promises and so on . 
`` So you will not marry Mary ? 
You do not love her ? 
... But she thinks ... Do you know , she is madly in love with you , poor girl ! '' 
... ***** About two o'clock in the morning I opened the window and , tying two shawls together , I let myself down from the upper balcony to the lower , holding on by the pillar . 
A light was still burning in Princess Mary 's room . 
Something drew me towards that window . 
The curtain was not quite drawn , and I was able to cast a curious glance into the interior of the room . 
Mary was sitting on her bed , her hands crossed upon her knees ; her thick hair was gathered up under a lace-frilled nightcap ; her white shoulders were covered by a large crimson kerchief , and her little feet were hidden in a pair of many-coloured Persian slippers . 
She was sitting quite still , her head sunk upon her breast ; on a little table in front of her was an open book ; but her eyes , fixed and full of inexpressible grief , seemed for the hundredth time to be skimming the same page whilst her thoughts were far away . 
At that moment somebody stirred behind a shrub . 
I leaped from the balcony on to the sward . 
An invisible hand seized me by the shoulder . 
`` Aha ! '' 
said a rough voice : `` caught ! 
... I 'll teach you to be entering princesses ' rooms at night ! '' 
`` Hold him fast ! '' 
exclaimed another , springing out from a corner . 
It was Grushnitski and the captain of dragoons . 
I struck the latter on the head with my fist , knocked him off his feet , and darted into the bushes . 
All the paths of the garden which covered the slope opposite our houses were known to me . 
`` Thieves , guard ! '' 
... they cried . 
A gunshot rang out ; a smoking wad fell almost at my feet . 
Within a minute I was in my own room , undressed and in bed . 
My manservant had only just locked the door when Grushnitski and the captain began knocking for admission . 
`` Pechorin ! 
Are you asleep ? 
Are you there ? '' 
... cried the captain . 
`` I am in bed , '' I answered angrily . 
`` Get up ! 
Thieves ! 
... Circassians ! '' 
... `` I have a cold , '' I answered . 
`` I am afraid of catching a chill . '' 
They went away . 
I had gained no useful purpose by answering them : they would have been looking for me in the garden for another hour or so . 
Meanwhile the alarm became terrific . 
A Cossack galloped up from the fortress . 
The commotion was general ; Circassians were looked for in every shrub -- and of course none were found . 
Probably , however , a good many people were left with the firm conviction that , if only more courage and despatch had been shown by the garrison , at least a score of brigands would have failed to get away with their lives . 
THIS morning , at the well , the sole topic of conversation was the nocturnal attack by the Circassians . 
I drank the appointed number of glasses of Narzan water , and , after sauntering a few times about the long linden avenue , I met Vera 's husband , who had just arrived from Pyatigorsk . 
He took my arm and we went to the restaurant for breakfast . 
He was dreadfully uneasy about his wife . 
`` What a terrible fright she had last night , '' he said . 
`` Of course , it was bound to happen just at the very time when I was absent . '' 
We sat down to breakfast near the door leading into a corner-room in which about a dozen young men were sitting . 
Grushnitski was amongst them . 
For the second time destiny provided me with the opportunity of overhearing a conversation which was to decide his fate . 
He did not see me , and , consequently , it was impossible for me to suspect him of design ; but that only magnified his fault in my eyes . 
`` Is it possible , though , that they were really Circassians ? '' 
somebody said . 
`` Did anyone see them ? '' 
`` I will tell you the whole truth , '' answered Grushnitski : `` only please do not betray me . 
This is how it was : yesterday , a certain man , whose name I will not tell you , came up to me and told me that , at ten o'clock in the evening , he had seen somebody creeping into the Ligovskis ' house . 
I must observe that Princess Ligovski was here , and Princess Mary at home . 
So he and I set off to wait beneath the windows and waylay the lucky man . '' 
I confess I was frightened , although my companion was very busily engaged with his breakfast : he might have heard things which he would have found rather displeasing , if Grushnitski had happened to guess the truth ; but , blinded by jealousy , the latter did not even suspect it . 
`` So , do you see ? '' 
Grushnitski continued . 
`` We set off , taking with us a gun , loaded with blank cartridge , so as just to give him a fright . 
We waited in the garden till two o'clock . 
At length -- goodness knows , indeed , where he appeared from , but he must have come out by the glass door which is behind the pillar ; it was not out of the window that he came , because the window had remained unopened -- at length , I say , we saw someone getting down from the balcony ... What do you think of Princess Mary -- eh ? 
Well , I admit , it is hardly what you might expect from Moscow ladies ! 
After that what can you believe ? 
We were going to seize him , but he broke away and darted like a hare into the shrubs . 
Thereupon I fired at him . '' 
There was a general murmur of incredulity . 
`` You do not believe it ? '' 
he continued . 
`` I give you my word of honour as a gentleman that it is all perfectly true , and , in proof , I will tell you the man 's name if you like . '' 
`` Tell us , tell us , who was he ? '' 
came from all sides . 
`` Pechorin , '' answered Grushnitski . 
At that moment he raised his eyes -- I was standing in the doorway opposite to him . 
He grew terribly red . 
I went up to him and said , slowly and distinctly : `` I am very sorry that I did not come in before you had given your word of honour in confirmation of a most abominable calumny : my presence would have saved you from that further act of baseness . '' 
Grushnitski jumped up from his seat and seemed about to fly into a passion . 
`` I beg you , '' I continued in the same tone : `` I beg you at once to retract what you have said ; you know very well that it is all an invention . 
I do not think that a woman 's indifference to your brilliant merits should deserve so terrible a revenge . 
Bethink you well : if you maintain your present attitude , you will lose the right to the name of gentleman and will risk your life . '' 
Grushnitski stood before me in violent agitation , his eyes cast down . 
But the struggle between his conscience and his vanity was of short duration . 
The captain of dragoons , who was sitting beside him , nudged him with his elbow . 
Grushnitski started , and answered rapidly , without raising his eyes : `` My dear sir , what I say , I mean , and I am prepared to repeat ... I am not afraid of your menaces and am ready for anything . '' 
`` The latter you have already proved , '' I answered coldly ; and , taking the captain of dragoons by the arm , I left the room . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` You are Grushnitski 's friend and will no doubt be his second ? '' 
The captain bowed very gravely . 
`` You have guessed rightly , '' he answered . 
`` Moreover , I am bound to be his second , because the insult offered to him touches myself also . 
I was with him last night , '' he added , straightening up his stooping figure . 
`` Ah ! 
So it was you whose head I struck so clumsily ? '' 
... He turned yellow in the face , then blue ; suppressed rage was portrayed upon his countenance . 
`` I shall have the honour to send my second to you to-day , '' I added , bowing adieu to him very politely , without appearing to have noticed his fury . 
On the restaurant-steps I met Vera 's husband . 
Apparently he had been waiting for me . 
He seized my hand with a feeling akin to rapture . 
`` Noble young man ! '' 
he said , with tears in his eyes . 
`` I have heard everything . 
What a scoundrel ! 
Ingrate ! 
... Just fancy such people being admitted into a decent household after this ! 
Thank God I have no daughters ! 
But she for whom you are risking your life will reward you . 
Be assured of my constant discretion , '' he continued . 
`` I have been young myself and have served in the army : I know that these affairs must take their course . 
Good-bye . '' 
Poor fellow ! 
He is glad that he has no daughters ! 
... I went straight to Werner , found him at home , and told him the whole story -- my relations with Vera and Princess Mary , and the conversation which I had overheard and from which I had learned the intention of these gentlemen to make a fool of me by causing me to fight a duel with blank cartridges . 
But , now , the affair had gone beyond the bounds of jest ; they probably had not expected that it would turn out like this . 
The doctor consented to be my second ; I gave him a few directions with regard to the conditions of the duel . 
He was to insist upon the affair being managed with all possible secrecy , because , although I am prepared , at any moment , to face death , I am not in the least disposed to spoil for all time my future in this world . 
After that I went home . 
In an hour 's time the doctor returned from his expedition . 
`` There is indeed a conspiracy against you , '' he said . 
`` I found the captain of dragoons at Grushnitski 's , together with another gentleman whose surname I do not remember . 
I stopped a moment in the ante-room , in order to take off my goloshes . 
They were squabbling and making a terrible uproar . 
` On no account will I agree , ' Grushnitski was saying : ` he has insulted me publicly ; it was quite a different thing before ' ... '' ` What does it matter to you ? ' 
answered the captain . ' 
I will take it all upon myself . 
I have been second in five duels , and I should think I know how to arrange the affair . 
I have thought it all out . 
Just let me alone , please . 
It is not a bad thing to give people a bit of a fright . 
And why expose yourself to danger if it is possible to avoid it ? ' 
... `` At that moment I entered the room . 
They suddenly fell silent . 
Our negotiations were somewhat protracted . 
At length we decided the matter as follows : about five versts from here there is a hollow gorge ; they will ride thither tomorrow at four o'clock in the morning , and we shall leave half an hour later . 
You will fire at six paces -- Grushnitski himself demanded that condition . 
Whichever of you is killed -- his death will be put down to the account of the Circassians . 
And now I must tell you what I suspect : they , that is to say the seconds , may have made some change in their former plan and may want to load only Grushnitski 's pistol . 
That is something like murder , but in time of war , and especially in Asiatic warfare , such tricks are allowed . 
Grushnitski , however , seems to be a little more magnanimous than his companions . 
What do you think ? 
Ought we not to let them see that we have guessed their plan ? '' 
`` Not on any account , doctor ! 
Make your mind easy ; I will not give in to them . '' 
`` But what are you going to do , then ? '' 
`` That is my secret . '' 
`` Mind you are not caught ... six paces , you know ! '' 
`` Doctor , I shall expect you to-morrow at four o'clock . 
The horses will be ready ... Goodbye . '' 
I remained in the house until the evening , with my door locked . 
A manservant came to invite me to Princess Ligovski 's -- I bade him say that I was ill . 
***** Two o'clock in the morning ... I can not sleep ... Yet sleep is what I need , if I am to have a steady hand to-morrow . 
However , at six paces it is difficult to miss . 
Aha ! 
Mr. Grushnitski , your wiles will not succeed ! 
... We shall exchange roles : now it is I who shall have to seek the signs of latent terror upon your pallid countenance . 
Why have you yourself appointed these fatal six paces ? 
Think you that I will tamely expose my forehead to your aim ? 
... No , we shall cast lots ... And then -- then -- what if his luck should prevail ? 
If my star at length should betray me ? 
... And little wonder if it did : it has so long and faithfully served my caprices . 
Well ? 
If I must die , I must ! 
The loss to the world will not be great ; and I myself am already downright weary of everything . 
I am like a guest at a ball , who yawns but does not go home to bed , simply because his carriage has not come for him . 
But now the carriage is here ... Good-bye ! 
... My whole past life I live again in memory , and , involuntarily , I ask myself : ` why have I lived -- for what purpose was I born ? ' 
... A purpose there must have been , and , surely , mine was an exalted destiny , because I feel that within my soul are powers immeasurable ... But I was not able to discover that destiny , I allowed myself to be carried away by the allurements of passions , inane and ignoble . 
From their crucible I issued hard and cold as iron , but gone for ever was the glow of noble aspirations -- the fairest flower of life . 
And , from that time forth , how often have I not played the part of an axe in the hands of fate ! 
Like an implement of punishment , I have fallen upon the head of doomed victims , often without malice , always without pity ... To none has my love brought happiness , because I have never sacrificed anything for the sake of those I have loved : for myself alone I have loved -- for my own pleasure . 
I have only satisfied the strange craving of my heart , greedily draining their feelings , their tenderness , their joys , their sufferings -- and I have never been able to sate myself . 
I am like one who , spent with hunger , falls asleep in exhaustion and sees before him sumptuous viands and sparkling wines ; he devours with rapture the aerial gifts of the imagination , and his pains seem somewhat assuaged . 
Let him but awake : the vision vanishes -- twofold hunger and despair remain ! 
And to-morrow , it may be , I shall die ! 
... And there will not be left on earth one being who has understood me completely . 
Some will consider me worse , others , better , than I have been in reality ... Some will say : ` he was a good fellow ' ; others : ' a villain . ' 
And both epithets will be false . 
After all this , is life worth the trouble ? 
And yet we live -- out of curiosity ! 
We expect something new ... How absurd , and yet how vexatious ! 
IT is now a month and a half since I have been in the N -- Fortress . 
Maksim Maksimych is out hunting ... I am alone . 
I am sitting by the window . 
Grey clouds have covered the mountains to the foot ; the sun appears through the mist as a yellow spot . 
It is cold ; the wind is whistling and rocking the shutters ... I am bored ! 
... I will continue my diary which has been interrupted by so many strange events . 
I read the last page over : how ridiculous it seems ! 
... I thought to die ; it was not to be . 
I have not yet drained the cup of suffering , and now I feel that I still have long to live . 
How clearly and how sharply have all these bygone events been stamped upon my memory ! 
Time has not effaced a single line , a single shade . 
I remember that during the night preceding the duel I did not sleep a single moment . 
I was not able to write for long : a secret uneasiness took possession of me . 
For about an hour I paced the room , then I sat down and opened a novel by Walter Scott which was lying on my table . 
It was `` The Scottish Puritans . '' 
-LSB- 301 -RSB- At first I read with an effort ; then , carried away by the magical fiction , I became oblivious of everything else . 
At last day broke . 
My nerves became composed . 
I looked in the glass : a dull pallor covered my face , which preserved the traces of harassing sleeplessness ; but my eyes , although encircled by a brownish shadow , glittered proudly and inexorably . 
I was satisfied with myself . 
I ordered the horses to be saddled , dressed myself , and ran down to the baths . 
Plunging into the cold , sparkling water of the Narzan Spring , I felt my bodily and mental powers returning . 
I left the baths as fresh and hearty as if I was off to a ball . 
After that , who shall say that the soul is not dependent upon the body ! 
... On my return , I found the doctor at my rooms . 
He was wearing grey riding-breeches , a jacket and a Circassian cap . 
I burst out laughing when I saw that little figure under the enormous shaggy cap . 
Werner has a by no means warlike countenance , and on that occasion it was even longer than usual . 
`` Why so sad , doctor ? '' 
I said to him . 
`` Have you not a hundred times , with the greatest indifference , escorted people to the other world ? 
Imagine that I have a bilious fever : I may get well ; also , I may die ; both are in the usual course of things . 
Try to look on me as a patient , afflicted with an illness with which you are still unfamiliar -- and then your curiosity will be aroused in the highest degree . 
You can now make a few important physiological observations upon me ... Is not the expectation of a violent death itself a real illness ? '' 
The doctor was struck by that idea , and he brightened up . 
We mounted our horses . 
Werner clung on to his bridle with both hands , and we set off . 
In a trice we had galloped past the fortress , through the village , and had ridden into the gorge . 
Our winding road was half-overgrown with tall grass and was intersected every moment by a noisy brook , which we had to ford , to the great despair of the doctor , because each time his horse would stop in the water . 
A morning more fresh and blue I can not remember ! 
The sun had scarce shown his face from behind the green summits , and the blending of the first warmth of his rays with the dying coolness of the night produced on all my feelings a sort of sweet languor . 
The joyous beam of the young day had not yet penetrated the gorge ; it gilded only the tops of the cliffs which overhung us on both sides . 
The tufted shrubs , growing in the deep crevices of the cliffs , besprinkled us with a silver shower at the least breath of wind . 
I remember that on that occasion I loved Nature more than ever before . 
With what curiosity did I examine every dewdrop trembling upon the broad vine leaf and reflecting millions of rainbowhued rays ! 
How eagerly did my glance endeavour to penetrate the smoky distance ! 
There the road grew narrower and narrower , the cliffs bluer and more dreadful , and at last they met , it seemed , in an impenetrable wall . 
We rode in silence . 
`` Have you made your will ? '' 
Werner suddenly inquired . 
`` No . '' 
`` And if you are killed ? '' 
`` My heirs will be found of themselves . '' 
`` Is it possible that you have no friends , to whom you would like to send a last farewell ? '' 
... I shook my head . 
`` Is there , really , not one woman in the world to whom you would like to leave some token in remembrance ? '' 
... `` Do you want me to reveal my soul to you , doctor ? '' 
I answered ... `` You see , I have outlived the years when people die with the name of the beloved on their lips and bequeathing to a friend a lock of pomaded -- or unpomaded -- hair . 
When I think that death may be near , I think of myself alone ; others do not even do as much .
