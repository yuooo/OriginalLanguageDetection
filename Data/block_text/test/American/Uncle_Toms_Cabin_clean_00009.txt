If I was to say anything on this slavery matter , I would say out , fair and square , ` We 're in for it ; we 've got 'em , and mean to keep 'em , -- it 's for our convenience and our interest ; ' for that 's the long and short of it , -- that 's just the whole of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to , after all ; and I think that it will be intelligible to everybody , everywhere . '' 
`` I do think , Augustine , you are so irreverent ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` I think it 's shocking to hear you talk . '' 
`` Shocking ! 
it 's the truth . 
This religious talk on such matters , -- why do n't they carry it a little further , and show the beauty , in its season , of a fellow 's taking a glass too much , and sitting a little too late over his cards , and various providential arrangements of that sort , which are pretty frequent among us young men ; -- we 'd like to hear that those are right and godly , too . '' 
`` Well , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` do you think slavery right or wrong ? '' 
`` I 'm not going to have any of your horrid New England directness , cousin , '' said St. Clare , gayly . 
`` If I answer that question , I know you 'll be at me with half a dozen others , each one harder than the last ; and I 'm not a going to define my position . 
I am one of the sort that lives by throwing stones at other people 's glass houses , but I never mean to put up one for them to stone . '' 
`` That 's just the way he 's always talking , '' said Marie ; `` you ca n't get any satisfaction out of him . 
I believe it 's just because he do n't like religion , that he 's always running out in this way he 's been doing . '' 
`` Religion ! '' 
said St. Clare , in a tone that made both ladies look at him . 
`` Religion ! 
Is what you hear at church , religion ? 
Is that which can bend and turn , and descend and ascend , to fit every crooked phase of selfish , worldly society , religion ? 
Is that religion which is less scrupulous , less generous , less just , less considerate for man , than even my own ungodly , worldly , blinded nature ? 
No ! 
When I look for a religion , I must look for something above me , and not something beneath . '' 
`` Then you do n't believe that the Bible justifies slavery , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` The Bible was my mother 's book , '' said St. Clare . 
`` By it she lived and died , and I would be very sorry to think it did . 
I 'd as soon desire to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy , chew tobacco , and swear , by way of satisfying me that I did right in doing the same . 
It would n't make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself , and it would take from me the comfort of respecting her ; and it really is a comfort , in this world , to have anything one can respect . 
In short , you see , '' said he , suddenly resuming his gay tone , `` all I want is that different things be kept in different boxes . 
The whole frame-work of society , both in Europe and America , is made up of various things which will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality . 
It 's pretty generally understood that men do n't aspire after the absolute right , but only to do about as well as the rest of the world . 
Now , when any one speaks up , like a man , and says slavery is necessary to us , we ca n't get along without it , we should be beggared if we give it up , and , of course , we mean to hold on to it , -- this is strong , clear , well-defined language ; it has the respectability of truth to it ; and , if we may judge by their practice , the majority of the world will bear us out in it . 
But when he begins to put on a long face , and snuffle , and quote Scripture , I incline to think he is n't much better than he should be . '' 
`` You are very uncharitable , '' said Marie . 
`` Well , '' said St. Clare , `` suppose that something should bring down the price of cotton once and forever , and make the whole slave property a drug in the market , do n't you think we should soon have another version of the Scripture doctrine ? 
What a flood of light would pour into the church , all at once , and how immediately it would be discovered that everything in the Bible and reason went the other way ! '' 
`` Well , at any rate , '' said Marie , as she reclined herself on a lounge , `` I 'm thankful I 'm born where slavery exists ; and I believe it 's right , -- indeed , I feel it must be ; and , at any rate , I 'm sure I could n't get along without it . '' 
`` I say , what do you think , Pussy ? '' 
said her father to Eva , who came in at this moment , with a flower in her hand . 
`` What about , papa ? '' 
`` Why , which do you like the best , -- to live as they do at your uncle 's , up in Vermont , or to have a house-full of servants , as we do ? '' 
`` O , of course , our way is the pleasantest , '' said Eva . 
`` Why so ? '' 
said St. Clare , stroking her head . 
`` Why , it makes so many more round you to love , you know , '' said Eva , looking up earnestly . 
`` Now , that 's just like Eva , '' said Marie ; `` just one of her odd speeches . '' 
`` Is it an odd speech , papa ? '' 
said Eva , whisperingly , as she got upon his knee . 
`` Rather , as this world goes , Pussy , '' said St. Clare . 
`` But where has my little Eva been , all dinner-time ? '' 
`` O , I 've been up in Tom 's room , hearing him sing , and Aunt Dinah gave me my dinner . '' 
`` Hearing Tom sing , hey ? '' 
`` O , yes ! 
he sings such beautiful things about the New Jerusalem , and bright angels , and the land of Canaan . '' 
`` I dare say ; it 's better than the opera , is n't it ? '' 
`` Yes , and he 's going to teach them to me . '' 
`` Singing lessons , hey ? 
-- you are coming on . '' 
`` Yes , he sings for me , and I read to him in my Bible ; and he explains what it means , you know . '' 
`` On my word , '' said Marie , laughing , `` that is the latest joke of the season . '' 
`` Tom is n't a bad hand , now , at explaining Scripture , I 'll dare swear , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Tom has a natural genius for religion . 
I wanted the horses out early , this morning , and I stole up to Tom 's cubiculum there , over the stables , and there I heard him holding a meeting by himself ; and , in fact , I have n't heard anything quite so savory as Tom 's prayer , this some time . 
He put in for me , with a zeal that was quite apostolic . '' 
`` Perhaps he guessed you were listening . 
I 've heard of that trick before . '' 
`` If he did , he was n't very polite ; for he gave the Lord his opinion of me , pretty freely . 
Tom seemed to think there was decidedly room for improvement in me , and seemed very earnest that I should be converted . '' 
`` I hope you 'll lay it to heart , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I suppose you are much of the same opinion , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Well , we shall see , -- sha n't we , Eva ? '' 
There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house , as the afternoon drew to a close . 
Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro , collecting from her household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass , for the wanderers who were to go forth that night . 
The afternoon shadows stretched eastward , and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon , and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed-room where George and his wife were sitting . 
He was sitting with his child on his knee , and his wife 's hand in his . 
Both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks . 
`` Yes , Eliza , '' said George , `` I know all you say is true . 
You are a good child , -- a great deal better than I am ; and I will try to do as you say . 
I 'll try to act worthy of a free man . 
I 'll try to feel like a Christian . 
God Almighty knows that I 've meant to do well , -- tried hard to do well , -- when everything has been against me ; and now I 'll forget all the past , and put away every hard and bitter feeling , and read my Bible , and learn to be a good man . '' 
`` And when we get to Canada , '' said Eliza , `` I can help you . 
I can do dress-making very well ; and I understand fine washing and ironing ; and between us we can find something to live on . '' 
`` Yes , Eliza , so long as we have each other and our boy . 
O ! 
Eliza , if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his wife and child belong to him ! 
I 've often wondered to see men that could call their wives and children their own fretting and worrying about anything else . 
Why , I feel rich and strong , though we have nothing but our bare hands . 
I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for any more . 
Yes , though I 've worked hard every day , till I am twenty-five years old , and have not a cent of money , nor a roof to cover me , nor a spot of land to call my own , yet , if they will only let me alone now , I will be satisfied , -- thankful ; I will work , and send back the money for you and my boy . 
As to my old master , he has been paid five times over for all he ever spent for me . 
I do n't owe him anything . '' 
`` But yet we are not quite out of danger , '' said Eliza ; `` we are not yet in Canada . '' 
`` True , '' said George , `` but it seems as if I smelt the free air , and it makes me strong . '' 
At this moment , voices were heard in the outer apartment , in earnest conversation , and very soon a rap was heard on the door . 
Eliza started and opened it . 
Simeon Halliday was there , and with him a Quaker brother , whom he introduced as Phineas Fletcher . 
Phineas was tall and lathy , red-haired , with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face . 
He had not the placid , quiet , unworldly air of Simeon Halliday ; on the contrary , a particularly wide-awake and au fait appearance , like a man who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about , and keeping a bright lookout ahead ; peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his broad brim and formal phraseology . 
`` Our friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party , George , '' said Simeon ; `` it were well for thee to hear it . '' 
`` That I have , '' said Phineas , `` and it shows the use of a man 's always sleeping with one ear open , in certain places , as I 've always said . 
Last night I stopped at a little lone tavern , back on the road . 
Thee remembers the place , Simeon , where we sold some apples , last year , to that fat woman , with the great ear-rings . 
Well , I was tired with hard driving ; and , after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner , and pulled a buffalo over me , to wait till my bed was ready ; and what does I do , but get fast asleep . '' 
`` With one ear open , Phineas ? '' 
said Simeon , quietly . 
`` No ; I slept , ears and all , for an hour or two , for I was pretty well tired ; but when I came to myself a little , I found that there were some men in the room , sitting round a table , drinking and talking ; and I thought , before I made much muster , I 'd just see what they were up to , especially as I heard them say something about the Quakers . 
` So , ' says one , ` they are up in the Quaker settlement , no doubt , ' says he . 
Then I listened with both ears , and I found that they were talking about this very party . 
So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans . 
This young man , they said , was to be sent back to Kentucky , to his master , who was going to make an example of him , to keep all niggers from running away ; and his wife two of them were going to run down to New Orleans to sell , on their own account , and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollars for her ; and the child , they said , was going to a trader , who had bought him ; and then there was the boy , Jim , and his mother , they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky . 
They said that there were two constables , in a town a little piece ahead , who would go in with 'em to get 'em taken up , and the young woman was to be taken before a judge ; and one of the fellows , who is small and smooth-spoken , was to swear to her for his property , and get her delivered over to him to take south . 
They 've got a right notion of the track we are going tonight ; and they 'll be down after us , six or eight strong . 
So now , what 's to be done ? '' 
The group that stood in various attitudes , after this communication , were worthy of a painter . 
Rachel Halliday , who had taken her hands out of a batch of biscuit , to hear the news , stood with them upraised and floury , and with a face of the deepest concern . 
Simeon looked profoundly thoughtful ; Eliza had thrown her arms around her husband , and was looking up to him . 
George stood with clenched hands and glowing eyes , and looking as any other man might look , whose wife was to be sold at auction , and son sent to a trader , all under the shelter of a Christian nation 's laws . 
`` What shall we do , George ? '' 
said Eliza faintly . 
`` I know what I shall do , '' said George , as he stepped into the little room , and began examining pistols . 
`` Ay , ay , '' said Phineas , nodding his head to Simeon ; `` thou seest , Simeon , how it will work . '' 
`` I see , '' said Simeon , sighing ; `` I pray it come not to that . '' 
`` I do n't want to involve any one with or for me , '' said George . 
`` If you will lend me your vehicle and direct me , I will drive alone to the next stand . 
Jim is a giant in strength , and brave as death and despair , and so am I. '' `` Ah , well , friend , '' said Phineas , `` but thee 'll need a driver , for all that . 
Thee 's quite welcome to do all the fighting , thee knows ; but I know a thing or two about the road , that thee does n't . '' 
`` But I do n't want to involve you , '' said George . 
`` Involve , '' said Phineas , with a curious and keen expression of face , `` When thee does involve me , please to let me know . '' 
`` Phineas is a wise and skilful man , '' said Simeon . 
`` Thee does well , George , to abide by his judgment ; and , '' he added , laying his hand kindly on George 's shoulder , and pointing to the pistols , `` be not over hasty with these , -- young blood is hot . '' 
`` I will attack no man , '' said George . 
`` All I ask of this country is to be let alone , and I will go out peaceably ; but , '' -- he paused , and his brow darkened and his face worked , -- `` I 've had a sister sold in that New Orleans market . 
I know what they are sold for ; and am I going to stand by and see them take my wife and sell her , when God has given me a pair of strong arms to defend her ? 
No ; God help me ! 
I 'll fight to the last breath , before they shall take my wife and son . 
Can you blame me ? '' 
`` Mortal man can not blame thee , George . 
Flesh and blood could not do otherwise , '' said Simeon . 
`` Woe unto the world because of offences , but woe unto them through whom the offence cometh . '' 
`` Would not even you , sir , do the same , in my place ? '' 
`` I pray that I be not tried , '' said Simeon ; `` the flesh is weak . '' 
`` I think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong , in such a case , '' said Phineas , stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a windmill . 
`` I a n't sure , friend George , that I should n't hold a fellow for thee , if thee had any accounts to settle with him . '' 
`` If man should ever resist evil , '' said Simeon , `` then George should feel free to do it now : but the leaders of our people taught a more excellent way ; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God ; but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man , and none can receive it save they to whom it is given . 
Let us pray the Lord that we be not tempted . '' 
`` And so I do , '' said Phineas ; `` but if we are tempted too much -- why , let them look out , that 's all . '' 
`` It 's quite plain thee was n't born a Friend , '' said Simeon , smiling . 
`` The old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet . '' 
To tell the truth , Phineas had been a hearty , two-fisted backwoodsman , a vigorous hunter , and a dead shot at a buck ; but , having wooed a pretty Quakeress , had been moved by the power of her charms to join the society in his neighborhood ; and though he was an honest , sober , and efficient member , and nothing particular could be alleged against him , yet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of savor in his developments . 
`` Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his own , '' said Rachel Halliday , smiling ; `` but we all think that his heart is in the right place , after all . '' 
`` Well , '' said George , `` is n't it best that we hasten our flight ? '' 
`` I got up at four o'clock , and came on with all speed , full two or three hours ahead of them , if they start at the time they planned . 
It is n't safe to start till dark , at any rate ; for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead , that might be disposed to meddle with us , if they saw our wagon , and that would delay us more than the waiting ; but in two hours I think we may venture . 
I will go over to Michael Cross , and engage him to come behind on his swift nag , and keep a bright lookout on the road , and warn us if any company of men come on . 
Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses ; and he could shoot ahead and let us know , if there were any danger . 
I am going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness , and to see about the horse . 
We have a pretty fair start , and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us . 
So , have good courage , friend George ; this is n't the first ugly scrape that I 've been in with thy people , '' said Phineas , as he closed the door . 
`` Phineas is pretty shrewd , '' said Simeon . 
`` He will do the best that can be done for thee , George . '' 
`` All I am sorry for , '' said George , `` is the risk to you . '' 
`` Thee 'll much oblige us , friend George , to say no more about that . 
What we do we are conscience bound to do ; we can do no other way . 
And now , mother , '' said he , turning to Rachel , `` hurry thy preparations for these friends , for we must not send them away fasting . '' 
And while Rachel and her children were busy making corn-cake , and cooking ham and chicken , and hurrying on the et ceteras of the evening meal , George and his wife sat in their little room , with their arms folded about each other , in such talk as husband and wife have when they know that a few hours may part them forever . 
`` Eliza , '' said George , `` people that have friends , and houses , and lands , and money , and all those things ca n't love as we do , who have nothing but each other . 
Till I knew you , Eliza , no creature had loved me , but my poor , heart-broken mother and sister . 
I saw poor Emily that morning the trader carried her off . 
She came to the corner where I was lying asleep , and said , ` Poor George , your last friend is going . 
What will become of you , poor boy ? ' 
And I got up and threw my arms round her , and cried and sobbed , and she cried too ; and those were the last kind words I got for ten long years ; and my heart all withered up , and felt as dry as ashes , till I met you . 
And your loving me , -- why , it was almost like raising one from the dead ! 
I 've been a new man ever since ! 
And now , Eliza , I 'll give my last drop of blood , but they shall not take you from me . 
Whoever gets you must walk over my dead body . '' 
`` O , Lord , have mercy ! '' 
said Eliza , sobbing . 
`` If he will only let us get out of this country together , that is all we ask . '' 
`` Is God on their side ? '' 
said George , speaking less to his wife than pouring out his own bitter thoughts . 
`` Does he see all they do ? 
Why does he let such things happen ? 
And they tell us that the Bible is on their side ; certainly all the power is . 
They are rich , and healthy , and happy ; they are members of churches , expecting to go to heaven ; and they get along so easy in the world , and have it all their own way ; and poor , honest , faithful Christians , -- Christians as good or better than they , -- are lying in the very dust under their feet . 
They buy 'em and sell 'em , and make trade of their heart 's blood , and groans and tears , -- and God lets them . '' 
`` Friend George , '' said Simeon , from the kitchen , `` listen to this Psalm ; it may do thee good . '' 
George drew his seat near the door , and Eliza , wiping her tears , came forward also to listen , while Simeon read as follows : `` But as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well-nigh slipped . 
For I was envious of the foolish , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked . 
They are not in trouble like other men , neither are they plagued like other men . 
Therefore , pride compasseth them as a chain ; violence covereth them as a garment . 
Their eyes stand out with fatness ; they have more than heart could wish . 
They are corrupt , and speak wickedly concerning oppression ; they speak loftily . 
Therefore his people return , and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them , and they say , How doth God know ? 
and is there knowledge in the Most High ? '' 
`` Is not that the way thee feels , George ? '' 
`` It is so indeed , '' said George , -- `` as well as I could have written it myself . '' 
`` Then , hear , '' said Simeon : `` When I thought to know this , it was too painful for me until I went unto the sanctuary of God . 
Then understood I their end . 
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places , thou castedst them down to destruction . 
As a dream when one awaketh , so , oh Lord , when thou awakest , thou shalt despise their image . 
Nevertheless I am continually with thee ; thou hast holden me by my right hand . 
Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel , and afterwards receive me to glory . 
It is good for me to draw near unto God . 
I have put my trust in the Lord God . '' 
* * Ps . 
73 , `` The End of the Wicked contrasted with that of the Righteous . '' 
The words of holy trust , breathed by the friendly old man , stole like sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of George ; and after he ceased , he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine features . 
`` If this world were all , George , '' said Simeon , `` thee might , indeed , ask where is the Lord ? 
But it is often those who have least of all in this life whom he chooseth for the kingdom . 
Put thy trust in him and , no matter what befalls thee here , he will make all right hereafter . '' 
If these words had been spoken by some easy , self-indulgent exhorter , from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical flourish , proper to be used to people in distress , perhaps they might not have had much effect ; but coming from one who daily and calmly risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of God and man , they had a weight that could not but be felt , and both the poor , desolate fugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it . 
And now Rachel took Eliza 's hand kindly , and led the way to the supper-table . 
As they were sitting down , a light tap sounded at the door , and Ruth entered . 
`` I just ran in , '' she said , `` with these little stockings for the boy , -- three pair , nice , warm woollen ones . 
It will be so cold , thee knows , in Canada . 
Does thee keep up good courage , Eliza ? '' 
she added , tripping round to Eliza 's side of the table , and shaking her warmly by the hand , and slipping a seed-cake into Harry 's hand . 
`` I brought a little parcel of these for him , '' she said , tugging at her pocket to get out the package . 
`` Children , thee knows , will always be eating . '' 
`` O , thank you ; you are too kind , '' said Eliza . 
`` Come , Ruth , sit down to supper , '' said Rachel . 
`` I could n't , any way . 
I left John with the baby , and some biscuits in the oven ; and I ca n't stay a moment , else John will burn up all the biscuits , and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl . 
That 's the way he does , '' said the little Quakeress , laughing . 
`` So , good-by , Eliza ; good-by , George ; the Lord grant thee a safe journey ; '' and , with a few tripping steps , Ruth was out of the apartment . 
A little while after supper , a large covered-wagon drew up before the door ; the night was clear starlight ; and Phineas jumped briskly down from his seat to arrange his passengers . 
George walked out of the door , with his child on one arm and his wife on the other . 
His step was firm , his face settled and resolute . 
Rachel and Simeon came out after them . 
`` You get out , a moment , '' said Phineas to those inside , `` and let me fix the back of the wagon , there , for the women-folks and the boy . '' 
`` Here are the two buffaloes , '' said Rachel . 
`` Make the seats as comfortable as may be ; it 's hard riding all night . '' 
Jim came out first , and carefully assisted out his old mother , who clung to his arm , and looked anxiously about , as if she expected the pursuer every moment . 
`` Jim , are your pistols all in order ? '' 
said George , in a low , firm voice . 
`` Yes , indeed , '' said Jim . 
`` And you 've no doubt what you shall do , if they come ? '' 
`` I rather think I have n't , '' said Jim , throwing open his broad chest , and taking a deep breath . 
`` Do you think I 'll let them get mother again ? '' 
During this brief colloquy , Eliza had been taking her leave of her kind friend , Rachel , and was handed into the carriage by Simeon , and , creeping into the back part with her boy , sat down among the buffalo-skins . 
The old woman was next handed in and seated and George and Jim placed on a rough board seat front of them , and Phineas mounted in front . 
`` Farewell , my friends , '' said Simeon , from without . 
`` God bless you ! '' 
answered all from within . 
And the wagon drove off , rattling and jolting over the frozen road . 
There was no opportunity for conversation , on account of the roughness of the way and the noise of the wheels . 
The vehicle , therefore , rumbled on , through long , dark stretches of woodland , -- over wide dreary plains , -- up hills , and down valleys , -- and on , on , on they jogged , hour after hour . 
The child soon fell asleep , and lay heavily in his mother 's lap . 
The poor , frightened old woman at last forgot her fears ; and , even Eliza , as the night waned , found all her anxieties insufficient to keep her eyes from closing . 
Phineas seemed , on the whole , the briskest of the company , and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very unquaker-like songs , as he went on . 
But about three o'clock George 's ear caught the hasty and decided click of a horse 's hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged Phineas by the elbow . 
Phineas pulled up his horses , and listened . 
`` That must be Michael , '' he said ; `` I think I know the sound of his gallop ; '' and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the road . 
A man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant hill . 
`` There he is , I do believe ! '' 
said Phineas . 
George and Jim both sprang out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing . 
All stood intensely silent , with their faces turned towards the expected messenger . 
On he came . 
Now he went down into a valley , where they could not see him ; but they heard the sharp , hasty tramp , rising nearer and nearer ; at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence , within hail . 
`` Yes , that 's Michael ! '' 
said Phineas ; and , raising his voice , `` Halloa , there , Michael ! '' 
`` Phineas ! 
is that thee ? '' 
`` Yes ; what news -- they coming ? '' 
`` Right on behind , eight or ten of them , hot with brandy , swearing and foaming like so many wolves . '' 
And , just as he spoke , a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping horsemen towards them . 
`` In with you , -- quick , boys , in ! '' 
said Phineas . 
`` If you must fight , wait till I get you a piece ahead . '' 
And , with the word , both jumped in , and Phineas lashed the horses to a run , the horseman keeping close beside them . 
The wagon rattled , jumped , almost flew , over the frozen ground ; but plainer , and still plainer , came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind . 
The women heard it , and , looking anxiously out , saw , far in the rear , on the brow of a distant hill , a party of men looming up against the red-streaked sky of early dawn . 
Another hill , and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon , whose white cloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance , and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind . 
Eliza sickened , and strained her child closer to her bosom ; the old woman prayed and groaned , and George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair . 
The pursuers gained on them fast ; the carriage made a sudden turn , and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock , that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot , which was , all around it , quite clear and smooth . 
This isolated pile , or range of rocks , rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky , and seemed to promise shelter and concealment . 
It was a place well known to Phineas , who had been familiar with the spot in his hunting days ; and it was to gain this point he had been racing his horses . 
`` Now for it ! '' 
said he , suddenly checking his horses , and springing from his seat to the ground . 
`` Out with you , in a twinkling , every one , and up into these rocks with me . 
Michael , thee tie thy horse to the wagon , and drive ahead to Amariah 's and get him and his boys to come back and talk to these fellows . '' 
In a twinkling they were all out of the carriage . 
`` There , '' said Phineas , catching up Harry , `` you , each of you , see to the women ; and run , now if you ever did run ! '' 
They needed no exhortation . 
Quicker than we can say it , the whole party were over the fence , making with all speed for the rocks , while Michael , throwing himself from his horse , and fastening the bridle to the wagon , began driving it rapidly away . 
`` Come ahead , '' said Phineas , as they reached the rocks , and saw in the mingled starlight and dawn , the traces of a rude but plainly marked foot-path leading up among them ; `` this is one of our old hunting-dens . 
Come up ! '' 
Phineas went before , springing up the rocks like a goat , with the boy in his arms . 
Jim came second , bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder , and George and Eliza brought up the rear . 
The party of horsemen came up to the fence , and , with mingled shouts and oaths , were dismounting , to prepare to follow them . 
A few moments ' scrambling brought them to the top of the ledge ; the path then passed between a narrow defile , where only one could walk at a time , till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth , and beyond which lay a pile of rocks , separate from the rest of the ledge , standing full thirty feet high , with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle . 
Phineas easily leaped the chasm , and sat down the boy on a smooth , flat platform of crisp white moss , that covered the top of the rock . 
`` Over with you ! '' 
he called ; `` spring , now , once , for your lives ! '' 
said he , as one after another sprang across . 
Several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breast-work , which sheltered their position from the observation of those below . 
`` Well , here we all are , '' said Phineas , peeping over the stone breast-work to watch the assailants , who were coming tumultuously up under the rocks . 
`` Let 'em get us , if they can . 
Whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks , in fair range of your pistols , boys , d'ye see ? '' 
`` I do see , '' said George ! 
`` and now , as this matter is ours , let us take all the risk , and do all the fighting . '' 
`` Thee 's quite welcome to do the fighting , George , '' said Phineas , chewing some checkerberry-leaves as he spoke ; `` but I may have the fun of looking on , I suppose . 
But see , these fellows are kinder debating down there , and looking up , like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost . 
Had n't thee better give 'em a word of advice , before they come up , just to tell 'em handsomely they 'll be shot if they do ? '' 
The party beneath , now more apparent in the light of the dawn , consisted of our old acquaintances , Tom Loker and Marks , with two constables , and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of niggers . 
`` Well , Tom , yer coons are farly treed , '' said one . 
`` Yes , I see 'em go up right here , '' said Tom ; `` and here 's a path . 
I 'm for going right up . 
They ca n't jump down in a hurry , and it wo n't take long to ferret 'em out . '' 
`` But , Tom , they might fire at us from behind the rocks , '' said Marks . 
`` That would be ugly , you know . '' 
`` Ugh ! '' 
said Tom , with a sneer . 
`` Always for saving your skin , Marks ! 
No danger ! 
niggers are too plaguy scared ! '' 
`` I do n't know why I should n't save my skin , '' said Marks . 
`` It 's the best I 've got ; and niggers do fight like the devil , sometimes . '' 
At this moment , George appeared on the top of a rock above them , and , speaking in a calm , clear voice , said , `` Gentlemen , who are you , down there , and what do you want ? '' 
`` We want a party of runaway niggers , '' said Tom Loker . 
`` One George Harris , and Eliza Harris , and their son , and Jim Selden , and an old woman . 
We 've got the officers , here , and a warrant to take 'em ; and we 're going to have 'em , too . 
D'ye hear ? 
A n't you George Harris , that belongs to Mr. Harris , of Shelby county , Kentucky ? '' 
`` I am George Harris . 
A Mr. Harris , of Kentucky , did call me his property . 
But now I 'm a free man , standing on God 's free soil ; and my wife and my child I claim as mine . 
Jim and his mother are here . 
We have arms to defend ourselves , and we mean to do it . 
You can come up , if you like ; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man , and the next , and the next ; and so on till the last . '' 
`` O , come ! 
come ! '' 
said a short , puffy man , stepping forward , and blowing his nose as he did so . 
`` Young man , this a n't no kind of talk at all for you . 
You see , we 're officers of justice . 
We 've got the law on our side , and the power , and so forth ; so you 'd better give up peaceably , you see ; for you 'll certainly have to give up , at last . '' 
`` I know very well that you 've got the law on your side , and the power , '' said George , bitterly . 
`` You mean to take my wife to sell in New Orleans , and put my boy like a calf in a trader 's pen , and send Jim 's old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before , because he could n't abuse her son . 
You want to send Jim and me back to be whipped and tortured , and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters ; and your laws will bear you out in it , -- more shame for you and them ! 
But you have n't got us . 
We do n't own your laws ; we do n't own your country ; we stand here as free , under God 's sky , as you are ; and , by the great God that made us , we 'll fight for our liberty till we die . '' 
George stood out in fair sight , on the top of the rock , as he made his declaration of independence ; the glow of dawn gave a flush to his swarthy cheek , and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark eye ; and , as if appealing from man to the justice of God , he raised his hand to heaven as he spoke . 
If it had been only a Hungarian youth , now bravely defending in some mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from Austria into America , this would have been sublime heroism ; but as it was a youth of African descent , defending the retreat of fugitives through America into Canada , of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any heroism in it ; and if any of our readers do , they must do it on their own private responsibility . 
When despairing Hungarian fugitives make their way , against all the search-warrants and authorities of their lawful government , to America , press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome . 
When despairing African fugitives do the same thing , -- it is -- what is it ? 
Be it as it may , it is certain that the attitude , eye , voice , manner , of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence . 
There is something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature . 
Marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched . 
He was deliberately cocking his pistol , and , in the momentary silence that followed George 's speech , he fired at him . 
`` Ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in Kentucky , '' he said coolly , as he wiped his pistol on his coat-sleeve . 
George sprang backward , -- Eliza uttered a shriek , -- the ball had passed close to his hair , had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife , and struck in the tree above . 
`` It 's nothing , Eliza , '' said George , quickly . 
`` Thee 'd better keep out of sight , with thy speechifying , '' said Phineas ; `` they 're mean scamps . '' 
`` Now , Jim , '' said George , `` look that your pistols are all right , and watch that pass with me . 
The first man that shows himself I fire at ; you take the second , and so on . 
It wo n't do , you know , to waste two shots on one . '' 
`` But what if you do n't hit ? '' 
`` I shall hit , '' said George , coolly . 
`` Good ! 
now , there 's stuff in that fellow , '' muttered Phineas , between his teeth . 
The party below , after Marks had fired , stood , for a moment , rather undecided . 
`` I think you must have hit some on 'em , '' said one of the men . 
`` I heard a squeal ! '' 
`` I 'm going right up for one , '' said Tom . 
`` I never was afraid of niggers , and I a n't going to be now . 
Who goes after ? '' 
he said , springing up the rocks . 
George heard the words distinctly . 
He drew up his pistol , examined it , pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would appear . 
One of the most courageous of the party followed Tom , and , the way being thus made , the whole party began pushing up the rock , -- the hindermost pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of themselves . 
On they came , and in a moment the burly form of Tom appeared in sight , almost at the verge of the chasm . 
George fired , -- the shot entered his side , -- but , though wounded , he would not retreat , but , with a yell like that of a mad bull , he was leaping right across the chasm into the party . 
`` Friend , '' said Phineas , suddenly stepping to the front , and meeting him with a push from his long arms , `` thee is n't wanted here . '' 
Down he fell into the chasm , crackling down among trees , bushes , logs , loose stones , till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below . 
The fall might have killed him , had it not been broken and moderated by his clothes catching in the branches of a large tree ; but he came down with some force , however , -- more than was at all agreeable or convenient . 
`` Lord help us , they are perfect devils ! '' 
said Marks , heading the retreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the ascent , while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him , -- the fat constable , in particular , blowing and puffing in a very energetic manner . 
`` I say , fellers , '' said Marks , `` you jist go round and pick up Tom , there , while I run and get on to my horse to go back for help , -- that 's you ; '' and , without minding the hootings and jeers of his company , Marks was as good as his word , and was soon seen galloping away . 
`` Was ever such a sneaking varmint ? '' 
said one of the men ; `` to come on his business , and he clear out and leave us this yer way ! '' 
`` Well , we must pick up that feller , '' said another . 
`` Cuss me if I much care whether he is dead or alive . '' 
The men , led by the groans of Tom , scrambled and crackled through stumps , logs and bushes , to where that hero lay groaning and swearing with alternate vehemence . 
`` Ye keep it agoing pretty loud , Tom , '' said one . 
`` Ye much hurt ? '' 
`` Do n't know . 
Get me up , ca n't ye ? 
Blast that infernal Quaker ! 
If it had n't been for him , I 'd a pitched some on 'em down here , to see how they liked it . '' 
With much labor and groaning , the fallen hero was assisted to rise ; and , with one holding him up under each shoulder , they got him as far as the horses . 
`` If you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern . 
Give me a handkerchief or something , to stuff into this place , and stop this infernal bleeding . '' 
George looked over the rocks , and saw them trying to lift the burly form of Tom into the saddle . 
After two or three ineffectual attempts , he reeled , and fell heavily to the ground . 
`` O , I hope he is n't killed ! '' 
said Eliza , who , with all the party , stood watching the proceeding . 
`` Why not ? '' 
said Phineas ; `` serves him right . '' 
`` Because after death comes the judgment , '' said Eliza . 
`` Yes , '' said the old woman , who had been groaning and praying , in her Methodist fashion , during all the encounter , `` it 's an awful case for the poor crittur 's soul . '' 
`` On my word , they 're leaving him , I do believe , '' said Phineas . 
It was true ; for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation , the whole party got on their horses and rode away . 
When they were quite out of sight , Phineas began to bestir himself . 
`` Well , we must go down and walk a piece , '' he said . 
`` I told Michael to go forward and bring help , and be along back here with the wagon ; but we shall have to walk a piece along the road , I reckon , to meet them . 
The Lord grant he be along soon ! 
It 's early in the day ; there wo n't be much travel afoot yet a while ; we a n't much more than two miles from our stopping-place . 
If the road had n't been so rough last night , we could have outrun 'em entirely . '' 
As the party neared the fence , they discovered in the distance , along the road , their own wagon coming back , accompanied by some men on horseback . 
`` Well , now , there 's Michael , and Stephen and Amariah , '' exclaimed Phineas , joyfully . 
`` Now we are made -- as safe as if we 'd got there . '' 
`` Well , do stop , then , '' said Eliza , `` and do something for that poor man ; he 's groaning dreadfully . '' 
`` It would be no more than Christian , '' said George ; `` let 's take him up and carry him on . '' 
`` And doctor him up among the Quakers ! '' 
said Phineas ; `` pretty well , that ! 
Well , I do n't care if we do . 
Here , let 's have a look at him ; '' and Phineas , who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had acquired some rude experience of surgery , kneeled down by the wounded man , and began a careful examination of his condition . 
`` Marks , '' said Tom , feebly , `` is that you , Marks ? '' 
`` No ; I reckon ` ta n't friend , '' said Phineas . 
`` Much Marks cares for thee , if his own skin 's safe . 
He 's off , long ago . '' 
`` I believe I 'm done for , '' said Tom . 
`` The cussed sneaking dog , to leave me to die alone ! 
My poor old mother always told me ' t would be so . '' 
`` La sakes ! 
jist hear the poor crittur . 
He 's got a mammy , now , '' said the old negress . 
`` I ca n't help kinder pityin ' on him . '' 
`` Softly , softly ; do n't thee snap and snarl , friend , '' said Phineas , as Tom winced and pushed his hand away . 
`` Thee has no chance , unless I stop the bleeding . '' 
And Phineas busied himself with making some off-hand surgical arrangements with his own pocket-handkerchief , and such as could be mustered in the company . 
`` You pushed me down there , '' said Tom , faintly . 
`` Well if I had n't thee would have pushed us down , thee sees , '' said Phineas , as he stooped to apply his bandage . 
`` There , there , -- let me fix this bandage . 
We mean well to thee ; we bear no malice . 
Thee shall be taken to a house where they 'll nurse thee first rate , well as thy own mother could . '' 
Tom groaned , and shut his eyes . 
In men of his class , vigor and resolution are entirely a physical matter , and ooze out with the flowing of the blood ; and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his helplessness . 
The other party now came up . 
The seats were taken out of the wagon . 
The buffalo-skins , doubled in fours , were spread all along one side , and four men , with great difficulty , lifted the heavy form of Tom into it . 
Before he was gotten in , he fainted entirely . 
The old negress , in the abundance of her compassion , sat down on the bottom , and took his head in her lap . 
Eliza , George and Jim , bestowed themselves , as well as they could , in the remaining space and the whole party set forward . 
`` What do you think of him ? '' 
said George , who sat by Phineas in front . 
`` Well it 's only a pretty deep flesh-wound ; but , then , tumbling and scratching down that place did n't help him much . 
It has bled pretty freely , -- pretty much drained him out , courage and all , -- but he 'll get over it , and may be learn a thing or two by it . '' 
`` I 'm glad to hear you say so , '' said George . 
`` It would always be a heavy thought to me , if I 'd caused his death , even in a just cause . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Phineas , `` killing is an ugly operation , any way they 'll fix it , -- man or beast . 
I 've seen a buck that was shot down and a dying , look that way on a feller with his eye , that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him ; and human creatures is a more serious consideration yet , bein ' , as thy wife says , that the judgment comes to 'em after death . 
So I do n't know as our people 's notions on these matters is too strict ; and , considerin ' how I was raised , I fell in with them pretty considerably . '' 
`` What shall you do with this poor fellow ? '' 
said George . 
`` O , carry him along to Amariah 's . 
There 's old Grandmam Stephens there , -- Dorcas , they call her , -- she 's most an amazin ' nurse . 
She takes to nursing real natural , and a n't never better suited than when she gets a sick body to tend . 
We may reckon on turning him over to her for a fortnight or so . '' 
A ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse , where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast . 
Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying . 
His wound was carefully dressed and bandaged , and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick room , like a weary child . 
And here , for the present , we shall take our leave of one party . 
Our friend Tom , in his own simple musings , often compared his more fortunate lot , in the bondage into which he was cast , with that of Joseph in Egypt ; and , in fact , as time went on , and he developed more and more under the eye of his master , the strength of the parallel increased . 
St. Clare was indolent and careless of money . 
Hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by Adolph , who was , to the full , as careless and extravagant as his master ; and , between them both , they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity . 
Accustomed , for many years , to regard his master 's property as his own care , Tom saw , with an uneasiness he could scarcely repress , the wasteful expenditure of the establishment ; and , in the quiet , indirect way which his class often acquire , would sometimes make his own suggestions . 
St. Clare at first employed him occasionally ; but , struck with his soundness of mind and good business capacity , he confided in him more and more , till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family were intrusted to him . 
`` No , no , Adolph , '' he said , one day , as Adolph was deprecating the passing of power out of his hands ; `` let Tom alone . 
You only understand what you want ; Tom understands cost and come to ; and there may be some end to money , bye and bye if we do n't let somebody do that . '' 
Trusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master , who handed him a bill without looking at it , and pocketed the change without counting it , Tom had every facility and temptation to dishonesty ; and nothing but an impregnable simplicity of nature , strengthened by Christian faith , could have kept him from it . 
But , to that nature , the very unbounded trust reposed in him was bond and seal for the most scrupulous accuracy . 
With Adolph the case had been different . 
Thoughtless and self-indulgent , and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to indulge than to regulate , he had fallen into an absolute confusion as to meum tuum with regard to himself and his master , which sometimes troubled even St. Clare . 
His own good sense taught him that such a training of his servants was unjust and dangerous . 
A sort of chronic remorse went with him everywhere , although not strong enough to make any decided change in his course ; and this very remorse reacted again into indulgence . 
He passed lightly over the most serious faults , because he told himself that , if he had done his part , his dependents had not fallen into them . 
Tom regarded his gay , airy , handsome young master with an odd mixture of fealty , reverence , and fatherly solicitude . 
That he never read the Bible ; never went to church ; that he jested and made free with any and every thing that came in the way of his wit ; that he spent his Sunday evenings at the opera or theatre ; that he went to wine parties , and clubs , and suppers , oftener than was at all expedient , -- were all things that Tom could see as plainly as anybody , and on which he based a conviction that `` Mas ' r was n't a Christian ; '' -- a conviction , however , which he would have been very slow to express to any one else , but on which he founded many prayers , in his own simple fashion , when he was by himself in his little dormitory . 
Not that Tom had not his own way of speaking his mind occasionally , with something of the tact often observable in his class ; as , for example , the very day after the Sabbath we have described , St. Clare was invited out to a convivial party of choice spirits , and was helped home , between one and two o'clock at night , in a condition when the physical had decidedly attained the upper hand of the intellectual . 
Tom and Adolph assisted to get him composed for the night , the latter in high spirits , evidently regarding the matter as a good joke , and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Tom 's horror , who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night , praying for his young master . 
`` Well , Tom , what are you waiting for ? '' 
said St. Clare , the next day , as he sat in his library , in dressing-gown and slippers . 
St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money , and various commissions . 
`` Is n't all right there , Tom ? '' 
he added , as Tom still stood waiting . 
`` I 'm ` fraid not , Mas ` r , '' said Tom , with a grave face . 
St. Clare laid down his paper , and set down his coffee-cup , and looked at Tom . 
`` Why Tom , what 's the case ? 
You look as solemn as a coffin . '' 
`` I feel very bad , Mas ` r. I allays have thought that Mas ' r would be good to everybody . '' 
`` Well , Tom , have n't I been ? 
Come , now , what do you want ? 
There 's something you have n't got , I suppose , and this is the preface . '' 
`` Mas ' r allays been good to me . 
I have n't nothing to complain of on that head . 
But there is one that Mas ' r is n't good to . '' 
`` Why , Tom , what 's got into you ? 
Speak out ; what do you mean ? '' 
`` Last night , between one and two , I thought so .
