Around the fountain ran a walk , paved with a mosaic of pebbles , laid in various fanciful patterns ; and this , again , was surrounded by turf , smooth as green velvet , while a carriage-drive enclosed the whole . 
Two large orange-trees , now fragrant with blossoms , threw a delicious shade ; and , ranged in a circle round upon the turf , were marble vases of arabesque sculpture , containing the choicest flowering plants of the tropics . 
Huge pomegranate trees , with their glossy leaves and flame-colored flowers , dark-leaved Arabian jessamines , with their silvery stars , geraniums , luxuriant roses bending beneath their heavy abundance of flowers , golden jessamines , lemon-scented verbenum , all united their bloom and fragrance , while here and there a mystic old aloe , with its strange , massive leaves , sat looking like some old enchanter , sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom and fragrance around it . 
The galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain of some kind of Moorish stuff , and could be drawn down at pleasure , to exclude the beams of the sun . 
On the whole , the appearance of the place was luxurious and romantic . 
As the carriage drove in , Eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a cage , with the wild eagerness of her delight . 
`` O , is n't it beautiful , lovely ! 
my own dear , darling home ! '' 
she said to Miss Ophelia . 
`` Is n't it beautiful ? '' '' ' 
T is a pretty place , '' said Miss Ophelia , as she alighted ; `` though it looks rather old and heathenish to me . '' 
Tom got down from the carriage , and looked about with an air of calm , still enjoyment . 
The negro , it must be remembered , is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world , and he has , deep in his heart , a passion for all that is splendid , rich , and fanciful ; a passion which , rudely indulged by an untrained taste , draws on them the ridicule of the colder and more correct white race . 
St. Clare , who was in heart a poetical voluptuary , smiled as Miss Ophelia made her remark on his premises , and , turning to Tom , who was standing looking round , his beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration , he said , `` Tom , my boy , this seems to suit you . '' 
`` Yes , Mas ` r , it looks about the right thing , '' said Tom . 
All this passed in a moment , while trunks were being hustled off , hackman paid , and while a crowd , of all ages and sizes , -- men , women , and children , -- came running through the galleries , both above and below to see Mas ' r come in . 
Foremost among them was a highly-dressed young mulatto man , evidently a very distingue personage , attired in the ultra extreme of the mode , and gracefully waving a scented cambric handkerchief in his hand . 
This personage had been exerting himself , with great alacrity , in driving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah . 
`` Back ! 
all of you . 
I am ashamed of you , '' he said , in a tone of authority . 
`` Would you intrude on Master 's domestic relations , in the first hour of his return ? '' 
All looked abashed at this elegant speech , delivered with quite an air , and stood huddled together at a respectful distance , except two stout porters , who came up and began conveying away the baggage . 
Owing to Mr. Adolph 's systematic arrangements , when St. Clare turned round from paying the hackman , there was nobody in view but Mr. Adolph himself , conspicuous in satin vest , gold guard-chain , and white pants , and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity . 
`` Ah , Adolph , is it you ? '' 
said his master , offering his hand to him ; `` how are you , boy ? '' 
while Adolph poured forth , with great fluency , an extemporary speech , which he had been preparing , with great care , for a fortnight before . 
`` Well , well , '' said St. Clare , passing on , with his usual air of negligent drollery , `` that 's very well got up , Adolph . 
See that the baggage is well bestowed . 
I 'll come to the people in a minute ; '' and , so saying , he led Miss Ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the verandah . 
While this had been passing , Eva had flown like a bird , through the porch and parlor , to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah . 
A tall , dark-eyed , sallow woman , half rose from a couch on which she was reclining . 
`` Mamma ! '' 
said Eva , in a sort of a rapture , throwing herself on her neck , and embracing her over and over again . 
`` That 'll do , -- take care , child , -- do n't , you make my head ache , '' said the mother , after she had languidly kissed her . 
St. Clare came in , embraced his wife in true , orthodox , husbandly fashion , and then presented to her his cousin . 
Marie lifted her large eyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity , and received her with languid politeness . 
A crowd of servants now pressed to the entry door , and among them a middle-aged mulatto woman , of very respectable appearance , stood foremost , in a tremor of expectation and joy , at the door . 
`` O , there 's Mammy ! '' 
said Eva , as she flew across the room ; and , throwing herself into her arms , she kissed her repeatedly . 
This woman did not tell her that she made her head ache , but , on the contrary , she hugged her , and laughed , and cried , till her sanity was a thing to be doubted of ; and when released from her , Eva flew from one to another , shaking hands and kissing , in a way that Miss Ophelia afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach . 
`` Well ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , `` you southern children can do something that I could n't . '' 
`` What , now , pray ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` Well , I want to be kind to everybody , and I would n't have anything hurt ; but as to kissing -- '' `` Niggers , '' said St. Clare , `` that you 're not up to , -- hey ? '' 
`` Yes , that 's it . 
How can she ? '' 
St. Clare laughed , as he went into the passage . 
`` Halloa , here , what 's to pay out here ? 
Here , you all -- Mammy , Jimmy , Polly , Sukey -- glad to see Mas ` r ? '' 
he said , as he went shaking hands from one to another . 
`` Look out for the babies ! '' 
he added , as he stumbled over a sooty little urchin , who was crawling upon all fours . 
`` If I step upon anybody , let 'em mention it . '' 
There was an abundance of laughing and blessing Mas ` r , as St. Clare distributed small pieces of change among them . 
`` Come , now , take yourselves off , like good boys and girls , '' he said ; and the whole assemblage , dark and light , disappeared through a door into a large verandah , followed by Eva , who carried a large satchel , which she had been filling with apples , nuts , candy , ribbons , laces , and toys of every description , during her whole homeward journey . 
As St. Clare turned to go back his eye fell upon Tom , who was standing uneasily , shifting from one foot to the other , while Adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters , examining Tom through an opera-glass , with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living . 
`` Puh ! 
you puppy , '' said his master , striking down the opera glass ; `` is that the way you treat your company ? 
Seems to me , Dolph , '' he added , laying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was sporting , `` seems to me that 's my vest . '' 
`` O ! 
Master , this vest all stained with wine ; of course , a gentleman in Master 's standing never wears a vest like this . 
I understood I was to take it . 
It does for a poor nigger-fellow , like me . '' 
And Adolph tossed his head , and passed his fingers through his scented hair , with a grace . 
`` So , that 's it , is it ? '' 
said St. Clare , carelessly . 
`` Well , here , I 'm going to show this Tom to his mistress , and then you take him to the kitchen ; and mind you do n't put on any of your airs to him . 
He 's worth two such puppies as you . '' 
`` Master always will have his joke , '' said Adolph , laughing . 
`` I 'm delighted to see Master in such spirits . '' 
`` Here , Tom , '' said St. Clare , beckoning . 
Tom entered the room . 
He looked wistfully on the velvet carpets , and the before unimagined splendors of mirrors , pictures , statues , and curtains , and , like the Queen of Sheba before Solomon , there was no more spirit in him . 
He looked afraid even to set his feet down . 
`` See here , Marie , '' said St. Clare to his wife , `` I 've bought you a coachman , at last , to order . 
I tell you , he 's a regular hearse for blackness and sobriety , and will drive you like a funeral , if you want . 
Open your eyes , now , and look at him . 
Now , do n't say I never think about you when I 'm gone . '' 
Marie opened her eyes , and fixed them on Tom , without rising . 
`` I know he 'll get drunk , '' she said . 
`` No , he 's warranted a pious and sober article . '' 
`` Well , I hope he may turn out well , '' said the lady ; `` it 's more than I expect , though . '' 
`` Dolph , '' said St. Clare , `` show Tom down stairs ; and , mind yourself , '' he added ; `` remember what I told you . '' 
Adolph tripped gracefully forward , and Tom , with lumbering tread , went after . 
`` He 's a perfect behemoth ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` Come , now , Marie , '' said St. Clare , seating himself on a stool beside her sofa , `` be gracious , and say something pretty to a fellow . '' 
`` You 've been gone a fortnight beyond the time , '' said the lady , pouting . 
`` Well , you know I wrote you the reason . '' 
`` Such a short , cold letter ! '' 
said the lady . 
`` Dear me ! 
the mail was just going , and it had to be that or nothing . '' 
`` That 's just the way , always , '' said the lady ; `` always something to make your journeys long , and letters short . '' 
`` See here , now , '' he added , drawing an elegant velvet case out of his pocket , and opening it , `` here 's a present I got for you in New York . '' 
It was a daguerreotype , clear and soft as an engraving , representing Eva and her father sitting hand in hand . 
Marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air . 
`` What made you sit in such an awkward position ? '' 
she said . 
`` Well , the position may be a matter of opinion ; but what do you think of the likeness ? '' 
`` If you do n't think anything of my opinion in one case , I suppose you would n't in another , '' said the lady , shutting the daguerreotype . 
`` Hang the woman ! '' 
said St. Clare , mentally ; but aloud he added , `` Come , now , Marie , what do you think of the likeness ? 
Do n't be nonsensical , now . '' 
`` It 's very inconsiderate of you , St. Clare , '' said the lady , `` to insist on my talking and looking at things . 
You know I 've been lying all day with the sick-headache ; and there 's been such a tumult made ever since you came , I 'm half dead . '' 
`` You 're subject to the sick-headache , ma'am ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , suddenly rising from the depths of the large arm-chair , where she had sat quietly , taking an inventory of the furniture , and calculating its expense . 
`` Yes , I 'm a perfect martyr to it , '' said the lady . 
`` Juniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache , '' said Miss Ophelia ; `` at least , Auguste , Deacon Abraham Perry 's wife , used to say so ; and she was a great nurse . '' 
`` I 'll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our garden by the lake brought in for that special purpose , '' said St. Clare , gravely pulling the bell as he did so ; `` meanwhile , cousin , you must be wanting to retire to your apartment , and refresh yourself a little , after your journey . 
Dolph , '' he added , `` tell Mammy to come here . '' 
The decent mulatto woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered ; she was dressed neatly , with a high red and yellow turban on her head , the recent gift of Eva , and which the child had been arranging on her head . 
`` Mammy , '' said St. Clare , `` I put this lady under your care ; she is tired , and wants rest ; take her to her chamber , and be sure she is made comfortable , '' and Miss Ophelia disappeared in the rear of Mammy . 
`` And now , Marie , '' said St. Clare , `` your golden days are dawning . 
Here is our practical , business-like New England cousin , who will take the whole budget of cares off your shoulders , and give you time to refresh yourself , and grow young and handsome . 
The ceremony of delivering the keys had better come off forthwith . '' 
This remark was made at the breakfast-table , a few mornings after Miss Ophelia had arrived . 
`` I 'm sure she 's welcome , '' said Marie , leaning her head languidly on her hand . 
`` I think she 'll find one thing , if she does , and that is , that it 's we mistresses that are the slaves , down here . '' 
`` O , certainly , she will discover that , and a world of wholesome truths besides , no doubt , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Talk about our keeping slaves , as if we did it for our convenience , '' said Marie . 
`` I 'm sure , if we consulted that , we might let them all go at once . '' 
Evangeline fixed her large , serious eyes on her mother 's face , with an earnest and perplexed expression , and said , simply , `` What do you keep them for , mamma ? '' 
`` I do n't know , I 'm sure , except for a plague ; they are the plague of my life . 
I believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any one thing ; and ours , I know , are the very worst that ever anybody was plagued with . '' 
`` O , come , Marie , you 've got the blues , this morning , '' said St. Clare . 
`` You know ' t is n't so . 
There 's Mammy , the best creature living , -- what could you do without her ? '' 
`` Mammy is the best I ever knew , '' said Marie ; `` and yet Mammy , now , is selfish -- dreadfully selfish ; it 's the fault of the whole race . '' 
`` Selfishness is a dreadful fault , '' said St. Clare , gravely . 
`` Well , now , there 's Mammy , '' said Marie , `` I think it 's selfish of her to sleep so sound nights ; she knows I need little attentions almost every hour , when my worst turns are on , and yet she 's so hard to wake . 
I absolutely am worse , this very morning , for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night . '' 
`` Has n't she sat up with you a good many nights , lately , mamma ? '' 
said Eva . 
`` How should you know that ? '' 
said Marie , sharply ; `` she 's been complaining , I suppose . '' 
`` She did n't complain ; she only told me what bad nights you 'd had , -- so many in succession . '' 
`` Why do n't you let Jane or Rosa take her place , a night or two , '' said St. Clare , `` and let her rest ? '' 
`` How can you propose it ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` St. Clare , you really are inconsiderate . 
So nervous as I am , the least breath disturbs me ; and a strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic . 
If Mammy felt the interest in me she ought to , she 'd wake easier , -- of course , she would . 
I 've heard of people who had such devoted servants , but it never was my luck ; '' and Marie sighed . 
Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd , observant gravity ; and she still kept her lips tightly compressed , as if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position , before she committed herself . 
`` Now , Mammy has a sort of goodness , '' said Marie ; `` she 's smooth and respectful , but she 's selfish at heart . 
Now , she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers . 
You see , when I was married and came to live here , of course , I had to bring her with me , and her husband my father could n't spare . 
He was a blacksmith , and , of course , very necessary ; and I thought and said , at the time , that Mammy and he had better give each other up , as it was n't likely to be convenient for them ever to live together again . 
I wish , now , I 'd insisted on it , and married Mammy to somebody else ; but I was foolish and indulgent , and did n't want to insist . 
I told Mammy , at the time , that she must n't ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her life again , for the air of father 's place does n't agree with my health , and I ca n't go there ; and I advised her to take up with somebody else ; but no -- she would n't . 
Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her , in spots , that everybody do n't see as I do . '' 
`` Has she children ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Yes ; she has two . '' 
`` I suppose she feels the separation from them ? '' 
`` Well , of course , I could n't bring them . 
They were little dirty things -- I could n't have them about ; and , besides , they took up too much of her time ; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this . 
She wo n't marry anybody else ; and I do believe , now , though she knows how necessary she is to me , and how feeble my health is , she would go back to her husband tomorrow , if she only could . 
I do , indeed , '' said Marie ; `` they are just so selfish , now , the best of them . '' 
`` It 's distressing to reflect upon , '' said St. Clare , dryly . 
Miss Ophelia looked keenly at him , and saw the flush of mortification and repressed vexation , and the sarcastic curl of the lip , as he spoke . 
`` Now , Mammy has always been a pet with me , '' said Marie . 
`` I wish some of your northern servants could look at her closets of dresses , -- silks and muslins , and one real linen cambric , she has hanging there . 
I 've worked sometimes whole afternoons , trimming her caps , and getting her ready to go to a party . 
As to abuse , she do n't know what it is . 
She never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life . 
She has her strong coffee or her tea every day , with white sugar in it . 
It 's abominable , to be sure ; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs , and they every one of them live just as they please . 
The fact is , our servants are over-indulged . 
I suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish , and act like spoiled children ; but I 've talked to St. Clare till I am tired . '' 
`` And I , too , '' said St. Clare , taking up the morning paper . 
Eva , the beautiful Eva , had stood listening to her mother , with that expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her . 
She walked softly round to her mother 's chair , and put her arms round her neck . 
`` Well , Eva , what now ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` Mamma , could n't I take care of you one night -- just one ? 
I know I should n't make you nervous , and I should n't sleep . 
I often lie awake nights , thinking -- '' `` O , nonsense , child -- nonsense ! '' 
said Marie ; `` you are such a strange child ! '' 
`` But may I , mamma ? 
I think , '' she said , timidly , `` that Mammy is n't well . 
She told me her head ached all the time , lately . '' 
`` O , that 's just one of Mammy 's fidgets ! 
Mammy is just like all the rest of them -- makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache ; it 'll never do to encourage it -- never ! 
I 'm principled about this matter , '' said she , turning to Miss Ophelia ; `` you 'll find the necessity of it . 
If you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling , and complaining of every little ailment , you 'll have your hands full . 
I never complain myself -- nobody knows what I endure . 
I feel it a duty to bear it quietly , and I do . '' 
Miss Ophelia 's round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this peroration , which struck St. Clare as so supremely ludicrous , that he burst into a loud laugh . 
`` St. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill health , '' said Marie , with the voice of a suffering martyr . 
`` I only hope the day wo n't come when he 'll remember it ! '' 
and Marie put her handkerchief to her eyes . 
Of course , there was rather a foolish silence . 
Finally , St. Clare got up , looked at his watch , and said he had an engagement down street . 
Eva tripped away after him , and Miss Ophelia and Marie remained at the table alone . 
`` Now , that 's just like St. Clare ! '' 
said the latter , withdrawing her handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to be affected by it was no longer in sight . 
`` He never realizes , never can , never will , what I suffer , and have , for years . 
If I was one of the complaining sort , or ever made any fuss about my ailments , there would be some reason for it . 
Men do get tired , naturally , of a complaining wife . 
But I 've kept things to myself , and borne , and borne , till St. Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything . '' 
Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to this . 
While she was thinking what to say , Marie gradually wiped away her tears , and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way , as a dove might be supposed to make toilet after a shower , and began a housewifely chat with Miss Ophelia , concerning cupboards , closets , linen-presses , store-rooms , and other matters , of which the latter was , by common understanding , to assume the direction , -- giving her so many cautious directions and charges , that a head less systematic and business-like than Miss Ophelia 's would have been utterly dizzied and confounded . 
`` And now , '' said Marie , `` I believe I 've told you everything ; so that , when my next sick turn comes on , you 'll be able to go forward entirely , without consulting me ; -- only about Eva , -- she requires watching . '' 
`` She seems to be a good child , very , '' said Miss Ophelia ; `` I never saw a better child . '' 
`` Eva 's peculiar , '' said her mother , `` very . 
There are things about her so singular ; she is n't like me , now , a particle ; '' and Marie sighed , as if this was a truly melancholy consideration . 
Miss Ophelia in her own heart said , `` I hope she is n't , '' but had prudence enough to keep it down . 
`` Eva always was disposed to be with servants ; and I think that well enough with some children . 
Now , I always played with father 's little negroes -- it never did me any harm . 
But Eva somehow always seems to put herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her . 
It 's a strange thing about the child . 
I never have been able to break her of it . 
St. Clare , I believe , encourages her in it . 
The fact is , St. Clare indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife . '' 
Again Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence . 
`` Now , there 's no way with servants , '' said Marie , `` but to put them down , and keep them down . 
It was always natural to me , from a child . 
Eva is enough to spoil a whole house-full . 
What she will do when she comes to keep house herself , I 'm sure I do n't know . 
I hold to being kind to servants -- I always am ; but you must make 'em know their place . 
Eva never does ; there 's no getting into the child 's head the first beginning of an idea what a servant 's place is ! 
You heard her offering to take care of me nights , to let Mammy sleep ! 
That 's just a specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time , if she was left to herself . '' 
`` Why , '' said Miss Ophelia , bluntly , `` I suppose you think your servants are human creatures , and ought to have some rest when they are tired . '' 
`` Certainly , of course . 
I 'm very particular in letting them have everything that comes convenient , -- anything that does n't put one at all out of the way , you know . 
Mammy can make up her sleep , some time or other ; there 's no difficulty about that . 
She 's the sleepiest concern that ever I saw ; sewing , standing , or sitting , that creature will go to sleep , and sleep anywhere and everywhere . 
No danger but Mammy gets sleep enough . 
But this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers , or china vases , is really ridiculous , '' said Marie , as she plunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge , and drew towards her an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette . 
`` You see , '' she continued , in a faint and lady-like voice , like the last dying breath of an Arabian jessamine , or something equally ethereal , `` you see , Cousin Ophelia , I do n't often speak of myself . 
It is n't my habit ; ' t is n't agreeable to me . 
In fact , I have n't strength to do it . 
But there are points where St. Clare and I differ . 
St. Clare never understood me , never appreciated me . 
I think it lies at the root of all my ill health . 
St. Clare means well , I am bound to believe ; but men are constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman . 
That , at least , is my impression . '' 
Miss Ophelia , who had not a small share of the genuine New England caution , and a very particular horror of being drawn into family difficulties , now began to foresee something of this kind impending ; so , composing her face into a grim neutrality , and drawing out of her pocket about a yard and a quarter of stocking , which she kept as a specific against what Dr. Watts asserts to be a personal habit of Satan when people have idle hands , she proceeded to knit most energetically , shutting her lips together in a way that said , as plain as words could , `` You need n't try to make me speak . 
I do n't want anything to do with your affairs , '' -- in fact , she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion . 
But Marie did n't care for that . 
She had got somebody to talk to , and she felt it her duty to talk , and that was enough ; and reinforcing herself by smelling again at her vinaigrette , she went on . 
`` You see , I brought my own property and servants into the connection , when I married St. Clare , and I am legally entitled to manage them my own way . 
St. Clare had his fortune and his servants , and I 'm well enough content he should manage them his way ; but St. Clare will be interfering . 
He has wild , extravagant notions about things , particularly about the treatment of servants . 
He really does act as if he set his servants before me , and before himself , too ; for he lets them make him all sorts of trouble , and never lifts a finger . 
Now , about some things , St. Clare is really frightful -- he frightens me -- good-natured as he looks , in general . 
Now , he has set down his foot that , come what will , there shall not be a blow struck in this house , except what he or I strike ; and he does it in a way that I really dare not cross him . 
Well , you may see what that leads to ; for St. Clare would n't raise his hand , if every one of them walked over him , and I -- you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion . 
Now , you know these servants are nothing but grown-up children . '' 
`` I do n't know anything about it , and I thank the Lord that I do n't ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , shortly . 
`` Well , but you will have to know something , and know it to your cost , if you stay here . 
You do n't know what a provoking , stupid , careless , unreasonable , childish , ungrateful set of wretches they are . '' 
Marie seemed wonderfully supported , always , when she got upon this topic ; and she now opened her eyes , and seemed quite to forget her languor . 
`` You do n't know , and you ca n't , the daily , hourly trials that beset a housekeeper from them , everywhere and every way . 
But it 's no use to complain to St. Clare . 
He talks the strangest stuff . 
He says we have made them what they are , and ought to bear with them . 
He says their faults are all owing to us , and that it would be cruel to make the fault and punish it too . 
He says we should n't do any better , in their place ; just as if one could reason from them to us , you know . '' 
`` Do n't you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , shortly . 
`` No , indeed not I ! 
A pretty story , truly ! 
They are a degraded race . '' 
`` Do n't you think they 've got immortal souls ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , with increasing indignation . 
`` O , well , '' said Marie , yawning , `` that , of course -- nobody doubts that . 
But as to putting them on any sort of equality with us , you know , as if we could be compared , why , it 's impossible ! 
Now , St. Clare really has talked to me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping me from mine . 
There 's no comparing in this way . 
Mammy could n't have the feelings that I should . 
It 's a different thing altogether , -- of course , it is , -- and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it . 
And just as if Mammy could love her little dirty babies as I love Eva ! 
Yet St. Clare once really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty , with my weak health , and all I suffer , to let Mammy go back , and take somebody else in her place . 
That was a little too much even for me to bear . 
I do n't often show my feelings , I make it a principle to endure everything in silence ; it 's a wife 's hard lot , and I bear it . 
But I did break out , that time ; so that he has never alluded to the subject since . 
But I know by his looks , and little things that he says , that he thinks so as much as ever ; and it 's so trying , so provoking ! '' 
Miss Ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say something ; but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had volumes of meaning in it , if Marie could only have understood it . 
`` So , you just see , '' she continued , `` what you 've got to manage . 
A household without any rule ; where servants have it all their own way , do what they please , and have what they please , except so far as I , with my feeble health , have kept up government . 
I keep my cowhide about , and sometimes I do lay it on ; but the exertion is always too much for me . 
If St. Clare would only have this thing done as others do -- '' `` And how 's that ? '' 
`` Why , send them to the calaboose , or some of the other places to be flogged . 
That 's the only way . 
If I was n't such a poor , feeble piece , I believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does . '' 
`` And how does St. Clare contrive to manage ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` You say he never strikes a blow . '' 
`` Well , men have a more commanding way , you know ; it is easier for them ; besides , if you ever looked full in his eye , it 's peculiar , -- that eye , -- and if he speaks decidedly , there 's a kind of flash . 
I 'm afraid of it , myself ; and the servants know they must mind . 
I could n't do as much by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his eye , if once he is in earnest . 
O , there 's no trouble about St. Clare ; that 's the reason he 's no more feeling for me . 
But you 'll find , when you come to manage , that there 's no getting along without severity , -- they are so bad , so deceitful , so lazy . '' 
`` The old tune , '' said St. Clare , sauntering in . 
`` What an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle , at last , especially for being lazy ! 
You see , cousin , '' said he , as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to Marie , `` it 's wholly inexcusable in them , in the light of the example that Marie and I set them , -- this laziness . '' 
`` Come , now , St. Clare , you are too bad ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` Am I , now ? 
Why , I thought I was talking good , quite remarkably for me . 
I try to enforce your remarks , Marie , always . '' 
`` You know you meant no such thing , St. Clare , '' said Marie . 
`` O , I must have been mistaken , then . 
Thank you , my dear , for setting me right . '' 
`` You do really try to be provoking , '' said Marie . 
`` O , come , Marie , the day is growing warm , and I have just had a long quarrel with Dolph , which has fatigued me excessively ; so , pray be agreeable , now , and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile . '' 
`` What 's the matter about Dolph ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` That fellow 's impudence has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me . 
I only wish I had the undisputed management of him a while . 
I 'd bring him down ! '' 
`` What you say , my dear , is marked with your usual acuteness and good sense , '' said St. Clare . 
`` As to Dolph , the case is this : that he has so long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections , that he has , at last , really mistaken himself for his master ; and I have been obliged to give him a little insight into his mistake . '' 
`` How ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` Why , I was obliged to let him understand explicitly that I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing ; also , I put his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water , and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs . 
Dolph was particularly huffy about it , and I had to talk to him like a father , to bring him round . '' 
`` O ! 
St. Clare , when will you learn how to treat your servants ? 
It 's abominable , the way you indulge them ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` Why , after all , what 's the harm of the poor dog 's wanting to be like his master ; and if I have n't brought him up any better than to find his chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs , why should n't I give them to him ? '' 
`` And why have n't you brought him up better ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , with blunt determination . 
`` Too much trouble , -- laziness , cousin , laziness , -- which ruins more souls than you can shake a stick at . 
If it were n't for laziness , I should have been a perfect angel , myself . 
I 'm inclined to think that laziness is what your old Dr. Botherem , up in Vermont , used to call the ` essence of moral evil . ' 
It 's an awful consideration , certainly . '' 
`` I think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I would n't have it , for a thousand worlds . 
You ought to educate your slaves , and treat them like reasonable creatures , -- like immortal creatures , that you 've got to stand before the bar of God with . 
That 's my mind , '' said the good lady , breaking suddenly out with a tide of zeal that had been gaining strength in her mind all the morning . 
`` O ! 
come , come , '' said St. Clare , getting up quickly ; `` what do you know about us ? '' 
And he sat down to the piano , and rattled a lively piece of music . 
St. Clare had a decided genius for music . 
His touch was brilliant and firm , and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and bird-like motion , airy , and yet decided . 
He played piece after piece , like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor . 
After pushing the music aside , he rose up , and said , gayly , `` Well , now , cousin , you 've given us a good talk and done your duty ; on the whole , I think the better of you for it . 
I make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth at me , though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it was n't exactly appreciated , at first . '' 
`` For my part , I do n't see any use in such sort of talk , '' said Marie . 
`` I 'm sure , if anybody does more for servants than we do , I 'd like to know who ; and it do n't do 'em a bit good , -- not a particle , -- they get worse and worse . 
As to talking to them , or anything like that , I 'm sure I have talked till I was tired and hoarse , telling them their duty , and all that ; and I 'm sure they can go to church when they like , though they do n't understand a word of the sermon , more than so many pigs , -- so it is n't of any great use for them to go , as I see ; but they do go , and so they have every chance ; but , as I said before , they are a degraded race , and always will be , and there is n't any help for them ; you ca n't make anything of them , if you try . 
You see , Cousin Ophelia , I 've tried , and you have n't ; I was born and bred among them , and I know . '' 
Miss Ophelia thought she had said enough , and therefore sat silent . 
St. Clare whistled a tune . 
`` St. Clare , I wish you would n't whistle , '' said Marie ; `` it makes my head worse . '' 
`` I wo n't , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Is there anything else you would n't wish me to do ? '' 
`` I wish you would have some kind of sympathy for my trials ; you never have any feeling for me . '' 
`` My dear accusing angel ! '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` It 's provoking to be talked to in that way . '' 
`` Then , how will you be talked to ? 
I 'll talk to order , -- any way you 'll mention , -- only to give satisfaction . '' 
A gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the verandah . 
St. Clare stepped out , and lifting up the curtain , laughed too . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , coming to the railing . 
There sat Tom , on a little mossy seat in the court , every one of his button-holes stuck full of cape jessamines , and Eva , gayly laughing , was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck ; and then she sat down on his knee , like a chip-sparrow , still laughing . 
`` O , Tom , you look so funny ! '' 
Tom had a sober , benevolent smile , and seemed , in his quiet way , to be enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress . 
He lifted his eyes , when he saw his master , with a half-deprecating , apologetic air . 
`` How can you let her ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Why not ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` Why , I do n't know , it seems so dreadful ! '' 
`` You would think no harm in a child 's caressing a large dog , even if he was black ; but a creature that can think , and reason , and feel , and is immortal , you shudder at ; confess it , cousin . 
I know the feeling among some of you northerners well enough . 
Not that there is a particle of virtue in our not having it ; but custom with us does what Christianity ought to do , -- obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice . 
I have often noticed , in my travels north , how much stronger this was with you than with us . 
You loathe them as you would a snake or a toad , yet you are indignant at their wrongs . 
You would not have them abused ; but you do n't want to have anything to do with them yourselves . 
You would send them to Africa , out of your sight and smell , and then send a missionary or two to do up all the self-denial of elevating them compendiously . 
Is n't that it ? '' 
`` Well , cousin , '' said Miss Ophelia , thoughtfully , `` there may be some truth in this . '' 
`` What would the poor and lowly do , without children ? '' 
said St. Clare , leaning on the railing , and watching Eva , as she tripped off , leading Tom with her . 
`` Your little child is your only true democrat . 
Tom , now is a hero to Eva ; his stories are wonders in her eyes , his songs and Methodist hymns are better than an opera , and the traps and little bits of trash in his pocket a mine of jewels , and he the most wonderful Tom that ever wore a black skin . 
This is one of the roses of Eden that the Lord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly , who get few enough of any other kind . '' 
`` It 's strange , cousin , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` one might almost think you were a professor , to hear you talk . '' 
`` A professor ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` Yes ; a professor of religion . '' 
`` Not at all ; not a professor , as your town-folks have it ; and , what is worse , I 'm afraid , not a practiser , either . '' 
`` What makes you talk so , then ? '' 
`` Nothing is easier than talking , '' said St. Clare . 
`` I believe Shakespeare makes somebody say , ' I could sooner show twenty what were good to be done , than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing . ' 
* Nothing like division of labor . 
My forte lies in talking , and yours , cousin , lies in doing . '' 
* The Merchant of Venice , Act 1 , scene 2 , lines 17-18 . 
In Tom 's external situation , at this time , there was , as the world says , nothing to complain of Little Eva 's fancy for him -- the instinctive gratitude and loveliness of a noble nature -- had led her to petition her father that he might be her especial attendant , whenever she needed the escort of a servant , in her walks or rides ; and Tom had general orders to let everything else go , and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him , -- orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him . 
He was kept well dressed , for St. Clare was fastidiously particular on this point . 
His stable services were merely a sinecure , and consisted simply in a daily care and inspection , and directing an under-servant in his duties ; for Marie St. Clare declared that she could not have any smell of the horses about him when he came near her , and that he must positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to her , as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of that nature ; one snuff of anything disagreeable being , according to her account , quite sufficient to close the scene , and put an end to all her earthly trials at once . 
Tom , therefore , in his well-brushed broadcloth suit , smooth beaver , glossy boots , faultless wristbands and collar , with his grave , good-natured black face , looked respectable enough to be a Bishop of Carthage , as men of his color were , in other ages . 
Then , too , he was in a beautiful place , a consideration to which his sensitive race was never indifferent ; and he did enjoy with a quiet joy the birds , the flowers , the fountains , the perfume , and light and beauty of the court , the silken hangings , and pictures , and lustres , and statuettes , and gilding , that made the parlors within a kind of Aladdin 's palace to him . 
If ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race , -- and come it must , some time , her turn to figure in the great drama of human improvement . 
-- life will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived . 
In that far-off mystic land of gold , and gems , and spices , and waving palms , and wondrous flowers , and miraculous fertility , will awake new forms of art , new styles of splendor ; and the negro race , no longer despised and trodden down , will , perhaps , show forth some of the latest and most magnificent revelations of human life . 
Certainly they will , in their gentleness , their lowly docility of heart , their aptitude to repose on a superior mind and rest on a higher power , their childlike simplicity of affection , and facility of forgiveness . 
In all these they will exhibit the highest form of the peculiarly Christian life , and , perhaps , as God chasteneth whom he loveth , he hath chosen poor Africa in the furnace of affliction , to make her the highest and noblest in that kingdom which he will set up , when every other kingdom has been tried , and failed ; for the first shall be last , and the last first . 
Was this what Marie St. Clare was thinking of , as she stood , gorgeously dressed , on the verandah , on Sunday morning , clasping a diamond bracelet on her slender wrist ? 
Most likely it was . 
Or , if it was n't that , it was something else ; for Marie patronized good things , and she was going now , in full force , -- diamonds , silk , and lace , and jewels , and all , -- to a fashionable church , to be very religious . 
Marie always made a point to be very pious on Sundays . 
There she stood , so slender , so elegant , so airy and undulating in all her motions , her lace scarf enveloping her like a mist . 
She looked a graceful creature , and she felt very good and very elegant indeed . 
Miss Ophelia stood at her side , a perfect contrast . 
It was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl , and as fine a pocket-handkerchief ; but stiffness and squareness , and bolt-uprightness , enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor ; not the grace of God , however , -- that is quite another thing ! 
`` Where 's Eva ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` The child stopped on the stairs , to say something to Mammy . '' 
And what was Eva saying to Mammy on the stairs ? 
Listen , reader , and you will hear , though Marie does not . 
`` Dear Mammy , I know your head is aching dreadfully . '' 
`` Lord bless you , Miss Eva ! 
my head allers aches lately . 
You do n't need to worry . '' 
`` Well , I 'm glad you 're going out ; and here , '' -- and the little girl threw her arms around her , -- `` Mammy , you shall take my vinaigrette . '' 
`` What ! 
your beautiful gold thing , thar , with them diamonds ! 
Lor , Miss , ' t would n't be proper , no ways . '' 
`` Why not ? 
You need it , and I do n't . 
Mamma always uses it for headache , and it 'll make you feel better . 
No , you shall take it , to please me , now . '' 
`` Do hear the darlin talk ! '' 
said Mammy , as Eva thrust it into her bosom , and kissing her , ran down stairs to her mother . 
`` What were you stopping for ? '' 
`` I was just stopping to give Mammy my vinaigrette , to take to church with her . '' 
`` Eva '' said Marie , stamping impatiently , -- `` your gold vinaigrette to Mammy ! 
When will you learn what 's proper ? 
Go right and take it back this moment ! '' 
Eva looked downcast and aggrieved , and turned slowly . 
`` I say , Marie , let the child alone ; she shall do as she pleases , '' said St. Clare . 
`` St. Clare , how will she ever get along in the world ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` The Lord knows , '' said St. Clare , `` but she 'll get along in heaven better than you or I. '' `` O , papa , do n't , '' said Eva , softly touching his elbow ; `` it troubles mother . '' 
`` Well , cousin , are you ready to go to meeting ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , turning square about on St. Clare . 
`` I 'm not going , thank you . '' 
`` I do wish St. Clare ever would go to church , '' said Marie ; `` but he has n't a particle of religion about him . 
It really is n't respectable . '' 
`` I know it , '' said St. Clare . 
`` You ladies go to church to learn how to get along in the world , I suppose , and your piety sheds respectability on us . 
If I did go at all , I would go where Mammy goes ; there 's something to keep a fellow awake there , at least . '' 
`` What ! 
those shouting Methodists ? 
Horrible ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` Anything but the dead sea of your respectable churches , Marie . 
Positively , it 's too much to ask of a man . 
Eva , do you like to go ? 
Come , stay at home and play with me . '' 
`` Thank you , papa ; but I 'd rather go to church . '' 
`` Is n't it dreadful tiresome ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` I think it is tiresome , some , '' said Eva , `` and I am sleepy , too , but I try to keep awake . '' 
`` What do you go for , then ? '' 
`` Why , you know , papa , '' she said , in a whisper , `` cousin told me that God wants to have us ; and he gives us everything , you know ; and it is n't much to do it , if he wants us to . 
It is n't so very tiresome after all . '' 
`` You sweet , little obliging soul ! '' 
said St. Clare , kissing her ; `` go along , that 's a good girl , and pray for me . '' 
`` Certainly , I always do , '' said the child , as she sprang after her mother into the carriage . 
St. Clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her , as the carriage drove away ; large tears were in his eyes . 
`` O , Evangeline ! 
rightly named , '' he said ; `` hath not God made thee an evangel to me ? '' 
So he felt a moment ; and then he smoked a cigar , and read the Picayune , and forgot his little gospel . 
Was he much unlike other folks ? 
`` You see , Evangeline , '' said her mother , `` it 's always right and proper to be kind to servants , but it is n't proper to treat them just as we would our relations , or people in our own class of life . 
Now , if Mammy was sick , you would n't want to put her in your own bed . '' 
`` I should feel just like it , mamma , '' said Eva , `` because then it would be handier to take care of her , and because , you know , my bed is better than hers . '' 
Marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception evinced in this reply . 
`` What can I do to make this child understand me ? '' 
she said . 
`` Nothing , '' said Miss Ophelia , significantly . 
Eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment ; but children , luckily , do not keep to one impression long , and in a few moments she was merrily laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows , as it rattled along . 
***** `` Well , ladies , '' said St. Clare , as they were comfortably seated at the dinner-table , `` and what was the bill of fare at church today ? '' 
`` O , Dr. G -- preached a splendid sermon , '' said Marie . 
`` It was just such a sermon as you ought to hear ; it expressed all my views exactly . '' 
`` It must have been very improving , '' said St. Clare . 
`` The subject must have been an extensive one . '' 
`` Well , I mean all my views about society , and such things , '' said Marie . 
`` The text was , ` He hath made everything beautiful in its season ; ' and he showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from God ; and that it was so appropriate , you know , and beautiful , that some should be high and some low , and that some were born to rule and some to serve , and all that , you know ; and he applied it so well to all this ridiculous fuss that is made about slavery , and he proved distinctly that the Bible was on our side , and supported all our institutions so convincingly . 
I only wish you 'd heard him . '' 
`` O , I did n't need it , '' said St. Clare . 
`` I can learn what does me as much good as that from the Picayune , any time , and smoke a cigar besides ; which I ca n't do , you know , in a church . '' 
`` Why , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` do n't you believe in these views ? '' 
`` Who , -- I ? 
You know I 'm such a graceless dog that these religious aspects of such subjects do n't edify me much .
