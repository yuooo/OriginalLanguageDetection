`` And so ye telled Tom , did ye ? 
O , Lor ! 
what young uns will be up ter ! 
Ye crowed over Tom ? 
O , Lor ! 
Mas ' r George , if ye would n't make a hornbug laugh ! '' 
`` Yes , '' said George , `` I says to him , ` Tom , you ought to see some of Aunt Chloe 's pies ; they 're the right sort , ' says I. '' `` Pity , now , Tom could n't , '' said Aunt Chloe , on whose benevolent heart the idea of Tom 's benighted condition seemed to make a strong impression . 
`` Ye oughter just ask him here to dinner , some o ' these times , Mas ' r George , '' she added ; `` it would look quite pretty of ye . 
Ye know , Mas ' r George , ye oughtenter feel ` bove nobody , on ` count yer privileges , 'cause all our privileges is gi 'n to us ; we ought al ` ays to ` member that , '' said Aunt Chloe , looking quite serious . 
`` Well , I mean to ask Tom here , some day next week , '' said George ; `` and you do your prettiest , Aunt Chloe , and we 'll make him stare . 
Wo n't we make him eat so he wo n't get over it for a fortnight ? '' 
`` Yes , yes -- sartin , '' said Aunt Chloe , delighted ; `` you 'll see . 
Lor ! 
to think of some of our dinners ! 
Yer mind dat ar great chicken pie I made when we guv de dinner to General Knox ? 
I and Missis , we come pretty near quarrelling about dat ar crust . 
What does get into ladies sometimes , I do n't know ; but , sometimes , when a body has de heaviest kind o ' ` sponsibility on 'em , as ye may say , and is all kinder ` seris ' and taken up , dey takes dat ar time to be hangin ' round and kinder interferin ' ! 
Now , Missis , she wanted me to do dis way , and she wanted me to do dat way ; and , finally , I got kinder sarcy , and , says I , ` Now , Missis , do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o ' yourn with long fingers , and all a sparkling with rings , like my white lilies when de dew 's on 'em ; and look at my great black stumpin hands . 
Now , do n't ye think dat de Lord must have meant me to make de pie-crust , and you to stay in de parlor ? 
Dar ! 
I was jist so sarcy , Mas ' r George . '' 
`` And what did mother say ? '' 
said George . 
`` Say ? 
-- why , she kinder larfed in her eyes -- dem great handsome eyes o ' hern ; and , says she , ` Well , Aunt Chloe , I think you are about in the right on ` t , ' says she ; and she went off in de parlor . 
She oughter cracked me over de head for bein ' so sarcy ; but dar 's whar ' t is -- I ca n't do nothin ' with ladies in de kitchen ! '' 
`` Well , you made out well with that dinner , -- I remember everybody said so , '' said George . 
`` Did n't I ? 
And wa n't I behind de dinin ' - room door dat bery day ? 
and did n't I see de General pass his plate three times for some more dat bery pie ? 
-- and , says he , ` You must have an uncommon cook , Mrs. Shelby . ' 
Lor ! 
I was fit to split myself . 
`` And de Gineral , he knows what cookin ' is , '' said Aunt Chloe , drawing herself up with an air . 
`` Bery nice man , de Gineral ! 
He comes of one of de bery fustest families in Old Virginny ! 
He knows what 's what , now , as well as I do -- de Gineral . 
Ye see , there 's pints in all pies , Mas ' r George ; but ta n't everybody knows what they is , or as orter be . 
But the Gineral , he knows ; I knew by his ` marks he made . 
Yes , he knows what de pints is ! '' 
By this time , Master George had arrived at that pass to which even a boy can come -LRB- under uncommon circumstances , when he really could not eat another morsel -RRB- , and , therefore , he was at leisure to notice the pile of woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations hungrily from the opposite corner . 
`` Here , you Mose , Pete , '' he said , breaking off liberal bits , and throwing it at them ; `` you want some , do n't you ? 
Come , Aunt Chloe , bake them some cakes . '' 
And George and Tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney-corner , while Aunte Chloe , after baking a goodly pile of cakes , took her baby on her lap , and began alternately filling its mouth and her own , and distributing to Mose and Pete , who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table , tickling each other , and occasionally pulling the baby 's toes . 
`` O ! 
go long , will ye ? '' 
said the mother , giving now and then a kick , in a kind of general way , under the table , when the movement became too obstreperous . 
`` Ca n't ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye ? 
Stop dat ar , now , will ye ? 
Better mind yerselves , or I 'll take ye down a button-hole lower , when Mas ' r George is gone ! '' 
What meaning was couched under this terrible threat , it is difficult to say ; but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce very little impression on the young sinners addressed . 
`` La , now ! '' 
said Uncle Tom , `` they are so full of tickle all the while , they ca n't behave theirselves . '' 
Here the boys emerged from under the table , and , with hands and faces well plastered with molasses , began a vigorous kissing of the baby . 
`` Get along wid ye ! '' 
said the mother , pushing away their woolly heads . 
`` Ye 'll all stick together , and never get clar , if ye do dat fashion . 
Go long to de spring and wash yerselves ! '' 
she said , seconding her exhortations by a slap , which resounded very formidably , but which seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones , as they tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors , where they fairly screamed with merriment . 
`` Did ye ever see such aggravating young uns ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe , rather complacently , as , producing an old towel , kept for such emergencies , she poured a little water out of the cracked tea-pot on it , and began rubbing off the molasses from the baby 's face and hands ; and , having polished her till she shone , she set her down in Tom 's lap , while she busied herself in clearing away supper . 
The baby employed the intervals in pulling Tom 's nose , scratching his face , and burying her fat hands in his woolly hair , which last operation seemed to afford her special content . 
`` Aint she a peart young un ? '' 
said Tom , holding her from him to take a full-length view ; then , getting up , he set her on his broad shoulder , and began capering and dancing with her , while Mas ' r George snapped at her with his pocket-handkerchief , and Mose and Pete , now returned again , roared after her like bears , till Aunt Chloe declared that they `` fairly took her head off '' with their noise . 
As , according to her own statement , this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin , the declaration no whit abated the merriment , till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure . 
`` Well , now , I hopes you 're done , '' said Aunt Chloe , who had been busy in pulling out a rude box of a trundle-bed ; `` and now , you Mose and you Pete , get into thar ; for we 's goin ' to have the meetin ' . '' 
`` O mother , we do n't wanter . 
We wants to sit up to meetin ' , -- meetin 's is so curis . 
We likes 'em . '' 
`` La , Aunt Chloe , shove it under , and let 'em sit up , '' said Mas ' r George , decisively , giving a push to the rude machine . 
Aunt Chloe , having thus saved appearances , seemed highly delighted to push the thing under , saying , as she did so , `` Well , mebbe ' t will do 'em some good . '' 
The house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole , to consider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting . 
`` What we 's to do for cheers , now , I declar I do n't know , '' said Aunt Chloe . 
As the meeting had been held at Uncle Tom 's weekly , for an indefinite length of time , without any more `` cheers , '' there seemed some encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present . 
`` Old Uncle Peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer , last week , '' suggested Mose . 
`` You go long ! 
I 'll boun ' you pulled 'em out ; some o ' your shines , '' said Aunt Chloe . 
`` Well , it 'll stand , if it only keeps jam up agin de wall ! '' 
said Mose . 
`` Den Uncle Peter mus 'n' t sit in it , cause he al ` ays hitches when he gets a singing . 
He hitched pretty nigh across de room , t ' other night , '' said Pete . 
`` Good Lor ! 
get him in it , then , '' said Mose , `` and den he 'd begin , ` Come saints -- and sinners , hear me tell , ' and den down he 'd go , '' -- and Mose imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man , tumbling on the floor , to illustrate the supposed catastrophe . 
`` Come now , be decent , ca n't ye ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe ; `` a n't yer shamed ? '' 
Mas ' r George , however , joined the offender in the laugh , and declared decidedly that Mose was a `` buster . '' 
So the maternal admonition seemed rather to fail of effect . 
`` Well , ole man , '' said Aunt Chloe , `` you 'll have to tote in them ar bar ` ls . '' 
`` Mother 's bar ` ls is like dat ar widder 's , Mas ' r George was reading ` bout , in de good book , -- dey never fails , '' said Mose , aside to Peter . 
`` I 'm sure one on 'em caved in last week , '' said Pete , `` and let 'em all down in de middle of de singin ' ; dat ar was failin ' , warnt it ? '' 
During this aside between Mose and Pete , two empty casks had been rolled into the cabin , and being secured from rolling , by stones on each side , boards were laid across them , which arrangement , together with the turning down of certain tubs and pails , and the disposing of the rickety chairs , at last completed the preparation . 
`` Mas ' r George is such a beautiful reader , now , I know he 'll stay to read for us , '' said Aunt Chloe ; '' ` pears like ' t will be so much more interestin ' . '' 
George very readily consented , for your boy is always ready for anything that makes him of importance . 
The room was soon filled with a motley assemblage , from the old gray-headed patriarch of eighty , to the young girl and lad of fifteen . 
A little harmless gossip ensued on various themes , such as where old Aunt Sally got her new red headkerchief , and how `` Missis was a going to give Lizzy that spotted muslin gown , when she 'd got her new berage made up ; '' and how Mas ' r Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt , that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place . 
A few of the worshippers belonged to families hard by , who had got permission to attend , and who brought in various choice scraps of information , about the sayings and doings at the house and on the place , which circulated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles . 
After a while the singing commenced , to the evident delight of all present . 
Not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent the effect of the naturally fine voices , in airs at once wild and spirited . 
The words were sometimes the well-known and common hymns sung in the churches about , and sometimes of a wilder , more indefinite character , picked up at camp-meetings . 
The chorus of one of them , which ran as follows , was sung with great energy and unction : `` Die on the field of battle , Die on the field of battle , Glory in my soul . '' 
Another special favorite had oft repeated the words -- `` O , I 'm going to glory , -- wo n't you come along with me ? 
Do n't you see the angels beck ` ning , and a calling me away ? 
Do n't you see the golden city and the everlasting day ? '' 
There were others , which made incessant mention of `` Jordan 's banks , '' and `` Canaan 's fields , '' and the `` New Jerusalem ; '' for the negro mind , impassioned and imaginative , always attaches itself to hymns and expressions of a vivid and pictorial nature ; and , as they sung , some laughed , and some cried , and some clapped hands , or shook hands rejoicingly with each other , as if they had fairly gained the other side of the river . 
Various exhortations , or relations of experience , followed , and intermingled with the singing . 
One old gray-headed woman , long past work , but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past , rose , and leaning on her staff , said -- `` Well , chil ` en ! 
Well , I 'm mighty glad to hear ye all and see ye all once more , 'cause I do n't know when I 'll be gone to glory ; but I 've done got ready , chil ` en ; ` pears like I 'd got my little bundle all tied up , and my bonnet on , jest a waitin ' for the stage to come along and take me home ; sometimes , in the night , I think I hear the wheels a rattlin ' , and I 'm lookin ' out all the time ; now , you jest be ready too , for I tell ye all , chil ` en , '' she said striking her staff hard on the floor , `` dat ar glory is a mighty thing ! 
It 's a mighty thing , chil ` en , -- you don ` no nothing about it , -- it 's wonderful . '' 
And the old creature sat down , with streaming tears , as wholly overcome , while the whole circle struck up -- `` O Canaan , bright Canaan I 'm bound for the land of Canaan . '' 
Mas ' r George , by request , read the last chapters of Revelation , often interrupted by such exclamations as `` The sakes now ! '' 
`` Only hear that ! '' 
`` Jest think on ` t ! '' 
`` Is all that a comin ' sure enough ? '' 
George , who was a bright boy , and well trained in religious things by his mother , finding himself an object of general admiration , threw in expositions of his own , from time to time , with a commendable seriousness and gravity , for which he was admired by the young and blessed by the old ; and it was agreed , on all hands , that `` a minister could n't lay it off better than he did ; that ' t was reely ` mazin ' ! '' 
Uncle Tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters , in the neighborhood . 
Having , naturally , an organization in which the morale was strongly predominant , together with a greater breadth and cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions , he was looked up to with great respect , as a sort of minister among them ; and the simple , hearty , sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better educated persons . 
But it was in prayer that he especially excelled . 
Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity , the childlike earnestness , of his prayer , enriched with the language of Scripture , which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his being , as to have become a part of himself , and to drop from his lips unconsciously ; in the language of a pious old negro , he `` prayed right up . '' 
And so much did his prayer always work on the devotional feelings of his audiences , that there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him . 
While this scene was passing in the cabin of the man , one quite otherwise passed in the halls of the master . 
The trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room afore-named , at a table covered with papers and writing utensils . 
Mr. Shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills , which , as they were counted , he pushed over to the trader , who counted them likewise . 
`` All fair , '' said the trader ; `` and now for signing these yer . '' 
Mr. Shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him , and signed them , like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business , and then pushed them over with the money . 
Haley produced , from a well-worn valise , a parchment , which , after looking over it a moment , he handed to Mr. Shelby , who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness . 
`` Wal , now , the thing 's done ! '' 
said the trader , getting up . 
`` It 's done ! '' 
said Mr. Shelby , in a musing tone ; and , fetching a long breath , he repeated , `` It 's done ! '' 
`` Yer do n't seem to feel much pleased with it , ` pears to me , '' said the trader . 
`` Haley , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` I hope you 'll remember that you promised , on your honor , you would n't sell Tom , without knowing what sort of hands he 's going into . '' 
`` Why , you 've just done it sir , '' said the trader . 
`` Circumstances , you well know , obliged me , '' said Shelby , haughtily . 
`` Wal , you know , they may ` blige me , too , '' said the trader . 
`` Howsomever , I 'll do the very best I can in gettin ' Tom a good berth ; as to my treatin ' on him bad , you need n't be a grain afeard . 
If there 's anything that I thank the Lord for , it is that I 'm never noways cruel . '' 
After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles , Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations ; but , as they were the best comfort the case admitted of , he allowed the trader to depart in silence , and betook himself to a solitary cigar . 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night . 
He was lounging in a large easy-chair , looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail , and she was standing before her mirror , brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair ; for , noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes , she had excused her attendance that night , and ordered her to bed . 
The employment , naturally enough , suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning ; and turning to her husband , she said , carelessly , `` By the by , Arthur , who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today ? '' 
`` Haley is his name , '' said Shelby , turning himself rather uneasily in his chair , and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter . 
`` Haley ! 
Who is he , and what may be his business here , pray ? '' 
`` Well , he 's a man that I transacted some business with , last time I was at Natchez , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` And he presumed on it to make himself quite at home , and call and dine here , ay ? '' 
`` Why , I invited him ; I had some accounts with him , '' said Shelby . 
`` Is he a negro-trader ? '' 
said Mrs. Shelby , noticing a certain embarrassment in her husband 's manner . 
`` Why , my dear , what put that into your head ? '' 
said Shelby , looking up . 
`` Nothing , -- only Eliza came in here , after dinner , in a great worry , crying and taking on , and said you were talking with a trader , and that she heard him make an offer for her boy -- the ridiculous little goose ! '' 
`` She did , hey ? '' 
said Mr. Shelby , returning to his paper , which he seemed for a few moments quite intent upon , not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards . 
`` It will have to come out , '' said he , mentally ; `` as well now as ever . '' 
`` I told Eliza , '' said Mrs. Shelby , as she continued brushing her hair , `` that she was a little fool for her pains , and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons . 
Of course , I knew you never meant to sell any of our people , -- least of all , to such a fellow . '' 
`` Well , Emily , '' said her husband , `` so I have always felt and said ; but the fact is that my business lies so that I can not get on without . 
I shall have to sell some of my hands . '' 
`` To that creature ? 
Impossible ! 
Mr. Shelby , you can not be serious . '' 
`` I 'm sorry to say that I am , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` I 've agreed to sell Tom . '' 
`` What ! 
our Tom ? 
-- that good , faithful creature ! 
-- been your faithful servant from a boy ! 
O , Mr. Shelby ! 
-- and you have promised him his freedom , too , -- you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it . 
Well , I can believe anything now , -- I can believe now that you could sell little Harry , poor Eliza 's only child ! '' 
said Mrs. Shelby , in a tone between grief and indignation . 
`` Well , since you must know all , it is so . 
I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both ; and I do n't know why I am to be rated , as if I were a monster , for doing what every one does every day . '' 
`` But why , of all others , choose these ? '' 
said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` Why sell them , of all on the place , if you must sell at all ? '' 
`` Because they will bring the highest sum of any , -- that 's why . 
I could choose another , if you say so . 
The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza , if that would suit you any better , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` The wretch ! '' 
said Mrs. Shelby , vehemently . 
`` Well , I did n't listen to it , a moment , -- out of regard to your feelings , I would n't ; -- so give me some credit . '' 
`` My dear , '' said Mrs. Shelby , recollecting herself , `` forgive me . 
I have been hasty . 
I was surprised , and entirely unprepared for this ; -- but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures . 
Tom is a noble-hearted , faithful fellow , if he is black . 
I do believe , Mr. Shelby , that if he were put to it , he would lay down his life for you . '' 
`` I know it , -- I dare say ; -- but what 's the use of all this ? 
-- I ca n't help myself . '' 
`` Why not make a pecuniary sacrifice ? 
I 'm willing to bear my part of the inconvenience . 
O , Mr. Shelby , I have tried -- tried most faithfully , as a Christian woman should -- to do my duty to these poor , simple , dependent creatures . 
I have cared for them , instructed them , watched over them , and know all their little cares and joys , for years ; and how can I ever hold up my head again among them , if , for the sake of a little paltry gain , we sell such a faithful , excellent , confiding creature as poor Tom , and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and value ? 
I have taught them the duties of the family , of parent and child , and husband and wife ; and how can I bear to have this open acknowledgment that we care for no tie , no duty , no relation , however sacred , compared with money ? 
I have talked with Eliza about her boy -- her duty to him as a Christian mother , to watch over him , pray for him , and bring him up in a Christian way ; and now what can I say , if you tear him away , and sell him , soul and body , to a profane , unprincipled man , just to save a little money ? 
I have told her that one soul is worth more than all the money in the world ; and how will she believe me when she sees us turn round and sell her child ? 
-- sell him , perhaps , to certain ruin of body and soul ! '' 
`` I 'm sorry you feel so about it , -- indeed I am , '' said Mr. Shelby ; `` and I respect your feelings , too , though I do n't pretend to share them to their full extent ; but I tell you now , solemnly , it 's of no use -- I ca n't help myself . 
I did n't mean to tell you this Emily ; but , in plain words , there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything . 
Either they must go , or all must . 
Haley has come into possession of a mortgage , which , if I do n't clear off with him directly , will take everything before it . 
I 've raked , and scraped , and borrowed , and all but begged , -- and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance , and I had to give them up . 
Haley fancied the child ; he agreed to settle the matter that way , and no other . 
I was in his power , and had to do it . 
If you feel so to have them sold , would it be any better to have all sold ? '' 
Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken . 
Finally , turning to her toilet , she rested her face in her hands , and gave a sort of groan . 
`` This is God 's curse on slavery ! 
-- a bitter , bitter , most accursed thing ! 
-- a curse to the master and a curse to the slave ! 
I was a fool to think I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil . 
It is a sin to hold a slave under laws like ours , -- I always felt it was , -- I always thought so when I was a girl , -- I thought so still more after I joined the church ; but I thought I could gild it over , -- I thought , by kindness , and care , and instruction , I could make the condition of mine better than freedom -- fool that I was ! '' 
`` Why , wife , you are getting to be an abolitionist , quite . '' 
`` Abolitionist ! 
if they knew all I know about slavery , they might talk ! 
We do n't need them to tell us ; you know I never thought that slavery was right -- never felt willing to own slaves . '' 
`` Well , therein you differ from many wise and pious men , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` You remember Mr. B. 's sermon , the other Sunday ? '' 
`` I do n't want to hear such sermons ; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our church again . 
Ministers ca n't help the evil , perhaps , -- ca n't cure it , any more than we can , -- but defend it ! 
-- it always went against my common sense . 
And I think you did n't think much of that sermon , either . '' 
`` Well , '' said Shelby , `` I must say these ministers sometimes carry matters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do . 
We men of the world must wink pretty hard at various things , and get used to a deal that is n't the exact thing . 
But we do n't quite fancy , when women and ministers come out broad and square , and go beyond us in matters of either modesty or morals , that 's a fact . 
But now , my dear , I trust you see the necessity of the thing , and you see that I have done the very best that circumstances would allow . '' 
`` O yes , yes ! '' 
said Mrs. Shelby , hurriedly and abstractedly fingering her gold watch , -- `` I have n't any jewelry of any amount , '' she added , thoughtfully ; `` but would not this watch do something ? 
-- it was an expensive one , when it was bought . 
If I could only at least save Eliza 's child , I would sacrifice anything I have . '' 
`` I 'm sorry , very sorry , Emily , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` I 'm sorry this takes hold of you so ; but it will do no good . 
The fact is , Emily , the thing 's done ; the bills of sale are already signed , and in Haley 's hands ; and you must be thankful it is no worse . 
That man has had it in his power to ruin us all , -- and now he is fairly off . 
If you knew the man as I do , you 'd think that we had had a narrow escape . '' 
`` Is he so hard , then ? '' 
`` Why , not a cruel man , exactly , but a man of leather , -- a man alive to nothing but trade and profit , -- cool , and unhesitating , and unrelenting , as death and the grave . 
He 'd sell his own mother at a good percentage -- not wishing the old woman any harm , either . '' 
`` And this wretch owns that good , faithful Tom , and Eliza 's child ! '' 
`` Well , my dear , the fact is that this goes rather hard with me ; it 's a thing I hate to think of . 
Haley wants to drive matters , and take possession tomorrow . 
I 'm going to get out my horse bright and early , and be off . 
I ca n't see Tom , that 's a fact ; and you had better arrange a drive somewhere , and carry Eliza off . 
Let the thing be done when she is out of sight . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Mrs. Shelby ; `` I 'll be in no sense accomplice or help in this cruel business . 
I 'll go and see poor old Tom , God help him , in his distress ! 
They shall see , at any rate , that their mistress can feel for and with them . 
As to Eliza , I dare not think about it . 
The Lord forgive us ! 
What have we done , that this cruel necessity should come on us ? '' 
There was one listener to this conversation whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby little suspected . 
Communicating with their apartment was a large closet , opening by a door into the outer passage . 
When Mrs. Shelby had dismissed Eliza for the night , her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this closet ; and she had hidden herself there , and , with her ear pressed close against the crack of the door , had lost not a word of the conversation . 
When the voices died into silence , she rose and crept stealthily away . 
Pale , shivering , with rigid features and compressed lips , she looked an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been hitherto . 
She moved cautiously along the entry , paused one moment at her mistress ' door , and raised her hands in mute appeal to Heaven , and then turned and glided into her own room . 
It was a quiet , neat apartment , on the same floor with her mistress . 
There was a pleasant sunny window , where she had often sat singing at her sewing ; there a little case of books , and various little fancy articles , ranged by them , the gifts of Christmas holidays ; there was her simple wardrobe in the closet and in the drawers : -- here was , in short , her home ; and , on the whole , a happy one it had been to her . 
But there , on the bed , lay her slumbering boy , his long curls falling negligently around his unconscious face , his rosy mouth half open , his little fat hands thrown out over the bedclothes , and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his whole face . 
`` Poor boy ! 
poor fellow ! '' 
said Eliza ; `` they have sold you ! 
but your mother will save you yet ! '' 
No tear dropped over that pillow ; in such straits as these , the heart has no tears to give , -- it drops only blood , bleeding itself away in silence . 
She took a piece of paper and a pencil , and wrote , hastily , `` O , Missis ! 
dear Missis ! 
do n't think me ungrateful , -- do n't think hard of me , any way , -- I heard all you and master said tonight . 
I am going to try to save my boy -- you will not blame me ! 
God bless and reward you for all your kindness ! '' 
Hastily folding and directing this , she went to a drawer and made up a little package of clothing for her boy , which she tied with a handkerchief firmly round her waist ; and , so fond is a mother 's remembrance , that , even in the terrors of that hour , she did not forget to put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys , reserving a gayly painted parrot to amuse him , when she should be called on to awaken him . 
It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper ; but , after some effort , he sat up , and was playing with his bird , while his mother was putting on her bonnet and shawl . 
`` Where are you going , mother ? '' 
said he , as she drew near the bed , with his little coat and cap . 
His mother drew near , and looked so earnestly into his eyes , that he at once divined that something unusual was the matter . 
`` Hush , Harry , '' she said ; `` must n't speak loud , or they will hear us . 
A wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother , and carry him ` way off in the dark ; but mother wo n't let him -- she 's going to put on her little boy 's cap and coat , and run off with him , so the ugly man ca n't catch him . '' 
Saying these words , she had tied and buttoned on the child 's simple outfit , and , taking him in her arms , she whispered to him to be very still ; and , opening a door in her room which led into the outer verandah , she glided noiselessly out . 
It was a sparkling , frosty , starlight night , and the mother wrapped the shawl close round her child , as , perfectly quiet with vague terror , he clung round her neck . 
Old Bruno , a great Newfoundland , who slept at the end of the porch , rose , with a low growl , as she came near . 
She gently spoke his name , and the animal , an old pet and playmate of hers , instantly , wagging his tail , prepared to follow her , though apparently revolving much , in this simple dog 's head , what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might mean . 
Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably ; for he often stopped , as Eliza glided forward , and looked wistfully , first at her and then at the house , and then , as if reassured by reflection , he pattered along after her again . 
A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom 's cottage , and Eliza stopping , tapped lightly on the window-pane . 
The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom 's had , in the order of hymn-singing , been protracted to a very late hour ; and , as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards , the consequence was , that , although it was now between twelve and one o'clock , he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep . 
`` Good Lord ! 
what 's that ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe , starting up and hastily drawing the curtain . 
`` My sakes alive , if it a n't Lizy ! 
Get on your clothes , old man , quick ! 
-- there 's old Bruno , too , a pawin round ; what on airth ! 
I 'm gwine to open the door . '' 
And suiting the action to the word , the door flew open , and the light of the tallow candle , which Tom had hastily lighted , fell on the haggard face and dark , wild eyes of the fugitive . 
`` Lord bless you ! 
-- I 'm skeered to look at ye , Lizy ! 
Are ye tuck sick , or what 's come over ye ? '' 
`` I 'm running away -- Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe -- carrying off my child -- Master sold him ! '' 
`` Sold him ? '' 
echoed both , lifting up their hands in dismay . 
`` Yes , sold him ! '' 
said Eliza , firmly ; `` I crept into the closet by Mistress ' door tonight , and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry , and you , Uncle Tom , both , to a trader ; and that he was going off this morning on his horse , and that the man was to take possession today . '' 
Tom had stood , during this speech , with his hands raised , and his eyes dilated , like a man in a dream . 
Slowly and gradually , as its meaning came over him , he collapsed , rather than seated himself , on his old chair , and sunk his head down upon his knees . 
`` The good Lord have pity on us ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe . 
`` O ! 
it do n't seem as if it was true ! 
What has he done , that Mas ' r should sell him ? '' 
`` He has n't done anything , -- it is n't for that . 
Master do n't want to sell , and Missis she 's always good . 
I heard her plead and beg for us ; but he told her ' t was no use ; that he was in this man 's debt , and that this man had got the power over him ; and that if he did n't pay him off clear , it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people , and move off . 
Yes , I heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all , the man was driving him so hard . 
Master said he was sorry ; but oh , Missis -- you ought to have heard her talk ! 
If she a n't a Christian and an angel , there never was one . 
I 'm a wicked girl to leave her so ; but , then , I ca n't help it . 
She said , herself , one soul was worth more than the world ; and this boy has a soul , and if I let him be carried off , who knows what 'll become of it ? 
It must be right : but , if it a n't right , the Lord forgive me , for I ca n't help doing it ! '' 
`` Well , old man ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , `` why do n't you go , too ? 
Will you wait to be toted down river , where they kill niggers with hard work and starving ? 
I 'd a heap rather die than go there , any day ! 
There 's time for ye , -- be off with Lizy , -- you 've got a pass to come and go any time . 
Come , bustle up , and I 'll get your things together . '' 
Tom slowly raised his head , and looked sorrowfully but quietly around , and said , `` No , no -- I a n't going . 
Let Eliza go -- it 's her right ! 
I would n't be the one to say no -- ` ta n't in natur for her to stay ; but you heard what she said ! 
If I must be sold , or all the people on the place , and everything go to rack , why , let me be sold . 
I s ` pose I can bar it as well as any on 'em , '' he added , while something like a sob and a sigh shook his broad , rough chest convulsively . 
`` Mas ' r always found me on the spot -- he always will . 
I never have broke trust , nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word , and I never will . 
It 's better for me alone to go , than to break up the place and sell all . 
Mas ' r a n't to blame , Chloe , and he 'll take care of you and the poor -- '' Here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads , and broke fairly down . 
He leaned over the back of the chair , and covered his face with his large hands . 
Sobs , heavy , hoarse and loud , shook the chair , and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor ; just such tears , sir , as you dropped into the coffin where lay your first-born son ; such tears , woman , as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe . 
For , sir , he was a man , -- and you are but another man . 
And , woman , though dressed in silk and jewels , you are but a woman , and , in life 's great straits and mighty griefs , ye feel but one sorrow ! 
`` And now , '' said Eliza , as she stood in the door , `` I saw my husband only this afternoon , and I little knew then what was to come . 
They have pushed him to the very last standing place , and he told me , today , that he was going to run away . 
Do try , if you can , to get word to him . 
Tell him how I went , and why I went ; and tell him I 'm going to try and find Canada . 
You must give my love to him , and tell him , if I never see him again , '' she turned away , and stood with her back to them for a moment , and then added , in a husky voice , `` tell him to be as good as he can , and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven . '' 
`` Call Bruno in there , '' she added . 
`` Shut the door on him , poor beast ! 
He must n't go with me ! '' 
A few last words and tears , a few simple adieus and blessings , and clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms , she glided noiselessly away . 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby , after their protracted discussion of the night before , did not readily sink to repose , and , in consequence , slept somewhat later than usual , the ensuing morning . 
`` I wonder what keeps Eliza , '' said Mrs. Shelby , after giving her bell repeated pulls , to no purpose . 
Mr. Shelby was standing before his dressing-glass , sharpening his razor ; and just then the door opened , and a colored boy entered , with his shaving-water . 
`` Andy , '' said his mistress , `` step to Eliza 's door , and tell her I have rung for her three times . 
Poor thing ! '' 
she added , to herself , with a sigh . 
Andy soon returned , with eyes very wide in astonishment . 
`` Lor , Missis ! 
Lizy 's drawers is all open , and her things all lying every which way ; and I believe she 's just done clared out ! '' 
The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment . 
He exclaimed , `` Then she suspected it , and she 's off ! '' 
`` The Lord be thanked ! '' 
said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` I trust she is . '' 
`` Wife , you talk like a fool ! 
Really , it will be something pretty awkward for me , if she is . 
Haley saw that I hesitated about selling this child , and he 'll think I connived at it , to get him out of the way . 
It touches my honor ! '' 
And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily . 
There was great running and ejaculating , and opening and shutting of doors , and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different places , for about a quarter of an hour . 
One person only , who might have shed some light on the matter , was entirely silent , and that was the head cook , Aunt Chloe . 
Silently , and with a heavy cloud settled down over her once joyous face , she proceeded making out her breakfast biscuits , as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her . 
Very soon , about a dozen young imps were roosting , like so many crows , on the verandah railings , each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange Mas ' r of his ill luck . 
`` He 'll be rael mad , I 'll be bound , '' said Andy . '' 
Wo n't he swar ! '' 
said little black Jake . 
`` Yes , for he does swar , '' said woolly-headed Mandy . 
`` I hearn him yesterday , at dinner . 
I hearn all about it then , 'cause I got into the closet where Missis keeps the great jugs , and I hearn every word . '' 
And Mandy , who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard , more than a black cat , now took airs of superior wisdom , and strutted about , forgetting to state that , though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified , she had been fast asleep all the time . 
When , at last , Haley appeared , booted and spurred , he was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand . 
The young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him `` swar , '' which he did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly , as they ducked and dodged hither and thither , to be out of the reach of his riding-whip ; and , all whooping off together , they tumbled , in a pile of immeasurable giggle , on the withered turf under the verandah , where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction . 
`` If I had the little devils ! '' 
muttered Haley , between his teeth . 
`` But you ha ` nt got 'em , though ! '' 
said Andy , with a triumphant flourish , and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader 's back , when he was fairly beyond hearing . 
`` I say now , Shelby , this yer 's a most extro ` rnary business ! '' 
said Haley , as he abruptly entered the parlor . 
`` It seems that gal 's off , with her young un . '' 
`` Mr. Haley , Mrs. Shelby is present , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` I beg pardon , ma'am , '' said Haley , bowing slightly , with a still lowering brow ; `` but still I say , as I said before , this yer 's a sing ` lar report . 
Is it true , sir ? '' 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` if you wish to communicate with me , you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman . 
Andy , take Mr. Haley 's hat and riding-whip . 
Take a seat , sir . 
Yes , sir ; I regret to say that the young woman , excited by overhearing , or having reported to her , something of this business , has taken her child in the night , and made off . '' 
`` I did expect fair dealing in this matter , I confess , '' said Haley . 
`` Well , sir , '' said Mr. Shelby , turning sharply round upon him , `` what am I to understand by that remark ? 
If any man calls my honor in question , I have but one answer for him . '' 
The trader cowered at this , and in a somewhat lower tone said that `` it was plaguy hard on a fellow , that had made a fair bargain , to be gulled that way . '' 
`` Mr. Haley , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` if I did not think you had some cause for disappointment , I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning . 
I say thus much , however , since appearances call for it , that I shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me , as if I were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter . 
Moreover , I shall feel bound to give you every assistance , in the use of horses , servants , & c. , in the recovery of your property . 
So , in short , Haley , '' said he , suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness , `` the best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast , and we will then see what is to be done . '' 
Mrs. Shelby now rose , and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfast-table that morning ; and , deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen 's coffee at the side-board , she left the room . 
`` Old lady do n't like your humble servant , over and above , '' said Haley , with an uneasy effort to be very familiar . 
`` I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom , '' said Mr. Shelby , dryly . 
`` Beg pardon ; of course , only a joke , you know , '' said Haley , forcing a laugh . 
`` Some jokes are less agreeable than others , '' rejoined Shelby . 
`` Devilish free , now I 've signed those papers , cuss him ! '' 
muttered Haley to himself ; `` quite grand , since yesterday ! '' 
Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of Tom 's fate among his compeers on the place . 
It was the topic in every mouth , everywhere ; and nothing was done in the house or in the field , but to discuss its probable results . 
Eliza 's flight -- an unprecedented event on the place -- was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement . 
Black Sam , as he was commonly called , from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place , was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings , with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being , that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington . 
`` It 's an ill wind dat blow nowhar , -- dat ar a fact , '' said Sam , sententiously , giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons , and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender-button , with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted . 
`` Yes , it 's an ill wind blows nowhar , '' he repeated . 
`` Now , dar , Tom 's down -- wal , course der 's room for some nigger to be up -- and why not dis nigger ? 
-- dat 's de idee . 
Tom , a ridin ' round de country -- boots blacked -- pass in his pocket -- all grand as Cuffee -- but who he ? 
Now , why should n't Sam ? 
-- dat 's what I want to know . '' 
`` Halloo , Sam -- O Sam ! 
Mas ' r wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry , '' said Andy , cutting short Sam 's soliloquy . 
`` High ! 
what 's afoot now , young un ? '' 
`` Why , you do n't know , I s ` pose , that Lizy 's cut stick , and clared out , with her young un ? '' 
`` You teach your granny ! '' 
said Sam , with infinite contempt ; `` knowed it a heap sight sooner than you did ; this nigger a n't so green , now ! '' 
`` Well , anyhow , Mas ' r wants Bill and Jerry geared right up ; and you and I 's to go with Mas ' r Haley , to look arter her . '' 
`` Good , now ! 
dat 's de time o ' day ! '' 
said Sam . 
`` It 's Sam dat 's called for in dese yer times . 
He 's de nigger . 
See if I do n't cotch her , now ; Mas ` r 'll see what Sam can do ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
but , Sam , '' said Andy , `` you 'd better think twice ; for Missis do n't want her cotched , and she 'll be in yer wool . '' 
`` High ! '' 
said Sam , opening his eyes . 
`` How you know dat ? '' 
`` Heard her say so , my own self , dis blessed mornin ' , when I bring in Mas ` r 's shaving-water . 
She sent me to see why Lizy did n't come to dress her ; and when I telled her she was off , she jest ris up , and ses she , ` The Lord be praised ; ' and Mas ` r , he seemed rael mad , and ses he , ` Wife , you talk like a fool . ' 
But Lor ! 
she 'll bring him to ! 
I knows well enough how that 'll be , -- it 's allers best to stand Missis ' side the fence , now I tell yer . '' 
Black Sam , upon this , scratched his woolly pate , which , if it did not contain very profound wisdom , still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and countries , and vulgarly denominated `` knowing which side the bread is buttered ; '' so , stopping with grave consideration , he again gave a hitch to his pantaloons , which was his regularly organized method of assisting his mental perplexities . 
`` Der a n't no saying ' -- never -- ` bout no kind o ' thing in dis yer world , '' he said , at last . 
Sam spoke like a philosopher , emphasizing this -- as if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds , and therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly . 
`` Now , sartin I 'd a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world after Lizy , '' added Sam , thoughtfully . 
`` So she would , '' said Andy ; `` but ca n't ye see through a ladder , ye black nigger ? 
Missis do n't want dis yer Mas ' r Haley to get Lizy 's boy ; dat 's de go ! '' 
`` High ! '' 
said Sam , with an indescribable intonation , known only to those who have heard it among the negroes . 
`` And I 'll tell yer more 'n all , '' said Andy ; `` I specs you 'd better be making tracks for dem hosses , -- mighty sudden , too , -- for I hearn Missis ` quirin ' arter yer , -- so you 've stood foolin ' long enough . '' 
Sam , upon this , began to bestir himself in real earnest , and after a while appeared , bearing down gloriously towards the house , with Bill and Jerry in a full canter , and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping , he brought them up alongside of the horse-post like a tornado . 
Haley 's horse , which was a skittish young colt , winced , and bounced , and pulled hard at his halter . 
`` Ho , ho ! '' 
said Sam , `` skeery , ar ye ? '' 
and his black visage lighted up with a curious , mischievous gleam . 
`` I 'll fix ye now ! '' 
said he . 
There was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place , and the small , sharp , triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground . 
With one of these in his fingers , Sam approached the colt , stroked and patted , and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation . 
On pretence of adjusting the saddle , he adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut , in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal , without leaving any perceptible graze or wound . 
`` Dar ! '' 
he said , rolling his eyes with an approving grin ; `` me fix 'em ! '' 
At this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony , beckoning to him . 
Sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at St. James ' or Washington . 
`` Why have you been loitering so , Sam ? 
I sent Andy to tell you to hurry . '' 
`` Lord bless you , Missis ! '' 
said Sam , `` horses wo n't be cotched all in a minit ; they 'd done clared out way down to the south pasture , and the Lord knows whar ! '' 
`` Sam , how often must I tell you not to say ` Lord bless you , and the Lord knows , ' and such things ? 
It 's wicked . '' 
`` O , Lord bless my soul ! 
I done forgot , Missis ! 
I wo n't say nothing of de sort no more . '' 
`` Why , Sam , you just have said it again . '' 
`` Did I ? 
O , Lord ! 
I mean -- I did n't go fur to say it . '' 
`` You must be careful , Sam . '' 
`` Just let me get my breath , Missis , and I 'll start fair . 
I 'll be bery careful . '' 
`` Well , Sam , you are to go with Mr. Haley , to show him the road , and help him . 
Be careful of the horses , Sam ; you know Jerry was a little lame last week ; do n't ride them too fast . '' 
Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice , and strong emphasis . 
`` Let dis child alone for dat ! '' 
said Sam , rolling up his eyes with a volume of meaning . 
`` Lord knows ! 
High ! 
Did n't say dat ! '' 
said he , suddenly catching his breath , with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension , which made his mistress laugh , spite of herself . 
`` Yes , Missis , I 'll look out for de hosses ! '' 
`` Now , Andy , '' said Sam , returning to his stand under the beech-trees , `` you see I would n't be ' t all surprised if dat ar gen ` lman 's crittur should gib a fling , by and by , when he comes to be a gettin ' up . 
You know , Andy , critturs will do such things ; '' and therewith Sam poked Andy in the side , in a highly suggestive manner . 
`` High ! '' 
said Andy , with an air of instant appreciation . 
`` Yes , you see , Andy , Missis wants to make time , -- dat ar 's clar to der most or ` nary ` bserver . 
I jis make a little for her . 
Now , you see , get all dese yer hosses loose , caperin ' permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar , and I spec Mas ' r wo n't be off in a hurry . '' 
Andy grinned . 
`` Yer see , '' said Sam , `` yer see , Andy , if any such thing should happen as that Mas ' r Haley 's horse should begin to act contrary , and cut up , you and I jist lets go of our 'n to help him , and we 'll help him -- oh yes ! '' 
And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders , and broke into a low , immoderate laugh , snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight . 
At this instant , Haley appeared on the verandah . 
Somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee , he came out smiling and talking , in tolerably restored humor . 
Sam and Andy , clawing for certain fragmentary palm-leaves , which they were in the habit of considering as hats , flew to the horseposts , to be ready to `` help Mas ` r. '' Sam 's palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid , as respects its brim ; and the slivers starting apart , and standing upright , gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance , quite equal to that of any Fejee chief ; while the whole brim of Andy 's being departed bodily , he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump , and looked about well pleased , as if to say , `` Who says I have n't got a hat ? ''
