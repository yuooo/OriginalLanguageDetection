The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously . 
Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin . 
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain , now in the seclusion of the sea , became almost a perturbation . 
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah 's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me , with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of . 
But poorly could I withstand them , much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves . 
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions . 
For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked . 
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage . 
Three better , more likely sea-officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a Vineyarder , a Cape man . 
Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor , for a space we had biting Polar weather , though all the time running away from it to the southward ; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed , gradually leaving that merciless winter , and all its intolerable weather behind us . 
It was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch , so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail , foreboding shivers ran over me . 
Reality outran apprehension ; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck . 
There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him , nor of the recovery from any . 
He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness . 
His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like Cellini 's cast Perseus . 
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod-like mark , lividly whitish . 
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it , and without wrenching a single twig , peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom , ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still greenly alive , but branded . 
Whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say . 
By some tacit consent , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates . 
But once Tashtego 's senior , an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew , superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal fray , but in an elemental strife at sea . 
Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab . 
Nevertheless , the old sea-traditions , the immemorial credulities , popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment . 
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole . 
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood . 
It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale 's jaw . 
`` Aye , he was dismasted off Japan , '' said the old Gay-Head Indian once ; `` but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it . 
He has a quiver of 'em . '' 
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained . 
Upon each side of the Pequod 's quarter deck , and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds , there was an auger hole , bored about half an inch or so , into the plank . 
His bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship 's ever-pitching prow . 
There was an infinity of firmest fortitude , a determinate , unsurrenderable wilfulness , in the fixed and fearless , forward dedication of that glance . 
Not a word he spoke ; nor did his officers say aught to him ; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions , they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful , consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye . 
And not only that , but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe . 
Ere long , from his first visit in the air , he withdrew into his cabin . 
But after that morning , he was every day visible to the crew ; either standing in his pivot-hole , or seated upon an ivory stool he had ; or heavily walking the deck . 
As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a recluse ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded . 
And , by and by , it came to pass , that he was almost continually in the air ; but , as yet , for all that he said , or perceptibly did , on the at last sunny deck , he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast . 
But the Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to employ or excite Ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon . 
Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . 
For , as when the red-cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad-hearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air . 
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile . 
Some days elapsed , and ice and icebergs all astern , the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring , which , at sea , almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic . 
The warmly cool , clear , ringing , perfumed , overflowing , redundant days , were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet , heaped up -- flaked up , with rose-water snow . 
The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns ! 
For sleeping man , 't was hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights . 
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world . 
Inward they turned upon the soul , especially when the still mild hours of eve came on ; then , memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights . 
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab 's texture . 
Old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death . 
Among sea-commanders , the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck . 
It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks . 
`` It feels like going down into one 's tomb , '' -- he would mutter to himself -- `` for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle , to go to my grave-dug berth . '' 
So , almost every twenty-four hours , when the watches of the night were set , and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below ; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle , the sailors flung it not rudely down , as by day , but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates ; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail , habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle ; and ere long the old man would emerge , gripping at the iron banister , to help his crippled way . 
Some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks . 
But once , the mood was on him too deep for common regardings ; and as with heavy , lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast , Stubb , the old second mate , came up from below , with a certain unassured , deprecating humorousness , hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks , then , no one could say nay ; but there might be some way of muffling the noise ; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow , and the insertion into it , of the ivory heel . 
Ah ! 
Stubb , thou didst not know Ahab then . 
`` Am I a cannon-ball , Stubb , '' said Ahab , `` that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ? 
But go thy ways ; I had forgot . 
Below to thy nightly grave ; where such as ye sleep between shrouds , to use ye to the filling one at last . 
-- Down , dog , and kennel ! '' 
Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , `` I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir . '' 
`` Avast ! 
gritted Ahab between his set teeth , and violently moving away , as if to avoid some passionate temptation . 
`` No , sir ; not yet , '' said Stubb , emboldened , `` I will not tamely be called a dog , sir . '' 
`` Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I 'll clear the world of thee ! '' 
As he said this , Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect , that Stubb involuntarily retreated . 
`` I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it , '' muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle . 
`` It 's very queer . 
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I do n't well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what 's that ? 
-- down here on my knees and pray for him ? 
Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray . 
It 's queer ; very queer ; and he 's queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he 's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with . 
How he flashed at me ! 
-- his eyes like powder-pans ! 
is he mad ? 
Anyway there 's something on his mind , as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks . 
He aint in his bed now , either , more than three hours out of the twenty-four ; and he do n't sleep then . 
Did n't that Dough-Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man 's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ? 
A hot old man ! 
I guess he 's got what some folks ashore call a conscience ; it 's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say -- worse nor a toothache . 
Well , well ; I do n't know what it is , but the Lord keep me from catching it . 
He 's full of riddles ; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for , every night , as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects ; what 's that for , I should like to know ? 
Who 's made appointments with him in the hold ? 
Ai n't that queer , now ? 
But there 's no telling , it 's the old game -- Here goes for a snooze . 
Damn me , it 's worth a fellow 's while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep . 
And now that I think of it , that 's about the first thing babies do , and that 's a sort of queer , too . 
Damn me , but all things are queer , come to think of 'em . 
But that 's against my principles . 
Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again . 
But how 's that ? 
did n't he call me a dog ? 
blazes ! 
he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT ! 
He might as well have kicked me , and done with it . 
Maybe he DID kick me , and I did n't observe it , I was so taken all aback with his brow , somehow . 
It flashed like a bleached bone . 
What the devil 's the matter with me ? 
I do n't stand right on my legs . 
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out . 
By the Lord , I must have been dreaming , though -- How ? 
how ? 
how ? 
-- but the only way 's to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , I 'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight . '' 
When Stubb had departed , Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks ; and then , as had been usual with him of late , calling a sailor of the watch , he sent him below for his ivory stool , and also his pipe . 
Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked . 
In old Norse times , the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale . 
How could one look at Ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ? 
For a Khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab . 
Some moments passed , during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs , which blew back again into his face . 
`` How now , '' he soliloquized at last , withdrawing the tube , `` this smoking no longer soothes . 
Oh , my pipe ! 
hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone ! 
Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble . 
What business have I with this pipe ? 
This thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs , not among torn iron-grey locks like mine . 
I 'll smoke no more -- '' He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea . 
The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made . 
With slouched hat , Ahab lurchingly paced the planks . 
Next morning Stubb accosted Flask . 
`` Such a queer dream , King-Post , I never had . 
You know the old man 's ivory leg , well I dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when I tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , I kicked my leg right off ! 
And then , presto ! 
Ahab seemed a pyramid , and I , like a blazing fool , kept kicking at it . 
But what was still more curious , Flask -- you know how curious all dreams are -- through all this rage that I was in , I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself , that after all , it was not much of an insult , that kick from Ahab . 
` Why , ' thinks I , ` what 's the row ? 
It 's not a real leg , only a false leg . ' 
And there 's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump . 
That 's what makes a blow from the hand , Flask , fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane . 
The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man . 
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ` what 's his leg now , but a cane -- a whalebone cane . 
Yes , ' thinks I , ` it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick . 
Besides , ' thinks I , ` look at it once ; why , the end of it -- the foot part -- what a small sort of end it is ; whereas , if a broad footed farmer kicked me , THERE 'S a devilish broad insult . 
But this insult is whittled down to a point only . ' 
But now comes the greatest joke of the dream , Flask . 
While I was battering away at the pyramid , a sort of badger-haired old merman , with a hump on his back , takes me by the shoulders , and slews me round . 
` What are you ` bout ? ' 
says he . 
Slid ! 
man , but I was frightened . 
Such a phiz ! 
But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright . 
` What am I about ? ' 
says I at last . 
` And what business is that of yours , I should like to know , Mr. Humpback ? 
Do YOU want a kick ? ' 
By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , I saw ? 
-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out . 
Says I , on second thoughts , ' I guess I wo n't kick you , old fellow . ' 
` Wise Stubb , ' said he , ` wise Stubb ; ' and kept muttering it all the time , a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag . 
Seeing he was n't going to stop saying over his ` wise Stubb , wise Stubb , ' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again . 
But I had only just lifted my foot for it , when he roared out , ` Stop that kicking ! ' 
` Halloa , ' says I , ` what 's the matter now , old fellow ? ' 
` Look ye here , ' says he ; ` let 's argue the insult . 
Captain Ahab kicked ye , did n't he ? ' 
` Yes , he did , ' says I -- ` right HERE it was . ' 
` Very good , ' says he -- ` he used his ivory leg , did n't he ? ' 
` Yes , he did , ' says I. ` Well then , ' says he , ` wise Stubb , what have you to complain of ? 
Did n't he kick with right good will ? 
it was n't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with , was it ? 
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb . 
It 's an honour ; I consider it an honour . 
Listen , wise Stubb . 
In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter-knights of ; but , be YOUR boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of . 
Remember what I say ; BE kicked by him ; account his kicks honours ; and on no account kick back ; for you ca n't help yourself , wise Stubb . 
Do n't you see that pyramid ? ' 
With that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air . 
I snored ; rolled over ; and there I was in my hammock ! 
Now , what do you think of that dream , Flask ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; it seems a sort of foolish to me , tho . ' '' 
`` May be ; may be . 
But it 's made a wise man of me , Flask . 
D'ye see Ahab standing there , sideways looking over the stern ? 
Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says . 
Halloa ! 
What 's that he shouts ? 
Hark ! '' 
`` Mast-head , there ! 
Look sharp , all of ye ! 
There are whales hereabouts ! 
`` If ye see a white one , split your lungs for him ! 
`` What do you think of that now , Flask ? 
ai n't there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ? 
A white whale -- did ye mark that , man ? 
Look ye -- there 's something special in the wind . 
Stand by for it , Flask . 
Ahab has that that 's bloody on his mind . 
But , mum ; he comes this way . '' 
Already we are boldly launched upon the deep ; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored , harbourless immensities . 
Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod 's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow . 
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that I would now fain put before you . 
Yet is it no easy task . 
The classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed . 
Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down . 
`` No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology , '' says Captain Scoresby , A.D. 1820 . 
`` It is not my intention , were it in my power , to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families ... . 
Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal '' -LRB- sperm whale -RRB- , says Surgeon Beale , A.D. 1839 . 
`` Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters . '' 
`` Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea . '' 
`` A field strewn with thorns . '' 
`` All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists . '' 
Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy . 
Nevertheless , though of real knowledge there be little , yet of books there are a plenty ; and so in some small degree , with cetology , or the science of whales . 
Many are the men , small and great , old and new , landsmen and seamen , who have at large or in little , written of the whale . 
Run over a few : -- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J. Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev. T. Cheever . 
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show . 
Of the names in this list of whale authors , only those following Owen ever saw living whales ; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman . 
I mean Captain Scoresby . 
On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale , he is the best existing authority . 
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning . 
And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas . 
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales . 
Yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete . 
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the Greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas . 
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation . 
This is Charing Cross ; hear ye ! 
good people all , -- the Greenland whale is deposed , -- the great sperm whale now reigneth ! 
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt . 
Those books are Beale 's and Bennett 's ; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships , and both exact and reliable men . 
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description . 
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature . 
Far above all other hunted whales , his is an unwritten life . 
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification , if only an easy outline one for the present , hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers . 
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors . 
I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be faulty . 
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description . 
My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology . 
I am the architect , not the builder . 
But it is a ponderous task ; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it . 
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them ; to have one 's hands among the unspeakable foundations , ribs , and very pelvis of the world ; this is a fearful thing . 
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! 
The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me . 
Will he -LRB- the leviathan -RRB- make a covenant with thee ? 
Behold the hope of him is vain ! 
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try . 
There are some preliminaries to settle . 
First : The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish . 
In his System of Nature , A.D. 1776 , Linnaeus declares , `` I hereby separate the whales from the fish . '' 
But of my own knowledge , I know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against Linnaeus 's express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan . 
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : `` On account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem , '' and finally , `` ex lege naturae jure meritoque . '' 
I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin , of Nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient . 
Charley profanely hinted they were humbug . 
Be it known that , waiving all argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me . 
This fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish . 
Above , Linnaeus has given you those items . 
But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded . 
Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ? 
To be short , then , a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL . 
There you have him . 
However contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation . 
A walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is amphibious . 
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first . 
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up-and-down tail . 
Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position . 
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien . 
* Hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology . 
Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host . 
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs -LRB- Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket -RRB- are included by many naturalists among the whales . 
But as these pig-fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , I deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology . 
First : According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS -LRB- subdivisible into CHAPTERS -RRB- , and these shall comprehend them all , both small and large . 
I . 
THE FOLIO WHALE ; II . 
the OCTAVO WHALE ; III . 
the DUODECIMO WHALE . 
As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE ; of the OCTAVO , the GRAMPUS ; of the DUODECIMO , the PORPOISE . 
FOLIOS . 
Among these I here include the following chapters : -- I . 
The SPERM WHALE ; II . 
the RIGHT WHALE ; III . 
the FIN-BACK WHALE ; IV . 
the HUMP-BACKED WHALE ; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE ; VI . 
the SULPHUR-BOTTOM WHALE . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , CHAPTER I. -LRB- SPERM WHALE -RRB- . 
-- This whale , among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale , and the Physeter whale , and the Anvil Headed whale , is the present Cachalot of the French , and the Pottsfich of the Germans , and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words . 
He is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained . 
All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon . 
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do . 
Philologically considered , it is absurd . 
Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale . 
It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses . 
In those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament . 
It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb . 
When , as I opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity . 
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , CHAPTER II . 
-LRB- RIGHT WHALE -RRB- . 
-- In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man . 
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as `` whale oil , '' an inferior article in commerce . 
Among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : The Whale ; the Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great Whale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale . 
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised . 
What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my Folios ? 
It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists ; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen ; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen ; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes . 
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean , on the Brazil Banks , on the Nor ' West Coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds . 
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans . 
But they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction . 
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate . 
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , CHAPTER III . 
-LRB- FIN-BACK -RRB- . 
-- Under this head I reckon a monster which , by the various names of Fin-Back , Tall-Spout , and Long-John , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic , in the New York packet-tracks . 
In the length he attains , and in his baleen , the Fin-back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive . 
His great lips present a cable-like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles . 
His grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object . 
This fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end . 
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface . 
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it . 
On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back . 
The Fin-Back is not gregarious . 
He seems a whale-hater , as some men are man-haters . 
Very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back . 
From having the baleen in his mouth , the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES , that is , whales with baleen . 
Of these so called Whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known . 
Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike-headed whales ; bunched whales ; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen 's names for a few sorts . 
In connection with this appellative of `` Whalebone whales , '' it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents . 
How then ? 
The baleen , hump , back-fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars . 
Thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases . 
Then , this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases . 
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned . 
In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis . 
On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split . 
But it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy -- there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification . 
Nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the Greenland whale 's anatomy more striking than his baleen ? 
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale . 
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated . 
What then remains ? 
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way . 
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted ; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed , for it alone is practicable . 
To proceed . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- CHAPTER IV . 
-LRB- HUMP-BACK -RRB- . 
-- This whale is often seen on the northern American coast . 
He has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor . 
He has a great pack on him like a peddler ; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale . 
At any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one . 
His oil is not very valuable . 
He has baleen . 
He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , CHAPTER V. -LRB- RAZOR-BACK -RRB- . 
-- Of this whale little is known but his name . 
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn . 
Of a retiring nature , he eludes both hunters and philosophers . 
Though no coward , he has never yet shown any part of him but his back , which rises in a long sharp ridge . 
Let him go . 
I know little more of him , nor does anybody else . 
BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , CHAPTER VI . 
-LRB- SULPHUR-BOTTOM -RRB- . 
-- Another retiring gentleman , with a brimstone belly , doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings . 
He is seldom seen ; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas , and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance . 
He is never chased ; he would run away with rope-walks of line . 
Prodigies are told of him . 
Adieu , Sulphur Bottom ! 
I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer . 
Thus ends BOOK I. -LRB- FOLIO -RRB- , and now begins BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- . 
OCTAVOES . 
* -- These embrace the whales of middling magnitude , among which present may be numbered : -- I. , the GRAMPUS ; II. , the BLACK FISH ; III. , the NARWHALE ; IV. , the THRASHER ; V. , the KILLER . 
* Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain . 
Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder 's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does . 
BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , CHAPTER I. -LRB- GRAMPUS -RRB- . 
-- Though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales . 
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one . 
He is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist . 
He swims in herds ; he is never regularly hunted , though his oil is considerable in quantity , and pretty good for light . 
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale . 
BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , CHAPTER II . 
-LRB- BLACK FISH -RRB- . 
-- I give the popular fishermen 's names for all these fish , for generally they are the best . 
Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive , I shall say so , and suggest another . 
I do so now , touching the Black Fish , so-called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales . 
So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please . 
His voracity is well known , and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards , he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face . 
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length . 
He is found in almost all latitudes . 
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming , which looks something like a Roman nose . 
When not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax . 
Though their blubber is very thin , some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil . 
BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , CHAPTER III . 
-LRB- NARWHALE -RRB- , that is , NOSTRIL WHALE . 
-- Another instance of a curiously named whale , so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose . 
The creature is some sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet , though some exceed ten , and even attain to fifteen feet . 
Strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal . 
But it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man . 
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers , it would be hard to say . 
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food . 
Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through . 
But you can not prove either of these surmises to be correct . 
My own opinion is , that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets . 
The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale , the Horned whale , and the Unicorn whale . 
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature . 
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn 's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices . 
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn . 
Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity . 
Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage , when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace , as his bold ship sailed down the Thames ; `` when Sir Martin returned from that voyage , '' saith Black Letter , `` on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale , which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor . '' 
An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature . 
The Narwhale has a very picturesque , leopard-like look , being of a milk-white ground colour , dotted with round and oblong spots of black . 
His oil is very superior , clear and fine ; but there is little of it , and he is seldom hunted . 
He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas . 
BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , CHAPTER IV . 
-LRB- KILLER -RRB- . 
-- Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer , and nothing at all to the professed naturalist . 
From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus . 
He is very savage -- a sort of Feegee fish . 
He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip , and hangs there like a leech , till the mighty brute is worried to death . 
The Killer is never hunted . 
I never heard what sort of oil he has . 
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its indistinctness . 
For we are all killers , on land and on sea ; Bonapartes and Sharks included . 
BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , CHAPTER V. -LRB- THRASHER -RRB- . 
-- This gentleman is famous for his tail , which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes . 
He mounts the Folio whale 's back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process . 
Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer . 
Both are outlaws , even in the lawless seas . 
Thus ends BOOK II . 
-LRB- OCTAVO -RRB- , and begins BOOK III . 
-LRB- DUODECIMO -RRB- . 
DUODECIMOES . 
-- These include the smaller whales . 
I . 
The Huzza Porpoise . 
II . 
The Algerine Porpoise . 
III . 
The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise . 
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject , it may possibly seem strange , that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES -- a word , which , in the popular sense , always conveys an idea of hugeness . 
But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales , by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -- i.e. a spouting fish , with a horizontal tail . 
BOOK III . 
-LRB- DUODECIMO -RRB- , CHAPTER 1 . 
-LRB- HUZZA PORPOISE -RRB- . 
-- This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe . 
The name is of my own bestowal ; for there are more than one sort of porpoises , and something must be done to distinguish them . 
I call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd . 
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner . 
Full of fine spirits , they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward . 
They are the lads that always live before the wind . 
They are accounted a lucky omen . 
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish , then heaven help ye ; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye . 
A well-fed , plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil . 
But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable . 
It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers . 
Sailors put it on their hones . 
Porpoise meat is good eating , you know . 
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts . 
Indeed , his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible . 
But the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature . 
BOOK III . 
-LRB- DUODECIMO -RRB- , CHAPTER II . 
-LRB- ALGERINE PORPOISE -RRB- . 
-- A pirate . 
Very savage . 
He is only found , I think , in the Pacific . 
He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise , but much of the same general make . 
Provoke him , and he will buckle to a shark . 
I have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured . 
BOOK III . 
-LRB- DUODECIMO -RRB- , CHAPTER III . 
-LRB- MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE -RRB- . 
-- The largest kind of Porpoise ; and only found in the Pacific , so far as it is known . 
The only English name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the fishers -- Right-Whale Porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio . 
In shape , he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure . 
He has no fins on his back -LRB- most other porpoises have -RRB- , he has a lovely tail , and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue . 
But his mealy-mouth spoils all . 
Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable , yet a boundary line , distinct as the mark in a ship 's hull , called the `` bright waist , '' that line streaks him from stem to stern , with two separate colours , black above and white below . 
The white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag . 
A most mean and mealy aspect ! 
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise . 
Beyond the DUODECIMO , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales . 
Above , you have all the Leviathans of note . 
But there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive , half-fabulous whales , which , as an American whaleman , I know by reputation , but not personally . 
I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators , who may complete what I have here but begun . 
If any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this System , according to his Folio , Octavo , or Duodecimo magnitude : -- The Bottle-Nose Whale ; the Junk Whale ; the Pudding-Headed Whale ; the Cape Whale ; the Leading Whale ; the Cannon Whale ; the Scragg Whale ; the Coppered Whale ; the Elephant Whale ; the Iceberg Whale ; the Quog Whale ; the Blue Whale ; etc. . 
From Icelandic , Dutch , and old English authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names . 
But I omit them as altogether obsolete ; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds , full of Leviathanism , but signifying nothing . 
Finally : It was stated at the outset , that this system would not be here , and at once , perfected . 
You can not but plainly see that I have kept my word . 
But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished , even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left , with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower . 
For small erections may be finished by their first architects ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the copestone to posterity . 
God keep me from ever completing anything . 
This whole book is but a draught -- nay , but the draught of a draught . 
Oh , Time , Strength , Cash , and Patience ! 
Concerning the officers of the whale-craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet . 
The large importance attached to the harpooneer 's vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder . 
Literally this word means Fat-Cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer . 
In those days , the captain 's authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns , the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme . 
In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged . 
At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain 's more inferior subalterns . 
Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances -LRB- night watches on a whaling ground -RRB- the command of the ship 's deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal . 
Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward . 
Hence , in whale-ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship . 
That is to say , they take their meals in the captain 's cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it . 
Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage -LRB- by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man -RRB- , the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away . 
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth . 
And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or IN TERROREM , or otherwise ; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea . 
Nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve .
