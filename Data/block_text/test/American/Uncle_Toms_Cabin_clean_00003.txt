`` Well , boys , '' said Haley , `` look alive now ; we must lose no time . '' 
`` Not a bit of him , Mas ` r ! '' 
said Sam , putting Haley 's rein in his hand , and holding his stirrup , while Andy was untying the other two horses . 
The instant Haley touched the saddle , the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring , that threw his master sprawling , some feet off , on the soft , dry turf . 
Sam , with frantic ejaculations , made a dive at the reins , but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm-leaf afore-named into the horse 's eyes , which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his nerves . 
So , with great vehemence , he overturned Sam , and , giving two or three contemptuous snorts , flourished his heels vigorously in the air , and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn , followed by Bill and Jerry , whom Andy had not failed to let loose , according to contract , speeding them off with various direful ejaculations . 
And now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion . 
Sam and Andy ran and shouted , -- dogs barked here and there , -- and Mike , Mose , Mandy , Fanny , and all the smaller specimens on the place , both male and female , raced , clapped hands , whooped , and shouted , with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal . 
Haley 's horse , which was a white one , and very fleet and spirited , appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto ; and having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent , gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland , he appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers to approach him , and then , when within a hand 's breadth , whisk off with a start and a snort , like a mischievous beast as he was and career far down into some alley of the wood-lot . 
Nothing was further from Sam 's mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him most befitting , -- and the exertions that he made were certainly most heroic . 
Like the sword of Coeur De Lion , which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle , Sam 's palm-leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught ; there he would bear down full tilt , shouting , `` Now for it ! 
cotch him ! 
cotch him ! '' 
in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment . 
Haley ran up and down , and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously . 
Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony , and Mrs. Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered , -- not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion . 
At last , about twelve o'clock , Sam appeared triumphant , mounted on Jerry , with Haley 's horse by his side , reeking with sweat , but with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils , showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided . 
`` He 's cotched ! '' 
he exclaimed , triumphantly . 
`` If ' t had n't been for me , they might a bust themselves , all on 'em ; but I cotched him ! '' 
`` You ! '' 
growled Haley , in no amiable mood . 
`` If it had n't been for you , this never would have happened . '' 
`` Lord bless us , Mas ` r , '' said Sam , in a tone of the deepest concern , `` and me that has been racin ' and chasin ' till the sweat jest pours off me ! '' 
`` Well , well ! '' 
said Haley , `` you 've lost me near three hours , with your cursed nonsense . 
Now let 's be off , and have no more fooling . '' 
`` Why , Mas ` r , '' said Sam , in a deprecating tone , `` I believe you mean to kill us all clar , horses and all . 
Here we are all just ready to drop down , and the critters all in a reek of sweat . 
Why , Mas ' r wo n't think of startin ' on now till arter dinner . 
Mas ` r 's hoss wants rubben down ; see how he splashed hisself ; and Jerry limps too ; do n't think Missis would be willin ' to have us start dis yer way , no how . 
Lord bless you , Mas ` r , we can ketch up , if we do stop . 
Lizy never was no great of a walker . '' 
Mrs. Shelby , who , greatly to her amusement , had overheard this conversation from the verandah , now resolved to do her part . 
She came forward , and , courteously expressing her concern for Haley 's accident , pressed him to stay to dinner , saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately . 
Thus , all things considered , Haley , with rather an equivocal grace , proceeded to the parlor , while Sam , rolling his eyes after him with unutterable meaning , proceeded gravely with the horses to the stable-yard . 
`` Did yer see him , Andy ? 
did yer see him ? '' 
said Sam , when he had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn , and fastened the horse to a post . 
`` O , Lor , if it war n't as good as a meetin ' , now , to see him a dancin ' and kickin ' and swarin ' at us . 
Did n't I hear him ? 
Swar away , ole fellow -LRB- says I to myself -RRB- ; will yer have yer hoss now , or wait till you cotch him ? 
-LRB- says I -RRB- . 
Lor , Andy , I think I can see him now . '' 
And Sam and Andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their hearts ' content . 
`` Yer oughter seen how mad he looked , when I brought the hoss up . 
Lord , he 'd a killed me , if he durs ' to ; and there I was a standin ' as innercent and as humble . '' 
`` Lor , I seed you , '' said Andy ; `` a n't you an old hoss , Sam ? '' 
`` Rather specks I am , '' said Sam ; `` did yer see Missis up stars at the winder ? 
I seed her laughin ' . '' 
`` I 'm sure , I was racin ' so , I did n't see nothing , '' said Andy . 
`` Well , yer see , '' said Sam , proceeding gravely to wash down Haley 's pony , `` I ` se ` quired what yer may call a habit o ' bobservation , Andy . 
It 's a very ` portant habit , Andy ; and I ` commend yer to be cultivatin ' it , now yer young . 
Hist up that hind foot , Andy . 
Yer see , Andy , it 's bobservation makes all de difference in niggers . 
Did n't I see which way the wind blew dis yer mornin ' ? 
Did n't I see what Missis wanted , though she never let on ? 
Dat ar 's bobservation , Andy . 
I ` spects it 's what you may call a faculty . 
Faculties is different in different peoples , but cultivation of 'em goes a great way . '' 
`` I guess if I had n't helped your bobservation dis mornin ' , yer would n't have seen your way so smart , '' said Andy . 
`` Andy , '' said Sam , `` you 's a promisin ' child , der a n't no manner o ' doubt . 
I thinks lots of yer , Andy ; and I do n't feel no ways ashamed to take idees from you . 
We oughtenter overlook nobody , Andy , cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes . 
And so , Andy , let 's go up to the house now . 
I 'll be boun ' Missis 'll give us an uncommon good bite , dis yer time . '' 
It is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than Eliza , when she turned her footsteps from Uncle Tom 's cabin . 
Her husband 's suffering and dangers , and the danger of her child , all blended in her mind , with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she was running , in leaving the only home she had ever known , and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered . 
Then there was the parting from every familiar object , -- the place where she had grown up , the trees under which she had played , the groves where she had walked many an evening in happier days , by the side of her young husband , -- everything , as it lay in the clear , frosty starlight , seemed to speak reproachfully to her , and ask her whither could she go from a home like that ? 
But stronger than all was maternal love , wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger . 
Her boy was old enough to have walked by her side , and , in an indifferent case , she would only have led him by the hand ; but now the bare thought of putting him out of her arms made her shudder , and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp , as she went rapidly forward . 
The frosty ground creaked beneath her feet , and she trembled at the sound ; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her heart , and quickened her footsteps . 
She wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her ; for she felt the weight of her boy as if it had been a feather , and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on , while from her pale lips burst forth , in frequent ejaculations , the prayer to a Friend above -- `` Lord , help ! 
Lord , save me ! '' 
If it were your Harry , mother , or your Willie , that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader , tomorrow morning , -- if you had seen the man , and heard that the papers were signed and delivered , and you had only from twelve o'clock till morning to make good your escape , -- how fast could you walk ? 
How many miles could you make in those few brief hours , with the darling at your bosom , -- the little sleepy head on your shoulder , -- the small , soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck ? 
For the child slept . 
At first , the novelty and alarm kept him waking ; but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound , and so assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him , that he clung quietly round her neck , only asking , as he found himself sinking to sleep , `` Mother , I do n't need to keep awake , do I ? '' 
`` No , my darling ; sleep , if you want to . '' 
`` But , mother , if I do get asleep , you wo n't let him get me ? '' 
`` No ! 
so may God help me ! '' 
said his mother , with a paler cheek , and a brighter light in her large dark eyes . 
`` You 're sure , a n't you , mother ? '' 
`` Yes , sure ! '' 
said the mother , in a voice that startled herself ; for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within , that was no part of her ; and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder , and was soon asleep . 
How the touch of those warm arms , the gentle breathings that came in her neck , seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements ! 
It seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams , from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping , confiding child . 
Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body , that , for a time , can make flesh and nerve impregnable , and string the sinews like steel , so that the weak become so mighty . 
The boundaries of the farm , the grove , the wood-lot , passed by her dizzily , as she walked on ; and still she went , leaving one familiar object after another , slacking not , pausing not , till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway . 
She had often been , with her mistress , to visit some connections , in the little village of T -- , not far from the Ohio river , and knew the road well . 
To go thither , to escape across the Ohio river , were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape ; beyond that , she could only hope in God . 
When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway , with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement , and which seems to be a sort of inspiration , she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion . 
She therefore put the boy on the ground , and , adjusting her dress and bonnet , she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances . 
In her little bundle she had provided a store of cakes and apples , which she used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child , rolling the apple some yards before them , when the boy would run with all his might after it ; and this ruse , often repeated , carried them over many a half-mile . 
After a while , they came to a thick patch of woodland , through which murmured a clear brook . 
As the child complained of hunger and thirst , she climbed over the fence with him ; and , sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road , she gave him a breakfast out of her little package . 
The boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat ; and when , putting his arms round her neck , he tried to wedge some of his cake into her mouth , it seemed to her that the rising in her throat would choke her . 
`` No , no , Harry darling ! 
mother ca n't eat till you are safe ! 
We must go on -- on -- till we come to the river ! '' 
And she hurried again into the road , and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward . 
She was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known . 
If she should chance to meet any who knew her , she reflected that the well-known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion , as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a fugitive . 
As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage , without a critical survey , and her child was white also , it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected . 
On this presumption , she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse , to rest herself , and buy some dinner for her child and self ; for , as the danger decreased with the distance , the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened , and she found herself both weary and hungry . 
The good woman , kindly and gossipping , seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with ; and accepted , without examination , Eliza 's statement , that she `` was going on a little piece , to spend a week with her friends , '' -- all which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true . 
An hour before sunset , she entered the village of T -- , by the Ohio river , weary and foot-sore , but still strong in heart . 
Her first glance was at the river , which lay , like Jordan , between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side . 
It was now early spring , and the river was swollen and turbulent ; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters . 
Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side , the land bending far out into the water , the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities , and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice , piled one cake over another , thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice , which lodged , and formed a great , undulating raft , filling up the whole river , and extending almost to the Kentucky shore . 
Eliza stood , for a moment , contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things , which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from running , and then turned into a small public house on the bank , to make a few inquiries . 
The hostess , who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire , preparatory to the evening meal , stopped , with a fork in her hand , as Eliza 's sweet and plaintive voice arrested her . 
`` What is it ? '' 
she said . 
`` Is n't there any ferry or boat , that takes people over to B -- , now ? '' 
she said . 
`` No , indeed ! '' 
said the woman ; `` the boats has stopped running . '' 
Eliza 's look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman , and she said , inquiringly , `` May be you 're wanting to get over ? 
-- anybody sick ? 
Ye seem mighty anxious ? '' 
`` I 've got a child that 's very dangerous , '' said Eliza . 
`` I never heard of it till last night , and I 've walked quite a piece today , in hopes to get to the ferry . '' 
`` Well , now , that 's onlucky , '' said the woman , whose motherly sympathies were much aroused ; `` I 'm re ` lly consarned for ye . 
Solomon ! '' 
she called , from the window , towards a small back building . 
A man , in leather apron and very dirty hands , appeared at the door . 
`` I say , Sol , '' said the woman , `` is that ar man going to tote them bar ` ls over tonight ? '' 
`` He said he should try , if ' t was any way prudent , '' said the man . 
`` There 's a man a piece down here , that 's going over with some truck this evening , if he durs ' to ; he 'll be in here to supper tonight , so you 'd better set down and wait . 
That 's a sweet little fellow , '' added the woman , offering him a cake . 
But the child , wholly exhausted , cried with weariness . 
`` Poor fellow ! 
he is n't used to walking , and I 've hurried him on so , '' said Eliza . 
`` Well , take him into this room , '' said the woman , opening into a small bed-room , where stood a comfortable bed . 
Eliza laid the weary boy upon it , and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep . 
For her there was no rest . 
As a fire in her bones , the thought of the pursuer urged her on ; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen , surging waters that lay between her and liberty . 
Here we must take our leave of her for the present , to follow the course of her pursuers . 
Though Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table , yet it was soon seen , as the thing has often been seen before , that it required more than one to make a bargain . 
So , although the order was fairly given out in Haley 's hearing , and carried to Aunt Chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers , that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts , and tosses of her head , and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner . 
For some singular reason , an impression seemed to reign among the servants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay ; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly , to retard the course of things . 
One luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy ; and then gravy had to be got up de novo , with due care and formality , Aunt Chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision , answering shortly , to all suggestions of haste , that she `` war n't a going to have raw gravy on the table , to help nobody 's catchings . '' 
One tumbled down with the water , and had to go to the spring for more ; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events ; and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that `` Mas ' r Haley was mighty oneasy , and that he could n't sit in his cheer no ways , but was a walkin ' and stalkin ' to the winders and through the porch . '' 
`` Sarves him right ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , indignantly . 
`` He 'll get wus nor oneasy , one of these days , if he do n't mend his ways . 
His master 'll be sending for him , and then see how he 'll look ! '' 
`` He 'll go to torment , and no mistake , '' said little Jake . 
`` He desarves it ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , grimly ; `` he 's broke a many , many , many hearts , -- I tell ye all ! '' 
she said , stopping , with a fork uplifted in her hands ; `` it 's like what Mas ' r George reads in Ravelations , -- souls a callin ' under the altar ! 
and a callin ' on the Lord for vengeance on sich ! 
-- and by and by the Lord he 'll hear 'em -- so he will ! '' 
Aunt Chloe , who was much revered in the kitchen , was listened to with open mouth ; and , the dinner being now fairly sent in , the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her , and to listen to her remarks . 
`` Sich 'll be burnt up forever , and no mistake ; wo n't ther ? '' 
said Andy . 
`` I 'd be glad to see it , I 'll be boun ' , '' said little Jake . 
`` Chil ` en ! '' 
said a voice , that made them all start . 
It was Uncle Tom , who had come in , and stood listening to the conversation at the door . 
`` Chil ` en ! '' 
he said , `` I 'm afeard you do n't know what ye 're sayin ' . 
Forever is a dre ` ful word , chil ` en ; it 's awful to think on ` t . 
You oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur . '' 
`` We would n't to anybody but the soul-drivers , '' said Andy ; `` nobody can help wishing it to them , they 's so awful wicked . '' 
`` Do n't natur herself kinder cry out on 'em ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe . 
`` Do n't dey tear der suckin ' baby right off his mother 's breast , and sell him , and der little children as is crying and holding on by her clothes , -- do n't dey pull 'em off and sells 'em ? 
Do n't dey tear wife and husband apart ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe , beginning to cry , `` when it 's jest takin ' the very life on 'em ? 
-- and all the while does they feel one bit , do n't dey drink and smoke , and take it oncommon easy ? 
Lor , if the devil do n't get them , what 's he good for ? '' 
And Aunt Chloe covered her face with her checked apron , and began to sob in good earnest . 
`` Pray for them that ` spitefully use you , the good book says , '' says Tom . 
`` Pray for 'em ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe ; `` Lor , it 's too tough ! 
I ca n't pray for 'em . '' 
`` It 's natur , Chloe , and natur 's strong , '' said Tom , `` but the Lord 's grace is stronger ; besides , you oughter think what an awful state a poor crittur 's soul 's in that 'll do them ar things , -- you oughter thank God that you a n't like him , Chloe . 
I 'm sure I 'd rather be sold , ten thousand times over , than to have all that ar poor crittur 's got to answer for . '' 
`` So 'd I , a heap , '' said Jake . 
`` Lor , should n't we cotch it , Andy ? '' 
Andy shrugged his shoulders , and gave an acquiescent whistle . 
`` I 'm glad Mas ' r did n't go off this morning , as he looked to , '' said Tom ; `` that ar hurt me more than sellin ' , it did . 
Mebbe it might have been natural for him , but ' t would have come desp ' t hard on me , as has known him from a baby ; but I 've seen Mas ` r , and I begin ter feel sort o ' reconciled to the Lord 's will now . 
Mas ' r could n't help hisself ; he did right , but I 'm feared things will be kinder goin ' to rack , when I 'm gone Mas ' r ca n't be spected to be a pryin ' round everywhar , as I 've done , a keepin ' up all the ends . 
The boys all means well , but they 's powerful car ` less . 
That ar troubles me . '' 
The bell here rang , and Tom was summoned to the parlor . 
`` Tom , '' said his master , kindly , `` I want you to notice that I give this gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the spot when he wants you ; he 's going today to look after his other business , and you can have the day to yourself . 
Go anywhere you like , boy . '' 
`` Thank you , Mas ` r , '' said Tom . 
`` And mind yourself , '' said the trader , `` and do n't come it over your master with any o ' yer nigger tricks ; for I 'll take every cent out of him , if you a n't thar . 
If he 'd hear to me , he would n't trust any on ye -- slippery as eels ! '' 
`` Mas ` r , '' said Tom , -- and he stood very straight , -- `` I was jist eight years old when ole Missis put you into my arms , and you was n't a year old . 
` Thar , ' says she , ` Tom , that 's to be your young Mas ` r ; take good care on him , ' says she . 
And now I jist ask you , Mas ` r , have I ever broke word to you , or gone contrary to you , ` specially since I was a Christian ? '' 
Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome , and the tears rose to his eyes . 
`` My good boy , '' said he , `` the Lord knows you say but the truth ; and if I was able to help it , all the world should n't buy you . '' 
`` And sure as I am a Christian woman , '' said Mrs. Shelby , `` you shall be redeemed as soon as I can any way bring together means . 
Sir , '' she said to Haley , `` take good account of who you sell him to , and let me know . '' 
`` Lor , yes , for that matter , '' said the trader , `` I may bring him up in a year , not much the wuss for wear , and trade him back . '' 
`` I 'll trade with you then , and make it for your advantage , '' said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` Of course , '' said the trader , `` all 's equal with me ; li ` ves trade 'em up as down , so I does a good business . 
All I want is a livin ' , you know , ma'am ; that 's all any on us wants , I , s ` pose . '' 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader , and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feelings . 
The more hopelessly sordid and insensible he appeared , the greater became Mrs. Shelby 's dread of his succeeding in recapturing Eliza and her child , and of course the greater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice . 
She therefore graciously smiled , assented , chatted familiarly , and did all she could to make time pass imperceptibly . 
At two o'clock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts , apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning . 
Sam was there new oiled from dinner , with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness . 
As Haley approached , he was boasting , in flourishing style , to Andy , of the evident and eminent success of the operation , now that he had `` farly come to it . '' 
`` Your master , I s ` pose , do n't keep no dogs , '' said Haley , thoughtfully , as he prepared to mount . 
`` Heaps on 'em , '' said Sam , triumphantly ; `` thar 's Bruno -- he 's a roarer ! 
and , besides that , ` bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther . '' 
`` Poh ! '' 
said Haley , -- and he said something else , too , with regard to the said dogs , at which Sam muttered , `` I do n't see no use cussin ' on 'em , no way . '' 
`` But your master do n't keep no dogs -LRB- I pretty much know he do n't -RRB- for trackin ' out niggers . '' 
Sam knew exactly what he meant , but he kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity . 
`` Our dogs all smells round considable sharp . 
I spect they 's the kind , though they ha n't never had no practice . 
They 's far dogs , though , at most anything , if you 'd get 'em started . 
Here , Bruno , '' he called , whistling to the lumbering Newfoundland , who came pitching tumultuously toward them . 
`` You go hang ! '' 
said Haley , getting up . 
`` Come , tumble up now . '' 
Sam tumbled up accordingly , dexterously contriving to tickle Andy as he did so , which occasioned Andy to split out into a laugh , greatly to Haley 's indignation , who made a cut at him with his riding-whip . 
`` I 's ` stonished at yer , Andy , '' said Sam , with awful gravity . 
`` This yer 's a seris bisness , Andy . 
Yer must n't be a makin ' game . 
This yer a n't no way to help Mas ` r. '' `` I shall take the straight road to the river , '' said Haley , decidedly , after they had come to the boundaries of the estate . 
`` I know the way of all of 'em , -- they makes tracks for the underground . '' 
`` Sartin , '' said Sam , `` dat 's de idee . 
Mas ' r Haley hits de thing right in de middle . 
Now , der 's two roads to de river , -- de dirt road and der pike , -- which Mas ' r mean to take ? '' 
Andy looked up innocently at Sam , surprised at hearing this new geographical fact , but instantly confirmed what he said , by a vehement reiteration . 
`` Cause , '' said Sam , `` I 'd rather be ` clined to ` magine that Lizy 'd take de dirt road , bein ' it 's the least travelled . '' 
Haley , notwithstanding that he was a very old bird , and naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff , was rather brought up by this view of the case . 
`` If yer war n't both on yer such cussed liars , now ! '' 
he said , contemplatively as he pondered a moment . 
The pensive , reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse Andy prodigiously , and he drew a little behind , and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse , while Sam 's face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity . 
`` Course , '' said Sam , `` Mas ' r can do as he 'd ruther , go de straight road , if Mas ' r thinks best , -- it 's all one to us . 
Now , when I study ` pon it , I think de straight road de best , deridedly . '' 
`` She would naturally go a lonesome way , '' said Haley , thinking aloud , and not minding Sam 's remark . 
`` Dar a n't no sayin ' , '' said Sam ; `` gals is pecular ; they never does nothin ' ye thinks they will ; mose gen ` lly the contrary . 
Gals is nat ` lly made contrary ; and so , if you thinks they 've gone one road , it is sartin you 'd better go t ' other , and then you 'll be sure to find 'em . 
Now , my private ` pinion is , Lizy took der road ; so I think we 'd better take de straight one . '' 
This profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose Haley particularly to the straight road , and he announced decidedly that he should go the other , and asked Sam when they should come to it . 
`` A little piece ahead , '' said Sam , giving a wink to Andy with the eye which was on Andy 's side of the head ; and he added , gravely , `` but I 've studded on de matter , and I 'm quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way . 
I nebber been over it no way . 
It 's despit lonesome , and we might lose our way , -- whar we 'd come to , de Lord only knows . '' 
`` Nevertheless , '' said Haley , `` I shall go that way . '' 
`` Now I think on ` t , I think I hearn 'em tell that dat ar road was all fenced up and down by der creek , and thar , a n't it , Andy ? '' 
Andy was n't certain ; he 'd only `` hearn tell '' about that road , but never been over it . 
In short , he was strictly noncommittal . 
Haley , accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies of greater or lesser magnitude , thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid . 
The mention of the thing he thought he perceived was involuntary on Sam 's part at first , and his confused attempts to dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts , as being unwilling to implicate Liza . 
When , therefore , Sam indicated the road , Haley plunged briskly into it , followed by Sam and Andy . 
Now , the road , in fact , was an old one , that had formerly been a thoroughfare to the river , but abandoned for many years after the laying of the new pike . 
It was open for about an hour 's ride , and after that it was cut across by various farms and fences . 
Sam knew this fact perfectly well , -- indeed , the road had been so long closed up , that Andy had never heard of it . 
He therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission , only groaning and vociferating occasionally that ' t was `` desp ' t rough , and bad for Jerry 's foot . '' 
`` Now , I jest give yer warning , '' said Haley , `` I know yer ; yer wo n't get me to turn off this road , with all yer fussin ' -- so you shet up ! '' 
`` Mas ' r will go his own way ! '' 
said Sam , with rueful submission , at the same time winking most portentously to Andy , whose delight was now very near the explosive point . 
Sam was in wonderful spirits , -- professed to keep a very brisk lookout , -- at one time exclaiming that he saw `` a gal 's bonnet '' on the top of some distant eminence , or calling to Andy `` if that thar was n't ` Lizy ' down in the hollow ; '' always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy part of the road , where the sudden quickening of speed was a special inconvenience to all parties concerned , and thus keeping Haley in a state of constant commotion . 
After riding about an hour in this way , the whole party made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard belonging to a large farming establishment . 
Not a soul was in sight , all the hands being employed in the fields ; but , as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the road , it was evident that their journey in that direction had reached a decided finale . 
`` Wa n't dat ar what I telled Mas ` r ? '' 
said Sam , with an air of injured innocence . 
`` How does strange gentleman spect to know more about a country dan de natives born and raised ? '' 
`` You rascal ! '' 
said Haley , `` you knew all about this . '' 
`` Did n't I tell yer I knowd , and yer would n't believe me ? 
I telled Mas ' r ' t was all shet up , and fenced up , and I did n't spect we could get through , -- Andy heard me . '' 
It was all too true to be disputed , and the unlucky man had to pocket his wrath with the best grace he was able , and all three faced to the right about , and took up their line of march for the highway . 
In consequence of all the various delays , it was about three-quarters of an hour after Eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into the same place . 
Eliza was standing by the window , looking out in another direction , when Sam 's quick eye caught a glimpse of her . 
Haley and Andy were two yards behind . 
At this crisis , Sam contrived to have his hat blown off , and uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation , which startled her at once ; she drew suddenly back ; the whole train swept by the window , round to the front door . 
A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza . 
Her room opened by a side door to the river . 
She caught her child , and sprang down the steps towards it . 
The trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank ; and throwing himself from his horse , and calling loudly on Sam and Andy , he was after her like a hound after a deer . 
In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground , and a moment brought her to the water 's edge . 
Right on behind they came ; and , nerved with strength such as God gives only to the desperate , with one wild cry and flying leap , she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore , on to the raft of ice beyond . 
It was a desperate leap -- impossible to anything but madness and despair ; and Haley , Sam , and Andy , instinctively cried out , and lifted up their hands , as she did it . 
The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it , but she staid there not a moment . 
With wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake ; stumbling -- leaping -- slipping -- springing upwards again ! 
Her shoes are gone -- her stockings cut from her feet -- while blood marked every step ; but she saw nothing , felt nothing , till dimly , as in a dream , she saw the Ohio side , and a man helping her up the bank . 
`` Yer a brave gal , now , whoever ye ar ! '' 
said the man , with an oath . 
Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home . 
`` O , Mr. Symmes ! 
-- save me -- do save me -- do hide me ! '' 
said Elia . 
`` Why , what 's this ? '' 
said the man . 
`` Why , if ` ta n't Shelby 's gal ! '' 
`` My child ! 
-- this boy ! 
-- he 'd sold him ! 
There is his Mas ` r , '' said she , pointing to the Kentucky shore . 
`` O , Mr. Symmes , you 've got a little boy ! '' 
`` So I have , '' said the man , as he roughly , but kindly , drew her up the steep bank . 
`` Besides , you 're a right brave gal . 
I like grit , wherever I see it . '' 
When they had gained the top of the bank , the man paused . 
`` I 'd be glad to do something for ye , '' said he ; `` but then there 's nowhar I could take ye . 
The best I can do is to tell ye to go thar , '' said he , pointing to a large white house which stood by itself , off the main street of the village . 
`` Go thar ; they 're kind folks . 
Thar 's no kind o ' danger but they 'll help you , -- they 're up to all that sort o ' thing . '' 
`` The Lord bless you ! '' 
said Eliza , earnestly . 
`` No ` casion , no ` casion in the world , '' said the man . 
`` What I 've done 's of no ` count . '' 
`` And , oh , surely , sir , you wo n't tell any one ! '' 
`` Go to thunder , gal ! 
What do you take a feller for ? 
In course not , '' said the man . 
`` Come , now , go along like a likely , sensible gal , as you are . 
You 've arnt your liberty , and you shall have it , for all me . '' 
The woman folded her child to her bosom , and walked firmly and swiftly away . 
The man stood and looked after her . 
`` Shelby , now , mebbe wo n't think this yer the most neighborly thing in the world ; but what 's a feller to do ? 
If he catches one of my gals in the same fix , he 's welcome to pay back . 
Somehow I never could see no kind o ' critter a strivin ' and pantin ' , and trying to clar theirselves , with the dogs arter 'em and go agin 'em . 
Besides , I do n't see no kind of ` casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks , neither . '' 
So spoke this poor , heathenish Kentuckian , who had not been instructed in his constitutional relations , and consequently was betrayed into acting in a sort of Christianized manner , which , if he had been better situated and more enlightened , he would not have been left to do . 
Haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene , till Eliza had disappeared up the bank , when he turned a blank , inquiring look on Sam and Andy . 
`` That ar was a tolable fair stroke of business , '' said Sam . 
`` The gal 's got seven devils in her , I believe ! '' 
said Haley . 
`` How like a wildcat she jumped ! '' 
`` Wal , now , '' said Sam , scratching his head , `` I hope Mas ` r 'll ` scuse us trying dat ar road . 
Do n't think I feel spry enough for dat ar , no way ! '' 
and Sam gave a hoarse chuckle . '' 
You laugh ! '' 
said the trader , with a growl . 
`` Lord bless you , Mas ` r , I could n't help it now , '' said Sam , giving way to the long pent-up delight of his soul . 
`` She looked so curi 's , a leapin ' and springin ' -- ice a crackin ' -- and only to hear her , -- plump ! 
ker chunk ! 
ker splash ! 
Spring ! 
Lord ! 
how she goes it ! '' 
and Sam and Andy laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks . 
`` I 'll make ye laugh t ' other side yer mouths ! '' 
said the trader , laying about their heads with his riding-whip . 
Both ducked , and ran shouting up the bank , and were on their horses before he was up . 
`` Good-evening , Mas ` r ! '' 
said Sam , with much gravity . 
`` I berry much spect Missis be anxious ` bout Jerry . 
Mas ' r Haley wo n't want us no longer . 
Missis would n't hear of our ridin ' the critters over Lizy 's bridge tonight ; '' and , with a facetious poke into Andy 's ribs , he started off , followed by the latter , at full speed , -- their shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind . 
Eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight . 
The gray mist of evening , rising slowly from the river , enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank , and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer . 
Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern , to ponder further what was to be done . 
The woman opened to him the door of a little parlor , covered with a rag carpet , where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth , sundry lank , high-backed wood chairs , with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel-shelf , above a very dimly-smoking grate ; a long hard-wood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney , and here Haley sat him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general . 
`` What did I want with the little cuss , now , '' he said to himself , `` that I should have got myself treed like a coon , as I am , this yer way ? '' 
and Haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of imprecations on himself , which , though there was the best possible reason to consider them as true , we shall , as a matter of taste , omit . 
He was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was apparently dismounting at the door . 
He hurried to the window . 
`` By the land ! 
if this yer a n't the nearest , now , to what I 've heard folks call Providence , '' said Haley . 
`` I do b ` lieve that ar 's Tom Loker . '' 
Haley hastened out . 
Standing by the bar , in the corner of the room , was a brawny , muscular man , full six feet in height , and broad in proportion . 
He was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin , made with the hair outward , which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance , perfectly in keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy . 
In the head and face every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence was in a state of the highest possible development . 
Indeed , could our readers fancy a bull-dog come unto man 's estate , and walking about in a hat and coat , they would have no unapt idea of the general style and effect of his physique . 
He was accompanied by a travelling companion , in many respects an exact contrast to himself . 
He was short and slender , lithe and catlike in his motions , and had a peering , mousing expression about his keen black eyes , with which every feature of his face seemed sharpened into sympathy ; his thin , long nose , ran out as if it was eager to bore into the nature of things in general ; his sleek , thin , black hair was stuck eagerly forward , and all his motions and evolutions expressed a dry , cautious acuteness . 
The great man poured out a big tumbler half full of raw spirits , and gulped it down without a word . 
The little man stood tiptoe , and putting his head first to one side and then the other , and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various bottles , ordered at last a mint julep , in a thin and quivering voice , and with an air of great circumspection . 
When poured out , he took it and looked at it with a sharp , complacent air , like a man who thinks he has done about the right thing , and hit the nail on the head , and proceeded to dispose of it in short and well-advised sips . 
`` Wal , now , who 'd a thought this yer luck ` ad come to me ? 
Why , Loker , how are ye ? '' 
said Haley , coming forward , and extending his hand to the big man . 
`` The devil ! '' 
was the civil reply . 
`` What brought you here , Haley ? '' 
The mousing man , who bore the name of Marks , instantly stopped his sipping , and , poking his head forward , looked shrewdly on the new acquaintance , as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf , or some other possible object of pursuit . 
`` I say , Tom , this yer 's the luckiest thing in the world . 
I 'm in a devil of a hobble , and you must help me out . '' 
`` Ugh ? 
aw ! 
like enough ! '' 
grunted his complacent acquaintance . 
`` A body may be pretty sure of that , when you 're glad to see 'em ; something to be made off of 'em . 
What 's the blow now ? '' 
`` You 've got a friend here ? '' 
said Haley , looking doubtfully at Marks ; `` partner , perhaps ? '' 
`` Yes , I have . 
Here , Marks ! 
here 's that ar feller that I was in with in Natchez . '' 
`` Shall be pleased with his acquaintance , '' said Marks , thrusting out a long , thin hand , like a raven 's claw . 
`` Mr. Haley , I believe ? '' 
`` The same , sir , '' said Haley . 
`` And now , gentlemen , seein ' as we 've met so happily , I think I 'll stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here parlor . 
So , now , old coon , '' said he to the man at the bar , `` get us hot water , and sugar , and cigars , and plenty of the real stuff and we 'll have a blow-out . '' 
Behold , then , the candles lighted , the fire stimulated to the burning point in the grate , and our three worthies seated round a table , well spread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before . 
Haley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles . 
Loker shut up his mouth , and listened to him with gruff and surly attention . 
Marks , who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch to his own peculiar taste , occasionally looked up from his employment , and , poking his sharp nose and chin almost into Haley 's face , gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative . 
The conclusion of it appeared to amuse him extremely , for he shook his shoulders and sides in silence , and perked up his thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment . 
`` So , then , ye ' r fairly sewed up , a n't ye ? '' 
he said ; `` he ! 
he ! 
he ! 
It 's neatly done , too . '' 
`` This yer young-un business makes lots of trouble in the trade , '' said Haley , dolefully . 
`` If we could get a breed of gals that did n't care , now , for their young uns , '' said Marks ; `` tell ye , I think ' t would be ` bout the greatest mod ` rn improvement I knows on , '' -- and Marks patronized his joke by a quiet introductory sniggle . 
`` Jes so , '' said Haley ; `` I never could n't see into it ; young uns is heaps of trouble to 'em ; one would think , now , they 'd be glad to get clar on 'em ; but they ar n't . 
And the more trouble a young un is , and the more good for nothing , as a gen ' l thing , the tighter they sticks to 'em . '' 
`` Wal , Mr. Haley , '' said Marks , '' ` est pass the hot water . 
Yes , sir , you say ` est what I feel and all ` us have . 
Now , I bought a gal once , when I was in the trade , -- a tight , likely wench she was , too , and quite considerable smart , -- and she had a young un that was mis ` able sickly ; it had a crooked back , or something or other ; and I jest gin ' t away to a man that thought he 'd take his chance raising on ` t , being it did n't cost nothin ' ; -- never thought , yer know , of the gal 's takin ' on about it , -- but , Lord , yer oughter seen how she went on . 
Why , re ` lly , she did seem to me to valley the child more 'cause ' t was sickly and cross , and plagued her ; and she war n't making b ` lieve , neither , -- cried about it , she did , and lopped round , as if she 'd lost every friend she had . 
It re ` lly was droll to think on ` t. Lord , there ai n't no end to women 's notions . '' 
`` Wal , jest so with me , '' said Haley . 
`` Last summer , down on Red River , I got a gal traded off on me , with a likely lookin ' child enough , and his eyes looked as bright as yourn ; but , come to look , I found him stone blind . 
Fact -- he was stone blind . 
Wal , ye see , I thought there war n't no harm in my jest passing him along , and not sayin ' nothin ' ; and I 'd got him nicely swapped off for a keg o ' whiskey ; but come to get him away from the gal , she was jest like a tiger . 
So ' t was before we started , and I had n't got my gang chained up ; so what should she do but ups on a cotton-bale , like a cat , ketches a knife from one of the deck hands , and , I tell ye , she made all fly for a minit , till she saw ' t wa n't no use ; and she jest turns round , and pitches head first , young un and all , into the river , -- went down plump , and never ris . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Tom Loker , who had listened to these stories with ill-repressed disgust , -- `` shif ` less , both on ye ! 
my gals do n't cut up no such shines , I tell ye ! '' 
`` Indeed ! 
how do you help it ? '' 
said Marks , briskly . 
`` Help it ? 
why , I buys a gal , and if she 's got a young un to be sold , I jest walks up and puts my fist to her face , and says , ` Look here , now , if you give me one word out of your head , I 'll smash yer face in . 
I wo n't hear one word -- not the beginning of a word . ' 
I says to 'em , ` This yer young un 's mine , and not yourn , and you 've no kind o ' business with it . 
I 'm going to sell it , first chance ; mind , you do n't cut up none o ' yer shines about it , or I 'll make ye wish ye 'd never been born . ' 
I tell ye , they sees it a n't no play , when I gets hold . 
I makes 'em as whist as fishes ; and if one on 'em begins and gives a yelp , why , -- '' and Mr. Loker brought down his fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus . 
`` That ar 's what ye may call emphasis , '' said Marks , poking Haley in the side , and going into another small giggle . 
`` A n't Tom peculiar ? 
he ! 
he ! 
I say , Tom , I s ` pect you make 'em understand , for all niggers ' heads is woolly . 
They do n't never have no doubt o ' your meaning , Tom . 
If you a n't the devil , Tom , you 's his twin brother , I 'll say that for ye ! '' 
Tom received the compliment with becoming modesty , and began to look as affable as was consistent , as John Bunyan says , `` with his doggish nature . '' 
Haley , who had been imbibing very freely of the staple of the evening , began to feel a sensible elevation and enlargement of his moral faculties , -- a phenomenon not unusual with gentlemen of a serious and reflective turn , under similar circumstances . 
`` Wal , now , Tom , '' he said , `` ye re ` lly is too bad , as I al ` ays have told ye ; ye know , Tom , you and I used to talk over these yer matters down in Natchez , and I used to prove to ye that we made full as much , and was as well off for this yer world , by treatin ' on 'em well , besides keepin ' a better chance for comin ' in the kingdom at last , when wust comes to wust , and thar a n't nothing else left to get , ye know . '' 
`` Boh ! '' 
said Tom , '' do n't I know ? 
-- do n't make me too sick with any yer stuff , -- my stomach is a leetle riled now ; '' and Tom drank half a glass of raw brandy . 
`` I say , '' said Haley , and leaning back in his chair and gesturing impressively , `` I 'll say this now , I al ` ays meant to drive my trade so as to make money on ' t fust and foremost , as much as any man ; but , then , trade a n't everything , and money a n't everything , 'cause we 's all got souls . 
I do n't care , now , who hears me say it , -- and I think a cussed sight on it , -- so I may as well come out with it . 
I b ` lieve in religion , and one of these days , when I 've got matters tight and snug , I calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matters ; and so what 's the use of doin ' any more wickedness than 's re ` lly necessary ? 
-- it do n't seem to me it 's ' t all prudent . '' 
`` Tend to yer soul ! '' 
repeated Tom , contemptuously ; `` take a bright lookout to find a soul in you , -- save yourself any care on that score . 
If the devil sifts you through a hair sieve , he wo n't find one . '' 
`` Why , Tom , you 're cross , '' said Haley ; `` why ca n't ye take it pleasant , now , when a feller 's talking for your good ? '' 
`` Stop that ar jaw o ' yourn , there , '' said Tom , gruffly . 
`` I can stand most any talk o ' yourn but your pious talk , -- that kills me right up . 
After all , what 's the odds between me and you ? 
` Ta n't that you care one bit more , or have a bit more feelin ' -- it 's clean , sheer , dog meanness , wanting to cheat the devil and save your own skin ; do n't I see through it ? 
And your ` gettin ' religion , ' as you call it , arter all , is too p ` isin mean for any crittur ; -- run up a bill with the devil all your life , and then sneak out when pay time comes ! 
Bob ! '' 
`` Come , come , gentlemen , I say ; this is n't business , '' said Marks . 
`` There 's different ways , you know , of looking at all subjects . 
Mr. Haley is a very nice man , no doubt , and has his own conscience ; and , Tom , you have your ways , and very good ones , too , Tom ; but quarrelling , you know , wo n't answer no kind of purpose . 
Let 's go to business . 
Now , Mr. Haley , what is it ? 
-- you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal ? '' 
`` The gal 's no matter of mine , -- she 's Shelby 's ; it 's only the boy . 
I was a fool for buying the monkey ! '' 
`` You 're generally a fool ! '' 
said Tom , gruffly . 
`` Come , now , Loker , none of your huffs , '' said Marks , licking his lips ; `` you see , Mr. Haley 's a puttin ' us in a way of a good job , I reckon ; just hold still -- these yer arrangements is my forte . 
This yer gal , Mr. Haley , how is she ? 
what is she ? '' 
`` Wal ! 
white and handsome -- well brought up . 
I 'd a gin Shelby eight hundred or a thousand , and then made well on her . '' 
`` White and handsome -- well brought up ! '' 
said Marks , his sharp eyes , nose and mouth , all alive with enterprise . 
`` Look here , now , Loker , a beautiful opening . 
We 'll do a business here on our own account ; -- we does the catchin ' ; the boy , of course , goes to Mr. Haley , -- we takes the gal to Orleans to speculate on . 
A n't it beautiful ? '' 
Tom , whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication , now suddenly snapped it together , as a big dog closes on a piece of meat , and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure . 
`` Ye see , '' said Marks to Haley , stirring his punch as he did so , `` ye see , we has justices convenient at all p ` ints along shore , that does up any little jobs in our line quite reasonable . 
Tom , he does the knockin ' down and that ar ; and I come in all dressed up -- shining boots -- everything first chop , when the swearin ' 's to be done . 
You oughter see , now , '' said Marks , in a glow of professional pride , `` how I can tone it off . 
One day , I 'm Mr. Twickem , from New Orleans ; ` nother day , I 'm just come from my plantation on Pearl River , where I works seven hundred niggers ; then , again , I come out a distant relation of Henry Clay , or some old cock in Kentuck . 
Talents is different , you know . 
Now , Tom 's roarer when there 's any thumping or fighting to be done ; but at lying he a n't good , Tom a n't , -- ye see it do n't come natural to him ; but , Lord , if thar 's a feller in the country that can swear to anything and everything , and put in all the circumstances and flourishes with a long face , and carry ' t through better 'n I can , why , I 'd like to see him , that 's all ! 
I b ` lieve my heart , I could get along and snake through , even if justices were more particular than they is . 
Sometimes I rather wish they was more particular ; ' t would be a heap more relishin ' if they was , -- more fun , yer know . '' 
Tom Loker , who , as we have made it appear , was a man of slow thoughts and movements , here interrupted Marks by bringing his heavy fist down on the table , so as to make all ring again , `` It 'll do ! '' 
he said . 
`` Lord bless ye , Tom , ye need n't break all the glasses ! '' 
said Marks ; `` save your fist for time o ' need . '' 
`` But , gentlemen , a n't I to come in for a share of the profits ? ''
