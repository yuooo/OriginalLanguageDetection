A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather ! 
It does n't vary five minutes in the year . 
It 's a perfect chronometer , look you . '' 
`` I see how it is , '' said Fix . 
`` You have kept London time , which is two hours behind that of Suez . 
You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country . '' 
`` I regulate my watch ? 
Never ! '' 
`` Well , then , it will not agree with the sun . '' 
`` So much the worse for the sun , monsieur . 
The sun will be wrong , then ! '' 
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture . 
After a few minutes silence , Fix resumed : `` You left London hastily , then ? '' 
`` I rather think so ! 
Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening , Monsieur Fogg came home from his club , and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off . '' 
`` But where is your master going ? '' 
`` Always straight ahead . 
He is going round the world . '' 
`` Round the world ? '' 
cried Fix . 
`` Yes , and in eighty days ! 
He says it is on a wager ; but , between us , I do n't believe a word of it . 
That would n't be common sense . 
There 's something else in the wind . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Mr. Fogg is a character , is he ? '' 
`` I should say he was . '' 
`` Is he rich ? '' 
`` No doubt , for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him . 
And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time . '' 
`` And you have known your master a long time ? '' 
`` Why , no ; I entered his service the very day we left London . '' 
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . 
The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed Fix in his theory . 
He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in London , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . 
Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez , but was really going on to Bombay . 
`` Is Bombay far from here ? '' 
asked Passepartout . 
`` Pretty far . 
It is a ten days ' voyage by sea . '' 
`` And in what country is Bombay ? '' 
`` India . '' 
`` In Asia ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` The deuce ! 
I was going to tell you there 's one thing that worries me -- my burner ! '' 
`` What burner ? '' 
`` My gas-burner , which I forgot to turn off , and which is at this moment burning at my expense . 
I have calculated , monsieur , that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours , exactly sixpence more than I earn ; and you will understand that the longer our journey -- '' Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout 's trouble about the gas ? 
It is not probable . 
He was not listening , but was cogitating a project . 
Passepartout and he had now reached the shop , where Fix left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate . 
Now that he was fully convinced , Fix had quite recovered his equanimity . 
`` Consul , '' said he , `` I have no longer any doubt . 
I have spotted my man . 
He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days . '' 
`` Then he 's a sharp fellow , '' returned the consul , `` and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track . '' 
`` We 'll see about that , '' replied Fix . 
`` But are you not mistaken ? '' 
`` I am not mistaken . '' 
`` Why was this robber so anxious to prove , by the visa , that he had passed through Suez ? '' 
`` Why ? 
I have no idea ; but listen to me . '' 
He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout . 
`` In short , '' said the consul , `` appearances are wholly against this man . 
And what are you going to do ? '' 
`` Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay , take passage on board the Mongolia , follow my rogue to India , and there , on English ground , arrest him politely , with my warrant in my hand , and my hand on his shoulder . '' 
Having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office . 
A quarter of an hour later found Fix , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the Mongolia ; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea . 
The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles , and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it . 
The Mongolia , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time . 
The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay , others for Calcutta by way of Bombay , the nearest route thither , now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula . 
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades , the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops , and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company : for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds , brigadiers , 2,400 pounds , and generals of divisions , 4,000 pounds . 
What with the military men , a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels , and the hospitable efforts of the purser , the time passed quickly on the Mongolia . 
The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and the eight o'clock supper , and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day ; and the hours were whirled away , when the sea was tranquil , with music , dancing , and games . 
But the Red Sea is full of caprice , and often boisterous , like most long and narrow gulfs . 
When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia , with her long hull , rolled fearfully . 
Then the ladies speedily disappeared below ; the pianos were silent ; singing and dancing suddenly ceased . 
Yet the good ship ploughed straight on , unretarded by wind or wave , towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb . 
What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time ? 
It might be thought that , in his anxiety , he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind , the disorderly raging of the billows -- every chance , in short , which might force the Mongolia to slacken her speed , and thus interrupt his journey . 
But , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . 
Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . 
How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia ? 
He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself . 
A tax-collector , on the way to his post at Goa ; the Rev. Decimus Smith , returning to his parish at Bombay ; and a brigadier-general of the English army , who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares , made up the party , and , with Mr. Fogg , played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence . 
As for Passepartout , he , too , had escaped sea-sickness , and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin . 
He rather enjoyed the voyage , for he was well fed and well lodged , took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing , and consoled himself with the delusion that his master 's whim would end at Bombay . 
He was pleased , on the day after leaving Suez , to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays . 
`` If I am not mistaken , '' said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , `` you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I quite recognise you . 
You are the servant of the strange Englishman -- '' `` Just so , monsieur -- '' `` Fix . '' 
`` Monsieur Fix , '' resumed Passepartout , `` I 'm charmed to find you on board . 
Where are you bound ? '' 
`` Like you , to Bombay . '' 
`` That 's capital ! 
Have you made this trip before ? '' 
`` Several times . 
I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company . '' 
`` Then you know India ? '' 
`` Why yes , '' replied Fix , who spoke cautiously . 
`` A curious place , this India ? '' 
`` Oh , very curious . 
Mosques , minarets , temples , fakirs , pagodas , tigers , snakes , elephants ! 
I hope you will have ample time to see the sights . '' 
`` I hope so , Monsieur Fix . 
You see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days ! 
No ; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at Bombay . '' 
`` And Mr. Fogg is getting on well ? '' 
asked Fix , in the most natural tone in the world . 
`` Quite well , and I too . 
I eat like a famished ogre ; it 's the sea air . '' 
`` But I never see your master on deck . '' 
`` Never ; he has n't the least curiosity . '' 
`` Do you know , Mr. Passepartout , that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand -- perhaps a diplomatic mission ? '' 
`` Faith , Monsieur Fix , I assure you I know nothing about it , nor would I give half a crown to find out . '' 
After this meeting , Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together , the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man 's confidence . 
He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room , which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity , mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows . 
Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly ; on the 13th , Mocha , surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing , was sighted , and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields . 
Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place , and thought that , with its circular walls and dismantled fort , it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer . 
The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears , and the next day they put in at Steamer Point , north-west of Aden harbour , to take in coal . 
This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines ; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year . 
In these distant seas , coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton . 
The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up . 
But this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect Phileas Fogg 's programme ; besides , the Mongolia , instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours . 
Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed ; Fix , unobserved , followed them . 
The visa procured , Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while Passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis , Banyans , Parsees , Jews , Arabs , and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden . 
He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean , and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon . 
`` Very curious , very curious , '' said Passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer . 
`` I see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . '' 
At six p.m. the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead , and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean . 
She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay , and the sea was favourable , the wind being in the north-west , and all sails aiding the engine . 
The steamer rolled but little , the ladies , in fresh toilets , reappeared on deck , and the singing and dancing were resumed . 
The trip was being accomplished most successfully , and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix . 
On Sunday , October 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the Indian coast : two hours later the pilot came on board . 
A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view . 
The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay . 
Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage , and his partner and himself having , by a bold stroke , captured all thirteen of the tricks , concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory . 
The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd ; she arrived on the 20th . 
This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from London , and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary , in the column of gains . 
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called India , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls . 
The British Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta , governors at Madras , Bombay , and in Bengal , and a lieutenant-governor at Agra . 
But British India , properly so called , only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles , and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants . 
A considerable portion of India is still free from British authority ; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent . 
The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756 , when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras , down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection . 
It gradually annexed province after province , purchasing them of the native chiefs , whom it seldom paid , and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates , civil and military . 
But the East India Company has now passed away , leaving the British possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown . 
The aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . 
Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days . 
This railway does not run in a direct line across India . 
The distance between Bombay and Calcutta , as the bird flies , is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles ; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third . 
The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows : Leaving Bombay , it passes through Salcette , crossing to the continent opposite Tannah , goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts , runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor , skirts the nearly independent territory of Bundelcund , ascends to Allahabad , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the Ganges at Benares , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor , has its terminus at Calcutta . 
The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four p.m. ; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta . 
Mr. Fogg , after bidding good-bye to his whist partners , left the steamer , gave his servant several errands to do , urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight , and , with his regular step , which beat to the second , like an astronomical clock , directed his steps to the passport office . 
As for the wonders of Bombay -- its famous city hall , its splendid library , its forts and docks , its bazaars , mosques , synagogues , its Armenian churches , and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill , with its two polygonal towers -- he cared not a straw to see them . 
He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta , or the mysterious hypogea , concealed south-east from the docks , or those fine remains of Buddhist architecture , the Kanherian grottoes of the island of Salcette . 
Having transacted his business at the passport office , Phileas Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station , where he ordered dinner . 
Among the dishes served up to him , the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of `` native rabbit , '' on which he prided himself . 
Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish , but , despite its spiced sauce , found it far from palatable . 
He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , `` Is this rabbit , sir ? '' 
`` Yes , my lord , '' the rogue boldly replied , `` rabbit from the jungles . '' 
`` And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed ? '' 
`` Mew , my lord ! 
What , a rabbit mew ! 
I swear to you -- '' `` Be so good , landlord , as not to swear , but remember this : cats were formerly considered , in India , as sacred animals . 
That was a good time . '' 
`` For the cats , my lord ? '' 
`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! '' 
After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner . 
Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg , and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police . 
He made himself known as a London detective , told his business at Bombay , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London . 
It had not reached the office ; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive . 
Fix was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police . 
This the director refused , as the matter concerned the London office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant . 
Fix did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay . 
He did not doubt for a moment , any more than Passepartout , that Phileas Fogg would remain there , at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive . 
Passepartout , however , had no sooner heard his master 's orders on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris , and that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta , and perhaps beyond that place . 
He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest , and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him , despite his love of repose , around the world in eighty days ! 
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes , he took a leisurely promenade about the streets , where crowds of people of many nationalities -- Europeans , Persians with pointed caps , Banyas with round turbans , Sindes with square bonnets , Parsees with black mitres , and long-robed Armenians -- were collected . 
It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival . 
These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster -- the most thrifty , civilised , intelligent , and austere of the East Indians , among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay -- were celebrating a sort of religious carnival , with processions and shows , in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls , clothed in rose-coloured gauze , looped up with gold and silver , danced airily , but with perfect modesty , to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines . 
It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth , and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable . 
Unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . 
At last , having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior . 
He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door . 
It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions . 
Passepartout , however , thinking no harm , went in like a simple tourist , and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes , when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging . 
He looked up to behold three enraged priests , who forthwith fell upon him ; tore off his shoes , and began to beat him with loud , savage exclamations . 
The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes ; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets . 
At five minutes before eight , Passepartout , hatless , shoeless , and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes , rushed breathlessly into the station . 
Fix , who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay , was there , upon the platform . 
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta , and farther , if necessary . 
Passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg . 
`` I hope that this will not happen again , '' said Phileas Fogg coldly , as he got into the train . 
Poor Passepartout , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word . 
Fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan . 
`` No , I 'll stay , '' muttered he . 
`` An offence has been committed on Indian soil . 
I 've got my man . '' 
Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night . 
The train had started punctually . 
Among the passengers were a number of officers , Government officials , and opium and indigo merchants , whose business called them to the eastern coast . 
Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master , and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them . 
This was Sir Francis Cromarty , one of Mr. Fogg 's whist partners on the Mongolia , now on his way to join his corps at Benares . 
Sir Francis was a tall , fair man of fifty , who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt . 
He made India his home , only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals ; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs , history , and character of India and its people . 
But Phileas Fogg , who was not travelling , but only describing a circumference , took no pains to inquire into these subjects ; he was a solid body , traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe , according to the laws of rational mechanics . 
He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London , and , had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration , would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction . 
Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion -- although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards , and between two rubbers -- and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior , and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature . 
The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that , of all the eccentric persons he had ever met , none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences . 
Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . 
In the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else . 
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the Island of Salcette , and had got into the open country . 
At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah ; and , passing Pauwell , they entered the defiles of the mountains , with their basalt bases , and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time , and now Sir Francis , reviving the conversation , observed , `` Some years ago , Mr. Fogg , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager . '' 
`` How so , Sir Francis ? '' 
`` Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah , on the other side . '' 
`` Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . '' 
`` But , Mr. Fogg , '' pursued Sir Francis , `` you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow 's adventure at the pagoda . '' 
Passepartout , his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket , was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him . 
`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence . 
It takes particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , Sir Francis , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to Europe . 
I do n't see how this affair could have delayed his master . '' 
The conversation fell again . 
During the night the train left the mountains behind , and passed Nassik , and the next day proceeded over the flat , well-cultivated country of the Khandeish , with its straggling villages , above which rose the minarets of the pagodas . 
This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams , mostly tributaries of the Godavery . 
Passepartout , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train . 
The locomotive , guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis -LRB- sort of abandoned monasteries -RRB- , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture . 
Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train ; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed . 
The travellers crossed , beyond Milligaum , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali . 
Not far off rose Ellora , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous Aurungabad , capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam . 
It was thereabouts that Feringhea , the Thuggee chief , king of the stranglers , held his sway . 
These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction . 
The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders , though the Thuggees still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites . 
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet . 
The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty , which empties into the Gulf of Cambray , near Surat . 
Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . 
Up to his arrival at Bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . 
His old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . 
He came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . 
Already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . 
He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . 
Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer . 
The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway . 
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains , which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund , towards evening . 
The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . 
This famous timepiece , always regulated on the Greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . 
Sir Francis corrected Passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at London time . 
It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one . 
The train stopped , at eight o'clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal , where there were several bungalows , and workmen 's cabins . 
The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , `` Passengers will get out here ! '' 
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias . 
Passepartout , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying : `` Monsieur , no more railway ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` I mean to say that the train is n't going on . '' 
The general at once stepped out , while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` At the hamlet of Kholby . '' 
`` Do we stop here ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
The railway is n't finished . '' 
`` What ! 
not finished ? '' 
`` No . 
There 's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad , where the line begins again . '' 
`` But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout . '' 
`` What would you have , officer ? 
The papers were mistaken . '' 
`` Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta , '' retorted Sir Francis , who was growing warm . 
`` No doubt , '' replied the conductor ; `` but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad . '' 
Sir Francis was furious . 
Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down , and did not dare to look at his master . 
`` Sir Francis , '' said Mr. Fogg quietly , `` we will , if you please , look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage . '' 
`` No , Sir Francis ; it was foreseen . '' 
`` What ! 
You knew that the way -- '' `` Not at all ; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route . 
Nothing , therefore , is lost . 
I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice . 
A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon , on the 25th . 
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach Calcutta in time . '' 
There was nothing to say to so confident a response . 
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . 
The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . 
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything . 
`` I shall go afoot , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
Passepartout , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail Indian shoes . 
Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moment 's hesitation , said , `` Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` An elephant ! 
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . '' 
`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question . 
An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure . 
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated . 
The Indian had begun already , by often irritating him , and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter , to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature , this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle . 
Happily , however , for Mr. Fogg , the animal 's instruction in this direction had not gone far , and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness . 
Kiouni -- this was the name of the beast -- could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time , and , in default of any other means of conveyance , Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him . 
But elephants are far from cheap in India , where they are becoming scarce , the males , which alone are suitable for circus shows , are much sought , especially as but few of them are domesticated . 
When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni , he refused point-blank . 
Mr. Fogg persisted , offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad . 
Refused . 
Twenty pounds ? 
Refused also . 
Forty pounds ? 
Still refused . 
Passepartout jumped at each advance ; but the Indian declined to be tempted . 
Yet the offer was an alluring one , for , supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad , his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling . 
Phileas Fogg , without getting in the least flurried , then proposed to purchase the animal outright , and at first offered a thousand pounds for him . 
The Indian , perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain , still refused . 
Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . 
Returning to the Indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain . 
Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds . 
Passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense . 
At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded . 
`` What a price , good heavens ! '' 
cried Passepartout , `` for an elephant . '' 
It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy . 
A young Parsee , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which Mr. Fogg accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal . 
The elephant was led out and equipped . 
The Parsee , who was an accomplished elephant driver , covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth , and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs . 
Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag , a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals . 
Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad , which the brigadier gratefully accepted , as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast . 
Provisions were purchased at Kholby , and , while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side , Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them . 
The Parsee perched himself on the elephant 's neck , and at nine o'clock they set out from the village , the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut . 
In order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built . 
This line , owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains , did not pursue a straight course . 
The Parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them , were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant , spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee ; but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm , talking little , and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other . 
As for Passepartout , who was mounted on the beast 's back , and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along , he was very careful , in accordance with his master 's advice , to keep his tongue from between his teeth , as it would otherwise have been bitten off short . 
The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant 's neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board ; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in Kiouni 's trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot . 
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which Kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . 
Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . 
`` Why , he 's made of iron ! '' 
exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on Kiouni . 
`` Of forged iron , '' replied Passepartout , as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast . 
At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure . 
The country soon presented a very savage aspect . 
Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests ; then vast , dry plains , dotted with scanty shrubs , and sown with great blocks of syenite . 
All this portion of Bundelcund , which is little frequented by travellers , is inhabited by a fanatical population , hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith . 
The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory , which is subjected to the influence of rajahs , whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses . 
The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians , who , when they perceived the elephant striding across-country , made angry and threatening motions . 
The Parsee avoided them as much as possible . 
Few animals were observed on the route ; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter . 
In the midst of his gaiety , however , one thought troubled the worthy servant . 
What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad ? 
Would he carry him on with him ? 
Impossible ! 
The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive . 
Would he sell him , or set him free ? 
The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration . 
Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him , Passepartout , a present of Kiouni , he would be very much embarrassed ; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time . 
The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined bungalow . 
They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad . 
The night was cold . 
The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . 
The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . 
The guide watched Kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . 
Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . 
Sir Francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . 
Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . 
As for Mr. Fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row . 
The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening . 
In that case , Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . 
Kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the Vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger , on the Cani , one of the branches of the Ganges . 
The guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . 
Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east . 
They stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated . 
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles ; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods . 
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters , and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished , when the elephant , becoming restless , suddenly stopped . 
It was then four o'clock . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Sir Francis , putting out his head . 
`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the Parsee , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches . 
The murmur soon became more distinct ; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments . 
Passepartout was all eyes and ears . 
Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word . 
The Parsee jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket . 
He soon returned , saying : `` A procession of Brahmins is coming this way . 
We must prevent their seeing us , if possible . '' 
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . 
He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed . 
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer , and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals . 
The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees , a hundred paces away ; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches . 
First came the priests , with mitres on their heads , and clothed in long lace robes . 
They were surrounded by men , women , and children , who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm , interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals ; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels , the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other . 
Upon the car , which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus , stood a hideous statue with four arms , the body coloured a dull red , with haggard eyes , dishevelled hair , protruding tongue , and lips tinted with betel . 
It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant . 
Sir Francis , recognising the statue , whispered , `` The goddess Kali ; the goddess of love and death . '' 
`` Of death , perhaps , '' muttered back Passepartout , `` but of love -- that ugly old hag ? 
Never ! '' 
The Parsee made a motion to keep silence . 
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great Indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut . 
Some Brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . 
This woman was young , and as fair as a European . 
Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form . 
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin . 
It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince . 
Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments ; these closed the procession . 
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , `` A suttee . '' 
The Parsee nodded , and put his finger to his lips . 
The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood . 
The songs gradually died away ; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again . 
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked : `` What is a suttee ? '' 
`` A suttee , '' returned the general , `` is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one . 
The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day . '' 
`` Oh , the scoundrels ! '' 
cried Passepartout , who could not repress his indignation . 
`` And the corpse ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` Is that of the prince , her husband , '' said the guide ; `` an independent rajah of Bundelcund . '' 
`` Is it possible , '' resumed Phileas Fogg , his voice betraying not the least emotion , `` that these barbarous customs still exist in India , and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them ? '' 
`` These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India , '' replied Sir Francis ; `` but we have no power over these savage territories , and especially here in Bundelcund . 
The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage . '' 
`` The poor wretch ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , `` to be burned alive ! '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Sir Francis , `` burned alive . 
And , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . 
They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . 
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . 
Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it . 
Several years ago , when I was living at Bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . 
The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose . '' 
While Sir Francis was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said : `` The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund . '' 
`` But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance , '' observed Sir Francis . 
`` That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium . '' 
`` But where are they taking her ? '' 
`` To the pagoda of Pillaji , two miles from here ; she will pass the night there . '' 
`` And the sacrifice will take place -- '' `` To-morrow , at the first light of dawn . '' 
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck . 
Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , Mr. Fogg stopped him , and , turning to Sir Francis Cromarty , said , `` Suppose we save this woman . '' 
`` Save the woman , Mr. Fogg ! '' 
`` I have yet twelve hours to spare ; I can devote them to that . '' 
`` Why , you are a man of heart ! '' 
`` Sometimes , '' replied Phileas Fogg , quietly ; `` when I have the time . '' 
The project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable . 
Mr. Fogg was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour . 
But he did not hesitate , and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally . 
As for Passepartout , he was ready for anything that might be proposed . 
His master 's idea charmed him ; he perceived a heart , a soul , under that icy exterior . 
He began to love Phileas Fogg . 
There remained the guide : what course would he adopt ? 
Would he not take part with the Indians ? 
In default of his assistance , it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality . 
Sir Francis frankly put the question to him . 
`` Officers , '' replied the guide , `` I am a Parsee , and this woman is a Parsee . 
Command me as you will . '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
`` However , '' resumed the guide , `` it is certain , not only that we shall risk our lives , but horrible tortures , if we are taken . '' 
`` That is foreseen , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` I think we must wait till night before acting . '' 
`` I think so , '' said the guide . 
The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant . 
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an European . 
Her name was Aouda . 
Left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape . 
The Parsee 's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design . 
It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible . 
They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly . 
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim . 
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned . 
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ? 
This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves ; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night , and not when , at break of day , the victim was led to her funeral pyre . 
Then no human intervention could save her . 
As soon as night fell , about six o'clock , they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda . 
The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing ; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp , and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself . 
The Parsee , leading the others , noiselessly crept through the wood , and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream , whence , by the light of the rosin torches , they perceived a pyre of wood , on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah , which was to be burned with his wife . 
The pagoda , whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk , stood a hundred steps away . 
`` Come ! '' 
whispered the guide . 
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush , followed by his companions ; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches . 
Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade , which was lit up by the torches . 
The ground was covered by groups of the Indians , motionless in their drunken sleep ; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead . 
Men , women , and children lay together . 
In the background , among the trees , the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly . 
Much to the guide 's disappointment , the guards of the rajah , lighted by torches , were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres ; probably the priests , too , were watching within . 
The Parsee , now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple , advanced no farther , but led his companions back again . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction . 
They stopped , and engaged in a whispered colloquy . 
`` It is only eight now , '' said the brigadier , `` and these guards may also go to sleep . '' 
`` It is not impossible , '' returned the Parsee . 
They lay down at the foot of a tree , and waited . 
The time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda . 
They waited till midnight ; but no change took place among the guards , and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on . 
The other plan must be carried out ; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made . 
It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door . 
After a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others . 
They took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear . 
They reached the walls about half-past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors . 
The night was dark . 
The moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness . 
It was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives .
