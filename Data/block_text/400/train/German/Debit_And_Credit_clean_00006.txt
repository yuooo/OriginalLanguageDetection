These experienced lawyers both agreed in thinking that the mortgage in question was not positively undesirable ; and when Ehrenthal next called , he found the baron 's mind made up to the purchase . 
The irresistible inducement was the making a few thousand dollars . 
He was resolved to think the mortgage good , and would perhaps have bought it even had his lawyer positively dissuaded him . 
Ehrenthal , having a journey to take to that part of the country , most unselfishly offered to complete the purchase for the baron , who was pleased with this arrangement . 
In about a fortnight he received the deeds . 
All were well contented with their share in the business , but Veitel Itzig with most reason , for he had by it got a hold over his master , and was now friend and confidant in the most secret transactions . 
The baron took out his richly-inlaid casket , and , in place of the fair white parchments , put in a thick , dirty bundle of deeds . 
Having done this , he joined the ladies , and gave a humorous account of Ehrenthal 's bows and compliments . 
`` I hate that man , '' said Lenore . 
`` On this occasion he has behaved with a certain disinterestedness , '' replied her father . 
`` But there is no denying that people of his class have their absurdities of manner , and it is difficult to help laughing at them . '' 
That evening Ehrenthal was so cheerful in his family circle that his wife asked him whether he had settled the affair with the baron . 
`` I have , '' he gayly replied . 
`` He is a handsome man , '' remarked the daughter . 
`` He is a good man , '' rejoined Ehrenthal , `` but he has his weaknesses . 
He is one of those who require low bows and civil speeches , and pay others to think for them . 
There must be such people in the world , or what would become of people of our profession ? '' 
About the same time Veitel was relating to his friend , the ex-advocate , the whole particulars of the affair . 
Hippus had taken off his spectacles , and sat on a corner of the four-cornered chest Mrs. Pinkus was pleased to call a sofa , looking like a sagacious elderly ape who despises the race of men , and bites his keeper when he can . 
He listened with critical interest to his pupil 's narrative , and shook his head or smiled , according as he dissented or approved . 
When Veitel had done , Hippus cried , `` Ehrenthal is a simpleton . 
He is up to nothing great ; he is always trying half-measures . 
If he goes on thus , the baron will throw him overboard yet . '' 
`` What more can he do ? '' 
asked Veitel . 
`` He must give him anxieties -- the anxieties of business , extensive business , ceaseless activity , daily cares -- that 's what the baron could not stand . 
That class is accustomed to little work and much enjoyment . 
Every thing is made easy to them from their childhood . 
There are few of them who may not be ruined by having some great care always boring at their brains . 
If Ehrenthal wishes to have the baron in his power , he must entangle him in business . '' 
So said the advocate , and Veitel understood him , and looked with a mixture of respect and aversion at the ugly little imp gesticulating before him . 
At last Hippus took out the brandy bottle , and cried , `` An extra glass to-day . 
What I have just told you , you young gallows-bird , is worth more than a bottle of brandy . '' 
`` I am eighteen years old to-day , '' said Karl to his father , who was sitting at home one Sunday morning , never weary of contemplating the handsome youth . 
`` So you are , '' replied the father ; `` there are eighteen tapers round the cake . '' 
`` Therefore , father , '' Karl went on , `` it is time that I should turn to , something , and make some money . 
I will be a porter . '' 
`` Make some money ! '' 
repeated old Sturm , looking at his son in amazement . 
`` Do I not make as much , and more than we want ? 
Why , you are going to turn a miser ! '' 
`` I ca n't always hang to your apron , '' said Karl ; `` and if you were to earn a thousand dollars , would that make an active , useful man of me ? 
Or , if I were to lose you , what would become of me ? '' 
`` You will lose me , boy , '' said the giant , nodding , `` in a few years , perhaps , and then you may become what you like , so it be not a porter . '' 
`` But why should I not be what you are ? 
Do not be unreasonable . '' 
`` You know nothing about the matter . 
Do not be covetous ; I can not bear covetous people . '' 
`` But , father , if I am not to be a porter , I must learn something , '' cried Karl . 
`` Learn ! '' 
exclaimed his father ; `` how much learning have you not had stuffed into your little head already ! 
Two years at the infant school , four at the city school , two at the industrial . 
Why , you have had eight years ' schooling , and you know the different goods as well as a clerk . 
Why , you are an insatiable youth . '' 
`` Yes ; but I must have a calling , '' replied Karl . 
`` I must be a shoemaker , tailor , shopkeeper , or mechanic . '' 
`` Do n't tease yourself about that , '' said his father ; `` I have provided for all that in your education . 
You are practical and honorable too . '' 
`` Yes ; but can I make a pair of boots ? 
can I cut out a coat ? '' 
`` You can , '' replied old Sturm ; `` try , and you 'll succeed . '' 
`` Very well ; to-morrow I 'll buy you some leather , and make you a pair of boots : you shall feel how they 'll pinch . 
But , once for all , I ca n't go on as I am , and I 'll set some one at you who will tell you the same . '' 
`` Do n't be covetous , Karl , '' said his father , `` or spoil this day for me . 
Give me the can of beer , and be a good boy . '' 
Karl placed the great can before his father , and soon took up his cap and went out . 
Old Sturm sat still a while , but his comfort was destroyed , and the house seemed dull without his son 's cheerful face . 
At length he went into the next room , and drew out a heavy iron chest from under the bed . 
He opened it with a little key that he took out of his waistcoat pocket , lifted one bag after another , began a long mental calculation , then pushed the chest under the bed again , and returned to his can of beer with a calmer aspect . 
Meanwhile Karl had hurried off to the town , and soon made his appearance in Anton 's apartment . 
After the kindly greeting on both sides , he began : `` I am come , sir , to ask your advice as to what is to become of me ? 
I can make nothing of my father . 
He wo n't hear of my being a porter ; and if I speak of another calling , he comforts me with saying that he shall not live long . 
A pretty comfort that ! 
Would you be so good as to speak to him about me ? 
He has a high opinion of you , and knows that you are always kind to me . '' 
`` That I will , gladly , '' replied Anton ; `` but what do you think of becoming ? '' 
`` It 's all one to me , '' said Karl , `` so that it 's something regular . 
Here I turn my hands to all sorts of things , but that 's different to regular work . '' 
The next Sunday Anton went to old Sturm 's . 
The home of the head porter was a small house near the river , distinguished from those of his neighbors by its red-washed walls . 
Anton opened the low door , and wondered how the giant could possibly live in so small a space . 
It must have required constant patience and forbearance ; for , had he ever drawn himself up to his full height , he would infallibly have carried off the roof . 
`` I am delighted to see you in my house , sir , '' said Sturm , taking Anton 's hand in his immense grasp as gently as he could . 
`` It is rather small for you , Mr. Sturm , '' answered Anton , laughing . 
`` I never thought you so large as I do now . '' 
`` My father was still taller , '' was the complacent reply ; `` taller and broader . 
He was the chief of the porters , and the strongest man in the place ; and yet a small barrel , not half so high as you are , was the death of him . 
Be seated , sir , '' said he , lifting an oaken chair , so heavy that Anton could hardly move it . 
`` My Karl has told me that he has been to see you , and that you were most kind . 
He is a good boy , but he is a falling off as to size . 
His mother was a little woman , '' added Sturm , mournfully , draining a quart of beer to the last drop . 
`` It is draught beer , '' he said , apologetically ; `` may I offer you a glass ? 
It is a custom among us to drink no other , but certainly we drink this the whole day through , for our work is heating . '' 
`` Your son wishes to become one of your number , I hear , '' said Anton . 
`` A porter ! '' 
rejoined the giant . 
`` No , that he never shall . '' 
Then laying his hand confidentially on Anton 's knee , `` It would never do ; my dear departed wife besought me against it on her death-bed . 
And why ? 
Our calling is respectable , as you , sir , best know . 
There are not many who have the requisite strength , and still fewer who have the requisite -- '' `` Integrity , '' said Anton . 
`` You are right , '' nodded Sturm . 
`` Always to have wares of every kind in immense quantities under our eyes , and never to touch one of them -- this is not in every body 's line . 
And our earnings are very fair too . 
My dear departed saved a good deal of money , gold as well as silver . 
But that is not my way . 
For why ? 
If a man be practical , he need not plague himself about money , and Karl will be a practical man . 
But he must not be a porter . 
His mother would not hear of it , and she was right . '' 
`` Your work is very laborious , '' suggested Anton . 
`` Laborious ! '' 
laughed Sturm ; `` it may be laborious for the weak , but it is not that . 
It is this , '' and he filled his glass ; `` it is the draught beer . '' 
Anton smiled . 
`` I know that you and your colleagues drink a good deal of this thin stuff . '' 
`` A good deal , '' said Sturm , with self-complacency ; `` it is a custom of ours -- it always has been so -- porters must be strong men , true men , and beer-drinkers . 
Water would weaken us , so would brandy ; there is nothing for it but draught beer and olive oil . 
Look here , sir , '' said he , mixing a small glassful of fine oil and beer , stirring plenty of sugar into it , and drinking off the nauseous compound ; `` this is a secret of ours , and makes an arm like this ; '' and he laid his on the table , and vainly endeavored to span it . 
`` But there is a drawback . 
Have you ever seen an old porter ? 
No ; for there are none . 
Fifty is the greatest age they have ever reached . 
My father was fifty when he died , and the one we lately buried -- Mr. Schröter was at the funeral -- was forty-nine . 
I have still two years before me , however . '' 
Anton looked at him anxiously . 
`` But , Sturm , since you know this , why not be more moderate ? '' 
`` Moderate ! '' 
asked Sturm ; `` what is moderate ? 
It never gets into our heads . 
Twenty quarts a day is not much if you know nothing of it . 
However , Mr. Wohlfart , it is on this account that my dear departed did not choose that Karl should be a porter . 
As for that , few men do live to be much more than fifty , and they have all sorts of ailments that we know nothing about . 
But such were my wife 's wishes , and so it must be . '' 
`` And have you thought of any other calling ? 
True , Karl is very useful in our house , and we should all miss him much . '' 
`` There it is , '' interrupted the porter ; `` you would miss him , and so should I. I am alone here ; when I see my little lad 's red cheeks , and hear his little hammer , I feel my heart glad within me . 
When he goes away , and I sit here by myself , I know not how I shall bear it . '' 
And his features worked with strong emotion . 
`` But must he leave you at present ? '' 
inquired Anton ; `` perhaps he may remain on for another year . '' 
`` Not he ; I know him ; if he once thinks of a thing at all , he thinks of nothing else . 
And , besides , I have been considering the matter these last days , and I see I have been wrong . 
The boy did not come into the world merely to amuse me ; he must turn to something or other ; so I try to think of what my dear departed would have liked . 
She had a brother , who is my brother-in-law , you know , and who lives in the country ; I should like my boy to go to him . 
It is far away , but then there 's kinship . '' 
`` A good thought , Sturm ; but , since you are resolved , keep your son no longer in uncertainty . '' 
`` He shall know at once ; he is only in the garden . '' 
And he went and called him in stentorian tones . 
Karl hastened in , greeted Anton , and looked expectantly first at him and then at his father , who had seated himself , and now inquired , in his usual voice , `` Little mannikin , will you be a farmer ? '' 
`` A farmer ! 
that never occurred to me . 
Why , I should have to leave you , father . '' 
`` He thinks of that , '' said the father , nodding his head to Anton . 
`` Do you then wish that I should leave you ? '' 
asked Karl , in amazement . 
`` I must , my little man , '' said Sturm , gravely ; `` I must wish it , because it is necessary for your dear departed mother 's sake . '' 
`` I am to go to my uncle ! '' 
cried Karl . 
`` Exactly so , '' said his father ; `` it 's all settled , provided your uncle will have you . 
You shall be a farmer , you shall learn something regular , you shall leave your father . '' 
`` Father , '' said Karl , much downcast , `` I do not like leaving you . 
Ca n't you come with me to the country ? '' '' 
I go to the country ! 
Ho , ho , ho ! '' 
Sturm laughed till the house shook again . 
`` My mannikin would put me into his pocket , and take me to the country . '' 
Then wiping his eyes : `` Come here , my Karl , '' said he , holding the youth 's head between his two great hands ; `` you are my own good lad ; but there must be partings on this earth , and if it were not now , it would be in a couple of years . '' 
And thus Karl 's departure from the firm was arranged . 
As the time drew near , he tried in vain to conceal his emotion by a great deal of cheerful whistling . 
He stroked Pluto tenderly , executed all his various odd jobs with intense zeal , and kept as close as he could to his father , who often left his barrels to place his hand in silence on his son 's head . 
`` Nothing heavy in farming ! '' 
said the paternal Sturm to Anton , looking anxiously into his face . 
`` Heavy ! '' 
replied Anton ; `` it will be no light matter to learn all connected with it . '' 
`` Learn ! '' 
cried the other ; `` the more he has to learn the better , so it be not very heavy . '' 
`` No , '' said Pix , who understood his meaning , `` nothing heavy . 
The heaviest are sacks of corn -- hundred and eighty ; beans -- two hundred pounds . 
And those he need not lift ; the servants do it . '' 
`` If that 's the case with farming , '' cried Sturm , contemptuously rearing himself to his full height , `` it 's all one to me whether he lifts them or not . 
Even my mannikin can carry two hundred pounds . '' 
Anton was now the most assiduous of all the clerks in the office . 
Fink was seldom able to persuade him to accompany him out riding or to the shooting gallery , but , on the other hand , he made diligent use of his friend 's book-shelves , and having , after arduous study , gained some insight into the mysteries of the English language , he was anxious to exercise his conversational powers upon Fink . 
But the latter proving a most irregular and careless master , Anton thought it best to put himself in the hands of a well-educated Englishman . 
One day , looking up from his desk as the door opened , he saw , to his amazement , Veitel Itzig , his old Ostrau schoolfellow . 
Hitherto they had but seldom met , and whenever they did so , Anton had taken pains to look another way . 
`` How are you getting on ? '' 
asked he , coldly enough . 
`` Poorly , '' was the reply ; `` there is nothing to be made in our business . 
I was to give you this letter , and to inquire when Mr. Bernhard Ehrenthal may call upon you . '' 
`` Upon me ! '' 
said Anton , taking the letter and a card with it . 
The letter was from his English master , asking whether he would join young Ehrenthal in a systematic course of some of the older English writers . 
`` Where does Mr. Bernhard Ehrenthal live ? '' 
asked Anton . 
`` At his father 's , '' said Itzig , making a face . 
`` He sits in his own room all the day long . '' 
`` I will call upon him , '' rejoined Anton ; and Itzig took his departure . 
Anton was not much inclined to agree to the proposal . 
The name of Ehrenthal did not stand high , and Itzig 's appearance had not conferred any pleasant associations upon it . 
But the ironical way in which he had mentioned his master 's son , and something Anton had heard of him besides , determined him to take the matter at least into consideration . 
Accordingly , one of the next days he mounted the dingy staircase , and was at once ushered into Bernhard 's room , which was long and narrow , and filled with books great and small . 
A young man came toward him with the uncertainty of manner that short-sight gives . 
He had fine features , a fragile frame , brown curling hair , and deep , expressive gray eyes . 
Anton mentioned the reason of his visit , and inquired the terms for the course . 
To his astonishment , young Ehrenthal did not know them , but said that , if Anton insisted upon sharing the expense , he would inquire . 
Our hero next asked whether Bernhard was in business with his father . 
`` Oh no , '' was the reply ; `` I have been at the University , and as it is not easy for a young man of my creed to get a government appointment , and I can live with my family , I occupy myself with my books . '' 
And , casting a loving glance at his book-shelves , he rose as if to introduce his guest to them . 
Anton looked at their titles , and said , `` They are too learned for me . '' 
Bernhard smiled . 
`` Through the Hebrew I have gone on to the other Asiatic languages . 
There is much beauty in them , and in their Old-World legends . 
I am now engaged upon a translation from the Persian , and some day or other , when you have a few idle minutes , I should like to inflict a short specimen upon you . '' 
Anton had the politeness to beg to hear it at once . 
It was one of those countless poems in which a votary of the grape compares his beloved to all fair things in heaven and earth . 
Its complicated structure impressed Anton a good deal , but he was somewhat amazed at Bernhard exclaiming , `` Beautiful ! 
is it not ? 
I mean the thought , for I am unable to give the beauty of language ; '' and he looked inspired , like a man who drinks Schiraz wine , and kisses his Zuleika all day long . 
`` But must one drink in order to love ? '' 
said Anton ; `` with us the one is very possible without the other . '' 
`` With us , life is very commonplace . '' 
`` I do not think so , '' Anton replied , with fervor . 
`` We have the sunshine and the roses , the joy in existence , the great passions and strange destinies of which poets sing . '' 
`` Our present time is too cold and uniform , '' rejoined Bernhard . 
`` So I read in books , but I do not believe it . 
I think that whoever is discontented with our life would be so still more with life in Teheran or Calcutta , if he remained there long enough . 
It is only novelty that charms the traveler . '' 
`` But how poor in vivid sensations our civilized existence is , '' rejoined Bernhard . 
`` I am sure you must often feel business very prosaic . '' 
`` That I deny , '' was the eager reply ; `` I know nothing so interesting as business . 
We live amid a many-colored web of countless threads , stretching across land and sea , and connecting man with man . 
When I place a sack of coffee in the scales , I am weaving an invisible link between the colonist 's daughter in Brazil , who has plucked the beans , and the young mechanic who drinks it for his breakfast ; and if I take up a stick of cinnamon , I seem to see , on the one side , the Malay who has rolled it up , and , on the other , the old woman of our suburb who grates it over her pudding . '' 
`` You have a lively imagination , and are happy in the utility of your calling . 
But if we seek for poetry , we must , like Byron , quit civilized countries to find it on the sea or in the desert . '' 
`` Not so , '' replied Anton , pertinaciously ; `` the merchant has just as poetical experiences as any pirate or Arab . 
There was a bankruptcy lately . 
Could you have witnessed the gloomy lull before the storm broke , the fearful despair of the husband , the high spirit of his wife , who insisted upon throwing in her own fortune to the last dollar to save his honor , you would not say that our calling is poor in passion or emotion . '' 
Bernhard listened with downcast eyes , and Anton remarked that he seemed embarrassed and distressed . 
Changing the conversation , he proposed that they should both walk together to the English master , and make the final arrangements . 
They left the house like two old acquaintances ; Anton surprised that Ehrenthal 's son should be so little of a trader , Bernhard delighted to find a man with whom he could discuss his favorite subjects . 
That evening he joined the family circle in a cheerful mood , and placing himself behind his sister , who was practicing a difficult piece on a costly piano , he kissed her ear . 
`` Do not disturb me , Bernhard , '' said she ; `` I must get this piece perfect for the large party on Sunday , when I shall be asked to play . '' 
`` Of course you will be asked , '' said her mother . 
`` There is no company that does not wish to hear Rosalie play . 
If you could only be persuaded to come with us , Bernhard -- you are so clever and so learned . 
It was but the other day that Professor Starke , of the University , spoke of you to me in the highest terms . 
It is so pleasant for a mother to feel proud of her children ! 
Why will you not join us ? 
The society will be as good as any in the town . '' 
`` You know , mother , that I am not fond of strangers . '' 
`` And I desire that my son Bernhard should have his own way , '' cried Ehrenthal from a neighboring room , having chanced , during a pause in Rosalie 's practice , to hear the last sentence , and now joining his family : `` our Bernhard is not like other people , and his way is sure to be a good one . 
You look pale , my son , '' stroking his brown curls ; `` you study too much . 
Think of your health . 
The doctor recommended exercise . 
Will you have a horse , my son Bernhard ? 
I will get the most expensive horse in the town for you , if you like . '' 
`` Thank you , dear father ; but it would give me no pleasure , '' and he gratefully pressed the hand of his father , who looked sorrowfully at his pale face . 
`` Do you always give Bernhard what he likes to eat ? 
Get him some peaches , Sidonie ; there are hot-house peaches to be had . 
You shall have any thing you like ; you are my good son Bernhard , and my delight is in you . '' 
`` He will not have any thing of the kind , '' interposed his mother . 
`` All his joy is in his books . 
Many a day he never asks for Rosalie and me . 
He reads too much , and that 's why he looks like a man of sixty . 
Why will he not go with us on Sunday ? '' 
`` I will , if you like , '' said Bernhard , mournfully ; adding soon after , `` Do you know a young man of the name of Wohlfart , in Schröter 's house ? '' 
`` No , '' said his father , decidedly . 
`` Perhaps you do , Rosalie . 
He is handsome and refined-looking ; I think you must have met him . '' 
`` Hardly , if he is in an office . '' 
`` Our Rosalie dances chiefly with officers and artists , '' explained her mother . 
`` He is a clever and a delightful man , '' continued Bernhard ; `` I am going to study English with him , and rejoice to have made his acquaintance . '' 
`` He shall be invited , '' decreed Ehrenthal ; `` if he pleases our Bernhard , he shall be welcome to our house . 
Let us have a good dinner on Sunday , Sidonie , at two o'clock . 
He shall come to all our parties ; Bernhard 's friend shall be the friend of us all . '' 
The mother gave her consent , and Rosalie began to ponder what dress she should wear , so as to make the greatest impression . 
But whence came it to pass that Bernhard did not communicate to his family the subject of the conversation that had so much interested him ? 
that he soon relapsed into silence and returned to his study ? 
that , when there , he bowed his head over his old manuscripts , while large drops rolled down on them , erasing the much-prized characters unobserved ? 
Whence came it that the young man , of whom his mother was so proud , whom his father so loved and honored , sat alone , shedding the bitterest tears that an honest man can , while in another part of the house Rosalie 's white fingers were flying over the keys , practicing the difficult piece that was to astonish the next soiree ? 
From that day dated a friendship between Anton and Bernhard which was a source of pleasure and profit to both . 
Anton described the studious youth to the free and easy Fink , and expressed his wish to bring about a meeting between the two by a tea-drinking in his rooms . 
`` If it amuses you , Tony , '' said Fink , shrugging his shoulders , `` I will come ; but I warn you that of all living characters I most dislike a book-worm . 
No one theorizes more presumptuously upon every possible subject , or makes a greater fool of himself when it comes to practice . 
And , besides , a son of the worthy Ehrenthal ! 
Do n't be angry if I soon run away . '' 
On the evening appointed , Bernhard sat on Anton 's sofa in anxious expectation of the arrival of this well-known character , many wild anecdotes of whom had found their way even into his study . 
At first Anton feared that the two would never suit . 
Two greater contrasts could hardly be imagined ; the thin , transparent hand of Bernhard , and the healthy , muscular development of Fink ; the bent form of the one , the elastic strength of the other ; here , a deeply-lined face , with dreamy eyes ; there , a proud set of features , lighted up by a glance like an eagle 's -- how could these possibly harmonize ? 
But all turned out better than he had expected . 
Bernhard listened with much interest to what Fink had to say of foreign countries , and Anton did all he could to turn the conversation to subjects likely to bring out Bernhard . 
The result was , that a few days later Bernhard found himself sitting in one of Fink 's easy-chairs , and even ventured to invite him , with Anton , to spend an evening with him . 
Fink consented . 
And now arose great excitement in the Ehrenthal circle . 
Bernhard dusted his books and set them in order , and for the first time in his life troubled himself about household matters . 
`` We must have tea , supper , wine , and cigars , '' said he . 
`` You need not be uneasy , '' replied his mother ; `` Herr von Fink shall find every thing well arranged . '' 
`` I will buy you some of the very finest cigars , and see to the wine , '' added his father . 
As the hour drew near , Bernhard grew increasingly anxious , nay , irritable . 
`` Where is the tea-kettle ? 
The tea-kettle is not yet in my room ! 
Nothing is ready ! '' 
cried he to his mother . 
`` I will make the tea and send it in -- that is the fashionable way , '' replied his mother , rustling up and down in a new silk . 
`` No , '' said Bernhard , decidedly , `` I will make the tea myself . 
Anton makes it , and so does Von Fink . '' 
`` Bernhard will make the tea himself ! '' 
cried the astonished mother to Rosalie . 
`` Wonderful ! 
he will make his own tea ! '' 
exclaimed Ehrenthal , who was in his room drawing on his boots . 
`` He is going to make the tea ! '' 
cried the cook in the kitchen , clapping her hands in amazement . 
On their way , Anton said to Fink , `` It is very kind of you , Fritz , to come ; Bernhard will be delighted . '' 
`` One must make sacrifices , '' replied Fink . 
`` I have taken the liberty to eat my supper beforehand , for I have a horror of Jewish cookery . 
But the handsomest girl in town is worth a little effort . 
I saw her lately at a concert -- a gorgeous figure , and such eyes ! 
The old usurer , her father , has never seen such diamonds pass through his hands . '' 
`` We are invited to see Bernhard , '' replied Anton , somewhat reproachfully . 
`` And we shall certainly see his sister too , '' said Fink . 
`` I hope not , '' thought Anton . 
Bernhard 's room was wonderfully adorned for their reception , and he himself was a most pleasant host . 
The three were soon in full talk . 
Fink was in one of his most benevolent moods , and Anton mentally prayed that the beautiful sister might be kept out of sight . 
But , just as the clock struck nine , the door opened , and Madam Ehrenthal majestically crossed the threshold . 
`` Bathsheba entering in to Solomon , '' whispered Fink to Anton , who angrily trod upon his foot in return . 
Bernhard , in some embarrassment , introduced his mother , and she invited them all three to the next room , where Ehrenthal and the fair Rosalie awaited them . 
Fink soon fell into a lively discussion with her about music , for which , in reality , he little cared ; promised her an excellent place at the ensuing races , and told her and her mother satirical anecdotes of the best society , which , as they were excluded from it , they particularly enjoyed . 
A princess of celebrated beauty came under discussion . 
Fink , who had been introduced to her once upon a time , declared that the young lady now before him might be taken for her , except , indeed , that the princess was not quite so tall and majestic-looking ; and then he went into ecstasies over Mrs. Ehrenthal 's mosaic brooch . 
The paternal Ehrenthal , however , tried in vain to keep up a conversation with him . 
Fink contrived not to appear aware of his presence , without , however , being in any way rude . 
Every one felt it to be in the nature of things ; and Ehrenthal himself humbly acted the part of nonentity assigned to him , and consoled himself by eating a whole pheasant . 
The supper lasted till midnight , and then Rosalie moved to the piano , after which Fink ran his fingers over the keys , and sang a wild Spanish song . 
When at length the guests took their departure , the family remained perfectly enraptured . 
Rosalie ran to the piano to try and remember the air Fink had sung ; her mother was full of his praises , and her father , spite of his temporary annihilation , was enchanted with the visit of the rich young heir , and kept repeating that he must be worth more than a million . 
Even Bernhard 's ingenuous spirit was captivated by his manner and brilliant rattle . 
True , he had occasionally felt an uncomfortable misgiving , as though Fink might be making fun of them all ; but he was too inexperienced to feel sure of it , and soothed himself by thinking that it was only the way of all men of the world . 
Anton alone was dissatisfied with his friend , and he told him so as they walked home . 
`` Why , you sat there like a stock , '' replied Fink ; `` I entertained the good people , and what more would you have ? 
Change yourself into a mouse , creep into the decked-out room , and hear how they are singing my praises . 
What more can be wanted than that our behavior to people should be what they themselves find pleasant ? '' 
`` I think , '' said Anton , `` that our aim should rather be to behave in a manner worthy of ourselves . 
You went on like a frivolous nobleman who meant to ask a loan from old Ehrenthal on the morrow . '' 
`` I choose to be frivolous , '' cried Fink ; `` and perhaps I may want a loan from the Ehrenthal house . 
And now have done with your preachments -- it is past one o'clock . '' 
A few days later , Anton remembered , at the close of the office , that he had promised to send on a book to the young student . 
As Fink , who had gone out an hour before , had carried off his paletot , which indeed often happened , Anton wrapped himself in Fink 's burnoose , which chanced to lie in his room , and hurried off to Ehrenthal 's house . 
As he reached the door , he was not a little amazed to see it noiselessly open , and a shawled and veiled figure come out . 
A soft arm wound itself round his , and a low voice said , `` Come quickly ; I have waited for you long . '' 
Anton recognized Rosalie 's voice , and stood petrified . 
At length he said , `` You are mistaken . '' 
With a suppressed scream the young lady rushed up stairs , and Anton , little less confused , entered his friend 's room , where he had the shock of being at once addressed by the short-sighted Bernhard as Herr von Fink . 
A dreadful suspicion crossed his mind ; and , pretending to be in the utmost haste , he carried the luckless cloak home , over a heart full of grief and anger . 
If it were , indeed , Fink that Ehrenthal 's fair daughter had been expecting ! 
The longer Anton had to wait for his friend , the more angry he grew . 
At last he heard his step in the court-yard -- ran down to meet him -- told him the circumstance -- and ended by saying , `` Look ! 
I wore your cloak ; it was dusk ; and I have a horrible suspicion that she mistook me for you , and that you have most unjustifiably abused Bernhard 's friendship . '' 
`` Ah ha ! '' 
said Fink , shaking his head , `` here we have a proof of how ready these virtuous ones are to throw a stone at others . 
You are a child . 
There are other white cloaks in the town ; how can you prove that mine was the one waited for ? 
And then allow me to remark , that you showed neither politeness nor presence of mind on the occasion . 
Why not have led the lady down stairs , and when the mistake became apparent , have said , ` It is true that I am not he you take me for , but I am equally ready to die in your service , ' and so forth ? '' 
`` You do n't deceive me , '' rejoined Anton ; `` when I think the matter over , I can not , spite of your lies , shake off the belief that you were the one expected . '' 
`` You cunning little fellow , '' said Fink , good-humoredly , `` confess , at least , that when a lady is in the case , I needs must lie . 
For seest thou , my son , to admit this were to compromise the fair daughter of an honorable house . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Anton , `` I fear that she already feels herself compromised . '' 
`` Never mind , '' said Fink , coolly , `` she will bear it . '' 
`` But , Fritz , '' said Anton , wringing his hands , `` have you , then , no sense of the wrong you are doing to Bernhard ? 
It is just because his pure heart beats in the midst of a family circle that he only endures because he is so trusting and inexperienced , that this injury pains me so bitterly . '' 
`` Therefore you will do wisely to spare your friend 's sensitiveness , and keep his sister 's secret . '' 
`` Not so , '' replied Anton , indignantly ; `` my duty to Bernhard leads me to a different course . 
I must demand from you that you break off your connection with Rosalie , whatever its nature , and strive only to see in her what you always should have seen -- the sister of my friend . '' 
`` Really , '' returned Fink , in a mocking tone , `` I have no objection to your making this demand ; but if I do not comply with it , how then ? 
-- always supposing , which , by the way , I deny , that I was the fortunate expected one . '' 
`` If you do not , '' cried Anton , in high excitement , `` I can never forgive you . 
This is more than mere want of feeling -- it is something worse . '' 
`` And what , pray ? '' 
coldly asked Fink . 
`` It is base , '' cried Anton . 
`` It is bad enough to take advantage of the young girl 's coquetry , but worse to forget her brother as well as me , through whom you made this unfortunate acquaintance . '' 
`` Be so good as to hear me say , '' replied Fink , lighting the lamp of his tea-kettle , `` that I never gave you any right to speak to me thus . 
I have no wish to quarrel with you , but I shall be much obliged to you henceforth to drop this subject . '' 
`` Then I must leave you , for I can speak of nothing else while I have the conviction that you are acting unworthily . '' 
Anton moved to the door . 
`` I give you your choice ; either you break with Rosalie , or , dreadful as it is to me to think of it , you break with me . 
If you do not by to-morrow evening give me an assurance that this intrigue is at an end , I go to Rosalie 's mother . '' 
`` Good-night , thou stupid Tony ! '' 
said Fink . 
The following day was a gray one for both . 
It was Fink 's constant custom , on entering the office , to beckon to his friend , whereupon Anton would leave his place , and exchange a few words as to how Fink had spent the previous evening . 
But this morning Anton doggedly remained where he was , and bent down over his letters when Fink took his seat opposite him . 
Whenever they looked up , they had to make as though empty space were before them , and not each other 's faces . 
Fink had found it easy to treat the paternal Ehrenthal as a nonentity , but it was not so in this case ; and Anton , who had had no practice in the art of overlooking others , felt himself supremely uncomfortable .
