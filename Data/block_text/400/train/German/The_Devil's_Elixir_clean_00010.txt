Many times , however , she now underwent severe conflicts on account of a transient recurrence of her not yet wholly conquered passion ; but against these her mind was fortified by the constant presence and advice of Hermogen . 
Thirdly , and lastly , comes a detail of recent circumstances which are already sufficiently intelligible . 
No sooner had Medardus , in consequence of Aurelia 's representations , been thrown into prison , and , by the opinion of every one , already prejudged to the scaffold , than she became dreadfully agitated ; and , although conscious that her conduct was but the fulfilment of imperious duty , and feeling the utmost abhorrence for him as a criminal , yet with these feelings was blended a share of compassion , so that she almost regretted what she had done . 
At this period , the discovery of the insane monk , in whom Cyrillus recognized the true Medardus -- the proofs received from Posen , that the individual who had , in consequence of her accusations , been imprisoned , was a Polish nobleman , and never had been a monk -- effected an entire revolution in her mind . 
Regret for the sufferings which she had so unwarrantably inflicted , led naturally to the revival of her early passion , which had now found a legitimate and innocent object . 
She dwells with satisfaction on many attributes of character and demeanour , in which her beloved Leonard differs from , and contrasts with , the detestable monk , by whom her brother had been put to death . 
Only the adventure at the Princess 's country-house had , for a time , broken in upon this confidence , and given rise to many harassing doubts and fears , with an oppressive feeling of mystery , by which her mind is still clouded , and against which she earnestly entreats the prayers and maternal blessing of the Abbess for herself and her betrothed husband . -RSB- 
Repeatedly , and with the greatest attention , I read over this letter of Aurelia , especially the latter pages , in which there was obviously displayed so much of true piety and confiding simplicity of heart , that , at our next meeting , I was unable to continue my addresses in the tone and manner in which I had before indulged . 
Aurelia remarked this change in my conduct ; and , struck with remorse , I penitentially confessed to her my robbery of her letter addressed to the Lady Abbess -- -LRB- which , however , I had duly sealed and forwarded -RRB- -- excusing myself on the principle , that some mysterious and supernatural impulse had forced me to this deed , against which it was impossible to contend . 
I insisted also , that a similar influence , emanating from some high and inexplicable source , had already shadowed forth to me in visions some of the principal incidents in her life , which the perusal of the letter , therefore , had only confirmed and realized . 
-- `` As a proof , '' said I , `` of the intellectual sympathy existing betwixt us , I could long ere now have informed you of a wonderful dream by which I was myself visited , in which you confessed to me your love ; but methought I was transformed into a miserable monk , whose heart , instead of being rejoiced by such good fortune , was torn by remorse and self-reproach . 
I loved you , indeed , with the utmost fervour ; but my love was mortal sin ; for I had regularly taken the vows of a Capuchin ; and you , Aurelia , were metamorphosed into the blessed St Rosalia . '' 
At these words Aurelia started up in affright . 
`` For God 's sake , Leonard , '' said she , `` say no more ! 
Our lives are mutually obscured by some frightful and impenetrable mystery ; and the less we endeavour to break through the veil by which it is now wrapt in darkness , the better . 
Who knows what insupportable horrors may be therein concealed ? 
Let us think no more of such frightful inquiries , but rely firmly on each other . 
That you have read my letter to the Abbess no doubt surprises and vexes me . 
But what is done can not be retrieved . 
As to its contents , I would willingly have imparted them to you viva voce , if I had known that it was to serve any good purpose , for no secrets dare exist betwixt us . 
But to say the truth , Leonard , it appears to me that you yourself struggle against the evil influence of much that is wrapt up in your own bosom , and which , on account of false shame , you do not allow to pass your lips . 
If possible , be for the future sincere ! 
How much would your heart be lightened by a free confession , and as to our attachment , its bonds would thereby be strengthened tenfold ! '' 
At these words of Aurelia , I felt in all its bitterness the torment of conscious deception and hypocrisy . 
I reflected with the keenest self-reproach , how , only a few moments before , I had voluntarily practised imposition against this pious simple-hearted girl ; and an almost unconquerable impulse arose within me to confess to her all -- even the worst that I could utter against myself , and yet methought I should not even then lose her affection ! 
`` Aurelia ! 
my guardian angel , who rescued me from -- '' I had thus even begun my confession , when the Princess abruptly entered the room , and produced an entire change , not only in my behaviour , but in my feelings . 
Her manner , as usual , was haughty and ceremonious . 
I met her with all the outward forms of respect , but internally with emotions of scorn and defiance . 
As the acknowledged bridegroom of Aurelia , she was now obliged to bear with me , and I boldly kept my place , though I perceived that her aversion to me was by no means abated . 
In truth , it was only when alone with Aurelia that I was now free from all wicked thoughts and impulses . 
At such moments , the beatitude of Heaven seemed to descend on me , and I began once more to wish anxiously for our marriage , in despite of every obstacle . 
About this time it came to pass that a remarkable dream one night greatly disturbed my rest , by the recollection of which I continued for several days to be haunted . 
Methought the figure of my mother stood vividly before me , and when I wished to salute and welcome her , I perceived it was but an aerial phantom which assumed her features , and mocked my filial embrace . 
`` To what purpose this absurd deception ? '' 
cried I , angrily -- `` Thou delusive shadow , what would ` st thou here ? '' 
Then methought my mother wept bitterly . 
The tears that she shed were changed into bright dazzling stars which floated through the air , and began to form a circle round my head ; but ever and anon , a black frightful hand , like that of a demon , with long claws , broke the circle as soon as it was nearly formed . 
`` Thou , whom I brought pure and sinless into the world , '' said my mother , `` and whose infancy and youth I watched over with such care , hast thou lost all energy and self-command , that thou submittest , like a grovelling slave , to every enticement of Satan ? 
Now , indeed , I can look into thine inmost heart , since the load of earthly existence , under which I have long struggled , is taken from my shoulders . 
Rouse thyself , Franciscus ! 
Resist the fiend that besets thee , and he will flee ! 
I shall once more adorn thee , as in early days , with ribbons and flowers , for St Bernard 's day is come , and thou shalt again be a pious and happy child ! '' 
Now it seemed to me as if , in obedience to my mother 's admonition , I must once more begin singing one of the lovely anthems which I had learned in my youth , but frightful and indescribable noises overpowered my voice . 
My attempts at music were like the howling of a wild beast ; and betwixt me and my phantom visitant there fell , rustling and undulating , the folds of a massy black veil , supported by the spectral arms of demons , with long hideous talons . 
Thus ended my dream . 
Two days afterwards , I happened to meet in the park the chief judge of the criminal court , who came up to me in a very friendly manner , and entered into conversation . 
`` Do you know , '' said he , `` that the final issue of Medardus 's trial has again become very doubtful ? 
Judgment of death had nearly been pronounced against him , indeed was all but carried into effect , when he again shewed symptoms of madness . 
The court received intelligence of the death of his mother . 
I made this known to him . 
Then he laughed aloud like a maniac , and in a tone which would have inspired the stoutest heart with horror -- ` The Duchess of Neuenburg ! ' 
said he , -LRB- naming the wife of the late Duke , brother of our Sovereign , -RRB- -- ` She is long since dead . 
If this is all the intelligence you had to bring , the trouble might have been spared ! ' 
`` In consequence of this paroxysm , the execution of the sentence is delayed , and a new medical inquiry set on foot . 
However , it is generally believed that his madness is only pretended , and that his condemnation is therefore inevitable . '' 
I afterwards obtained information of the day and hour of my mother 's death , and found that these corresponded exactly with the time at which she had appeared to me in that remarkable vision . 
* * * * * The day which the Prince had appointed for our marriage was at last arrived ; and the ceremony was to take place in the morning , at the altar of St Rosalia , in the church of a neighbouring convent , which -LRB- I know not for what reason -RRB- Aurelia preferred to the Prince 's chapel . 
I passed the preceding night in watching and prayer . 
-- Alas ! 
I did not reflect that prayer under such circumstances , and cherishing such intentions in my heart , was only adding by blasphemy to my previous guilt . 
When I went to Aurelia , she came , dressed in white , and wearing roses as her only ornament , to meet me . 
Never had she looked more beautiful ; but in the fashion of her dress , and in the flower wreaths that she had chosen , there was something that inspired me with strange and mysterious recollections , which I knew not how to define . 
At the same moment I remembered that the painting over the altar , at which the marriage ceremony was to take place , represented the martyrdom of St Rosalia , and that the saint was there dressed precisely as Aurelia now appeared , whereupon my whole frame was shaken with horrid and uncontrollable apprehensions , which it was hardly in my power to conceal . 
We had no time for conversation , however . 
Scarcely had I saluted Aurelia , when a servant of the Prince announced that we were waited for by the wedding-party . 
She quickly drew on her gloves , and gave me her arm . 
Then one of her attendants remarked that some ringlets of her hair had fallen loose , and begged for a moment 's delay . 
Aurelia seemed vexed at the interruption , but waited accordingly . 
At that moment a hollow rumbling noise , and a tumult of voices on the street , attracted our attention . 
At Aurelia 's request I hastened to the window . 
There , just before the palace , was a leiter-wagen , which , on account of some obstacle , had stopped in the street . 
The car was surrounded by the executioners of justice ; and within it , I perceived the horrible monk , who sat looking backwards , while before him was a capuchin , earnestly engaged in prayer . 
His countenance was deadly pale , and again disfigured by a grizzly beard , but the features of my detestable double were to me but too easily recognizable . 
When the carriage , that had been for a short space interrupted by the crowd , began to roll on , he seemed awoke from his reverie , and turning up his staring spectral eyes towards me , instantly became animated . 
He laughed and howled aloud -- '' Brüd-er-lein -- Brüd-er-lein ! '' 
cried he . 
-- `` Bride-groom ! 
-- Bride-groom ! 
-- Come quickly -- come quickly . 
-- Up -- up to the roof of the house . 
There the owl holds his wedding-feast ; the weather-cock sings aloud ! 
There shall we contend together , and whoever casts the other down , is king , and may drink blood ! '' 
The howling voice in which he uttered these words , the glare of his eyes , and the horrible writhings of his visage , that was like that of an animated corse , were more than , weakened as I was by previous agitation , I was able to withstand . 
From that moment I lost all self-possession ; I became also utterly insane , and unconscious what I did ! 
At first I tried to speak calmly . 
`` Horrible wretch ! '' 
said I ; `` what mean ` st thou ? 
What would ` st thou from me ? '' 
Then I grinned , jabbered , and howled back to the madman ; and Aurelia , in an agony of terror , broke from her attendants , and ran up to me . 
With all her strength , she seized my arms , and endeavoured to draw me from the window . 
`` For God 's sake , '' cried she , `` leave that horrible spectacle ; they are dragging Medardus , the murderer of my brother , to the scaffold . 
Leonard ! 
-- Leonard ! '' 
Then all the demons of hell seemed awoke within me , and manifested , in its utmost extent , that power which they are allowed to exercise over an obdurate and unrepentant sinner . 
With reckless cruelty I repulsed Aurelia , who trembled , as if shook by convulsions , in every limb . 
-- `` Ha -- ha -- ha ! '' 
I almost shrieked aloud -- `` foolish , insane girl ! 
I myself , thy lover , thy chosen bridegroom , am the murderer of thy brother ! 
Would ` st thou by thy complaints bring down destruction from heaven on thy sworn husband ? 
-- Ho -- ho -- ho ! 
I am king -- I am king -- and will drink blood ! '' 
I drew out the stiletto -- I struck at Aurelia , -- blood streamed over my arm and hand , and she fell lifeless at my feet . 
I rushed down stairs , -- forced my way through the crowd to the carriage -- seized the monk by the collar , and with supernatural strength tore him from the car . 
Then I was arrested by the executioner ; but with the stiletto in my hand , I defended myself so furiously , that I broke loose , and rushed into the thick of the mob , where , in a few moments , I found myself wounded by a stab in the side ; but the people were struck with such terror , that I made my way through them as far as to the neighbouring wall of the park , which , by a frightful effort , I leapt over . 
`` Murder -- murder ! 
-- Stop -- stop the murderer ! '' 
I had fallen down , almost fainting , on the other side of the wall , but these outcries instantly gave me new strength . 
Some were knocking with great violence , in vain endeavours to break open one of the park gates , which , not being the regular entrance , was always kept closed . 
Others were striving to clamber over the wall , which I had cleared by an incredible leap . 
I rose , and exerting my utmost speed , ran forward . 
I came , ere long , to a broad fosse , by which the park was separated from the adjoining forest . 
By another tremendous effort , I jumped over , and continued to run on through the wood , until at last I sank down , utterly exhausted , under a tree . 
I know not how the time had passed , but it was already evening , and dark shadows reigned through the forest , when I came again to my recollection . 
My progress in running so far had passed over like an obscure dream . 
I recollect only the wind roaring amid the dense canopy of the trees , and that many times I mistook some old moss-grown pollard stem for an officer of justice , armed and ready to seize upon me ! 
When I awoke from the swoon and utter stupefaction into which I had fallen , my first impulse was merely to set out again , like a hunted wild beast , and fly , if possible , from my pursuers to the very end of the earth ! 
As soon , however , as I was only past the frontiers of the Prince 's dominions , I would certainly be safe from all immediate persecution . 
I rose accordingly , but scarcely had I advanced a few steps , when there was a violent rustling in the thicket ; and from thence , in a state of the most vehement rage and excitement , sprung the monk , who , no doubt in consequence of the disturbance that I had raised , had contrived to make his escape from the guards and executioners . 
In a paroxysm of madness he flew towards me , leaping through the bushes like a tiger , and finally sprung upon my shoulders , clasping his arms about my throat , so that I was almost suffocated . 
Under any other circumstances , I would have instantly freed myself from such an attack , but I was enfeebled to the last degree by the exertions I had undergone , and all that I could attempt was to render this feebleness subservient to my rescue . 
I fell down under his weight , and endeavoured to take advantage of that event . 
I rolled myself on the ground , and grappled with him ; but in vain ! 
I could not disengage myself , and my infernal double laughed scornfully . 
His abominable accents , `` He -- he -- he ! 
-- He -- he -- he ! '' 
sounded amid the desolate loneliness of the woods . 
During this contest , the moon broke , only for a moment , through the clouds , for the night was gloomy and tempestuous . 
Then , as her silvery gleam slanted through the dark shade of the pine trees , I beheld , in all its horror , the deadly pale visage of my second self , with the same expression which had glared out upon me from the cart in which he had been dragged to execution . 
`` He -- he -- he -- Broth-er , broth-er ! 
-- Ever , ever I am with thee ! 
-- Leave thee , leave thee never ! 
-- Can not run as thou canst ! 
Must carry -- carry me ! 
Come straight from the gallows -- They would have nailed me to the wheel -- He -- he -- he ! 
-- He -- he -- he ! '' 
Thus the infernal spectre howled and laughed aloud as we lay on the ground ; but ere the fleeting moonbeam had passed away , I was roused once more to furious rage . 
I sprang up like a bear in the embraces of a boa-constrictor , and ran with my utmost force against trees and fragments of rock , so that if I could not kill him , I might at least wound him in such manner that he would be under the necessity of letting me go . 
But in vain . 
He only laughed the more loudly and scornfully ; and my personal sufferings were increased tenfold by my endeavours to end them . 
I then strove with my whole remaining strength to burst asunder his hands , which were firmly knotted round my throat , but the supernatural energies of the monster threatened me with strangulation . 
At last , after a furious conflict , he suddenly fell , as if lifeless , on the ground : and though scarcely able to breathe , I had run onwards for some yards , when again he sat upon my shoulders , laughing as before , and stammering out the same horrible words . 
Of new succeeded the same efforts of despairing rage ! 
Of new I was freed ! 
Then again locked in the embraces of this demoniacal spectre ! 
After this I lost all consciousness . 
-- I am utterly unable to say distinctly how long I was persecuted by my relentless double . 
It seems to me as if my struggles must have continued at least during a whole month ; and that during this long period I neither ate nor drank . 
I remember only one lucid interval . 
All the rest is utter darkness . 
I had just succeeded in throwing off my double , when a clear gleam of sun-light brightened the woods , and with it a pleasant sound of bells rose on mine ear . 
I distinguished unequivocally the chimes of a convent , which rung for early mass . 
For a moment I rejoiced ; but then the thought came like annihilation upon me -- `` Thou hast murdered Aurelia ! '' 
and once more losing all self-possession and recollection , I fell in despair upon the earth . 
Methought the air in which I breathed had a mildness and fragrance such as now I had never known ; but , as yet , I was labouring under the influence of a deep and morbid slumber . 
I felt a strange irritation , a shooting prickly pain in every vein and fibre , till it seemed as if my frame was split and divided an hundred fold , and every division thence arising assumed a peculiar and individual principle of life , while the head in vain strove to command the limbs , which , like unfaithful vassals , would not submit themselves to its dominion . 
Then , methought , each of these separated parts became a glittering fiery point , which began to turn itself round in a circle , till hundreds of them , whirling rapidly together , formed at last the appearance of a fixed ball of fire , which darted forth flames and coruscations . 
`` These are my limbs which are thus moving , '' said I to myself ; `` now I am for certain about to awake . '' 
At that moment , when the fiery ball was turning round , I felt sudden and violent pain , and distinctly heard the sound of a clear chime of bells . 
`` Away , away -- Onward , onward ! '' 
cried I , believing myself still in the wood , and making a vehement effort to rise up , but I fell back powerless on my couch . 
Now , for the first time , I was restored to perfect consciousness , and saw , with great surprise , that I was no longer in the forest . 
In the dress of a Capuchin monk , I lay upon a well-stuffed mattress . 
The room was vaulted and lofty ; a pair of rush-bottomed chairs , and a small table , stood beside my bed . 
I concluded that my state of unconsciousness must have continued for a long time , and that , while in that unhappy situation , I must have been brought to some convent or other , where the monks were , by their rule , obliged to receive the sick . 
Probably my clothes had been torn , and they had been obliged , for the meanwhile , to supply me with a cowl . 
However this might be , there was no doubt that I had escaped from all immediate danger . 
I was also free from pain , though very weak , therefore continued quite tranquil , having no doubt that my protectors would , in due time , look after their charge . 
Accordingly , it was not long before I heard steps that seemed , from their sound , to approach through a long stone-floored gallery . 
My door opened , and I saw two men , of whom one had a lay dress , the other wore the habit of the brethren of charity . 
They came up to me in silence ; the man in the lay dress fixed his eyes on me , and seemed much astonished . 
`` I am again come to myself , sir , '' said I , in a weak voice . 
`` Heaven be praised , who has restored to me my reason . 
But will you be so good as to inform me where I am , and how I have been brought hither ? '' 
Without answering me , the physician -LRB- as I supposed him to be -RRB- turned to the clergyman , and said , in Italian , `` This is indeed very extraordinary . 
His looks are , since our last visit , completely changed . 
His speech is quite clear , only weak . 
Some particular crisis must have taken place in his malady . '' 
`` For my part , '' said the monk , `` I have no doubt that he is completely cured . '' 
`` Of that , '' said the physician , `` we can not judge , until we have seen how he may conduct himself for the next few days . 
But do you not understand as much German as to speak with him ? '' 
The monk answered in the negative . 
`` I understand and speak Italian , '' interrupted I. `` Tell me , then , I beseech you , where I am , and how I found my way hither ? '' 
`` Ha ! '' 
cried the physician , `` our difficulties are then at an end . 
You find yourself , reverend sir , in a place where every possible precaution has been , and will be taken , for your perfect recovery . 
Three months ago you were brought hither in a very critical and dangerous situation ; but , under our care and attention , you seem to have made great progress towards convalescence ; and if we shall have the good fortune to complete your cure , you may then freely pursue your journey , for , as I have understood , you wish to go to Rome . '' 
`` Did I come to you , then , '' said I , `` in this Capuchin dress which I now wear ? '' 
`` Truly you did so , '' said the physician ; `` but give over , I pray you , this asking of questions , and do not disquiet yourself -- everything shall , in due time , be explained to your satisfaction . 
Our business at present is to attend to your bodily health . '' 
He then felt my pulse , and the monk , who had for a moment disappeared , returned with a cup full of some liquid , which the physician desired me to drink , and then to tell him what I thought it was . 
I obeyed , and told him that what I had drunk seemed to me a strong and nourishing meat-broth . 
`` Good -- very good , '' said the monk , with a smile of satisfaction . 
They then left me alone , with a promise of returning in a short time . 
Through the next three days , I was attended with the utmost skill and kindness by the brethren and the physician . 
I continued rapidly to improve , and at the end of that time was able to rise up , and , leaning on the monk 's arm , to walk through the room . 
He led me to the window and opened the lattice . 
A delightfully warm and fragrant -LRB- but not sultry -RRB- air , such as till then I had never breathed , came in at the window . 
Without , I beheld an extensive garden , wherein all sorts of fruit-trees grew , and flourished in the highest luxuriance . 
There were also delightful arbours , bowers , and temples ; while , even around the window from which I looked , the grapes hung in rich massy clusters . 
Above all , however , it was , with the clear cloudless blue of the sky that I was altogether enchanted . 
I could not find words to express my admiration . 
`` Where am I then ? '' 
cried I. `` Have the blessed saints granted to a wretched sinner to dwell in their Elysium ? '' 
The monk smiled contentedly at my raptures . 
`` You are in Italy , brother , '' said he . 
`` In Italy ! '' 
repeated I , with the utmost astonishment . 
I then urged the clergyman to explain to me more particularly how I could have found my way to such a distance . 
He referred me to the physician , who just then entered , and who at last informed me , that a strange man of most eccentric manners had brought me hither about three months ago , and begged that I might be taken into their house ; that , finally , I was in a regular hospital , which was taken charge of by the brethren of charity . 
As I gradually gained more strength , I found that the monk and physician willingly entered into conversation with me on various subjects of literature and the arts . 
The latter , as if in order to obtain information for himself , even requested me to write down many things which he afterwards read over in my presence ; but I was puzzled by observing that , instead of praising what I had written on its own account , he only said , `` Indeed ? 
-- This looks well ! 
-- I have not been deceived -- Excellent -- excellent ! '' 
I was now allowed at certain hours to walk in the garden , where , however , I was greatly discomposed by the sight of strange spectral figures , who , as if quite unable to take care of themselves , were led about by the monks . 
Once , in particular , I was struck by the appearance of a tall haggard man , in a dingy yellow mantle , who was led by two of the brethren , one on each side , and in this manner met me as I was returning to the house . 
At every step , he made the most absurd gesticulations , as if he were about to commence a pas seul , at the same time whistling shrilly an accompaniment . 
Astonished at this , I stood gazing on the man , but the monk by whom I was attended drew me suddenly away . 
`` Come , come , dear brother Medardus ! '' 
said he , `` that is no business of yours ! '' 
`` For God 's sake , '' said I , `` tell me how is it that you know anything of my name ? '' 
The vehemence with which I put this question seemed to discompose my attendant . 
`` For what reason , '' said he , `` should we not know your name ? 
The man by whom you were brought hither , named you without hesitation , and you were accordingly entered in the list of the house -- Medardus , brother of the Capuchin Convent at Königswald . '' 
Once more I felt the ice-cold shuddering of terror vibrate in every limb . 
But whoever was the unknown by whom I had been brought to the hospital , whether he were or were not initiated in the horrible mysteries of my life , he certainly had not cherished any evil intentions towards me , for I had been treated with the greatest care and tenderness , and was , besides , at liberty to go whereever I wished . 
After this walk , I had returned to my chamber , and was leaning out at the open window inhaling the delightful fragrance of the air , which seemed to inspire me with new life and energy in every fibre , when I beheld in the garden a man coming up the middle walk , whom I thought that I had seen before , but could not immediately recollect where . 
He was a diminutive withered figure , had upon his head a small hat with a long peaked crown , and was dressed in a miserable weather-beaten surtout . 
In his gait , he rather danced than walked ; nay , every now and then cut a caper right up into the air ; and anon , started off to one side , as if he were possessed by the demon of St Vitus . 
Occasionally he made a full stop , and at one of these intervals , perceiving me at the window , he took off his high-peaked hat , and waved it in the air , then kissed his hand repeatedly , with an emphasis of gesticulation which at once confirmed and cleared up my recollection . 
There was but one individual in the world who could have practised these manoeuvres , and that was Belcampo ! 
He vanished , however , among the trees ; but , not long afterwards , I heard a particular rap at the door , of which the style and manner immediately taught me whom I was to expect . 
`` Schönfeld ! '' 
said I , as he indeed made his appearance ; `` how , in the name of wonder , have you found your way hither ? '' 
`` Ach -- ach ! '' 
said he , twisting his face , as if he were about to weep -- `` how should I have come hither otherwise than driven and hurled onwards as I was by that malignant and relentless destiny , which never fails to persecute every man of true genius . 
On account of a murder , I was obliged to fly from the rich and flourishing town of Frankenburg . '' 
`` On account of a murder ! 
-- What would ` st thou say ? '' 
interrupted I , with considerable agitation . 
`` Ay , truly , '' answered he -- `` on account of a murder . 
I had , in a fit of wrath , immolated the left whisker of the youngest Commerziensrath in that free town , and had also dangerously wounded the right mustachio . '' 
`` Once more , '' said I , `` I must beg of you to give up these absurd and unmeaning jokes , and to tell your story connectedly , otherwise you had better leave the room . '' 
`` Nay , dear brother Medardus , '' he resumed , `` this is indeed unforeseen and unaccountable ; now that you are restored to health , you would send me from you in disgrace ; but , as long as you were ill , you were glad to have me for a companion in your room , and to be always near to you . '' 
`` What does all this mean ? '' 
cried I , quite confounded ; `` and how have you got to the knowledge of my name Medardus ? '' 
`` Look , '' said he , with an ironical smile , `` if you please , at the right-hand lappelle of your monk 's cowl . '' 
I did so , and became almost petrified with terror and astonishment , for I found the name `` Medardus '' embroidered thereupon ; and , on more accurate inspection , I could discover also that this was the identical tunic which , on my flight from the castle of the Baron von F -- , I had thrown into a hollow tree in the forest . 
Schönfeld did not fail to remark my agitation , over which he seemed wickedly to triumph . 
With his fore-finger on his nose , and lifting himself on tiptoe , he looked stedfastly in my face . 
I remained speechless ; then , in a low and pensive tone , he resumed -- `` Your excellency , no doubt , wonders at the handsome dress which has been chosen for you . 
To say the truth , it seemed in every respect to fit and become you better than the nut-brown suit , with plated buttons , which my wise friend Damon supplied for you . 
It was I , the banished , the despised and misunderstood Belcampo , who provided for you this dress , in order to cover your nakedness . 
Brother Medardus , you were then , indeed , but in a sorry plight , for , instead of great-coat , vest , pantaloons , English frock , & c. & c. you wore , in the simplest , and most unpretending manner , your own skin . 
As to a proper friseur , you thought as little of him as you did of a tailor , performing his functions with your own ten fingers , in a style which was by no means to be commended . '' 
`` Give over these disgusting follies , '' said I , much incensed ; `` Schönfeld -- I insist on your being rational , otherwise I will hear no more ! '' 
`` Pietro Belcampo is my name , '' interrupted he , with great vehemence ; `` Ay , Pietro Belcampo ; for we are now in Italy , and you must know , reverend sir , that I , simple as I here stand , impersonize that folly , which luckily has been present on every disastrous occasion , to assist your wisdom ; and without which , you would have found yourself miserably deficient . 
It is from Folly alone that you have derived protection . 
By this alone your boasted reason , which is unable to hold itself upright , but totters about like a drunk man or a child , has been supported , and instructed to find the right road home , that is to say , to the mad-house , where we are both happily arrived . '' 
By these last words I was much agitated . 
I thought on the strange figures that I had seen , especially on the tall haggard man in the dingy yellow mantle , who had made such absurd gesticulations ; and could entertain no doubt that Schönfeld had told me the truth . 
`` Ay , dear brother Medardus , '' resumed Schönfeld , with solemn voice and gestures ; `` Folly is , indeed , on this earth , the true intellectual queen . 
Reason , on the other hand , is only a pitiful viceroy , who never troubles himself with what happens beyond his own narrow boundaries , who , from sheer ennui , indeed , makes his soldiers be exercised on the parade-platz , though the said soldiers afterwards , in time of danger , can not fire a single volley in proper time . 
But Folly , the true queen of the people , marches in with kettle-drums and trumpets -- Huzza ! 
Huzza ! 
-- before and behind her , triumph and rejoicing ! 
The lieges straightway emancipate themselves from the constraint in which Reason would have held them , and will no longer stand or walk as their pedantic tutor would have them to do . 
At last he calls the roll , and complains , -- ` Lo ! 
Folly hath robbed me of my best recruits -- hath driven them away -- driven their wits a wool-gathering -- ay , driven them mad . ' 
That is a play of words , dear brother Medardus , and such play is like a glowing pair of curling-irons in the hand of Folly , with which she can twist such a thought ! '' 
`` Desist , I once more entreat of you , '' said I , `` desist from this childish clatter of unmeaning words , and tell me concisely how you came hither , and what you know regarding the dress which I now wear ! '' 
Hereupon I seized him by both arms , and forced him into a chair , where he seemed to recollect himself , fixed his eyes stedfastly on the ground , and with a deep sigh resumed , -- `` I have saved your life , '' said he , `` for the second time . 
It was I who enabled you to escape from the town of Frankenburg . 
It was I , too , who brought you hither . '' 
`` But , in the name of Heaven , '' said I , `` where did you last find me ? '' 
I had let him go , and he instantly bolted up -- `` Ha , brother Medardus , '' said he , `` if I , weak and diminutive as I seem , had not contrived to bear you on my shoulders , your limbs would by this time , have lain the food of ravens on the wheel ! '' 
I shuddered as if ready to faint , and sunk into a chair . 
At that moment my attendant monk entered the room . 
`` How hast thou come hither ? 
Who gave thee liberty now to enter this room ? '' 
said he , very angrily , to Belcampo . 
`` Alas ! 
venerable father , '' said the latter , in a supplicating tone , and pretending to burst into tears , `` I could no longer resist the vehement impulse to visit my dearest friend , whom I had rescued from danger of death ! '' 
I now recovered myself . 
`` Tell me , brother , '' said I to the monk , `` did this man really bring me hither ? '' 
The monk hesitated . 
`` I scarcely know , '' said I , `` in what sort of hospital I am now protected , but I can easily suppose that I have been in the most frightful of all conditions . 
You perceive , however , that I am now quite well , and therefore , I may hear all which was before intentionally concealed from me , when you supposed that my nerves were yet too irritable . '' 
`` It is , indeed , quite true , '' said the monk , `` this man brought you hither about three months and a half ago . 
He had , according to his own account , found you in the Lovanian forest , -LRB- which separates the dominions of the Prince of Laguria , from our district , -RRB- and had recognized you for the Capuchin Medardus from Königswald , who had before , on a journey to Rome , passed through a town where he then lived . 
`` When first brought among us , you were in a state of utter apathy . 
You walked when you were led , remained standing if one let you alone , and seated or laid yourself down according as you were put into the required position . 
Food and drink we were obliged to pour down your throat ; as to words , you were able only to utter hollow unintelligible sounds , and your eyes appeared to stare , without the power of distinguishing any object . 
Belcampo then never left you , but was your faithful attendant . 
After an interval of about a month , you fell into a state of outrageous madness , and we were obliged to place you in one of the cells appropriated for persons in that frightful malady . 
You were then like a ferocious wild beast ; but I dare not describe your sufferings more minutely , as the picture might be too painful . 
After some weeks , your state of apathy again returned , and seemed more obstinate than ever , but at last , God be praised , you awoke from your stupefaction , into your present convalescence . '' 
Schönfeld had , during this narrative of the monk , seated himself , as if in deep reflection , leaning his head on his hand . 
`` Ay , truly , '' he resumed , `` I know that I am sometimes little better than a self-conceited fool ; but the air of the mad-house , destructive to reasonable people , has on me had a very beneficial influence . 
I begin to speculate on my own errors , which is no bad sign . 
If , generally speaking , I exist only through my own self-consciousness , it is only requisite that this consciousness should pull off the fool 's motley coat , and I shall shew myself to the world , a very wise , rational gentleman . 
But , oh , heavens ! 
is not a genial friseur , according to the principles of his character and profession , a privileged fool and coxcomb ? 
Such folly is , in truth , a protection from all madness ; and I can assure you , reverend sir , that in a north-west wind , I can distinguish very well between a church-tower and a lamp-post ! '' 
`` If this be really the case , '' said I , `` give us a proof of it now by a quiet rational narrative , how you discovered me in the wood , and brought me to this house . '' 
`` That shall immediately be done , '' said Belcampo , `` though the reverend father on my right hand looks at me with a very suspicious aspect . 
You must know , then , that on the morning after your escape from Frankenburg , the foreign painter , with his collection of pictures , had also , in an inconceivable manner , vanished ; and although the disturbance that you had raised at first excited a good deal of notice , yet , in the stream of other events , and the bustle of the fair , it was ere long forgotten . 
It was not till after the murder at the castle of the Baron von F -- became generally talked of , and the magistracy of that district published handbills , offering a reward for the arrest of Medardus , a Capuchin monk in Königswald , that people were reminded of the painter having indeed told the whole story , and recognized in you the said brother Medardus . 
`` The landlord of the hotel wherein you had lodged , confirmed a supposition that had already got afloat , of my having been accessory to your flight . 
The people , therefore , fixed their attention on me , and would have thrown me into prison . 
Having long wished to quit for ever the miserable course of life that I had been dragging on , my resolution was , in consequence , very speedily adopted . 
I determined to go into Italy , where there are Abbatés with powdered wigs , and encouragement is yet afforded to an accomplished friseur . 
On my way thither I saw you in the residenz of the Prince von Rosenthurm . 
The people there talked of your marriage with the Baroness Aurelia , and of the condemnation and execution of the monk Medardus . 
`` I had also an opportunity of seeing this criminal monk , and whatever his history might have been , I was convinced at once that you were the true Medardus . 
I placed myself in your way , but you did not observe me , and I left the Prince 's residenz , in order to follow out my own plans . 
`` After a long and fatiguing journey , I had taken up my night 's rest at a small obscure hamlet . 
In the morning I rose very early , as was the custom of the inhabitants there , and prepared to continue my laborious progress through a forest , which lay in gloomy darkness before me . 
Just as the first gleams of the morning had begun to break through the clouds of the east , there was a rustling in the thickets , and a man , with his hair matted , and staring out in various directions , his beard , too , in the same disorder , but wearing an elegant modern suit of clothes , leaped past me ! 
`` His looks were wild and outrageous , and I gazed after him with the greatest astonishment , but in a moment he had disappeared again in the thick of the tangled coppice , and I could see no more of him . 
I walked onwards , therefore ; but what words can express the horror that I felt , when right before me I saw a naked human figure stretched out flat upon the ground ! 
There seemed to me no doubt that a murder had been committed , and that the fugitive whom I had before seen was the murderer . 
`` I knelt down beside the naked man , recognized at once your features , and perceived that you still breathed . 
Close beside you lay the Capuchin habit , which at this moment you are wearing . 
With much labour and stratagem I contrived to dress you in it , and to drag you along with me . 
At last you awoke out of your deep swoon , but you remained in that frightful state of apathy in which this reverend gentleman has described you . 
`` It cost me no little exertion to get you dragged along , and consequently it was not till late in the evening that I was able to reach an ale-house , which was situated in the middle of the forest . 
Here I placed you upon a bench of turf at the door , where you lay as if utterly overcome and drunk with sleep . 
I then went into the house to procure you food and drink , and , found -LRB- as I suspected might be the case -RRB- a party of hussars , who , as the hostess informed me , were in pursuit of a monk , who , in an inconceivable manner , had escaped at the moment when , on account of his enormous crimes , preparations were making for his death on the scaffold . 
`` It was to me an inexplicable mystery how you could have escaped out of the residenz into the forest ; but the entire conviction that you were the Medardus whom they now sought after , made me exert myself to the utmost to rescue you from the danger which now hovered over you . 
Of course , I brought you away directly from the ale-house , in which undertaking I was favoured by the increasing darkness ; and thereafter choosing always the by-roads and most unfrequented tracks , I succeeded at last in conducting you over the frontiers . 
`` Finally , after long and incredible wanderings , I came with you to this house , where the inhabitants received us both , as I declared that I was not willing to separate from you . 
Here I was convinced that you were perfectly secure , for by no means would the venerable fathers give up a sick person whom they had once received , to any criminal court . 
`` In this very chamber , then , I faithfully attended and nursed you ; for as to your own five senses , you were indeed but very indifferently provided . 
Nor were the movements of your limbs to be commended . 
Neither Vestris nor Noverre would have given you much encouragement , for your head hung down on your breast , and when any one wished you to stand upright , then you tumbled about like a capotted nine-pin or skittle . 
As to your celebrated eloquence , too , you fared still worse , for you were d -- d monosyllabic , and in your lucid intervals , only said , ` Hu -- hu ! ' 
and ` Me -- me ! ' 
out of which expressions your thoughts and wishes were not to be very clearly divined : Indeed , it was to be supposed , that your rational faculties had become unfaithful to you , and were gone a-vagabondizing on their own private account . 
`` At last you became all of a sudden extravagantly merry , cut inordinate capers in the air , and roared aloud with sheer exuberance of delight , tearing your habit at the same time , in order , we supposed , to escape even from the smallest restraint . 
Your appetite was then -- '' `` Stop , stop , Schönfeld , '' cried I , `` give over this horrible and cruel raillery -- you have already sufficiently informed me of the frightful situation into which I had fallen . 
Thanks and praise to the long-suffering and mercy of Heaven , and the intercession of the saints , that I am now rescued ! '' 
`` Alas ! 
reverend sir , '' resumed Schönfeld , `` in what respect are you the better of all that you have gained , I mean of this peculiar attribute of the soul , which is called self-consciousness ? 
Methinks it might well be compared to the cursed activity of a pettifogging toll-keeper , or excise-officer , at best , or a controller of customs , who has established his damnable comptoir in the brain , and upon the last indication of goods coming forth from hence , cries out ` Hey day ! 
The export is forbidden . 
These wares must remain in the country . ' 
The richest jewels , like contemptible grains of seed , remain stuck in the earth , and at last , all that rises above the surface are runkelrüben , -LSB- 4 -RSB- from an hundred thousand weight of which , perhaps a quarter of an ounce of bad sugar is afterwards extracted ; and yet this pitiful export is , forsooth , to lay the foundation of trade with the glorious city of the New Jerusalem in the realms above , where all is magnificence and splendour . 
Oh , heavens ! 
I would have given all my dearly bought powder à la Marchalle , or à la Pompadour , or à la Reine de Golconde , -- would have cast it into the river , where it is deepest , if by transi-to-trade , I could have obtained from thence but a quentlein of the golden dust of the sun 's rays , to dress the wigs of reverend professors , and men of learning , but in the first place , mine own ! 
What do I say ? 
If my excellent friend Damon , reverend sir , had , instead of the flea-coloured frock , contrived to hang about your shoulders one of those robes made of the morning light , in which the burgesses of the holy city walk to church , then , as to dignity and gentility , we should have come off very differently ; but as the matter stood , the world held you for a common glebæ adscriptus , and the devil for your cousin-german ! '' 
-LSB- Footnote 4 : Beet-roots . -RSB- 
Schönfeld had risen up , and walked , or rather hopped , about the room , with vehement gesticulations , and twisting his features into incredible contortions . 
He was in the plenitude of his vein , kindling up one folly by another . 
I therefore seized him again by both arms . 
`` Art thou resolved , '' said I , `` to secure thyself a place in this hospital instead of me ? 
Is it impossible for thee to talk more than five minutes together without falling into these absurdities ? '' 
`` Is then all that I utter , '' said he , `` so very foolish , when thus the spirit comes upon me ? '' 
`` That is precisely what renders your talk so intolerable , '' said I. `` There is often good sense at the bottom of all this gibberish , but so abominably metamorphosed , that a thought , good in itself , is like a fine dress hung over with party-coloured rags . 
Like a drunk man , thou canst not proceed in a straight direction , but art everlastingly floundering away hither and thither . 
Thy conduct is never consistent or consecutive . '' 
`` What is conduct ? '' 
said Schönfeld , with a contemptuous smile -- `` What is conduct , most venerable Capuchin ? 
Doth not that term imply the preconception in the mind of some fixed and certain object , for the attainment of which we shape and adapt our procedure ? 
Are you , reverend sir , sure of your own object ? 
Are you not rather afraid that you may have occasionally admitted too little alloy in your spirituous potations , and now , like a giddy tower-watcher , see two goals , without knowing the right one ? 
Besides , sir , let it be forgiven to one of my profession , if he is apt , perhaps too often , to have recourse to the humorous and the outré , in order to season the insipidity of this life , as we add Spanish pepper to cauliflower ; without this , an artist of my vocation would be but a pitiful dummkopf , -LSB- 5 -RSB- who carries his privilege in his pocket , without ever daring to make use of it . '' 
-LSB- Footnote 5 : Blockhead . -RSB- 
The monk had remained in the room , and had looked attentively at Belcampo and at me ; but as we spoke German , he did not understand a single word . 
At last , he resolutely interrupted our dialogue . 
`` Excuse me , gentlemen , '' said he , `` if I put an end to a discourse from which it is impossible for either of you to derive any advantage . 
Your health , brother , is yet much too weak to bear with a conversation which probably awakens painful recollections as to your past life . 
Besides , you will have time enough to learn all that your friend has to inform you of , as when you leave our establishment , he will no doubt accompany you . 
Belcampo has a strange manner of speaking ; and by his eloquence and gesticulations together , never fails , when he tells a story , to bring every adventure vividly before the eyes of his listener . 
In Germany he must , I suppose , be looked on as mad . 
Here in Italy , he would be valued as a capital buffoon , and on the stage might make a fortune . '' 
Schönfeld stared with all his might at the clergyman , then lifted himself on tiptoe , clasped his hands over his head , and called out in Italian , `` Thou warning voice from the world of spirits -- thou voice of omnipotent destiny ! 
To me thou hast spoken at last through the organs of this reverend father . 
Belcampo -- Belcampo ! 
How could ` st thou mistake so long thy true vocation ? 
It is now resolved ! '' 
He then ran out of the room , and for that day I saw no more of him . 
* * * * * Next morning he made his appearance , equipt for a journey . 
`` Dear Brother Medardus , '' said he , `` you are now quite recovered ; you do not any longer require my assistance . 
I therefore take my departure , in order to go , as the spirit moves me , into the world . 
Farewell , then ! 
Yet permit me that I exercise on you , for the last time , my art , although in my own estimation it has now become utterly contemptible . '' 
Hereupon he drew out his razors , comb , and scissars , and with a thousand grimaces , more suo , brought my hair and visage into proper order . 
At last he took his leave , with many tears ; and as the man , notwithstanding his fidelity , had become very strange and mysterious , and knew more of my history than I could have wished , I was not sorry to find myself free from his tiresome conversation . 
* * * * * The physician 's remedies had been of great service to me ; and as , by taking every day longer and longer walks , I had quite recovered my strength , I became convinced that I was able for the fatigues of a pedestrian journey , and resolved to leave a house , which , however suitable to the sick , was by no means a congenial abode for those who were in health . 
The plan of going to Rome had been , without any volition of my own , brought so far into execution . 
I had always been advancing farther towards the place of my destination , and resolved , therefore , that I would now persevere in the same course . 
At last I had taken leave of the charitable brethren , and set out as a pilgrim on that high road , which I was told was the proper route to the great city . 
Notwithstanding that my health was now thoroughly reinstated , yet I was conscious of a strange apathy of mind , which threw a dark shade on every image , rendering the prospects before me grey , withered , and cloudy . 
Without even any clear remembrance of my past life , I was completely occupied by cares for the present moment . 
Towards evening , I always looked out anxiously for some place , -LRB- generally a convent or private house , -RRB- where I would be able to extort food and shelter for the night . 
I rejoiced not a little , when I met with persons sufficiently devout to fill my knap-sack and wine-bottle , in return for which I mechanically repeated , according to monastic form , the customary blessings . 
In short , I had sunk in spirit , as well as in outward observances , into an ordinary , stupid , and depraved mendicant friar . 
At last , after many adventures , no one of which deserves particular commemoration , -LRB- for they were all of a similar character , -RRB- I came at last to a great Capuchin Convent , which , surrounded only by houses belonging to the establishment , and forming in itself a little town , is situated not far from Rome .
