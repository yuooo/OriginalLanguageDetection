`` Yea , many there be that have run out of their wits for women , and become servants for their sakes . 
Many also have perished , have erred , and sinned , for women ... . 
O ye men , how can it be but women should be strong , seeing they do thus ? '' 
-- ESDRAS . 
The schoolmaster was leaving the village , and everybody seemed sorry . 
The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination , about twenty miles off , such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teacher 's effects . 
For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers , and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master , in addition to the packing-case of books , was a cottage piano that he had bought at an auction during the year in which he thought of learning instrumental music . 
But the enthusiasm having waned he had never acquired any skill in playing , and the purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in moving house . 
The rector had gone away for the day , being a man who disliked the sight of changes . 
He did not mean to return till the evening , when the new school-teacher would have arrived and settled in , and everything would be smooth again . 
The blacksmith , the farm bailiff , and the schoolmaster himself were standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument . 
The master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster , the city he was bound for , since he was only going into temporary lodgings just at first . 
A little boy of eleven , who had been thoughtfully assisting in the packing , joined the group of men , and as they rubbed their chins he spoke up , blushing at the sound of his own voice : `` Aunt have got a great fuel-house , and it could be put there , perhaps , till you 've found a place to settle in , sir . '' 
`` A proper good notion , '' said the blacksmith . 
It was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy 's aunt -- an old maiden resident -- and ask her if she would house the piano till Mr. Phillotson should send for it . 
The smith and the bailiff started to see about the practicability of the suggested shelter , and the boy and the schoolmaster were left standing alone . 
`` Sorry I am going , Jude ? '' 
asked the latter kindly . 
Tears rose into the boy 's eyes , for he was not among the regular day scholars , who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster 's life , but one who had attended the night school only during the present teacher 's term of office . 
The regular scholars , if the truth must be told , stood at the present moment afar off , like certain historic disciples , indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid . 
The boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand , which Mr. Phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift , and admitted that he was sorry . 
`` So am I , '' said Mr. Phillotson . 
`` Why do you go , sir ? '' 
asked the boy . 
`` Ah -- that would be a long story . 
You would n't understand my reasons , Jude . 
You will , perhaps , when you are older . '' 
`` I think I should now , sir . '' 
`` Well -- do n't speak of this everywhere . 
You know what a university is , and a university degree ? 
It is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching . 
My scheme , or dream , is to be a university graduate , and then to be ordained . 
By going to live at Christminster , or near it , I shall be at headquarters , so to speak , and if my scheme is practicable at all , I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should have elsewhere . '' 
The smith and his companion returned . 
Old Miss Fawley 's fuel-house was dry , and eminently practicable ; and she seemed willing to give the instrument standing-room there . 
It was accordingly left in the school till the evening , when more hands would be available for removing it ; and the schoolmaster gave a final glance round . 
The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles , and at nine o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other impedimenta , and bade his friends good-bye . 
`` I sha n't forget you , Jude , '' he said , smiling , as the cart moved off . 
`` Be a good boy , remember ; and be kind to animals and birds , and read all you can . 
And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt me out for old acquaintance ' sake . '' 
The cart creaked across the green , and disappeared round the corner by the rectory-house . 
The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge of the greensward , where he had left his buckets when he went to help his patron and teacher in the loading . 
There was a quiver in his lip now and after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he paused and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework , his face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child 's who has felt the pricks of life somewhat before his time . 
The well into which he was looking was as ancient as the village itself , and from his present position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down . 
There was a lining of green moss near the top , and nearer still the hart 's - tongue fern . 
He said to himself , in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy , that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning like this , and would never draw there any more . 
`` I 've seen him look down into it , when he was tired with his drawing , just as I do now , and when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home ! 
But he was too clever to bide here any longer -- a small sleepy place like this ! '' 
A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well . 
The morning was a little foggy , and the boy 's breathing unfurled itself as a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air . 
His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden outcry : `` Bring on that water , will ye , you idle young harlican ! '' 
It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the garden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off . 
The boy quickly waved a signal of assent , drew the water with what was a great effort for one of his stature , landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair of smaller ones , and pausing a moment for breath , started with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stood -- nearly in the centre of the little village , or rather hamlet of Marygreen . 
It was as old-fashioned as it was small , and it rested in the lap of an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs . 
Old as it was , however , the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local history that remained absolutely unchanged . 
Many of the thatched and dormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years , and many trees felled on the green . 
Above all , the original church , hump-backed , wood-turreted , and quaintly hipped , had been taken down , and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane , or utilized as pig-sty walls , garden seats , guard-stones to fences , and rockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood . 
In place of it a tall new building of modern Gothic design , unfamiliar to English eyes , had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back in a day . 
The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to the Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level grass-plot that had immemorially been the churchyard , the obliterated graves being commemorated by eighteen-penny cast-iron crosses warranted to last five years . 
Slender as was Jude Fawley 's frame he bore the two brimming house-buckets of water to the cottage without resting . 
Over the door was a little rectangular piece of blue board , on which was painted in yellow letters , `` Drusilla Fawley , Baker . '' 
Within the little lead panes of the window -- this being one of the few old houses left -- were five bottles of sweets , and three buns on a plate of the willow pattern . 
While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an animated conversation in progress within-doors between his great-aunt , the Drusilla of the sign-board , and some other villagers . 
Having seen the school-master depart , they were summing up particulars of the event , and indulging in predictions of his future . 
`` And who 's he ? '' 
asked one , comparatively a stranger , when the boy entered . 
`` Well ye med ask it , Mrs. Williams . 
He 's my great-nephew -- come since you was last this way . '' 
The old inhabitant who answered was a tall , gaunt woman , who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject , and gave a phrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn . 
`` He come from Mellstock , down in South Wessex , about a year ago -- worse luck for ` n , Belinda '' -LRB- turning to the right -RRB- `` where his father was living , and was took wi ' the shakings for death , and died in two days , as you know , Caroline '' -LRB- turning to the left -RRB- . 
`` It would ha ' been a blessing if Goddy-mighty had took thee too , wi ' thy mother and father , poor useless boy ! 
But I 've got him here to stay with me till I can see what 's to be done with un , though I am obliged to let him earn any penny he can . 
Just now he 's a-scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham . 
It keeps him out of mischty . 
Why do ye turn away , Jude ? '' 
she continued , as the boy , feeling the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face , moved aside . 
The local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of Miss or Mrs. Fawley 's -LRB- as they called her indifferently -RRB- to have him with her -- `` to kip ` ee company in your loneliness , fetch water , shet the winder-shetters o ' nights , and help in the bit o ' baking . '' 
Miss Fawley doubted it ... `` Why did n't ye get the schoolmaster to take ` ee to Christminster wi ' un , and make a scholar of ` ee , '' she continued , in frowning pleasantry . 
`` I 'm sure he could n't ha ' took a better one . 
The boy is crazy for books , that he is . 
It runs in our family rather . 
His cousin Sue is just the same -- so I 've heard ; but I have not seen the child for years , though she was born in this place , within these four walls , as it happened . 
My niece and her husband , after they were married , didn ' get a house of their own for some year or more ; and then they only had one till -- Well , I wo n't go into that . 
Jude , my child , do n't you ever marry . 
'T is n't for the Fawleys to take that step any more . 
She , their only one , was like a child o ' my own , Belinda , till the split come ! 
Ah , that a little maid should know such changes ! '' 
Jude , finding the general attention again centering on himself , went out to the bakehouse , where he ate the cake provided for his breakfast . 
The end of his spare time had now arrived , and emerging from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a path northward , till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the general level of the upland , which was sown as a corn-field . 
This vast concave was the scene of his labours for Mr Troutham the farmer , and he descended into the midst of it . 
The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all round , where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the actual verge and accentuated the solitude . 
The only marks on the uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year 's produce standing in the midst of the arable , the rooks that rose at his approach , and the path athwart the fallow by which he had come , trodden now by he hardly knew whom , though once by many of his own dead family . 
`` How ugly it is here ! '' 
he murmured . 
The fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a piece of new corduroy , lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse , taking away its gradations , and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months , though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spare -- echoes of songs from ancient harvest-days , of spoken words , and of sturdy deeds . 
Every inch of ground had been the site , first or last , of energy , gaiety , horse-play , bickerings , weariness . 
Groups of gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard . 
Love-matches that had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there between reaping and carrying . 
Under the hedge which divided the field from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers who would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest ; and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love-promises to a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed-time after fulfilling them in the church adjoining . 
But this neither Jude nor the rooks around him considered . 
For them it was a lonely place , possessing , in the one view , only the quality of a work-ground , and in the other that of a granary good to feed in . 
The boy stood under the rick before mentioned , and every few seconds used his clacker or rattle briskly . 
At each clack the rooks left off pecking , and rose and went away on their leisurely wings , burnished like tassets of mail , afterwards wheeling back and regarding him warily , and descending to feed at a more respectful distance . 
He sounded the clacker till his arm ached , and at length his heart grew sympathetic with the birds ' thwarted desires . 
They seemed , like himself , to be living in a world which did not want them . 
Why should he frighten them away ? 
They took upon more and more the aspect of gentle friends and pensioners -- the only friends he could claim as being in the least degree interested in him , for his aunt had often told him that she was not . 
He ceased his rattling , and they alighted anew . 
`` Poor little dears ! '' 
said Jude , aloud . 
`` You SHALL have some dinner -- you shall . 
There is enough for us all . 
Farmer Troutham can afford to let you have some . 
Eat , then my dear little birdies , and make a good meal ! '' 
They stayed and ate , inky spots on the nut-brown soil , and Jude enjoyed their appetite . 
A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his own life with theirs . 
Puny and sorry as those lives were , they much resembled his own . 
His clacker he had by this time thrown away from him , as being a mean and sordid instrument , offensive both to the birds and to himself as their friend . 
All at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his buttocks , followed by a loud clack , which announced to his surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used . 
The birds and Jude started up simultaneously , and the dazed eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person , the great Troutham himself , his red face glaring down upon Jude 's cowering frame , the clacker swinging in his hand . 
`` So it 's ` Eat my dear birdies , ' is it , young man ? 
` Eat , dear birdies , ' indeed ! 
I 'll tickle your breeches , and see if you say , ` Eat , dear birdies , ' again in a hurry ! 
And you 've been idling at the schoolmaster 's too , instead of coming here , ha 'n' t ye , hey ? 
That 's how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn ! '' 
Whilst saluting Jude 's ears with this impassioned rhetoric , Troutham had seized his left hand with his own left , and swinging his slim frame round him at arm 's - length , again struck Jude on the hind parts with the flat side of Jude 's own rattle , till the field echoed with the blows , which were delivered once or twice at each revolution . 
`` Do n't ` ee , sir -- please do n't ` ee ! '' 
cried the whirling child , as helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish swinging to land , and beholding the hill , the rick , the plantation , the path , and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race . 
`` I -- I sir -- only meant that -- there was a good crop in the ground -- I saw 'em sow it -- and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner -- and you would n't miss it , sir -- and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to 'em -- oh , oh , oh ! '' 
This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all , and he still smacked the whirling urchin , the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant workers -- who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduity -- and echoing from the brand-new church tower just behind the mist , towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed , to testify his love for God and man . 
Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task , and depositing the quivering boy on his legs , took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it him in payment for his day 's work , telling him to go home and never let him see him in one of those fields again . 
Jude leaped out of arm 's reach , and walked along the trackway weeping -- not from the pain , though that was keen enough ; not from the perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme , by which what was good for God 's birds was bad for God 's gardener ; but with the awful sense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish , and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for life . 
With this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the village , and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge and across a pasture . 
Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground , as they always did in such weather at that time of the year . 
It was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread . 
Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him , he was a boy who could not himself bear to hurt anything . 
He had never brought home a nest of young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after , and often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next morning . 
He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped , from a fancy that it hurt them ; and late pruning , when the sap was up and the tree bled profusely , had been a positive grief to him in his infancy . 
This weakness of character , as it may be called , suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with him again . 
He carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms , without killing a single one . 
On entering the cottage he found his aunt selling a penny loaf to a little girl , and when the customer was gone she said , `` Well , how do you come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this ? '' 
`` I 'm turned away . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Mr. Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few peckings of corn . 
And there 's my wages -- the last I shall ever hae ! '' 
He threw the sixpence tragically on the table . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said his aunt , suspending her breath . 
And she opened upon him a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands doing nothing . 
`` If you ca n't skeer birds , what can ye do ? 
There ! 
do n't ye look so deedy ! 
Farmer Troutham is not so much better than myself , come to that . 
But 't is as Job said , ` Now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock . ' 
His father was my father 's journeyman , anyhow , and I must have been a fool to let ` ee go to work for ` n , which I should n't ha ' done but to keep ` ee out of mischty . '' 
More angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for dereliction of duty , she rated him primarily from that point of view , and only secondarily from a moral one . 
`` Not that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham planted . 
Of course you was wrong in that . 
Jude , Jude , why didst n't go off with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere ? 
But , oh no -- poor or ` nary child -- there never was any sprawl on thy side of the family , and never will be ! '' 
`` Where is this beautiful city , Aunt -- this place where Mr. Phillotson is gone to ? '' 
asked the boy , after meditating in silence . 
`` Lord ! 
you ought to know where the city of Christminster is . 
Near a score of miles from here . 
It is a place much too good for you ever to have much to do with , poor boy , I 'm a-thinking . '' 
`` And will Mr. Phillotson always be there ? '' 
`` How can I tell ? '' 
`` Could I go to see him ? '' 
`` Lord , no ! 
You did n't grow up hereabout , or you would n't ask such as that . 
We 've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster , nor folk in Christminster with we . '' 
Jude went out , and , feeling more than ever his existence to be an undemanded one , he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near the pig-sty . 
The fog had by this time become more translucent , and the position of the sun could be seen through it . 
He pulled his straw hat over his face , and peered through the interstices of the plaiting at the white brightness , vaguely reflecting . 
Growing up brought responsibilities , he found . 
Events did not rhyme quite as he had thought . 
Nature 's logic was too horrid for him to care for . 
That mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another sickened his sense of harmony . 
As you got older , and felt yourself to be at the centre of your time , and not at a point in its circumference , as you had felt when you were little , you were seized with a sort of shuddering , he perceived . 
All around you there seemed to be something glaring , garish , rattling , and the noises and glares hit upon the little cell called your life , and shook it , and warped it . 
If he could only prevent himself growing up ! 
He did not want to be a man . 
Then , like the natural boy , he forgot his despondency , and sprang up . 
During the remainder of the morning he helped his aunt , and in the afternoon , when there was nothing more to be done , he went into the village . 
Here he asked a man whereabouts Christminster lay . 
`` Christminster ? 
Oh , well , out by there yonder ; though I 've never bin there -- not I. I 've never had any business at such a place . '' 
The man pointed north-eastward , in the very direction where lay that field in which Jude had so disgraced himself . 
There was something unpleasant about the coincidence for the moment , but the fearsomeness of this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city . 
The farmer had said he was never to be seen in that field again ; yet Christminster lay across it , and the path was a public one . 
So , stealing out of the hamlet , he descended into the same hollow which had witnessed his punishment in the morning , never swerving an inch from the path , and climbing up the long and tedious ascent on the other side till the track joined the highway by a little clump of trees . 
Here the ploughed land ended , and all before him was bleak open down . 
Not a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway , or on either side of it , and the white road seemed to ascend and diminish till it joined the sky . 
At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green `` ridgeway '' -- the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the district . 
This ancient track ran east and west for many miles , and down almost to within living memory had been used for driving flocks and herds to fairs and markets . 
But it was now neglected and overgrown . 
The boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the nestling hamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a railway station southward , one dark evening some few months earlier , and till now he had had no suspicion that such a wide , flat , low-lying country lay so near at hand , under the very verge of his upland world . 
The whole northern semicircle between east and west , to a distance of forty or fifty miles , spread itself before him ; a bluer , moister atmosphere , evidently , than that he breathed up here . 
Not far from the road stood a weather-beaten old barn of reddish-grey brick and tile . 
It was known as the Brown House by the people of the locality . 
He was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against the eaves ; and the reflection that the higher he got , the further he could see , led Jude to stand and regard it . 
On the slope of the roof two men were repairing the tiling . 
He turned into the ridgeway and drew towards the barn . 
When he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took courage , and ascended the ladder till he stood beside them . 
`` Well , my lad , and what may you want up here ? '' 
`` I wanted to know where the city of Christminster is , if you please . '' 
`` Christminster is out across there , by that clump . 
You can see it -- at least you can on a clear day . 
Ah , no , you ca n't now . '' 
The other tiler , glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of his labour , had also turned to look towards the quarter designated . 
`` You ca n't often see it in weather like this , '' he said . 
`` The time I 've noticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame , and it looks like -- I do n't know what . '' 
`` The heavenly Jerusalem , '' suggested the serious urchin . 
`` Ay -- though I should never ha ' thought of it myself ... . 
But I ca n't see no Christminster to-day . '' 
The boy strained his eyes also ; yet neither could he see the far-off city . 
He descended from the barn , and abandoning Christminster with the versatility of his age he walked along the ridge-track , looking for any natural objects of interest that might lie in the banks thereabout . 
When he repassed the barn to go back to Marygreen he observed that the ladder was still in its place , but that the men had finished their day 's work and gone away . 
It was waning towards evening ; there was still a faint mist , but it had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country and along the river-courses . 
He thought again of Christminster , and wished , since he had come two or three miles from his aunt 's house on purpose , that he could have seen for once this attractive city of which he had been told . 
But even if he waited here it was hardly likely that the air would clear before night . 
Yet he was loth to leave the spot , for the northern expanse became lost to view on retreating towards the village only a few hundred yards . 
He ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men had designated , and perched himself on the highest rung , overlying the tiles . 
He might not be able to come so far as this for many days . 
Perhaps if he prayed , the wish to see Christminster might be forwarded . 
People said that , if you prayed , things sometimes came to you , even though they sometimes did not . 
He had read in a tract that a man who had begun to build a church , and had no money to finish it , knelt down and prayed , and the money came in by the next post . 
Another man tried the same experiment , and the money did not come ; but he found afterwards that the breeches he knelt in were made by a wicked Jew . 
This was not discouraging , and turning on the ladder Jude knelt on the third rung , where , resting against those above it , he prayed that the mist might rise . 
He then seated himself again , and waited . 
In the course of ten or fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the northern horizon , as it had already done elsewhere , and about a quarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds parted , the sun 's position being partially uncovered , and the beams streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud . 
The boy immediately looked back in the old direction . 
Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape , points of light like the topaz gleamed . 
The air increased in transparency with the lapse of minutes , till the topaz points showed themselves to be the vanes , windows , wet roof slates , and other shining spots upon the spires , domes , freestone-work , and varied outlines that were faintly revealed . 
It was Christminster , unquestionably ; either directly seen , or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere . 
The spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their shine , going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles . 
The vague city became veiled in mist . 
Turning to the west , he saw that the sun had disappeared . 
The foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark , and near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras . 
He anxiously descended the ladder , and started homewards at a run , trying not to think of giants , Herne the Hunter , Apollyon lying in wait for Christian , or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his forehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the bewitched ship . 
He knew that he had grown out of belief in these horrors , yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in the cottage windows , even though this was not the home of his birth , and his great-aunt did not care much about him . 
Inside and round about that old woman 's `` shop '' window , with its twenty-four little panes set in lead-work , the glass of some of them oxidized with age , so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles exhibited within , and forming part of a stock which a strong man could have carried , Jude had his outer being for some long tideless time . 
But his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small . 
Through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he was always beholding a gorgeous city -- the fancied place he had likened to the new Jerusalem , though there was perhaps more of the painter 's imagination and less of the diamond merchant 's in his dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer . 
And the city acquired a tangibility , a permanence , a hold on his life , mainly from the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so much reverence was actually living there ; not only so , but living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein . 
In sad wet seasons , though he knew it must rain at Christminster too , he could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there . 
Whenever he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two , which was not often , he would steal off to the Brown House on the hill and strain his eyes persistently ; sometimes to be rewarded by the sight of a dome or spire , at other times by a little smoke , which in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense . 
Then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark , or possibly went a mile or two further , he would see the night lights of the city . 
It would be necessary to come back alone , but even that consideration did not deter him , for he could throw a little manliness into his mood , no doubt . 
The project was duly executed . 
It was not late when he arrived at the place of outlook , only just after dusk , but a black north-east sky , accompanied by a wind from the same quarter , made the occasion dark enough . 
He was rewarded ; but what he saw was not the lamps in rows , as he had half expected . 
No individual light was visible , only a halo or glow-fog over-arching the place against the black heavens behind it , making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so . 
He set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the schoolmaster might be -- he who never communicated with anybody at Marygreen now ; who was as if dead to them here . 
In the glow he seemed to see Phillotson promenading at ease , like one of the forms in Nebuchadnezzar 's furnace . 
He had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour , and the fact now came into his mind . 
He parted his lips as he faced the north-east , and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor . 
`` You , '' he said , addressing the breeze caressingly `` were in Christminster city between one and two hours ago , floating along the streets , pulling round the weather-cocks , touching Mr. Phillotson 's face , being breathed by him ; and now you are here , breathed by me -- you , the very same . '' 
Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him -- a message from the place -- from some soul residing there , it seemed . 
Surely it was the sound of bells , the voice of the city , faint and musical , calling to him , `` We are happy here ! '' 
He had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental leap , and only got back to it by a rough recalling . 
A few yards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its appearance , having reached the place by dint of half an hour 's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity . 
They had a load of coals behind them -- a fuel that could only be got into the upland by this particular route . 
They were accompanied by a carter , a second man , and a boy , who now kicked a large stone behind one of the wheels , and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest , while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink round . 
They were elderly men , and had genial voices . 
Jude addressed them , inquiring if they had come from Christminster . 
`` Heaven forbid , with this load ! '' 
said they . 
`` The place I mean is that one yonder . '' 
He was getting so romantically attached to Christminster that , like a young lover alluding to his mistress , he felt bashful at mentioning its name again . 
He pointed to the light in the sky -- hardly perceptible to their older eyes . 
`` Yes . 
There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor ' - east than elsewhere , though I should n't ha ' noticed it myself , and no doubt it med be Christminster . '' 
Here a little book of tales which Jude had tucked up under his arm , having brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark , slipped and fell into the road . 
The carter eyed him while he picked it up and straightened the leaves . 
`` Ah , young man , '' he observed , `` you 'd have to get your head screwed on t ` other way before you could read what they read there . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked the boy . 
`` Oh , they never look at anything that folks like we can understand , '' the carter continued , by way of passing the time . 
`` On ' y foreign tongues used in the days of the Tower of Babel , when no two families spoke alike . 
They read that sort of thing as fast as a night-hawk will whir . 
'T is all learning there -- nothing but learning , except religion . 
And that 's learning too , for I never could understand it . 
Yes , 't is a serious-minded place . 
Not but there 's wenches in the streets o ' nights ... You know , I suppose , that they raise pa ` sons there like radishes in a bed ? 
And though it do take -- how many years , Bob ? 
-- five years to turn a lirruping hobble-de-hoy chap into a solemn preaching man with no corrupt passions , they 'll do it , if it can be done , and polish un off like the workmen they be , and turn un out wi ' a long face , and a long black coat and waistcoat , and a religious collar and hat , same as they used to wear in the Scriptures , so that his own mother would n't know un sometimes ... . 
There , 't is their business , like anybody else 's . '' 
`` But how should you know '' `` Now do n't you interrupt , my boy . 
Never interrupt your senyers . 
Move the fore hoss aside , Bobby ; here 's som ` at coming ... You must mind that I be a-talking of the college life . 
'Em lives on a lofty level ; there 's no gainsaying it , though I myself med not think much of 'em . 
As we be here in our bodies on this high ground , so be they in their minds -- noble-minded men enough , no doubt -- some on 'em -- able to earn hundreds by thinking out loud . 
And some on 'em be strong young fellows that can earn a ` most as much in silver cups . 
As for music , there 's beautiful music everywhere in Christminster . 
You med be religious , or you med not , but you ca n't help striking in your homely note with the rest . 
And there 's a street in the place -- the main street -- that ha 'n' t another like it in the world . 
I should think I did know a little about Christminster ! '' 
By this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars again . 
Jude , throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo , turned and walked beside his remarkably well-informed friend , who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city -- its towers and halls and churches . 
The waggon turned into a cross-road , whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his information , and said he only wished he could talk half as well about Christminster as he . 
`` Well , 't is oonly what has come in my way , '' said the carter unboastfully . 
`` I 've never been there , no more than you ; but I 've picked up the knowledge here and there , and you be welcome to it . 
A-getting about the world as I do , and mixing with all classes of society , one ca n't help hearing of things . 
A friend o ' mine , that used to clane the boots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster when he was in his prime , why , I knowed un as well as my own brother in his later years . '' 
Jude continued his walk homeward alone , pondering so deeply that he forgot to feel timid . 
He suddenly grew older . 
It had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on , to cling to -- for some place which he could call admirable . 
Should he find that place in this city if he could get there ? 
Would it be a spot in which , without fear of farmers , or hindrance , or ridicule , he could watch and wait , and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had heard ? 
As the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier , so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark way . 
`` It is a city of light , '' he said to himself . 
`` The tree of knowledge grows there , '' he added a few steps further on . 
`` It is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to . '' 
`` It is what you may call a castle , manned by scholarship and religion . '' 
After this figure he was silent a long while , till he added : `` It would just suit me . '' 
Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration , the boy -- an ancient man in some phases of thought , much younger than his years in others -- was overtaken by a light-footed pedestrian , whom , notwithstanding the gloom , he could perceive to be wearing an extraordinarily tall hat , a swallow-tailed coat , and a watch-chain that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky-light as its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots . 
Jude , beginning to feel lonely , endeavoured to keep up with him . 
`` Well , my man ! 
I 'm in a hurry , so you 'll have to walk pretty fast if you keep alongside of me . 
Do you know who I am ? '' 
`` Yes , I think . 
Physician Vilbert ? '' 
`` Ah -- I 'm known everywhere , I see ! 
That comes of being a public benefactor . '' 
Vilbert was an itinerant quack-doctor , well known to the rustic population , and absolutely unknown to anybody else , as he , indeed , took care to be , to avoid inconvenient investigations . 
Cottagers formed his only patients , and his Wessex-wide repute was among them alone . 
His position was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of advertising . 
He was , in fact , a survival . 
The distances he traversed on foot were enormous , and extended nearly the whole length and breadth of Wessex . 
Jude had one day seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg , the woman arranging to pay a guinea , in instalments of a shilling a fortnight , for the precious salve , which , according to the physician , could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on Mount Sinai , and was to be captured only at great risk to life and limb . 
Jude , though he already had his doubts about this gentleman 's medicines , felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage , and one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not strictly professional . 
`` I s ` pose you 've been to Christminster , Physician ? '' 
`` I have -- many times , '' replied the long thin man . 
`` That 's one of my centres . '' 
`` It 's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion ? '' 
`` You 'd say so , my boy , if you 'd seen it . 
Why , the very sons of the old women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in Latin -- not good Latin , that I admit , as a critic : dog-Latin -- cat-Latin , as we used to call it in my undergraduate days . '' 
`` And Greek ? '' 
`` Well -- that 's more for the men who are in training for bishops , that they may be able to read the New Testament in the original . '' 
`` I want to learn Latin and Greek myself . '' 
`` A lofty desire . 
You must get a grammar of each tongue . '' 
`` I mean to go to Christminster some day . '' 
`` Whenever you do , you say that Physician Vilbert is the only proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all disorders of the alimentary system , as well as asthma and shortness of breath . 
Two and threepence a box -- specially licensed by the government stamp . '' 
`` Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout ? '' 
`` I 'll sell you mine with pleasure -- those I used as a student . '' 
`` Oh , thank you , sir ! '' 
said Jude gratefully , but in gasps , for the amazing speed of the physician 's walk kept him in a dog-trot which was giving him a stitch in the side . 
`` I think you 'd better drop behind , my young man . 
Now I 'll tell you what I 'll do . 
I 'll get you the grammars , and give you a first lesson , if you 'll remember , at every house in the village , to recommend Physician Vilbert 's golden ointment , life-drops , and female pills . '' 
`` Where will you be with the grammars ? '' 
`` I shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of five-and-twenty minutes past seven . 
My movements are as truly timed as those of the planets in their courses . '' 
`` Here I 'll be to meet you , '' said Jude . 
`` With orders for my medicines ? '' 
`` Yes , Physician . '' 
Jude then dropped behind , waited a few minutes to recover breath , and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for Christminster . 
Through the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at his inward thoughts , as if they were people meeting and nodding to him -- smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea , as if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures , giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then . 
He honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures , in whom he now sincerely believed , walking miles hither and thither among the surrounding hamlets as the Physician 's agent in advance . 
On the evening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau , at the place where he had parted from Vilbert , and there awaited his approach . 
The road-physician was fairly up to time ; but , to the surprise of Jude on striking into his pace , which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of force , the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion , though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light . 
Jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat , and he saluted the physician with dignity . 
`` Well , my boy ? '' 
said the latter abstractedly . 
`` I 've come , '' said Jude . 
`` You ? 
who are you ? 
Oh yes -- to be sure ! 
Got any orders , lad ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who were willing to test the virtues of the world-renowned pills and salve . 
The quack mentally registered these with great care . 
`` And the Latin and Greek grammars ? '' 
Jude 's voice trembled with anxiety . 
`` What about them ? '' 
`` You were to bring me yours , that you used before you took your degree . '' 
`` Ah , yes , yes ! 
Forgot all about it -- all ! 
So many lives depending on my attention , you see , my man , that I ca n't give so much thought as I would like to other things . '' 
Jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth ; and he repeated , in a voice of dry misery , `` You have n't brought 'em ! '' 
`` No . 
But you must get me some more orders from sick people , and I 'll bring the grammars next time . '' 
Jude dropped behind . 
He was an unsophisticated boy , but the gift of sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of . 
There was to be no intellectual light from this source . 
The leaves dropped from his imaginary crown of laurel ; he turned to a gate , leant against it , and cried bitterly . 
The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness . 
He might , perhaps , have obtained grammars from Alfredston , but to do that required money , and a knowledge of what books to order ; and though physically comfortable , he was in such absolute dependence as to be without a farthing of his own . 
At this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte , and it gave Jude a lead . 
Why should he not write to the schoolmaster , and ask him to be so kind as to get him the grammars in Christminster ? 
He might slip a letter inside the case of the instrument , and it would be sure to reach the desired eyes . 
Why not ask him to send any old second-hand copies , which would have the charm of being mellowed by the university atmosphere ? 
To tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it . 
It was necessary to act alone . 
After a further consideration of a few days he did act , and on the day of the piano 's departure , which happened to be his next birthday , clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing-case , directed to his much-admired friend , being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt Drusilla , lest she should discover his motive , and compel him to abandon his scheme . 
The piano was despatched , and Jude waited days and weeks , calling every morning at the cottage post office before his great-aunt was stirring .
