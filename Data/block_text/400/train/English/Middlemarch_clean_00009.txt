Miss Noble said , `` Oh poor things ! 
poor things ! '' 
in reference , probably , to the double loss of preaching and coal . 
But the Vicar answered quietly -- `` That is because they are not my parishioners . 
And I do n't think my sermons are worth a load of coals to them . '' 
`` Mr. Lydgate , '' said Mrs. Farebrother , who could not let this pass , `` you do n't know my son : he always undervalues himself . 
I tell him he is undervaluing the God who made him , and made him a most excellent preacher . '' 
`` That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study , mother , '' said the Vicar , laughing . 
`` I promised to show you my collection , '' he added , turning to Lydgate ; `` shall we go ? '' 
All three ladies remonstrated . 
Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea : Miss Winifred had abundance of good tea in the pot . 
Why was Camden in such haste to take a visitor to his den ? 
There was nothing but pickled vermin , and drawers full of blue-bottles and moths , with no carpet on the floor . 
Mr. Lydgate must excuse it . 
A game at cribbage would be far better . 
In short , it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as the king of men and preachers , and yet be held by them to stand in much need of their direction . 
Lydgate , with the usual shallowness of a young bachelor , wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better . 
`` My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest in my hobbies , '' said the Vicar , as he opened the door of his study , which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had implied , unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be excepted . 
`` Men of your profession do n't generally smoke , '' he said . 
Lydgate smiled and shook his head . 
`` Nor of mine either , properly , I suppose . 
You will hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company . 
They do n't know how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up . '' 
`` I understand . 
You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative . 
I am heavier , and should get idle with it . 
I should rush into idleness , and stagnate there with all my might . '' 
`` And you mean to give it all to your work . 
I am some ten or twelve years older than you , and have come to a compromise . 
I feed a weakness or two lest they should get clamorous . 
See , '' continued the Vicar , opening several small drawers , `` I fancy I have made an exhaustive study of the entomology of this district . 
I am going on both with the fauna and flora ; but I have at least done my insects well . 
We are singularly rich in orthoptera : I do n't know whether -- Ah ! 
you have got hold of that glass jar -- you are looking into that instead of my drawers . 
You do n't really care about these things ? '' 
`` Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster . 
I have never had time to give myself much to natural history . 
I was early bitten with an interest in structure , and it is what lies most directly in my profession . 
I have no hobby besides . 
I have the sea to swim in there . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are a happy fellow , '' said Mr. Farebrother , turning on his heel and beginning to fill his pipe . 
`` You do n't know what it is to want spiritual tobacco -- bad emendations of old texts , or small items about a variety of Aphis Brassicae , with the well-known signature of Philomicron , for the ` Twaddler 's Magazine ; ' or a learned treatise on the entomology of the Pentateuch , including all the insects not mentioned , but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage through the desert ; with a monograph on the Ant , as treated by Solomon , showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern research . 
You do n't mind my fumigating you ? '' 
Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its implied meaning -- that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right vocation . 
The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves , and the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History , made him think again of the winnings at cards and their destination . 
But he was beginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one . 
The Vicar 's frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others , but simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible . 
Apparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might seem premature , for he presently said -- `` I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you , Mr. Lydgate , and know you better than you know me . 
You remember Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time ? 
I was a correspondent of his , and he told me a good deal about you . 
I was not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man . 
I was very glad when I found that you were . 
Only I do n't forget that you have not had the like prologue about me . '' 
Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here , but did not half understand it . 
`` By the way , '' he said , `` what has become of Trawley ? 
I have quite lost sight of him . 
He was hot on the French social systems , and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean community . 
Is he gone ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
He is practising at a German bath , and has married a rich patient . '' 
`` Then my notions wear the best , so far , '' said Lydgate , with a short scornful laugh . 
`` He would have it , the medical profession was an inevitable system of humbug . 
I said , the fault was in the men -- men who truckle to lies and folly . 
Instead of preaching against humbug outside the walls , it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus within . 
In short -- I am reporting my own conversation -- you may be sure I had all the good sense on my side . '' 
`` Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the Pythagorean community , though . 
You have not only got the old Adam in yourself against you , but you have got all those descendants of the original Adam who form the society around you . 
You see , I have paid twelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of difficulties . 
But '' -- Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment , and then added , `` you are eying that glass vase again . 
Do you want to make an exchange ? 
You shall not have it without a fair barter . '' 
`` I have some sea-mice -- fine specimens -- in spirits . 
And I will throw in Robert Brown 's new thing -- ` Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of Plants ' -- if you do n't happen to have it already . '' 
`` Why , seeing how you long for the monster , I might ask a higher price . 
Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about all my new species ? '' 
The Vicar , while he talked in this way , alternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth , and returned to hang rather fondly over his drawers . 
`` That would be good discipline , you know , for a young doctor who has to please his patients in Middlemarch . 
You must learn to be bored , remember . 
However , you shall have the monster on your own terms . '' 
`` Do n't you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody 's nonsense , till they get despised by the very fools they humor ? '' 
said Lydgate , moving to Mr. Farebrother 's side , and looking rather absently at the insects ranged in fine gradation , with names subscribed in exquisite writing . 
`` The shortest way is to make your value felt , so that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not . '' 
`` With all my heart . 
But then you must be sure of having the value , and you must keep yourself independent . 
Very few men can do that . 
Either you slip out of service altogether , and become good for nothing , or you wear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you . 
But do look at these delicate orthoptera ! '' 
Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer , the Vicar laughing at himself , and yet persisting in the exhibition . 
`` Apropos of what you said about wearing harness , '' Lydgate began , after they had sat down , `` I made up my mind some time ago to do with as little of it as possible . 
That was why I determined not to try anything in London , for a good many years at least . 
I did n't like what I saw when I was studying there -- so much empty bigwiggism , and obstructive trickery . 
In the country , people have less pretension to knowledge , and are less of companions , but for that reason they affect one 's amour-propre less : one makes less bad blood , and can follow one 's own course more quietly . '' 
`` Yes -- well -- you have got a good start ; you are in the right profession , the work you feel yourself most fit for . 
Some people miss that , and repent too late . 
But you must not be too sure of keeping your independence . '' 
`` You mean of family ties ? '' 
said Lydgate , conceiving that these might press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother . 
`` Not altogether . 
Of course they make many things more difficult . 
But a good wife -- a good unworldly woman -- may really help a man , and keep him more independent . 
There 's a parishioner of mine -- a fine fellow , but who would hardly have pulled through as he has done without his wife . 
Do you know the Garths ? 
I think they were not Peacock 's patients . '' 
`` No ; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone 's , at Lowick . '' 
`` Their daughter : an excellent girl . '' 
`` She is very quiet -- I have hardly noticed her . '' 
`` She has taken notice of you , though , depend upon it . '' 
`` I do n't understand , '' said Lydgate ; he could hardly say `` Of course . '' 
`` Oh , she gauges everybody . 
I prepared her for confirmation -- she is a favorite of mine . '' 
Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence , Lydgate not caring to know more about the Garths . 
At last the Vicar laid down his pipe , stretched out his legs , and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards Lydgate , saying -- `` But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be . 
We have our intrigues and our parties . 
I am a party man , for example , and Bulstrode is another . 
If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode . '' 
`` What is there against Bulstrode ? '' 
said Lydgate , emphatically . 
`` I did not say there was anything against him except that . 
If you vote against him you will make him your enemy . '' 
`` I do n't know that I need mind about that , '' said Lydgate , rather proudly ; `` but he seems to have good ideas about hospitals , and he spends large sums on useful public objects . 
He might help me a good deal in carrying out my ideas . 
As to his religious notions -- why , as Voltaire said , incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if administered with a certain quantity of arsenic . 
I look for the man who will bring the arsenic , and do n't mind about his incantations . '' 
`` Very good . 
But then you must not offend your arsenic-man . 
You will not offend me , you know , '' said Mr. Farebrother , quite unaffectedly . 
`` I do n't translate my own convenience into other people 's duties . 
I am opposed to Bulstrode in many ways . 
I do n't like the set he belongs to : they are a narrow ignorant set , and do more to make their neighbors uncomfortable than to make them better . 
Their system is a sort of worldly-spiritual cliqueism : they really look on the rest of mankind as a doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven . 
But , '' he added , smilingly , `` I do n't say that Bulstrode 's new hospital is a bad thing ; and as to his wanting to oust me from the old one -- why , if he thinks me a mischievous fellow , he is only returning a compliment . 
And I am not a model clergyman -- only a decent makeshift . '' 
Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself . 
A model clergyman , like a model doctor , ought to think his own profession the finest in the world , and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his moral pathology and therapeutics . 
He only said , `` What reason does Bulstrode give for superseding you ? '' 
`` That I do n't teach his opinions -- which he calls spiritual religion ; and that I have no time to spare . 
Both statements are true . 
But then I could make time , and I should be glad of the forty pounds . 
That is the plain fact of the case . 
But let us dismiss it . 
I only wanted to tell you that if you vote for your arsenic-man , you are not to cut me in consequence . 
I ca n't spare you . 
You are a sort of circumnavigator come to settle among us , and will keep up my belief in the antipodes . 
Now tell me all about them in Paris . '' 
`` Oh , sir , the loftiest hopes on earth Draw lots with meaner hopes : heroic breasts , Breathing bad air , ran risk of pestilence ; Or , lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line , May languish with the scurvy . '' 
Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate , and without telling himself the reason , he deferred the predetermination on which side he should give his vote . 
It would really have been a matter of total indifference to him -- that is to say , he would have taken the more convenient side , and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without any hesitation -- if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother . 
But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph 's grew with growing acquaintanceship . 
That , entering into Lydgate 's position as a new-comer who had his own professional objects to secure , Mr. Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest , showed an unusual delicacy and generosity , which Lydgate 's nature was keenly alive to . 
It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother which were exceptionally fine , and made his character resemble those southern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and social slovenliness . 
Very few men could have been as filial and chivalrous as he was to the mother , aunt , and sister , whose dependence on him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself ; few men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not to dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of better motives . 
In these matters he was conscious that his life would bear the closest scrutiny ; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a little defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners , and whose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions . 
Then , his preaching was ingenious and pithy , like the preaching of the English Church in its robust age , and his sermons were delivered without book . 
People outside his parish went to hear him ; and , since to fill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman 's function , here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority . 
Besides , he was a likable man : sweet-tempered , ready-witted , frank , without grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors which make half of us an affliction to our friends . 
Lydgate liked him heartily , and wished for his friendship . 
With this feeling uppermost , he continued to waive the question of the chaplaincy , and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper business of his , but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for his vote . 
Lydgate , at Mr. Bulstrode 's request , was laying down plans for the internal arrangements of the new hospital , and the two were often in consultation . 
The banker was always presupposing that he could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor , but made no special recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother . 
When the General Board of the Infirmary had met , however , and Lydgate had notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors and medical men , to meet on the following Friday , he had a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch business . 
He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister , and that the Tyke affair was a question of office or no office ; and he could not help an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office . 
For his observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother 's assurance that the banker would not overlook opposition . 
`` Confound their petty politics ! '' 
was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative process of shaving , when he had begun to feel that he must really hold a court of conscience on this matter . 
Certainly there were valid things to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother : he had too much on his hands already , especially considering how much time he spent on non-clerical occupations . 
Then again it was a continually repeated shock , disturbing Lydgate 's esteem , that the Vicar should obviously play for the sake of money , liking the play indeed , but evidently liking some end which it served . 
Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for the desirability of all games , and said that Englishmen 's wit was stagnant for want of them ; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have played very much less but for the money . 
There was a billiard-room at the Green Dragon , which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch . 
The Vicar was a first-rate billiard-player , and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon , there were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had won money . 
And as to the chaplaincy , he did not pretend that he cared for it , except for the sake of the forty pounds . 
Lydgate was no Puritan , but he did not care for play , and winning money at it had always seemed a meanness to him ; besides , he had an ideal of life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him . 
Hitherto in his own life his wants had been supplied without any trouble to himself , and his first impulse was always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a gentleman ; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting half-crowns . 
He had always known in a general way that he was not rich , but he had never felt poor , and he had no power of imagining the part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men . 
Money had never been a motive to him . 
Hence he was not ready to frame excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains . 
It was altogether repulsive to him , and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between the Vicar 's income and his more or less necessary expenditure . 
It was possible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own case . 
And now , when the question of voting had come , this repulsive fact told more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before . 
One would know much better what to do if men 's characters were more consistent , and especially if one 's friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake ! 
Lydgate was convinced that if there had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother , he would have voted for him , whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject : he did not intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode 's . 
On the other hand , there was Tyke , a man entirely given to his clerical office , who was simply curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter 's parish , and had time for extra duty . 
Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke , except that they could not bear him , and suspected him of cant . 
Really , from his point of view , Bulstrode was thoroughly justified . 
But whichever way Lydgate began to incline , there was something to make him wince ; and being a proud man , he was a little exasperated at being obliged to wince . 
He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by getting on bad terms with Bulstrode ; he did not like voting against Farebrother , and helping to deprive him of function and salary ; and the question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards . 
Moreover , Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself . 
But would the end really be his own convenience ? 
Other people would say so , and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world . 
What then ? 
He for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been concerned , he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker 's friendship or enmity . 
What he really cared for was a medium for his work , a vehicle for his ideas ; and after all , was he not bound to prefer the object of getting a good hospital , where he could demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic results , before anything else connected with this chaplaincy ? 
For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small social conditions , and their frustrating complexity . 
At the end of his inward debate , when he set out for the hospital , his hope was really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to the question , and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for voting . 
I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances -- some feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy , while debate in cool blood had only made it more difficult . 
However it was , he did not distinctly say to himself on which side he would vote ; and all the while he was inwardly resenting the subjection which had been forced upon him . 
It would have seemed beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he , with his unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes , would find himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives , each of which was repugnant to him . 
In his student 's chambers , he had prearranged his social action quite differently . 
Lydgate was late in setting out , but Dr. Sprague , the two other surgeons , and several of the directors had arrived early ; Mr. Bulstrode , treasurer and chairman , being among those who were still absent . 
The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was problematical , and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had been generally supposed . 
The two physicians , for a wonder , turned out to be unanimous , or rather , though of different minds , they concurred in action . 
Dr. Sprague , the rugged and weighty , was , as every one had foreseen , an adherent of Mr. Farebrother . 
The Doctor was more than suspected of having no religion , but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor ; indeed it is probable that his professional weight was the more believed in , the world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas of frilling and sentiment . 
It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted ; conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of judgments connected with drugs . 
At all events , it is certain that if any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having very definite religious views , of being given to prayer , and of otherwise showing an active piety , there would have been a general presumption against his medical skill . 
On this ground it was -LRB- professionally speaking -RRB- fortunate for Dr. Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind , and such as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment , whether of Church or Dissent , rather than any adhesion to particular tenets . 
If Mr. Bulstrode insisted , as he was apt to do , on the Lutheran doctrine of justification , as that by which a Church must stand or fall , Dr. Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a fortuitous conjunction of atoms ; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint , Dr. Minchin for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to fixed limits ; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian Creed , Dr. Minchin quoted Pope 's `` Essay on Man . '' 
He objected to the rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged , preferring well-sanctioned quotations , and liking refinement of all kinds : it was generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop , and sometimes spent his holidays at `` the palace . '' 
Dr. Minchin was soft-handed , pale-complexioned , and of rounded outline , not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance : whereas Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall ; his trousers got creased at the knees , and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed necessary to any dignity of bearing ; you heard him go in and out , and up and down , as if he had come to see after the roofing . 
In short , he had weight , and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw it ; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to circumvent it . 
They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of medical reputation , and concealed with much etiquette their contempt for each other 's skill . 
Regarding themselves as Middlemarch institutions , they were ready to combine against all innovators , and against non-professionals given to interference . 
On this ground they were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode , though Dr. Minchin had never been in open hostility with him , and never differed from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode , who had found that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution . 
A layman who pried into the professional conduct of medical men , and was always obtruding his reforms , -- though he was less directly embarrassing to the two physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by contract , was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as such ; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode , excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate . 
The long-established practitioners , Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller ; were just now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy , in which they agreed that Lydgate was a jackanapes , just made to serve Bulstrode 's purpose . 
To non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other young practitioner , who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock 's retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge . 
It was clear that Lydgate , by not dispensing drugs , intended to cast imputations on his equals , and also to obscure the limit between his own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians , who , in the interest of the profession , felt bound to maintain its various grades , -- especially against a man who had not been to either of the English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside study there , but came with a libellous pretension to experience in Edinburgh and Paris , where observation might be abundant indeed , but hardly sound . 
Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with Lydgate , and Lydgate with Tyke ; and owing to this variety of interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question , diverse minds were enabled to form the same judgment concerning it . 
Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he entered , `` I go for Farebrother . 
A salary , with all my heart . 
But why take it from the Vicar ? 
He has none too much -- has to insure his life , besides keeping house , and doing a vicar 's charities . 
Put forty pounds in his pocket and you 'll do no harm . 
He 's a good fellow , is Farebrother , with as little of the parson about him as will serve to carry orders . '' 
`` Ho , ho ! 
Doctor , '' said old Mr. Powderell , a retired iron-monger of some standing -- his interjection being something between a laugh and a Parliamentary disapproval ; `` we must let you have your say . 
But what we have to consider is not anybody 's income -- it 's the souls of the poor sick people '' -- here Mr. Powderell 's voice and face had a sincere pathos in them . 
`` He is a real Gospel preacher , is Mr. Tyke . 
I should vote against my conscience if I voted against Mr. Tyke -- I should indeed . '' 
`` Mr. Tyke 's opponents have not asked any one to vote against his conscience , I believe , '' said Mr. Hackbutt , a rich tanner of fluent speech , whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell . 
`` But in my judgment it behoves us , as Directors , to consider whether we will regard it as our whole business to carry out propositions emanating from a single quarter . 
Will any member of the committee aver that he would have entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always discharged the function of chaplain here , if it had not been suggested to him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views ? 
I tax no man 's motives : let them lie between himself and a higher Power ; but I do say , that there are influences at work here which are incompatible with genuine independence , and that a crawling servility is usually dictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves could not afford either morally or financially to avow . 
I myself am a layman , but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions in the Church and -- '' `` Oh , damn the divisions ! '' 
burst in Mr. Frank Hawley , lawyer and town-clerk , who rarely presented himself at the board , but now looked in hurriedly , whip in hand . 
`` We have nothing to do with them here . 
Farebrother has been doing the work -- what there was -- without pay , and if pay is to be given , it should be given to him . 
I call it a confounded job to take the thing away from Farebrother . '' 
`` I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a personal bearing , '' said Mr. Plymdale . 
`` I shall vote for the appointment of Mr. Tyke , but I should not have known , if Mr. Hackbutt had n't hinted it , that I was a Servile Crawler . '' 
`` I disclaim any personalities . 
I expressly said , if I may be allowed to repeat , or even to conclude what I was about to say -- '' `` Ah , here 's Minchin ! '' 
said Mr. Frank Hawley ; at which everybody turned away from Mr. Hackbutt , leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior gifts in Middlemarch . 
`` Come , Doctor , I must have you on the right side , eh ? '' 
`` I hope so , '' said Dr. Minchin , nodding and shaking hands here and there ; `` at whatever cost to my feelings . '' 
`` If there 's any feeling here , it should be feeling for the man who is turned out , I think , '' said Mr. Frank Hawley . 
`` I confess I have feelings on the other side also . 
I have a divided esteem , '' said Dr. Minchin , rubbing his hands . 
`` I consider Mr. Tyke an exemplary man -- none more so -- and I believe him to be proposed from unimpeachable motives . 
I , for my part , wish that I could give him my vote . 
But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the preponderance to Mr. Farebrother 's claims . 
He is an amiable man , an able preacher , and has been longer among us . '' 
Old Mr. Powderell looked on , sad and silent . 
Mr. Plymdale settled his cravat , uneasily . 
`` You do n't set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman ought to be , I hope , '' said Mr. Larcher , the eminent carrier , who had just come in . 
`` I have no ill-will towards him , but I think we owe something to the public , not to speak of anything higher , in these appointments . 
In my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman . 
I do n't wish to bring up particulars against him ; but he will make a little attendance here go as far as he can . '' 
`` And a devilish deal better than too much , '' said Mr. Hawley , whose bad language was notorious in that part of the county . 
`` Sick people ca n't bear so much praying and preaching . 
And that methodistical sort of religion is bad for the spirits -- bad for the inside , eh ? '' 
he added , turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled . 
But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen , with whom there were greetings more or less cordial . 
These were the Reverend Edward Thesiger , Rector of St. Peter 's , Mr. Bulstrode , and our friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton , who had lately allowed himself to be put on the board of directors in his turn , but had never before attended , his attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode 's exertions . 
Lydgate was the only person still expected . 
Every one now sat down , Mr. Bulstrode presiding , pale and self-restrained as usual . 
Mr. Thesiger , a moderate evangelical , wished for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke , a zealous able man , who , officiating at a chapel of ease , had not a cure of souls too extensive to leave him ample time for the new duty . 
It was desirable that chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent intention : they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence ; and while it was good that a salary should be allotted , there was the more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted into a mere question of salary . 
Mr. Thesiger 's manner had so much quiet propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence . 
Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter . 
He had not himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary , though he had a strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch , and was most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question -- `` any public question , you know , '' Mr. Brooke repeated , with his nod of perfect understanding . 
`` I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate , and in the collection of documentary evidence , but I regard my time as being at the disposal of the public -- and , in short , my friends have convinced me that a chaplain with a salary -- a salary , you know -- is a very good thing , and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the appointment of Mr. Tyke , who , I understand , is an unexceptionable man , apostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind -- and I am the last man to withhold my vote -- under the circumstances , you know . '' 
`` It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the question , Mr. Brooke , '' said Mr. Frank Hawley , who was afraid of nobody , and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions . 
`` You do n't seem to know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as chaplain here for years without pay , and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to supersede him . '' 
`` Excuse me , Mr. Hawley , '' said Mr. Bulstrode . 
`` Mr. Brooke has been fully informed of Mr. Farebrother 's character and position . '' 
`` By his enemies , '' flashed out Mr. Hawley . 
`` I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here , '' said Mr. Thesiger . 
`` I 'll swear there is , though , '' retorted Mr. Hawley . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said Mr. Bulstrode , in a subdued tone , `` the merits of the question may be very briefly stated , and if any one present doubts that every gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully informed , I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh on either side . '' 
`` I do n't see the good of that , '' said Mr. Hawley . 
`` I suppose we all know whom we mean to vote for . 
Any man who wants to do justice does not wait till the last minute to hear both sides of the question . 
I have no time to lose , and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once . '' 
A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote `` Tyke '' or `` Farebrother '' on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass tumbler ; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter . 
`` I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present , '' said Mr. Bulstrode , in a clear biting voice . 
Then , looking up at Lydgate -- `` There is a casting-vote still to be given . 
It is yours , Mr. Lydgate : will you be good enough to write ? '' 
`` The thing is settled now , '' said Mr. Wrench , rising . 
`` We all know how Mr. Lydgate will vote . '' 
`` You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning , sir , '' said Lydgate , rather defiantly , and keeping his pencil suspended . 
`` I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode . 
Do you regard that meaning as offensive ? '' 
`` It may be offensive to others . 
But I shall not desist from voting with him on that account . '' 
Lydgate immediately wrote down `` Tyke . '' 
So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary , and Lydgate continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode . 
He was really uncertain whether Tyke were not the more suitable candidate , and yet his consciousness told him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should have voted for Mr. Farebrother . 
The affair of the chaplaincy remained a sore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him . 
How could a man be satisfied with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances ? 
No more than he can be satisfied with his hat , which he has chosen from among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him , wearing it at best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison . 
But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before . 
The character of the publican and sinner is not always practically incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee , for the majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments , or the dulness of our own jokes . 
But the Vicar of St. Botolph 's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture of the Pharisee , and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too much as other men were , he had become remarkably unlike them in this -- that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him , and could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him . 
`` The world has been too strong for me , I know , '' he said one day to Lydgate . 
`` But then I am not a mighty man -- I shall never be a man of renown . 
The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable ; but Prodicus makes it easy work for the hero , as if the first resolves were enough . 
Another story says that he came to hold the distaff , and at last wore the Nessus shirt . 
I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if everybody else 's resolve helped him . '' 
The Vicar 's talk was not always inspiriting : he had escaped being a Pharisee , but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure . 
Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr. Farebrother .

-- Purgatorio , vii . 
When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of Windsor , when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister , and Mr. Vincy was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch , Mrs. Casaubon , born Dorothea Brooke , had taken her wedding journey to Rome . 
In those days the world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years than it is at present . 
Travellers did not often carry full information on Christian art either in their heads or their pockets ; and even the most brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed tomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter 's fancy . 
Romanticism , which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love and knowledge , had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and entered into everybody 's food ; it was fermenting still as a distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German artists at Rome , and the youth of other nations who worked or idled near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement . 
One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long , but abundant and curly , and who was otherwise English in his equipment , had just turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was looking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining round vestibule . 
He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the approach of a dark-eyed , animated German who came up to him and placing a hand on his shoulder , said with a strong accent , `` Come here , quick ! 
else she will have changed her pose . '' 
Quickness was ready at the call , and the two figures passed lightly along by the Meleager , towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne , then called the Cleopatra , lies in the marble voluptuousness of her beauty , the drapery folding around her with a petal-like ease and tenderness . 
They were just in time to see another figure standing against a pedestal near the reclining marble : a breathing blooming girl , whose form , not shamed by the Ariadne , was clad in Quakerish gray drapery ; her long cloak , fastened at the neck , was thrown backward from her arms , and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek , pushing somewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to her face around the simply braided dark-brown hair . 
She was not looking at the sculpture , probably not thinking of it : her large eyes were fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor . 
But she became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused as if to contemplate the Cleopatra , and , without looking at them , immediately turned away to join a maid-servant and courier who were loitering along the hall at a little distance off . 
`` What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis ? '' 
said the German , searching in his friend 's face for responding admiration , but going on volubly without waiting for any other answer . 
`` There lies antique beauty , not corpse-like even in death , but arrested in the complete contentment of its sensuous perfection : and here stands beauty in its breathing life , with the consciousness of Christian centuries in its bosom . 
But she should be dressed as a nun ; I think she looks almost what you call a Quaker ; I would dress her as a nun in my picture . 
However , she is married ; I saw her wedding-ring on that wonderful left hand , otherwise I should have thought the sallow Geistlicher was her father . 
I saw him parting from her a good while ago , and just now I found her in that magnificent pose . 
Only think ! 
he is perhaps rich , and would like to have her portrait taken . 
Ah ! 
it is no use looking after her -- there she goes ! 
Let us follow her home ! '' 
`` No , no , '' said his companion , with a little frown . 
`` You are singular , Ladislaw . 
You look struck together . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` I know that she is married to my cousin , '' said Will Ladislaw , sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air , while his German friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly . 
`` What ! 
the Geistlicher ? 
He looks more like an uncle -- a more useful sort of relation . '' 
`` He is not my uncle . 
I tell you he is my second cousin , '' said Ladislaw , with some irritation . 
`` Schon , schon . 
Do n't be snappish . 
You are not angry with me for thinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw ? '' 
`` Angry ? 
nonsense . 
I have only seen her once before , for a couple of minutes , when my cousin introduced her to me , just before I left England . 
They were not married then . 
I did n't know they were coming to Rome . '' 
`` But you will go to see them now -- you will find out what they have for an address -- since you know the name . 
Shall we go to the post ? 
And you could speak about the portrait . '' 
`` Confound you , Naumann ! 
I do n't know what I shall do . 
I am not so brazen as you . '' 
`` Bah ! 
that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish . 
If you were an artist , you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form animated by Christian sentiment -- a sort of Christian Antigone -- sensuous force controlled by spiritual passion . '' 
`` Yes , and that your painting her was the chief outcome of her existence -- the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but exhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas . 
I am amateurish if you like : I do not think that all the universe is straining towards the obscure significance of your pictures . '' 
`` But it is , my dear ! 
-- so far as it is straining through me , Adolf Naumann : that stands firm , '' said the good-natured painter , putting a hand on Ladislaw 's shoulder , and not in the least disturbed by the unaccountable touch of ill-humor in his tone . 
`` See now ! 
My existence presupposes the existence of the whole universe -- does it not ? 
and my function is to paint -- and as a painter I have a conception which is altogether genialisch , of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a subject for a picture ; therefore , the universe is straining towards that picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth in the shape of me -- not true ? '' 
`` But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart it ? 
-- the case is a little less simple then . '' 
`` Not at all : the result of the struggle is the same thing -- picture or no picture -- logically . '' 
Will could not resist this imperturbable temper , and the cloud in his face broke into sunshiny laughter . 
`` Come now , my friend -- you will help ? '' 
said Naumann , in a hopeful tone . 
`` No ; nonsense , Naumann ! 
English ladies are not at everybody 's service as models . 
And you want to express too much with your painting . 
You would only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against . 
And what is a portrait of a woman ? 
Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff after all . 
They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them . 
Language is a finer medium . '' 
`` Yes , for those who ca n't paint , '' said Naumann . 
`` There you have perfect right . 
I did not recommend you to paint , my friend . '' 
The amiable artist carried his sting , but Ladislaw did not choose to appear stung . 
He went on as if he had not heard . 
`` Language gives a fuller image , which is all the better for beings vague . 
After all , the true seeing is within ; and painting stares at you with an insistent imperfection . 
I feel that especially about representations of women . 
As if a woman were a mere colored superficies ! 
You must wait for movement and tone . 
There is a difference in their very breathing : they change from moment to moment . 
-- This woman whom you have just seen , for example : how would you paint her voice , pray ? 
But her voice is much diviner than anything you have seen of her . '' 
`` I see , I see . 
You are jealous . 
No man must presume to think that he can paint your ideal . 
This is serious , my friend !
