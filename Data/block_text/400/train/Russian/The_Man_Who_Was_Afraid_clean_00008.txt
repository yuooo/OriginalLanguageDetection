`` I believe you ; that is , I believe everything you may say ; only this is not true ! '' 
said Foma , feelingly , in a low voice . 
`` What is not true ? 
What do you believe me ? '' 
`` No ! 
not this , but that . 
I -- excuse me ! 
I can not speak ! '' 
said Foma , sadly , all aflush with confusion . 
`` I am not cultured . '' 
`` You need not trouble yourself on this account , '' said Medinskaya , patronisingly . 
`` You are so young , and education is accessible to everybody . 
But there are people to whom education is not only unnecessary , but who can also be harmed by it . 
Those that are pure of heart , sanguine , sincere , like children , and you are of those people . 
You are , are you not ? '' 
What could Foma say in answer to this question ? 
He said sincerely : `` I thank you humbly ! '' 
And noticing that his words called forth a gay gleam in Medinskaya 's eyes , Foma appeared ridiculous and stupid in his own eyes ; he immediately became angry at himself and said in a muffled voice : `` Yes , I am such . 
I always speak my mind . 
I can not deceive . 
If I see something to laugh at , I laugh openly . 
I am stupid ! '' 
`` What makes you speak that way ? '' 
said the woman , reproachfully , and adjusting her dress , she accidentally stroked Foma 's hand , in which he held his hat . 
This made him look at his wrist and smile joyously and confusedly . 
`` You will surely be present at the dinner , wo n't you ? '' 
asked Medinskaya . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And tomorrow at the meeting in my house ? '' 
`` Without fail ! '' 
`` And perhaps sometime you will drop in , simply on a visit , would n't you ? '' 
`` I -- I thank you ! 
I 'll come ! '' 
`` I must thank you for the promise . '' 
They became silent . 
In the air soared the reverently soft voice of the bishop , who recited the prayer expressively , outstretching his hand over the place where the corner-stone of the house was laid : `` May neither the wind , nor water , nor anything else bring harm unto it ; may it be completed in thy benevolence , and free all those that are to live in it from all kinds of calumny . '' 
`` How rich and beautiful our prayers are , are they not ? '' 
asked Medinskaya . 
`` Yes , '' said Foma , shortly , without understanding her words and feeling that he was blushing again . 
`` They will always be opponents of our commercial interests , '' Mayakin whispered loudly and convincingly , standing beside the city mayor , not far from Foma . 
`` What is it to them ? 
All they want is somehow to deserve the approval of the newspaper . 
But they can not reach the main point . 
They live for mere display , not for the organisation of life ; these are their only measures : the newspapers and Sweden ! 
-LSB- Mayakin speaks of Sweden , meaning Switzerland . 
-- Translator 's note . -RSB- 
The doctor scoffed at me all day yesterday with this Sweden . 
The public education , says he , in Sweden , and everything else there is first-class ! 
But what is Sweden , anyway ? 
It may be that Sweden is but a fib , is but used as an example , and that there is no education whatever or any of the other things there . 
And then , we do n't live for the sake of Sweden , and Sweden can not put us to test . 
We have to make our lip according to our own last . 
Is n't it so ? '' 
And the archdeacon droned , his head thrown back : `` Eternal me-emo-ory to the founder of this ho-ouse ! '' 
Foma shuddered , but Mayakin was already by his side , and pulling him by the sleeve , asked : `` Are you going to the dinner ? '' 
And Medinskaya 's velvet-like , warm little hand glided once more over Foma 's hand . 
The dinner was to Foma a real torture . 
For the first time in his life among these uniformed people , he saw that they were eating and speaking -- doing everything better than he , and he felt that between him and Medinskaya , who was seated just opposite him , was a high mountain , not a table . 
Beside him sat the secretary of the society of which Foma had been made an honorary member ; he was a young court officer , bearing the odd name of Ookhtishchev . 
As if to make his name appear more absurd than it really was , he spoke in a loud , ringing tenor , and altogether -- plump , short , round-faced and a lively talker -- he looked like a brand new bell . 
`` The very best thing in our society is the patroness ; the most reasonable is what we are doing -- courting the patroness ; the most difficult is to tell the patroness such a compliment as would satisfy her ; and the most sensible thing is to admire the patroness silently and hopelessly . 
So that in reality , you are a member not of ` the Society of Solicitude , ' and so on , but of the Society of Tantaluses , which is composed of persons bent on pleasing Sophya Medinskaya . '' 
Foma listened to his chatter , now and then looking at the patroness , who was absorbed in a conversation with the chief of the police ; Foma roared in reply to his interlocutor , pretending to be busy eating , and he wished that all this would end the sooner . 
He felt that he was wretched , stupid , ridiculous and he was certain that everybody was watching and censuring him . 
This tied him with invisible shackles , thus checking his words and his thoughts . 
At last he went so far , that the line of various physiognomies , stretched out by the table opposite him , seemed to him a long and wavy white strip besprinkled with laughing eyes , and all these eyes were pricking him unpleasantly and painfully . 
Mayakin sat near the city mayor , waved his fork in the air quickly , and kept on talking all the time , now contracting , now expanding the wrinkles of his face . 
The mayor , a gray-headed , red-faced , short-necked man , stared at him like a bull , with obstinate attention and at times he rapped on the edge of the table with his big finger affirmatively . 
The animated talk and laughter drowned his godfather 's bold speech , and Foma was unable to hear a single word of it , much more so that the tenor of the secretary was unceasingly ringing in his ears : `` Look , there , the archdeacon arose ; he is filling his lungs with air ; he will soon proclaim an eternal memory for Ignat Matveyich . '' 
`` May I not go away ? '' 
asked Foma in a low voice . 
`` Why not ? 
Everybody will understand this . '' 
The deacon 's resounding voice drowned and seemed to have crushed the noise in the hail ; the eminent merchants fixed their eyes on the big , wide-open mouth , from which a deep sound was streaming forth , and availing himself of this moment , Foma arose from his seat and left the hall . 
After awhile he breathed freely and , sitting in his cab , thought sadly that there was no place for him amid these people . 
Inwardly , he called them polished . 
He did not like their brilliancy , their faces , their smiles or their words , but the freedom and the cleverness of their movements , their ability to speak much and on any subject , their pretty costumes -- all this aroused in him a mixture of envy and respect for them . 
He felt sad and oppressed at the consciousness of being unable to talk so much and so fluently as all these people , and here he recalled that Luba Mayakina had more than once scoffed at him on this account . 
Foma did not like Mayakin 's daughter , and since he had learned from his father of Mayakin 's intention to marry him to Luba , the young Gordyeeff began to shun her . 
But after his father 's death he was almost every day at the Mayakins , and somehow Luba said to him one day : `` I am looking at you , and , do you know ? 
-- you do not resemble a merchant at all . '' 
`` Nor do you look like a merchant 's daughter , '' said Foma , and looked at her suspiciously . 
He did not understand the meaning of her words ; did she mean to offend him , or did she say these words without any kind thoughts ? 
`` Thank God for this ! '' 
said she and smiled to him a kind , friendly smile . 
`` What makes you so glad ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The fact that we do n't resemble our fathers . '' 
Foma glanced at her in astonishment and kept silent . 
`` Tell me frankly , '' said she , lowering her voice , `` you do not love my father , do you ? 
You do n't like him ? '' 
`` Not very much , '' said Foma , slowly . 
`` And I dislike him very much . '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` For everything . 
When you grow wiser , you will know it yourself . 
Your father was a better man . '' 
`` Of course ! '' 
said Foma , proudly . 
After this conversation an attachment sprang up between them almost immediately , and growing stronger from day to day , it soon developed into friendship , though a somewhat odd friendship it was . 
Though Luba was not older than her god-brother , she nevertheless treated him as an older person would treat a little boy . 
She spoke to him condescendingly , often jesting at his expense ; her talk was always full of words which were unfamiliar to Foma ; and she pronounced these words with particular emphasis and with evident satisfaction . 
She was especially fond of speaking about her brother Taras , whom she had never seen , but of whom she was telling such stories as would make him look like Aunt Anfisa 's brave and noble robbers . 
Often , when complaining of her father , she said to Foma : `` You will also be just such a skinflint . '' 
All this was unpleasant to the youth and stung his vanity . 
But at times she was straightforward , simple-minded , and particularly kind and friendly to him ; then he would unburden his heart before her , and for a long time they would share each other 's thoughts and feelings . 
Both spoke a great deal and spoke sincerely , but neither one understood the other ; it seemed to Foma that whatever Luba had to say was foreign to him and unnecessary to her , and at the same time he clearly saw that his awkward words did not at all interest her , and that she did not care to understand them . 
No matter how long these conversations lasted , they gave both of them the sensation of discomfort and dissatisfaction . 
As if an invisible wall of perplexity had suddenly arisen and stood between them . 
They did not venture to touch this wall , or to tell each other that they felt it was there -- they resumed their conversations , dimly conscious that there was something in each of them that might bind and unite them . 
When Foma arrived at his godfather 's house , he found Luba alone . 
She came out to meet him , and it was evident that she was either ill or out of humour ; her eyes were flashing feverishly and were surrounded with black circles . 
Feeling cold , she muffled herself in a warm shawl and said with a smile : `` It is good that you 've come ! 
For I was sitting here alone ; it is lonesome -- I do n't feel like going anywhere . 
Will you drink tea ? '' 
`` I will . 
What is the matter with you , are you ill ? '' 
`` Go to the dining-room , and I 'll tell them to bring the samovar , '' she said , not answering his question . 
He went into one of the small rooms of the house , whose two windows overlooked the garden . 
In the middle of the room stood an oval table , surrounded with old-fashioned , leather-covered chairs ; on one partition hung a clock in a long case with a glass door , in the corner was a cupboard for dishes , and opposite the windows , by the walls , was an oaken sideboard as big as a fair-sized room . 
`` Are you coming from the banquet ? '' 
asked Luba , entering . 
Foma nodded his head mutely . 
`` Well , how was it ? 
Grand ? '' 
`` It was terrible ! '' 
Foma smiled . 
`` I sat there as if on hot coals . 
They all looked there like peacocks , while I looked like a barn-owl . '' 
Luba was taking out dishes from the cupboard and said nothing to Foma . 
`` Really , why are you so sad ? '' 
asked Foma again , glancing at her gloomy face . 
She turned to him and said with enthusiasm and anxiety : `` Ah , Foma ! 
What a book I 've read ! 
If you could only understand it ! '' 
`` It must be a good book , since it worked you up in this way , '' said Foma , smiling . 
`` I did not sleep . 
I read all night long . 
Just think of it : you read -- and it seems to you that the gates of another kingdom are thrown open before you . 
And the people there are different , and their language is different , everything different ! 
Life itself is different there . '' 
`` I do n't like this , '' said Foma , dissatisfied . 
`` That 's all fiction , deceit ; so is the theatre . 
The merchants are ridiculed there . 
Are they really so stupid ? 
Of course ! 
Take your father , for example . '' 
`` The theatre and the school are one and the same , Foma , '' said Luba , instructively . 
`` The merchants used to be like this . 
And what deceit can there be in books ? '' 
`` Just as in fairy -- tales , nothing is real . '' 
`` You are wrong ! 
You have read no books ; how can you judge ? 
Books are precisely real . 
They teach you how to live . '' 
`` Come , come ! '' 
Foma waved his hand . 
`` Drop it ; no good will come out of your books ! 
There , take your father , for example , does he read books ? 
And yet he is clever ! 
I looked at him today and envied him . 
His relations with everybody are so free , so clever , he has a word for each and every one . 
You can see at once that whatever he should desire he is sure to attain . '' 
`` What is he striving for ? '' 
exclaimed Luba . 
`` Nothing but money . 
But there are people that want happiness for all on earth , and to gain this end they work without sparing themselves ; they suffer and perish ! 
How can my father be compared with these ? '' 
`` You need not compare them . 
They evidently like one thing , while your father likes another . '' 
`` They do not like anything ! '' 
How 's that ? 
`` They want to change everything . '' 
`` So they do strive for something ? '' 
said Foma , thoughtfully . 
`` They do wish for something ? '' 
`` They wish for happiness for all ! '' 
cried Luba , hotly . 
`` I ca n't understand this , '' said Foma , nodding his head . 
`` Who cares there for my happiness ? 
And then again , what happiness can they give me , since I , myself , do not know as yet what I want ? 
No , you should have rather looked at those that were at the banquet . '' 
`` Those are not men ! '' 
announced Luba , categorically . 
`` I do not know what they are in your eyes , but you can see at once that they know their place . 
A clever , easy-going lot . '' 
`` Ah , Foma ! '' 
exclaimed Luba , vexed . 
`` You understand nothing ! 
Nothing agitates you ! 
You are an idler . '' 
`` Now , that 's going too far ! 
I 've simply not had time enough to see where I am . '' 
`` You are simply an empty man , '' said Luba , resolutely and firmly . 
`` You were not within my soul , '' replied Foma , calmly . 
`` You can not know my thoughts . '' 
`` What is there that you should think of ? '' 
said Luba , shrugging her shoulders . 
`` So ? 
First of all , I am alone . 
Secondly , I must live . 
Do n't I understand that it is altogether impossible for me to live as I am now ? 
I do not care to be made the laughing-stock of others . 
I can not even speak to people . 
No , nor can I think . '' 
Foma concluded his words and smiled confusedly . 
`` It is necessary to read , to study , '' Luba advised him convincingly , pacing up and down the room . 
`` Something is stirring within my soul , '' Foma went on , not looking at her , as though speaking to himself ; `` but I can not tell what it is . 
I see , for instance , that whatever my godfather says is clever and reasonable . 
But that does not attract me . 
The other people are by far more interesting to me . '' 
`` You mean the aristocrats ? '' 
asked Luba . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That 's just the place for you ! '' 
said Luba , with a smile of contempt . 
`` Eh , you ! 
Are they men ? 
Do they have souls ? '' 
`` How do you know them ? 
You are not acquainted with them . '' 
`` And the books ? 
Have I not read books about them ? '' 
The maid brought in the samovar , and the conversation was interrupted . 
Luba made tea in silence while Foma looked at her and thought of Medinskaya . 
He was wishing to have a talk with her . 
`` Yes , '' said the girl , thoughtfully , `` I am growing more and more convinced everyday that it is hard to live . 
What shall I do ? 
Marry ? 
Whom ? 
Shall I marry a merchant who will do nothing but rob people all his life , nothing but drink and play cards ? 
A savage ? 
I do not want it ! 
I want to be an individual . 
I am such , for I know how wrong the construction of life is . 
Shall I study ? 
My father will not allow this . 
Oh Lord ! 
Shall I run away ? 
I have not enough courage . 
What am I to do ? '' 
She clasped her hands and bowed her head over the table . 
`` If you knew but how repulsive everything is . 
There is not a living soul around here . 
Since my mother died , my father drove everyone away . 
Some went off to study . 
Lipa , too , left us . 
She writes me : ` Read . ' 
Ah , I am reading ! 
I am reading ! ' 
she exclaimed , with despair in her voice , and after a moment 's silence she went on sadly : `` Books do not contain what the heart needs most , and there 's much I can not understand in them . 
And then , I feel weary to be reading all the time alone , alone ! 
I want to speak to a man , but there is none to speak to ! 
I feel disgusted . 
We live but once , and it is high time for me to live , and yet there is not a soul ! 
Wherefore shall I live ? 
Lipa tells me : ` Read and you will understand it . ' 
I want bread and she gives me a stone . 
I understand what one must do -- one must stand up for what he loves and believes . 
He must fight for it . '' 
And she concluded , uttering something like a moan : `` But I am alone ! 
Whom shall I fight ? 
There are no enemies here . 
There are no men ! 
I live here in a prison ! '' 
Foma listened to her words , fixedly examining the fingers of his hand ; he felt that in her words was some great distress , but he could not understand her . 
And when she became silent , depressed and sad , he found nothing to tell her save a few words that were like a reproach : `` There , you yourself say that books are worthless to you , and yet you instruct me to read . '' 
She looked into his face , and anger flashed in her eyes . 
`` Oh , how I wish that all these torments would awaken within you , the torments that constantly oppress me . 
That your thoughts , like mine , would rob you of your sleep , that you , too , would be disgusted with everything , and with yourself as well ! 
I despise every one of you . 
I hate you ! '' 
All aflush , she looked at him so angrily and spoke with so much spitefulness , that in his astonishment he did not even feel offended by her . 
She had never before spoken to him in such manner . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
he asked her . 
`` I hate you , too ! 
You , what are you ? 
Dead , empty ; how will you live ? 
What will you give to mankind ? '' 
she said with malice , in a low voice . 
`` I 'll give nothing ; let them strive for it themselves , '' answered Foma , knowing that these words would augment her anger . 
`` Unfortunate creature ! '' 
exclaimed the girl with contempt . 
The assurance and the power of her reproaches involuntarily compelled Foma to listen attentively to her spiteful words ; he felt there was common sense in them . 
He even came nearer to her , but she , enraged and exasperated , turned away from him and became silent . 
It was still light outside , and the reflection of the setting sun lay still on the branches of the linden-trees before the windows , but the room was already filled with twilight , and the sideboard , the clock and the cupboard seemed to have grown in size . 
The huge pendulum peeped out every moment from beneath the glass of the clock-case , and flashing dimly , was hiding with a weary sound now on the right side , now on the left . 
Foma looked at the pendulum and he began to feel awkward and lonesome . 
Luba arose and lighted the lamp which was hanging over the table . 
The girl 's face was pale and stern . 
`` You went for me , '' said Foma , reservedly . 
`` What for ? 
I ca n't understand . '' 
`` I do n't want to speak to you ! '' 
replied Luba , angrily . 
`` That 's your affair . 
But nevertheless , what wrong have I done to you ? '' 
`` You ? 
`` I. '' `` Understand me , I am suffocating ! 
It is close here . 
Is this life ? 
Is this the way how to live ? 
What am I ? 
I am a hanger-on in my father 's house . 
They keep me here as a housekeeper . 
Then they 'll marry me ! 
Again housekeeping . 
It 's a swamp . 
I am drowning , suffocating . '' 
`` And what have I to do with it ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` You are no better than the others . '' 
`` And therefore I am guilty before you ? '' 
`` Yes , guilty ! 
You must desire to be better . '' 
`` But do I not wish it ? '' 
exclaimed Foma . 
The girl was about to tell him something , but at this time the bell began to ring somewhere , and she said in a low voice , leaning back in her chair : `` It 's father . '' 
`` I would not feel sorry if he stayed away a little longer , '' said Foma . 
`` I wish I could listen to you some more . 
You speak so very oddly . '' 
`` Ah ! 
my children , my doves ! '' 
exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich , appearing in the doorway . 
`` You 're drinking tea ? 
Pour out some tea for me , Lugava ! '' 
Sweetly smiling , and rubbing his hands , he sat down near Foma and asked , playfully jostling him in the side : `` What have you been cooing about ? '' 
`` So -- about different trifles , '' answered Luba . 
`` I have n't asked you , have I ? '' 
said her father to her , with a grimace . 
`` You just sit there , hold your tongue , and mind your woman 's affairs . '' 
`` I 've been telling her about the dinner , '' Foma interrupted his godfather 's words . 
`` Aha ! 
So-o-o . 
Well , then , I 'll also speak about the dinner . 
I have been watching you of late . 
You do n't behave yourself sensibly ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Foma , knitting his brow , ill pleased . 
`` I just mean that your behaviour is preposterous , and that 's all . 
When the governor , for instance , speaks to you , you keep quiet . '' 
`` What should I tell him ? 
He says that it is a misfortune to lose a father . 
Well , I know it . 
What could I tell him ? '' 
`` But as the Lord willed it so , I do not grumble , your Excellency . 
That 's what you should have said , or something in this spirit . 
Governors , my dear , are very fond of meekness in a man . '' 
`` Was I to look at him like a lamb ? '' 
said Foma , with a smile . 
`` You did look like a lamb , and that was unnecessary . 
You must look neither like a lamb , nor like a wolf , but just play off before him as though saying : ` You are our father , we are your children , ' and he will immediately soften . '' 
`` And what is this for ? '' 
`` For any event . 
A governor , my dear , can always be of use somewhere . '' 
`` What do you teach him , papa ? '' 
said Luba , indignantly , in a low voice . 
`` Well , what ? '' 
`` To dance attendance . '' 
`` You lie , you learned fool ! 
I teach him politics , not dancing attendance ; I teach him the politics of life . 
You had better leave us alone ! 
Depart from evil , and prepare some lunch for us . 
Go ahead ! '' 
Luba rose quickly and throwing the towel across the back of the chair , left the room . 
Mayakin , winking his eyes , looked after her , tapped the table with his fingers and said : `` I shall instruct you , Foma . 
I shall teach you the most genuine , true knowledge and philosophy , and if you understand them , your life will be faultless . '' 
Foma saw how the wrinkles on the old man 's forehead were twitching , and they seemed to him like lines of Slavonic letters . 
`` First of all , Foma , since you live on this earth , it is your duty to think over everything that takes place about you . 
Why ? 
That you may not suffer for your own senselessness , and may not harm others by your folly . 
Now , every act of man is double-faced , Foma . 
One is visible to all -- this is the wrong side ; the other is concealed -- and that is the real one . 
It is that one that you must be able to find in order to understand the sense of the thing . 
Take for example the lodging-asylums , the work-houses , the poor-houses and other similar institutions . 
Just consider , what are they for ? '' 
`` What is there to consider here ? '' 
said Foma , wearily `` Everybody knows what they are for -- for the poor and feeble . '' 
`` Eh , dear ! 
Sometimes everybody knows that a certain man is a rascal and a scoundrel , and yet all call him Ivan or Peter , and instead of abusing him they respectfully add his father 's name to his own . '' 
`` What has this to do with it ? '' 
`` It 's all to the point . 
So you say that these houses are for the poor , for beggars , consequently , in accordance with Christ 's commandment . 
Very well ! 
But who is the beggar ? 
The beggar is a man , forced by fate to remind us of Christ ; he is a brother of Christ ; he is the bell of the Lord and he rings in life to rouse our conscience , to arouse the satiety of the flesh of man . 
He stands by the window and sings out : ` For the sake of Christ ! ' 
and by his singing he reminds us of Christ , of His holy commandment to help the neighbour . 
But men have so arranged their life that it is impossible for them to act according to the teachings of Christ , and Jesus Christ has become altogether unnecessary to us . 
Not one time , but perhaps a hundred thousand times have we turned Him over to the cross , and yet we can not drive Him altogether out of life , because His poor brethren sing His Holy name on the streets and thus remind us of Him . 
And now we have arranged to lock up these beggars in separate houses that they should not walk around on the streets and should not rouse our conscience . 
`` Cle-ver ! '' 
whispered Foma , amazed , staring fixedly at his godfather . 
`` Aha ! '' 
exclaimed Mayakin , his eyes beaming with triumph . 
`` How is it that my father did not think of this ? '' 
asked Foma , uneasily . 
`` Just wait ! 
Listen further , it is still worse .
