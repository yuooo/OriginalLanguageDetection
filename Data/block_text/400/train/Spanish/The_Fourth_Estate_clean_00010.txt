To show the intelligence and brilliance he brought to bear on such a prosaic matter we must quote one of his paragraphs in which he wrote : `` Sugars , alive to these variations , remain low , and will not attain any permanent rise until coffees , cocoas , and all foreign produce restrain their violent oscillations . '' 
It was , in fact , the soul of the paper . 
Nevertheless , he had not done enough to realize his ideal . 
Belinchon had always followed with the greatest interest the personal polemics of the Parisian press , which generally ended in a duel . 
And these proceedings afforded him such exquisite pleasure that no banquet could be more congenial and delightful to his taste . 
When several days passed without this excitement Don Rosendo languished . 
The descriptions of the assaults of arms among the celebrated fencers of the capital were of equal interest to him , and although he found fencing expressions -- Engagement de sixte , Battement en quarte , Contreriposet , Feinte , etc. -- were somewhat confusing , he translated them in his own way , and pretended to be quite conversant with them . 
He said there was no surer sign of the state of the culture of a country than in its devotion to arms . 
The practise aroused and inspired the idea of human honor and dignity , and their abandonment brought dishonor and degradation . 
He knew better than their own relations the biography of all the great duelists and fencers in Paris , and he could give a detailed and minute description of all the duels that had taken place , with their accompanying wounds . 
When an assault of arms was announced between two masters like Jacob and Grisier , our friend was greatly excited ; he eagerly opened the `` Figaro '' every day , and mentally backed the one or the other . 
One day in bed -- his best ideas seemed always to come to him there -- it occurred to him that to be a journalist without a knowledge of the use of arms was like being a dancer without the power of playing the castanets . 
One day , when least expected , a blow might fell him to the ground if he were ignorant of the art of parrying it . 
It was true that nobody in Sarrio was versed in the science of fencing , but then nobody was under a strong obligation to attain it . 
There might be some dispute between him and a journalist of Lancia or Madrid , and then he would have to let himself be assassinated ! 
These thoughts led him to adopt the resolution of learning to use the foil at all costs . 
How ? 
Why , by sending for a master to come to Sarrio , as he could not leave the place . 
Without communicating the idea to anybody , he wrote to a friend in Paris to look out in the fencing clubs for a teacher , even if second rate , who would be willing to expatriate himself . 
At the end of some time , such a one was found who , for the sum of two thousand francs a year , with the liberty of giving other lessons , would settle in the Biscayan town . 
The news went forth that a professor of fencing , Monsieur Lemaire , had arrived in the schooner `` Julia '' for the sole purpose of teaching Don Rosendo the noble art of self-defense . 
And , in fact , our friend was soon seen in the company of a slight , red-haired young man of foreign appearance . 
The people were horror-struck , for in a little town where blows with fists and sticks are given and taken the coldbloodedness , formality , and gravity of duels inspire horror and terror . 
They first thought that Don Rosendo wished to kill somebody , and it was only after some time that they understood the reason of the step . 
Don Rosendo entered into the matter with the ardor and gravity that it deserved . 
He devoted an hour every morning , and two more in the afternoon , to perfecting himself in lunging , which was all that the professor allowed him to do for the first two months . 
The most noteworthy result of this exercise was that at the end of some days he did not know whether his legs were his own , or whether they really belonged to another rational biped like himself . 
So sharp and strong were the pains to which he became subject that even in his dreams he thought he was still lunging , and jumped up with cries of pain . 
Then Monsieur Lemaire was so cruel that he was never satisfied with the efforts made by the good gentleman . 
`` Try again , again , again ! '' 
and Don Rosendo had to stretch and strain himself to such a degree that he felt as if he were being sawed asunder . 
When the noble exercise was over Señor Belinchon , being nearly bowed to the ground with pain , was obliged to hold by the furniture to get from one room to another ; and the noble founder of `` The Light of Sarrio '' walked henceforth to the end of his days as if he were bandy legged . 
But these tortures , similar to those endured by martyrs in Japan , he bore , if not with pleasure , with heroic endurance , as he remembered at what enormous sacrifices the improvement of one 's self and one 's country is attained . 
At the end of two months the eternal tic-tac of the foils commenced : Dégagez ; coup droit ; dégagez ; un , deux ; dégagez , doublez . 
But the torture of the legs was not herewith relaxed . 
Don Rudesindo , Alvaro Peña , Sinforoso , Pablito , the printer Folgueras , and several others took lessons at the same time . 
In the hall the fencers were so overwhelmed by their belligerent feelings that solemn silence reigned . 
Nothing was heard but the sharp voice of Monsieur Lemaire incessantly repeating in an absent fashion : En garde vivement -- Contre de quarte -- Ripostez -- Ah bien ! 
-- En garde vivement -- Contre de sixte -- Ripostez -- Ah bien ! 
-- Parez seconde -- Ripostu -- Well done ! 
Don Rosendo thought he was transported to Paris , and he saw a Grisier , Anatole de la Forge , and the Baron de Basancour in Don Rudesindo , Folgueras , and Sinforoso . 
`` The Light '' no longer seemed to be `` The Light , '' but `` Le Gaulois '' or `` Le Journal des Débats . '' 
At the end of five months he was well versed in the art of self-defense ; he could parry direct blows , he could attack with a shortened arm , and he could spring forward to perfection . 
He then thought the time had come for a scandal to take place . 
It behooved the town to know that all the money expended on the fencing lessons had not been thrown away ; besides , he wished to imbue the place with a taste for the refinements of the great capitals . 
But with whom in Sarrio could he pick a quarrel ? 
However willingly he might quarrel with one of the members of the Cabin , he knew that the only one capable of fighting was Gabino Maza , and he held him somewhat in awe , especially since he had heard the professor say that one had to be very careful with violent men , even if they could not fence . 
After long and profound consideration he thought the best thing to do was to pick a quarrel with some journalist of Lancia through the discussion carried on by `` The Light '' with `` The Future '' about a particular branch road , and this plan he carried into execution . 
In the next number he showed himself so aggressive and so insolent to the paper of the capital that , surprised and indignant , it replied that certain remarks in `` The Light '' were only worthy of contempt . 
Whereupon Don Rosendo commissioned his friends Alvaro Peña and Sinforoso Suarez to take his challenge to the editor of `` The Future . '' 
So the two gentlemen went to Lancia , and returned the same day . 
On seeing them come back Señor Belinchon ardently hoped that the affair might have been amicably settled without the necessity of fighting , although he had been the one to demand satisfaction , which is a fresh proof of his singularly exalted soul and the exquisite sensibility with which he was endowed . 
Unfortunately , however , the editor of `` The Future '' had remained firm , and the seconds had arranged a duel with swords which was to come off the following day at an estate in the Lancian suburbs . 
On learning this our hero felt his legs tremble , not with fear -- that nobody would dare imagine -- but with emotion at finding himself about to be the object of public curiosity and attention . 
As they were walking toward home , Peña said to him with rough frankness : `` The Villar party wanted to have the sword points blunted , but I said : ' I know Don Rosendo very well , and he is a man who abhors childishness ; you can not trifle with him . 
When one has to do with a quarrel like this it has to be treated seriously . 
I am certain that if we blunted the points there would be a row with him . 
Was not that what you would have said ? '' 
`` Exactly . 
Many thanks , Alvaro , '' returned Señor Belinchon , giving him a hand which Peña found rather cold , and he added in a weak voice : `` But if the points were a trifle filed I would not mind agreeing to that . 
The affair , after all , does not precisely exact death . '' 
`` I did not dare to agree to it . 
Not knowing your opinion , I feared to vex you . '' 
`` Not at all -- not at all . 
I would not mind their being filed . '' 
`` Well , now it ca n't be . 
The conditions are arranged and unless they suggest it again the points will have to be sharp . 
That will suit you , as you know how to use the foil . '' 
`` And precisely for that reason I did not wish to take any unfair advantage of my adversary . '' 
To this remark Peña gave a knowing wink . 
`` Do n't be so scrupulous , Don Rosendo . 
If you can run him through first ! 
like a little bird , do n't hesitate to do so . '' 
The officer accompanied these last words with an expressive pass in the air with the tips of his fingers , as if he were inserting them in a human body . 
Don Rosendo made a gesture of repugnance , and after keeping silent for some time he said sullenly : `` What I fear is , that these cursed pains will not let me lunge properly . '' 
`` Tush ! 
man , do n't trouble about that . 
You wo n't feel any pain in your legs during the duel . 
Have n't you ever found that a toothache goes away directly you arrive at the dentist 's door to have it drawn ? '' 
This consolatory simile provoked a roar of laughter from the officer which lasted for some time , while Belinchon remained grave and depressed , as it behooves heroes to be on the eve of battle . 
The news of the approaching duel ran through the place like an electric shock . 
The excitement of the townsfolk was indescribable . 
It never entered anybody 's head that a person advanced in years , with a married daughter , could cross swords with any one on the question of a branch road . 
Nevertheless Belinchon 's party admired the firmness and bravery of their chief , who had a fearful nightmare that night . 
He dreamed that the sword of the editor of `` The Future '' cut him in two . 
The conqueror carried off one-half as a trophy , and only the other half returned to Sarrio . 
His cries awoke him , and filled Doña Paula with such alarm that she fetched the anti-spasm medicine . 
Belinchon , with the fortitude of heroic temperaments , said nothing to his consort , but he took a dose of the mixture . 
On the following day he went off to Lancia in a carriage , accompanied by Peña , Sinforoso , and Don Rufo , with two swords . 
Upon leaving the town more than a hundred persons were waiting in the road to see them off . 
Don Rosendo felt quite overcome . 
`` Good luck ! 
You 'll send a telegram , eh ? 
It shall not be said that Sarrio was beaten by Lancia . '' 
Don Rosendo pressed the hands of his partizans with emotion . 
They all offered to accompany him , and vowed vengeance in case of his perishing in the duel . 
At last they reached the appointed spot , and there they met the enemy . 
The seconds conferred with each other , and the swords were produced and put into the hands of the combatants , whose faces had assumed the color befitting such solemn occasions , which is that of bottle green varied with an orange hue . 
Once on the defensive , and the word of attack given , they both began brandishing the swords methodically , first on one side and then on the other , with a lugubrious , terror-striking sound . 
At the end of some time Villar ventured to raise his weapon with the intention of wounding his adversary 's head . 
But lo ! 
Don Rosendo gave such a prodigious leap backward that the seconds looked at each other in astonishment . 
Villar , also surprised , waited for his adversary to return to the attack . 
The melancholy tic-tac recommenced ; Don Rosendo at the end of some time raised his sword , whereupon Villar instantly far exceeded his foe in the really supernatural bound he made backward . 
The seconds looked at each other in increased surprise , for they thought he would leap out of the field . 
The duel lasted in this way more than half an hour , during which Don Rosendo once cried : `` Stop ! '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the seconds , approaching . 
`` It seems to me that the other gentleman has blunted the point of his sword . '' 
Then Villar 's sword was inspected , and it was seen that it was not so . 
This act of generosity , more befitting the Middle Ages than our own times , raised him , when it became known , in the public estimation to the dignity of the legendary heroes -- Roland , Bayard , and Bernardo del Carpio . 
The duel ended when Villar 's sword quite unintentionally struck Belinchon 's brow . 
It was a simple scratch , but the seconds considered it terminated the fight . 
Don Rufo stuck a large piece of English sticking-plaster on the wound . 
The wounded man nobly gave his hand to his adversary and despatched a telegram to Lancia to be sent to Sarrio . 
Then they all breakfasted cheerfully together ; and during the meal the champions expansively confided to each other the blows they had intended to administer , and which for lack of opportunity they had been powerless to give . 
`` Why , man , if you had not prevented it in time I should have cut your head in two . 
With one or two feints at the face I should have given a thrust at your chest and a cut at your head , '' said Don Rosendo , swallowing a large mouthful of cod . 
`` Well , you would not have come off any better if I had carried out my intended line of attack , '' returned Villar . 
`` I should have raised my arm , ping ! 
I should have made a feint at your head , ping ! 
You were to aim at my arm , ping ! 
I to give you a cut at your face , ping ! 
You to go for my head , ping ! 
I to parry and make for your arm , ping ! '' 
Here the editor of `` The Future '' of Lancia , who had been brandishing his fork and trying to swallow a fish-bone during the description of his proposed famous and complicated plan of action , now nearly choked and turned crimson . 
He had to be taken into the air , and Don Rosendo was the one to give him the sacred slaps upon his back to make him get rid of the fish-bone . 
Beautiful and striking example of chivalry that can never be forgotten ! 
The breakfast over , Don Rosendo and his companions entered the carriage , and repaired to Sarrio . 
More than half the population , apprised by the telegram , awaited them on the outskirts of the town . 
A cry of delight and enthusiasm burst from all throats on the approach of the carriage . 
Don Rosendo , much moved , put his head out of the window and took off his hat , which revealed the piece of English sticking-plaster . 
At the sight the people gave vent to a loud hurrah , and the vehicle was fairly mobbed by the crowd . 
After entering his house the acclamations were so great that the founder of `` The Light '' was obliged to appear at the window , where he was greeted with fresh enthusiasm . 
That night his friends treated him to a serenade .

`` It would be as well to put a light curb on her . '' 
`` Oh ! 
a bit , '' returned Piscis gravely . 
Both were silent for some minutes , then Pablito exclaimed : `` Confounded mare ! 
I never in my life saw such a sensitive mouth . '' 
`` Like silk , '' returned his friend in a tone of profound conviction . 
Another pause . 
`` Think we ought to give her more of the spur ? '' 
`` The spur is never amiss with any animal , '' growled Piscis in the same decided tone . 
`` We must train her in trotting . '' 
`` It would be just as well . '' 
During these remarks the two inseparable equestrians walked right across the town from the other end , where they had been in conclave in Don Rosendo 's stables . 
It was ten o'clock at night ; the air soft and springlike . 
The few people about were hastening homeward , and the only shops now open were those of popular resort , such as Graell 's , Marano 's , and the like . 
In the Cabin there was a great deal of light and excitement . 
Pablito , who shared his father 's resentment in the matter , said to his friend , as they passed the abhorred club : `` Piscis , throw a stone at the door and break the glass . '' 
Thereupon Piscis , always aggressive , took up a flint from the road , waited for his friend to get round the corner , and then , zas ! 
he flung it at the Cabin and shivered the windows to atoms . 
Then he took to his legs , and for fear of being recognized by those who came out in search of him , he ran away on all fours with wondrous agility . 
There were also some people in the Café de la Marina . 
They entered the place and quaffed in silence several glasses of chartreuse without its interfering with the active working of their brains . 
On rising Pablito said : `` The best thing will be to put her in harness with Romeo . '' 
`` That is just what I was thinking , '' returned Piscis eagerly . 
After leaving the café Pablito was asked , not in words , but with a horrible face , whither they were going . 
`` There . '' 
`` Good ; then as I pass by my home I will make myself look a bit shabbier . '' 
They left the principal streets , not without Piscis stopping a minute at his abode to alter his attire , and then they proceeded to the other end of the town , where the working classes mostly lived . 
They stopped in a certain street , as dull as it was dirty , in front of a poor-looking house with a rough stone balcony . 
Pablito looked carefully all round , and then gave a long , low whistle with the skill which distinguished him in this acquirement . 
Then casting an anxious look at the oil-lamp burning fifty steps off , he said : `` If we could but put out this light . '' 
The terrible Piscis was again to the fore . 
He stepped to the corner of the wall , and there extinguished the light with his stick , of course breaking the glass at the same time . 
A woman 's form then appeared upon the balcony . 
Pablito jumped up to the iron grating of the window , and thence climbed noiselessly on to the balcony . 
Piscis meanwhile kept guard at the corner , armed with his formidable stick . 
Who was the woman who happened just then to be the object of the attentions of the Sultan of Sarrio ? 
`` The fair Nieves , '' those will reply who have followed the course of this story . 
Well , although we do not wish to run counter to the perspicacity of our readers , truth obliges us to declare that the young woman was not the fair Nieves , but the fair Valentina . 
What ! 
that prim needlewoman so averse to young gentlemen , and who , moreover , was betrothed to a young man named Cosme ? 
The same in body and soul , with her golden curls upon her forehead , her piquant frown , and her nose a little turned up . 
Pablito was the man to cause this sort of upset . 
While he was courting , or pretending to court Nieves , he was trying the ground with Valentina . 
But she was more obdurate than the other . 
The first kiss that he gave her upon the neck was when she was drinking some water in the kitchen . 
The angry embroideress called it disgraceful ; she turned as red as a cherry , her expressive eyes shone with rage , and she cried : `` Take care , for I wo n't stand such ways ! 
Get along , and try them on with those that like them . '' 
By this she doubtless meant Nieves . 
Pablito proceeded more cautiously henceforth , but not with less audacity . 
He did not seem to object to her brusk manners ; he joked with her , and he patiently bore with her spitfire ways , for Valentina was a type of the artisan in Sarrio whose want of culture seemed merely an additional charm . 
The trousseau of Ventura being finished , there were no more opportunities of meeting , so Pablito made use of the public balls to lay siege to her . 
Not that he had abandoned Nieves . 
The gay young fellow guessed that the self-love excited by rivalry would do more in his favor than even the personal charms with which he was endowed . 
This perspicacity was innate in him , and had been clearly shown from the first time he paid attention to any of the fair sex , which is an additional argument for those who believe in the preexistence of the human being ; because it could only be by having laid siege to several seamstresses in a previous state of existence that our young friend could have such clear ideas as to the course of action that would prove successful . 
At last the conquest was made . 
She began by giving up her young man , and she ended by making evening appointments like the present one with the gallant Pablito . 
`` Is your father asleep ? '' 
was the first question that he asked when he appeared on the balcony . 
`` What is that to you ? '' 
returned the severe seamstress . 
`` Well , if he is not asleep , you see , by jingo ! 
the thing is serious . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , coward , or I will make it hot for you ; I will make a disturbance for the pleasure of seeing you run . '' 
Here Pablito caught her in his arms and kissed her effusively . 
The young girl smiled with delight , but she soon frowned , and her whole physiognomy expressed great displeasure . 
`` Go away , go away ! '' 
she said , pushing him off . 
`` I have something to ask you . 
Where were you this morning ? '' 
`` This morning ? 
In several places -- at home , at the Club , in the stables , at the end of the landing-stage . '' 
`` Were you not in the Calle de San Florencio ? '' 
`` Yes , I passed by there two or three times . '' 
`` And whom did you meet there ? '' 
`` How should I know . 
Several people . '' 
`` Did n't you meet Nieves ? '' 
asked the pretty seamstress with suppressed rage . 
`` Why , yes , I did meet her , '' he returned in a careless tone . 
`` And you did not stop her ? '' 
`` No , I simply said good-day . '' 
`` Fool ! 
hypocrite ! 
prevaricator ! '' 
Valentina exclaimed with fury . 
`` Take that , you ass ! '' 
giving him a terrible pinch on his arm . 
`` You only said ` Good-day ' to her , and yet you were a whole hour with her ! 
Take that , you deceiver ! 
Take that ! '' 
Upon this she gave him so many pinches that the wretched Pablo was doubled up with pain , while powerless to utter a sound out of respect for the slumbers of the father of the vixenish girl . 
`` Stop , Valentina ! 
for goodness ' sake . 
You are indeed mistaken . 
I stopped a minute to ask her if she had finished hemming my handkerchief . '' 
`` It was no such thing ! 
You stood there for a good hour together , laughing like mad ! 
I felt inclined to strangle you with my own hands , you fool ! 
you fool ! 
you more than fool ! '' 
The enraged girl , now maddened with fury , laid her hands on the neck of her adorer , as if about to strangle him . 
Her heart , however , was touched at seeing such a handsome , fine young fellow with his eyes distended with terror ; in fact , Valentina took pity on him and let him go , but not without giving his arms several additional pinches . 
`` You do n't deceive me , you know ; you do n't deceive me ! 
If I find that you are with her again I wo n't have anything more to do with you . '' 
`` All right , I promise not to speak to her any more ; but do n't go and believe the first story you hear about me . '' 
`` Will you promise ? '' 
asked the obdurate seamstress , looking at him in a relentless way . 
`` Never fear . '' 
`` Well , you will have to settle with me if you do n't keep your word . 
Come . '' 
This was the calm and tender mode of Valentina 's dealings with the young swell of Sarrio ; and when he gave Piscis , or any other friend , an account of them , he smiled like a man of the world , and declared that these irascible , imperious women are most attractive to men , especially if , like himself , they were somewhat bored . 
After they had made peace , or , to speak more correctly , after Valentina had come to terms , there was a whispered conversation which lasted for some time . 
Then nothing more was heard , and one was led to suppose that the balcony was vacated . 
If it were not very ugly to cast a slur on a girl 's reputation , one might have suspected that the loving couple had retired to the interior of the house . 
Piscis meanwhile kept guard , walking up and down the street ; and the fact was , he was not the only one so occupied , for a man had posted himself ever since their arrival in the corner of a doorway , where the shadows were darkest . 
Motionless and protected by the gloom , he was invisible to Piscis . 
Profiting by a moment when the back of the latter was turned to the house , the man issued from his hiding-place , and cautiously approached it . 
He looked at the balcony and hesitated a few seconds . 
This hesitation caused his failure . 
By the time he jumped up to catch hold of the bars the terrible Piscis turned and saw him . 
With two strides he was under the balcony before the intruder could swing himself up to it , and his famous stick came down with such force on the shoulders of the poor man that he loosened his hold on the bars and measured his length with the street . 
The wrathful Centaur was about to repeat the blow , when the fellow jumped up with such agility and fled away so swiftly that the second blow struck the ground , and he did not attempt a third . 
`` Confound it ! '' 
cried Piscis . 
This exclamation must have reached the ears of his happy friend , for a few seconds later he appeared on the balcony and swung himself into the street . 
`` What is it ? '' 
he asked , approaching his friend . 
`` A man . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
asked the cavalier , turning round two or three times . 
`` He has escaped now . 
I caught him just as he was about to scale the balcony , and I knocked him down with my stick . 
Then he took to his heels . 
By Jove ! 
Romeo could n't have beaten him in speed . '' 
`` This man , '' returned Pablito gloomily , `` must be an old lover of Valentina 's . 
What is to be done ? '' 
`` Then , if he be a lover , I do n't know what he could be here for , unless it was to give you a licking . '' 
Pablito threw his arm round his friend 's shoulder , not to support himself , although his legs trembled somewhat , but to say , in a low voice : `` Do you think so ? '' 
`` One -- or two , or three . '' 
The handsome young man was silent . 
At the end of a minute he said : `` Do you know him ? '' 
`` I ? 
No ; and you ? '' 
`` I have never seen him ; I only know that he is named Cosme , and that he is a barber . '' 
They left the street in silence , and in silence they arrived at Belinchon 's house . 
There , on taking leave of each other , Pablito said to his friend : `` If I go there again , which I doubt , will you do me the kindness not to lose sight of the balcony , eh ? '' 
`` I should rather think so , '' was the laconic reply of the indomitable Piscis . 
The following day was Sunday , and the usual weekly ball took place at the school . 
They danced in the afternoon from three to seven . 
The room was spacious , having been built a few years before as a school for children . 
The benches were piled up on the teacher 's platform ; the walls were covered with maps and proverbs , and as the followers of Terpsichore danced the languid habanera , they could amuse themselves by reading a portion of the invaluable exhortations tending to show that virtue and labor are the true treasures of childhood : `` The studious child will receive the reward of his industry ; '' `` Truth and perseverance are superior to talents . '' 
And there at the end over the master 's table was the image of Christ crucified -LRB- oh , blasphemy ! -RRB- 
, mounted on a silken background , in the presence of these wild polkas and voluptuous dances . 
It was there that , without fear of rain or sun , strangers could court and admire the young girls of Sarrio . 
And , in truth , all the captains and pilots who visited the town took care to frequent the place . 
Occasionally their admiration led them to overstep the bounds of British gravity , and their fair beards came too near to the face of some beauty . 
`` Are you mad , Christian ? '' 
she would ask , as she pushed him away . 
`` Christian ! 
Christian ! '' 
the Englishman repeated in astonishment . 
`` What is being a Christian ? '' 
`` Goodness , man , do n't you know the doctrine ? 
Well , learn it then . '' 
It would be about five or six in the evening , after four or five waltzes and as many polkas had been danced , that these ladies were so charming . 
The well-circulated blood tinged their cheeks with a bright color ; their fair or dark locks , in pretty disorder , floated in the air or fell in adorable curls upon their shoulders ; their eyes shone like stars in those heavenly faces , and those ruddy , luscious , half-opened lips revealed immaculate rows of teeth . 
But enough , or we shall never finish ; albeit in our admiration of the working-girls of Sarrio we are outdone by every Englishman who comes hither . 
There was always a sameness in the feminine element of these balls , for it was entirely composed of young girls of the same rung of the social ladder . 
But there was a dangerous variety in the masculine element , for it consisted of the young gentlemen as well as the young artisans of Sarrio . 
Thus the artisans considered that their rights were encroached upon by the rival charms of the young gentlemen , and the repeated unequal marriages that took place in the town showed how they had been ousted . 
As already remarked , the West Indians were generally satisfied with the somewhat poor and faded young ladies of the place , but the young men were more taken with the charms of the working-girls . 
Thus the poor artisans and sailors were outdone by the gentry . 
What were they to do ? 
They found some consolation in visits to the taverns , and in the use of their sticks , which made every ball the scene of a shower of blows , and two or three gentlemen generally left the school with broken heads on a Sunday . 
Pablito had come off pretty well hitherto , thanks to his most faithful Piscis , who undertook to receive the blows intended for him . 
The only inconvenience he suffered at most of these gatherings was the loss of his hat , and this happened so repeatedly that he was quite certain that they picked a quarrel with him to make him lose it . 
When an artisan wanted a hat he knew how to get one . 
But Piscis could not save him from the blows he received that Sunday ; and this not from want of will on the part of the Centaur , but because there are things that really can not be done . 
With what care did that gallant youth twist the ends of his mustache before his looking-glass ! 
How he dressed his cheeks with a cream he had sent for from Madrid , and what havoc was made of his toilet an hour afterward ! 
He walked across the room , looking so handsome and so attractive that it was a pleasure to see him as he cast his eyes from one side to another , as all men well versed in his accomplishments are prone to do . 
Occasionally on passing a young lady he would say , `` Pretty as ever , Julia ! '' 
or else , `` Your eyes are killing '' ; or , `` Torquata , there 's no one to come up to you in Sarrio , '' or any other remark flattering to a girl . 
But while saying these things he maintained his gravity of demeanor , as he was aware that it was one of his most irresistible charms . 
He waited for Valentina for some time , but the room was full of ladies , and the brass orchestra had played two dances without the pretty seamstress making her appearance . 
The strains of a mazurka began , the gilded youth encircled the slender waists of the working-girls , but Pablito , faithful to the absent , stood idle , looking on at the swift couples as they passed before him . 
The mazurka over , he began to think that Valentina would not come . 
In the sudden way he seized an idea he was very like his father , particularly when flushed with wine , so that in a few minutes he was quite convinced of the fact . 
This sudden fancy happened to be coincident with the entrance into the room of the fair Nieves . 
Their eyes met , and the poor girl , shamefully neglected for nearly two months , smiled sweetly at him . 
This sweetness had been precisely the cause of her failure , for the self-sufficient Pablito soon wearied of sweet women . 
Nevertheless , he returned the smile , and on coming to her side he said , teasingly : `` Are you going to frighten the bulls , Nieves ? '' 
The embroideress wore a scarlet sash at her waist , and this remark of her ex-admirer so flustered her that she could not reply . 
She smiled again , and said , `` Ah ! '' 
`` Yes , '' `` No , '' and uttered a few more words that we do not remember , and looked as if she would faint with emotion . 
The next time he came across her he asked if she would like to dance the first polka with him . 
`` The first , the second , the third , and all the polkas in the world , '' returned Nieves , with trembling lips . 
Pablo was filled with remorse after having engaged himself for the polka . 
`` What a fool , what a brute I am ! 
And suppose Valentina comes in now ! '' 
But she did not come . 
The orchestra struck up the opening bars , and the youth , without turning his eyes from the door , encircled the waist of the embroideress and dashed rapidly into the centre of the room . 
Other young people , no less rapid , dashed from the opposite side , and then ensued one shock , then another , and then another . 
Such collisions formed the chief attraction of these balls , and the young girls , instead of being angry at nearly losing their footing and having their hair tumbled , laughed with infinite pleasure . 
Pablo and Nieves , who could not take four turns without colliding with another couple , were perfectly charmed . 
Nevertheless , the young man felt his legs tremble whenever he passed the door , and he always left it as quickly as possible . 
When the orchestra had finished he took his partner to a corner of the room and then sat down a minute , and Pablito felt a spark of feeling glow in the ashes of his love for that girl so cheerful , so good-tempered , and so affectionate . 
`` Yes , I wanted to dance with you , Nieves , '' he said as he wiped his brow with his handkerchief . 
`` And I with you , Pablo . '' 
`` You ? '' 
The girl blushed . 
`` Do you say you instead of thou now ? '' 
`` It is now so long ago . '' 
`` You are right . 
But see , I have not forgotten . '' 
`` On Wednesday I saw you -- I saw you in the Nieva road -- you were on a white horse . '' 
`` It was a mare . '' 
`` I thought it would throw you . '' 
`` Throw me ! '' 
exclaimed Pablito , slightly frowning . 
`` It was a bit fresh , child ; a mare does not throw me so easily . '' 
`` But it reared up so ! 
It almost stood upright . 
Goodness , how frightened I was ! '' 
`` I was teaching it to step high , '' returned the youth , with a smile of superiority . 
`` As she has not been worked before she resisted a bit . 
Sometimes her mouth seems too tender , but , taking her all round , Linda is a fine creature . 
Look here , when I bought her , or , rather , when I changed Negress -- and she cost me over and above 1,500 reales -- for her last October , she had a temper , indeed ; she stuck in the middle of the road , she shied at the carts and carriages -- in short , she was an impossible creature , and I said to myself : ` What is to be done with this mare ? ' '' 
Pablito , in whose heart the girl had touched a sensitive chord , talked long and brilliantly on his equestrian deeds . 
Nieves listened with rapturous delight , thinking that behind the minute description of Linda 's peccadillos she was going to find her lost love . 
But suddenly the orator -LRB- pof ! -RRB- 
received a blow in the middle of his face , the listener -LRB- pof ! -RRB- 
received another , and before they had recovered from their surprise they received two more -- pof ! 
pof ! 
The choleric Valentina was the author of this attack , and in less than a minute she had overwhelmed them with blows . 
Pablito had nothing for it but to make his escape as gracefully as he could and retire to the street . 
Nieves remained like an innocent dove in the clutches of a vulture , until Valentina , seeing she could go no further , as her arms were seized by some of the party , quickly tore herself free , left the room , where the next dance was about to begin , and rushed into the street . 
Pablito was walking slowly , still feeling quite stunned , when he felt a terrible pain in his arm . 
Being quite accustomed to that kind of torture , he said , without turning his head : `` Valentina ! '' 
`` It is I ! 
Do you think you are going to make me a laughing-stock ? '' 
`` What you have just done is very ugly , '' replied the youth in an angry tone , and looking his beloved in the face . 
`` You have made a scandal , and you have made me ridiculous . 
I will not tolerate that , do you hear ? '' 
`` You wo n't tolerate it ? 
Well , look here , if I see you again with her I will not be contented with what I did to-day -- I will strike at you both with a knife . '' 
`` But I wo n't allow you to do anything of the sort ; neither will I have you speak to me when I am with another girl ! '' 
cried the young man , more and more infuriated . 
`` Not when I see you with that cat ! 
We 'll see about that , we 'll see ! '' 
Then the handsome youth , justly enraged and oblivious in his fury of all the laws of gallantry , discharged a blow at the face of his dear one , and then another , and then another , until , in fact , she had a regular buffeting . 
The pretty seamstress patiently submitted to this treatment of her admirer without evincing the slightest sign of resistance , nor even of avoidance of the blows . 
When Pablito had finished , she said , with delightful naturalness : `` Have you done now ? '' 
`` For the present , but I shall have to do it again ! '' 
roared the young man , blind with rage .
