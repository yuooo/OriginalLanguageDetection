And when she has swallowed you , you will know the sweetness of the taste of suffering . 
The way thereto in practice is by the ethic of mutual imposition . 
Men should strive to impose themselves upon one another , to give their spirits to one another , to seal one another 's souls . 
There is matter for thought in the fact that the Christian ethic has been called an ethic of slaves . 
By whom ? 
By anarchists ! 
It is anarchism that is an ethic of slaves , for it is only the slave that chants the praises of anarchical liberty . 
Anarchism , no ! 
but panarchism ; not the creed of `` Nor God nor master ! '' 
but that of `` All gods and all masters ! '' 
all striving to become gods , to become immortal , and achieving this by dominating others . 
And there are so many ways of dominating . 
There is even a passive way , or one at least that is apparently passive , of fulfilling at times this law of life . 
Adaptation to environment , imitation , putting oneself in another 's place , sympathy , in a word , besides being a manifestation of the unity of the species , is a mode of self-expansion , of being another . 
To be conquered , or at least to seem to be conquered , is often to conquer ; to take what is another 's is a way of living in him . 
And in speaking of domination , I do not mean the domination of the tiger . 
The fox also dominates by cunning , and the hare by flight , and the viper by poison , and the mosquito by its smallness , and the squid by the inky fluid with which it darkens the water and under cover of which it escapes . 
And no one is scandalized at this , for the same universal Father who gave its fierceness , its talons , and its jaws to the tiger , gave cunning to the fox , swift feet to the hare , poison to the viper , diminutiveness to the mosquito , and its inky fluid to the squid . 
And nobleness or ignobleness does not consist in the weapons we use , for every species and even every individual possesses its own , but rather in the way in which we use them , and above all in the cause in which we wield them . 
And among the weapons of conquest must be included the weapon of patience and of resignation , but a passionate patience and a passionate resignation , containing within itself an active principle and antecedent longings . 
You remember that famous sonnet of Milton -- Milton , the great fighter , the great Puritan disturber of the spiritual peace , the singer of Satan -- who , when he considered how his light was spent and that one talent which it is death to hide lodged with him useless , heard the voice of Patience saying to him , God doth not need Either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best Bear his mild yoke , they serve Him best : his state Is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed , And post o'er land and ocean without rest ; They also serve who only stand and wait . 
They also serve who only stand and wait -- yes , but it is when they wait for Him passionately , hungeringly , full of longing for immortality in Him . 
And we must impose ourselves , even though it be by our patience . 
`` My cup is small , but I drink out of my cup , '' said the egoistical poet of an avaricious people . 
-LSB- 58 -RSB- No , out of my cup all drink , for I wish all to drink out of it ; I offer it to them , and my cup grows according to the number of those who drink out of it , and all , in putting it to their lips , leave in it something of their spirit . 
And while they drink out of my cup , I also drink out of theirs . 
For the more I belong to myself , and the more I am myself , the more I belong to others ; out of the fullness of myself I overflow upon my brothers , and as I overflow upon them they enter into me . 
`` Be ye perfect , as your Father is perfect , '' we are bidden , and our Father is perfect because He is Himself and because He is in each one of His children who live and move and have their being in Him . 
And the end of perfection is that we all may be one -LRB- John xvii . 
21 -RRB- , all one body in Christ -LRB- Rom . 
xii . 
5 -RRB- , and that , at the last , when all things are subdued unto the Son , the Son himself may be subject to Him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all . 
And this is to make the Universe consciousness , to make Nature a society , and a human society . 
And then shall we be able confidently to call God Father . 
I am aware that those who say that ethics is a science will say that all this commentary of mine is nothing but rhetoric ; but each man has his own language and his own passion -- that is to say , each man who knows what passion is -- and as for the man who knows it not , nothing will it avail him to know science . 
And the passion that finds its expression in this rhetoric , the devotees of ethical science call egotism . 
But this egotism is the only true remedy for egoism , spiritual avarice , the vice of preserving and reserving oneself and of not striving to perennialize oneself by giving oneself . 
`` Be not , and ye shall be mightier than all that is , '' said Fr . 
Juan de los Angeles in one of his Diálogos de la Conquista del Reina de Dios -LRB- Dial . 
, iii. , 8 -RRB- ; but what does this `` Be not '' mean ? 
May it not mean paradoxically -- and such a mode of expression is common with the mystics -- the contrary of that which , at a first and literal reading , it would appear to mean ? 
Is not the whole ethic of submission and quietism an immense paradox , or rather a great tragic contradiction ? 
Is not the monastic , the strictly monastic , ethic an absurdity ? 
And by the monastic ethic I mean that of the solitary Carthusian , that of the hermit , who flees from the world -- perhaps carrying it with him nevertheless -- in order that he may live quite alone with a God who is lonely as himself ; not that of the Dominican inquisitor who scoured Provence in search of Albigensian hearts to burn . 
`` Let God do it all , '' someone will say ; but if man folds his arms , God will go to sleep . 
This Carthusian ethic and that scientific ethic which is derived from ethical science -- oh , this science of ethics ! 
rational and rationalistic ethics ! 
pedantry of pedantry , all is pedantry ! 
-- yes , this perhaps is egoism and coldness of heart . 
There are some who say that they isolate themselves with God in order that they may the better work out their salvation , their redemption ; but since sin is collective , redemption must be collective also . 
`` The religious is the determination of the whole , and everything outside this is an illusion of the senses , and that is why the greatest criminal is at bottom innocent , a good-natured man and a saint '' -LRB- Kierkegaard , Afsluttende , etc. , ii. , ii. , cap . 
iv. , sect . 
2 , a -RRB- . 
Are we to understand , on the other hand , that men seek to gain the other , the eternal life , by renouncing this the temporal life ? 
If the other life is anything , it must be a continuation of this , and only as such a continuation , more or less purified , is it mirrored in our desire ; and if this is so , such as is this life of time , so will be the life of eternity . 
`` This world and the other are like the two wives of one husband -- if he pleases one he makes the other envious , '' said an Arab thinker , quoted by Windelband -LRB- Das Heilige , in vol . 
ii . 
of Präludien -RRB- ; but such a thought could only have arisen in the mind of one who had failed to resolve the tragic conflict between his spirit and the world in a fruitful warfare , a practical contradiction . 
`` Thy kingdom come '' to us ; so Christ taught us to pray to the Father , not `` May we come to Thy kingdom '' ; and according to the primitive Christian belief the eternal life was to be realized on this earth itself and as a continuation of the earthly life . 
We were made men and not angels in order that we might seek our happiness through the medium of this life , and the Christ of the Christian Faith became , not an angelic , but a human , being , redeeming us by taking upon himself a real and effective body and not an appearance of one merely . 
And according to this same Faith , even the highest of the angelical hierarchy adore the Virgin , the supreme symbol of terrestrial Humanity . 
The angelical ideal , therefore , is not the Christian ideal , and still less is it the human ideal , nor can it be . 
An angel , moreover , is a neutral being , without sex and without country . 
It is impossible for us to feel the other life , the eternal life , I have already repeated more than once , as a life of angelical contemplation ; it must be a life of action . 
Goethe said that `` man must believe in immortality , since in his nature he has a right to it . '' 
And he added : `` The conviction of our persistence arises in me from the concept of activity . 
If I work without ceasing to the end , Nature is obliged -LRB- so ist die Natur verpflichtet -RRB- to provide me with another form of existence , since my actual spirit can bear no more . '' 
Change Nature to God , and you have a thought that remains Christian in character , for the first Fathers of the Church did not believe that the immortality of the soul was a natural gift -- that is to say , something rational -- but a divine gift of grace . 
And that which is of grace is usually , in its essence , of justice , since justice is divine and gratuitous , not natural . 
And Goethe added : `` I could begin nothing with an eternal happiness before me , unless new tasks and new difficulties were given me to overcome . '' 
And true it is that there is no happiness in a vacuity of contemplation . 
But may there not be some justification for the morality of the hermit , of the Carthusian , the ethic of the Thebaid ? 
Might we not say , perhaps , that it is necessary to preserve these exceptional types in order that they may stand as everlasting patterns for mankind ? 
Do not men breed racehorses , which are useless for any practical kind of work , but which preserve the purity of the breed and become the sires of excellent hackneys and hunters ? 
Is there not a luxury of ethics , not less justifiable than any other sort of luxury ? 
But , on the other hand , is not all this substantially esthetics , and not ethics , still less religion ? 
May not the contemplative , medieval , monastic ideal be esthetical , and not religious nor even ethical ? 
And after all , those of the seekers after solitude who have related to us their conversation when they were alone with God have performed an eternalizing work , they have concerned themselves with the souls of others . 
And by this alone , that it has given us an Eckhart , a Seuse , a Tauler , a Ruysbroek , a Juan de la Cruz , a Catherine of Siena , an Angela of Foligno , a Teresa de Jesús , is the cloister justified . 
But the chief of our Spanish Orders are the Predicadores , founded by Domingo de Guzmán for the aggressive work of extirpating heresy ; the Company of Jesus , a militia with the world as its field of operations -LRB- which explains its history -RRB- ; the order of the Escuelas Pías , also devoted to a work of an aggressive or invasive nature , that of instruction . 
I shall certainly be reminded that the reform of the contemplative Order of the Carmelites which Teresa de Jesús undertook was a Spanish work . 
Yes , Spanish it was , and in it men sought liberty . 
It was , in fact , the yearning for liberty , for inward liberty , which , in the troubled days of the Inquisition , led many choice spirits to the cloister . 
They imprisoned themselves in order that they might be more free . 
`` Is it not a fine thing that a poor nun of San José can attain to sovereignty over the whole earth and the elements ? '' 
said St. Teresa in her Life . 
It was the Pauline yearning for liberty , the longing to shake off the bondage of the external law , which was then very severe , and , as Maestro Fray Luis de León said , very stubborn . 
But did they actually find liberty in the cloister ? 
It is very doubtful if they did , and to-day it is impossible . 
For true liberty is not to rid oneself of the external law ; liberty is consciousness of the law . 
Not he who has shaken off the yoke of the law is free , but he who has made himself master of the law . 
Liberty must be sought in the midst of the world , which is the domain of the law , and of sin , the offspring of the law . 
That which we must be freed from is sin , which is collective . 
Instead of renouncing the world in order that we may dominate it -- and who does not know the collective instinct of domination of those religious Orders whose members renounce the world ? 
-- what we ought to do is to dominate the world in order that we may be able to renounce it . 
Not to seek poverty and submission , but to seek wealth in order that we may use it to increase human consciousness , and to seek power for the same end . 
It is curious that monks and anarchists should be at enmity with each other , when fundamentally they both profess the same ethic and are related by close ties of kinship . 
Anarchism tends to become a kind of atheistic monachism and a religious , rather than an ethical or economico-social , doctrine . 
The one party starts from the assumption that man is naturally evil , born in original sin , and that it is through grace that he becomes good , if indeed he ever does become good ; and the other from the assumption that man is naturally good and is subsequently perverted by society . 
And these two theories really amount to the same thing , for in both the individual is opposed to society , as if the individual had preceded society and therefore were destined to survive it . 
And both ethics are ethics of the cloister . 
And the fact that guilt is collective must not actuate me to throw mine upon the shoulders of others , but rather to take upon myself the burden of the guilt of others , the guilt of all men ; not to merge and sink my guilt in the total mass of guilt , but to make this total guilt my own ; not to dismiss and banish my own guilt , but to open the doors of my heart to the guilt of all men , to centre it within myself and appropriate it to myself . 
And each one of us ought to help to remedy the guilt , and just because others do not do so . 
The fact that society is guilty aggravates the guilt of each member of it . 
`` Someone ought to do it , but why should I ? 
is the ever re-echoed phrase of weak-kneed amiability . 
Someone ought to do it , so why not I ? 
is the cry of some earnest servant of man , eagerly forward springing to face some perilous duty . 
Between these two sentences lie whole centuries of moral evolution . '' 
Thus spoke Mrs. Annie Besant in her autobiography . 
Thus spoke theosophy . 
The fact that society is guilty aggravates the guilt of each one , and he is most guilty who most is sensible of the guilt . 
Christ , the innocent , since he best knew the intensity of the guilt , was in a certain sense the most guilty . 
In him the culpability , together with the divinity , of humanity arrived at the consciousness of itself . 
Many are wont to be amused when they read how , because of the most trifling faults , faults at which a man of the world would merely smile , the greatest saints counted themselves the greatest sinners . 
But the intensity of the fault is not measured by the external act , but by the consciousness of it , and an act for which the conscience of one man suffers acutely makes scarcely any impression on the conscience of another . 
And in a saint , conscience may be developed so fully and to such a degree of sensitiveness that the slightest sin may cause him more remorse than his crime causes the greatest criminal . 
And sin rests upon our consciousness of it , it is in him who judges and in so far as he judges . 
When a man commits a vicious act believing in good faith that he is doing a virtuous action , we can not hold him morally guilty , while on the other hand that man is guilty who commits an act which he believes to be wrong , even though in itself the act is indifferent or perhaps beneficent . 
The act passes away , the intention remains , and the evil of the evil act is that it corrupts the intention , that in knowingly doing wrong a man is predisposed to go on doing it , that it blurs the conscience . 
And doing evil is not the same as being evil . 
Evil blurs the conscience , and not only the moral conscience but the general , psychical consciousness . 
And everything that exalts and expands consciousness is good , while that which depresses and diminishes it is evil . 
And here we might raise the question which , according to Plato , was propounded by Socrates , as to whether virtue is knowledge , which is equivalent to asking whether virtue is rational . 
The ethicists -- those who maintain that ethics is a science , those whom the reading of these divagations will provoke to exclaim , `` Rhetoric , rhetoric , rhetoric ! '' 
-- would appear to think that virtue is the fruit of knowledge , of rational study , and that even mathematics help us to be better men . 
I do not know , but for my part I feel that virtue , like religion , like the longing never to die -- and all these are fundamentally the same thing -- is the fruit of passion . 
But , I shall be asked , What then is passion ? 
I do not know , or rather , I know full well , because I feel it , and since I feel it there is no need for me to define it to myself . 
Nay , more ; I fear that if I were to arrive at a definition of it , I should cease to feel it and to possess it . 
Passion is like suffering , and like suffering it creates its object . 
It is easier for the fire to find something to burn than for something combustible to find the fire . 
That this may appear empty and sophistical well I know . 
And I shall also be told that there is the science of passion and the passion of science , and that it is in the moral sphere that reason and life unite together . 
I do not know , I do not know , I do not know ... . 
And perhaps I may be saying fundamentally the same thing , although more confusedly , that my imaginary adversaries say , only more clearly , more definitely , and more rationally , those adversaries whom I imagine in order that I may have someone to fight . 
I do not know , I do not know ... . 
But what they say freezes me and sounds to me as though it proceeded from emptiness of feeling . 
And , returning to our former question , Is virtue knowledge ? 
-- Is knowledge virtue ? 
For they are two distinct questions . 
Virtue may be a science , the science of acting rightly , without every other science being therefore virtue . 
The virtue of Machiavelli is a science , and it can not be said that his virtu is always moral virtue It is well known , moreover , that the cleverest and the most learned men are not the best . 
No , no , no ! 
Physiology does not teach us how to digest , nor logic how to discourse , nor esthetics how to feel beauty or express it , nor ethics how to be good . 
And indeed it is well if they do not teach us how to be hypocrites ; for pedantry , whether it be the pedantry of logic , or of esthetics , or of ethics , is at bottom nothing but hypocrisy . 
Reason perhaps teaches certain bourgeois virtues , but it does not make either heroes or saints . 
Perhaps the saint is he who does good not for good 's sake , but for God 's sake , for the sake of eternalization . 
Perhaps , on the other hand , culture , or as I should say Culture -- oh , this culture ! 
-- which is primarily the work of philosophers and men of science , is a thing which neither heroes nor saints have had any share in the making of . 
For saints have concerned themselves very little with the progress of human culture ; they have concerned themselves rather with the salvation of the individual souls of those amongst whom they lived . 
Of what account in the history of human culture is our San Juan de la Cruz , for example -- that fiery little monk , as culture , in perhaps somewhat uncultured phrase , has called him -- compared with Descartes ? 
All those saints , burning with religious charity towards their neighbours , hungering for their own and others ' eternalization , who went about burning hearts , inquisitors , it may be -- what have all those saints done for the progress of the science of ethics ? 
Did any of them discover the categorical imperative , like the old bachelor of Königsberg , who , if he was not a saint , deserved to be one ? 
The son of a famous professor of ethics , one who scarcely ever opened his lips without mentioning the categorical imperative , was lamenting to me one day the fact that he lived in a desolating dryness of spirit , in a state of inward emptiness . 
And I was constrained to answer him thus : `` My friend , your father had a subterranean river flowing through his spirit , a fresh current fed by the beliefs of his early childhood , by hopes in the beyond ; and while he thought that he was nourishing his soul with this categorical imperative or something of that sort , he was in reality nourishing it with those waters which had their spring in his childish days . 
And it may be that to you he has given the flower of his spirit , his rational doctrines of ethics , but not the root , not the subterranean source , not the irrational substratum . '' 
How was it that Krausism took root here in Spain , while Kantism and Hegelianism did not , although the two latter systems are much more profound , morally and philosophically , than the first ? 
Because in transplanting the first , its roots were transplanted with it . 
The philosophical thought of a people or a period is , as it were , the flower , the thing that is external and above ground ; but this flower , or fruit if you prefer it , draws its sap from the root of the plant , and this root , which is in and under the ground , is the religious sense . 
The philosophical thought of Kant , the supreme flower of the mental evolution of the Germanic people , has its roots in the religious feeling of Luther , and it is not possible for Kantism , especially the practical part of it , to take root and bring forth flower and fruit in peoples who have not undergone the experience of the Reformation and who perhaps were incapable of experiencing it . 
Kantism is Protestant , and we Spaniards are fundamentally Catholic . 
And if Krause struck some roots here -- more numerous and more permanent than is commonly supposed -- it is because Krause had roots in pietism , and pietism , as Ritschl has demonstrated in his Geschichte des Pietismus , has specifically Catholic roots and may be described as the irruption , or rather the persistence , of Catholic mysticism in the heart of Protestant rationalism . 
And this explains why not a few Catholic thinkers in Spain became followers of Krause . 
And since we Spaniards are Catholic -- whether we know it or not , and whether we like it or not -- and although some of us may claim to be rationalists or atheists , perhaps the greatest service we can render to the cause of culture , and of what is of more value than culture , religiousness -- if indeed they are not the same thing -- is in endeavouring to formulate clearly to ourselves this subconscious , social , or popular Catholicism of ours . 
And that is what I have attempted to do in this work . 
What I call the tragic sense of life in men and peoples is at any rate our tragic sense of life , that of Spaniards and the Spanish people , as it is reflected in my consciousness , which is a Spanish consciousness , made in Spain . 
And this tragic sense of life is essentially the Catholic sense of it , for Catholicism , and above all popular Catholicism , is tragic . 
The people abhors comedy . 
When Pilate -- the type of the refined gentleman , the superior person , the esthete , the rationalist if you like -- proposes to give the people comedy and mockingly presents Christ to them , saying , `` Behold the man ! '' 
the people mutinies and shouts `` Crucify him ! 
Crucify him ! '' 
The people does not want comedy but tragedy . 
And that which Dante , the great Catholic , called the Divine Comedy , is the most tragical tragedy that has ever been written . 
And as I have endeavoured in these essays to exhibit the soul of a Spaniard , and therewithal the Spanish soul , I have curtailed the number of quotations from Spanish writers , while scattering with perhaps too lavish a hand those from the writers of other countries . 
For all human souls are brother-souls . 
And there is one figure , a comically tragic figure , a figure in which is revealed all that is profoundly tragic in the human comedy , the figure of Our Lord Don Quixote , the Spanish Christ , who resumes and includes in himself the immortal soul of my people . 
Perhaps the passion and death of the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance is the passion and death of the Spanish people , its death and resurrection . 
And there is a Quixotesque philosophy and even a Quixotesque metaphysic , there is a Quixotesque logic , and also a Quixotesque ethic and a Quixotesque religious sense -- the religious sense of Spanish Catholicism . 
This is the philosophy , this is the logic , this is the ethic , this is the religious sense , that I have endeavoured to outline , to suggest rather than to develop , in this work . 
To develop it rationally , no ; the Quixotesque madness does not submit to scientific logic . 
And now , before concluding and bidding my readers farewell , it remains for me to speak of the rôle that is reserved for Don Quixote in the modern European tragi-comedy . 
Let us see , in the next and last essay , what this may be . 
Need is that I bring to a conclusion , for the present at any rate , these essays that threaten to become like a tale that has no ending . 
They have gone straight from my hands to the press in the form of a kind of improvization upon notes collected during a number of years , and in writing each essay I have not had before me any of those that preceded it . 
And thus they will go forth full of inward contradictions -- apparent contradictions , at any rate -- like life and like me myself . 
My sin , if any , has been that I have embellished them to excess with foreign quotations , many of which will appear to have been dragged in with a certain degree of violence . 
But I will explain this another time . 
A few years after Our Lord Don Quixote had journeyed through Spain , Jacob Böhme declared in his Aurora -LRB- chap xi. , § 142 -RRB- that he did not write a story or history related to him by others , but that he himself had had to stand in the battle , which he found to be full of heavy strivings , and wherein he was often struck down to the ground like all other men ; and a little further on -LRB- § 152 -RRB- he adds : `` Although I must become a spectacle of scorn to the world and the devil , yet my hope is in God concerning the life to come ; in Him will I venture to hazard it and not resist or strive against the Spirit . 
Amen . '' 
And like this Quixote of the German intellectual world , neither will I resist the Spirit . 
And therefore I cry with the voice of one crying in the wilderness , and I send forth my cry from this University of Salamanca , a University that arrogantly styled itself omnium scientiarum princeps , and which Carlyle called a stronghold of ignorance and which a French man of letters recently called a phantom University ; I send it forth from this Spain -- `` the land of dreams that become realities , the rampart of Europe , the home of the knightly ideal , '' to quote from a letter which the American poet Archer M. Huntington sent me the other day -- from this Spain which was the head and front of the Counter-Reformation in the sixteenth century . 
And well they repay her for it ! 
In the fourth of these essays I spoke of the essence of Catholicism . 
And the chief factors in de-essentializing it -- that is , in de-Catholicizing Europe -- have been the Renaissance , the Reformation , and the Revolution , which for the ideal of an eternal , ultra-terrestrial life , have substituted the ideal of progress , of reason , of science , or , rather , of Science with the capital letter . 
And last of all , the dominant ideal of to-day , comes Culture . 
And in the second half of the nineteenth century , an age essentially unphilosophical and technical , dominated by a myopic specialism and by historical materialism , this ideal took a practical form , not so much in the popularization as in the vulgarization of science -- or , rather , of pseudo-science -- venting itself in a flood of cheap , popular , and propagandist literature . 
Science sought to popularize itself as if it were its function to come down to the people and subserve their passions , and not the duty of the people to rise to science and through science to rise to higher heights , to new and profounder aspirations . 
All this led Brunetière to proclaim the bankruptcy of science , and this science -- if you like to call it science -- did in effect become bankrupt . 
And as it failed to satisfy , men continued their quest for happiness , but without finding it , either in wealth , or in knowledge , or in power , or in pleasure , or in resignation , or in a good conscience , or in culture . 
And the result was pessimism . 
Neither did the gospel of progress satisfy . 
What end did progress serve ? 
Man would not accommodate himself to rationalism ; the Kulturkampf did not suffice him ; he sought to give a final finality to life , and what I call the final finality is the real hontôs hon . 
And the famous maladie du siècle , which announced itself in Rousseau and was exhibited more plainly in Sénancour 's Obermann than in any other character , neither was nor is anything else but the loss of faith in the immortality of the soul , in the human finality of the Universe . 
The truest symbol of it is to be found in a creation of fiction , Dr. Faustus . 
This immortal Dr. Faustus , the product of the Renaissance and the Reformation , first comes into our ken at the beginning of the seventeenth century , when in 1604 he is introduced to us by Christopher Marlowe . 
This is the same character that Goethe was to rediscover two centuries later , although in certain respects the earlier Faust was the fresher and more spontaneous . 
And side by side with him Mephistopheles appears , of whom Faust asks : `` What good will my soul do thy lord ? '' 
`` Enlarge his kingdom , '' Mephistopheles replies . 
`` Is that the reason why he tempts us thus ? '' 
the Doctor asks again , and the evil spirit answers : '' Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris , '' which , mistranslated into Romance , is the equivalent of our proverb -- `` The misfortune of many is the consolation of fools . '' 
`` Where we are is hell , and where hell is there must we ever be , '' Mephistopheles continues , to which Faust answers that he thinks hell 's a fable and asks him who made the world . 
And finally this tragic Doctor , tortured with our torture , meets Helen , who , although no doubt Marlowe never suspected it , is none other than renascent Culture . 
And in Marlowe 's Faust there is a scene that is worth the whole of the second part of the Faust of Goethe . 
Faust says to Helen : `` Sweet Helen , make me immortal with a kiss '' -- and he kisses her -- Her lips suck forth my soul ; see where it flies ! 
Come , Helen , come , give me my soul again . 
Here will I dwell , for Helen is in these lips , And all is dross that is not Helena . 
Give me my soul again ! 
-- the cry of Faust , the Doctor , when , after having kissed Helen , he is about to be lost eternally . 
For the primitive Faust has no ingenuous Margaret to save him . 
This idea of his salvation was the invention of Goethe . 
And is there not a Faust whom we all know , our own Faust ? 
This Faust has studied Philosophy , Jurisprudence , Medicine , and even Theology , only to find that we can know nothing , and he has sought escape in the open country -LRB- hinaus ins weite Land -RRB- and has encountered Mephistopheles , the embodiment of that force which , ever willing evil , ever achieves good in its own despite . 
This Faust has been led by Mephistopheles to the arms of Margaret , child of the simple-hearted people , she whom Faust , the overwise , had lost . 
And thanks to her -- for she gave herself to him -- this Faust is saved , redeemed by the people that believes with a simple faith . 
But there was a second part , for that Faust was the anecdotical Faust and not the categorical Faust of Goethe , and he gave himself again to Culture , to Helen , and begot Euphorion upon her , and everything ends among mystical choruses with the discovery of the eternal feminine . 
Poor Euphorion ! 
And this Helen is the spouse of the fair Menelaus , the Helen whom Paris bore away , who was the cause of the war of Troy , and of whom the ancient Trojans said that no one should be incensed because men fought for a woman who bore so terrible a likeness to the immortal gods . 
But I rather think that Faust 's Helen was that other Helen who accompanied Simon Magus , and whom he declared to be the divine wisdom . 
And Faust can say to her : Give me my soul again ! 
For Helen with her kisses takes away our soul . 
And what we long for and have need of is soul -- soul of bulk and substance . 
But the Renaissance , the Reformation , and the Revolution came , bringing Helen to us , or , rather , urged on by Helen , and now they talk to us about Culture and Europe . 
Europe ! 
This idea of Europe , primarily and immediately of geographical significance , has been converted for us by some magical process into a kind of metaphysical category . 
Who can say to-day -- in Spain , at any rate -- what Europe is ? 
I only know that it is a shibboleth -LRB- vide my Tres Ensayos -RRB- . 
And when I proceed to examine what it is that our Europeanizers call Europe , it sometimes seems to me that much of its periphery remains outside of it -- Spain , of course , and also England , Italy , Scandinavia , Russia -- and hence it is reduced to the central portion , Franco-Germany , with its annexes and dependencies . 
All this is the consequence , I repeat , of the Renaissance and the Reformation , which , although apparently they lived in a state of internecine war , were twin-brothers . 
The Italians of the Renaissance were all of them Socinians ; the humanists , with Erasmus at their head , regarded Luther , the German monk , as a barbarian , who derived his driving force from the cloister , as did Bruno and Campanella . 
But this barbarian was their twin-brother , and though their antagonist he was also the antagonist of the common enemy . 
All this , I say , is due to the Renaissance and the Reformation , and to what was the offspring of these two , the Revolution , and to them we owe also a new Inquisition , that of science or culture , which turns against those who refuse to submit to its orthodoxy the weapons of ridicule and contempt . 
When Galileo sent his treatise on the earth 's motion to the Grand Duke of Tuscany , he told him that it was meet that that which the higher authorities had determined should be believed and obeyed , and that he considered his treatise `` as poetry or as a dream , and as such I desire your highness to receive it . '' 
And at other times he calls it a `` chimera '' or a `` mathematical caprice . '' 
And in the same way in these essays , for fear also -- why not confess it ? 
-- of the Inquisition , of the modern , the scientific , Inquisition , I offer as a poetry , dream , chimera , mystical caprice , that which springs from what is deepest in me . 
And I say with Galileo , Eppur si muove ! 
But is it only because of this fear ? 
Ah , no ! 
for there is another , more tragic Inquisition , and that is the Inquisition which the modern man , the man of culture , the European -- and such am I , whether I will or not -- carries within him . 
There is a more terrible ridicule , and that is the ridicule with which a man contemplates his own self . 
It is my reason that laughs at my faith and despises it . 
And it is here that I must betake me to my Lord Don Quixote in order that I may learn of him how to confront ridicule and overcome it , and a ridicule which perhaps -- who knows ? 
-- he never knew . 
Yes , yes -- how shall my reason not smile at these dilettantesque , would-be mystical , pseudo-philosophical interpretations , in which there is anything rather than patient study and -- shall I say scientific ? 
-- objectivity and method ? 
And nevertheless ... eppur si muove ! 
Eppur si muove ! 
And I take refuge in dilettantism , in what a pedant would call demi-mondaine philosophy , as a shelter against the pedantry of specialists , against the philosophy of the professional philosophers . 
And who knows ? 
... Progress usually comes from the barbarian , and there is nothing more stagnant than the philosophy of the philosophers and the theology of the theologians . 
Let them talk to us of Europe ! 
The civilization of Thibet is parallel with ours , and men who disappear like ourselves have lived and are living by it . 
And over all civilizations there hovers the shadow of Ecclesiastes , with his admonition , `` How dieth the wise man ? 
-- as the fool '' -LRB- ii . 
16 -RRB- . 
Among the people of my country there is an admirable reply to the customary interrogation , `` How are you ? '' 
-LSB- 59 -RSB- and it is `` Living . '' 
And that is the truth -- we are living , and living as much as all the rest . 
What can a man ask for more ? 
And who does not recollect the verse ? 
-- Coda vez que considero que me tengo de morir , tiendo la capa en el suelo y no me harto de dormir . 
-LSB- 60 -RSB- But no , not sleeping , but dreaming -- dreaming life , since life is a dream . 
Among us Spaniards another phrase has very rapidly passed into current usage , the expression `` It 's a question of passing the time , '' or `` killing the time . '' 
And , in fact , we make time in order to kill it . 
But there is something that has always preoccupied us as much as or more than passing the time -- a formula which denotes an esthetical attitude -- and that is , gaining eternity , which is the formula of the religious attitude . 
The truth is , we leap from the esthetic and the economic to the religious , passing over the logical and the ethical ; we jump from art to religion . 
One of our younger novelists , Ramón Pérez de Ayala , in his recent novel , La Pata de la Raposa , has told us that the idea of death is the trap , and spirit the fox or the wary virtue with which to circumvent the ambushes set by fatality , and he continues : `` Caught in the trap , weak men and weak peoples lie prone on the ground ... ; to robust spirits and strong peoples the rude shock of danger gives clear-sightedness ; they quickly penetrate into the heart of the immeasurable beauty of life , and renouncing for ever their original hastiness and folly , emerge from the trap with muscles taut for action and with the soul 's vigour , power , and efficiency increased a hundredfold . '' 
But let us see ; weak men ... weak peoples ... robust spirits ... strong peoples ... what does all this mean ? 
I do not know . 
What I think I know is that some individuals and peoples have not yet really thought about death and immortality , have not felt them , and that others have ceased to think about them , or rather ceased to feel them . 
And the fact that they have never passed through the religious period is not , I think , a matter for either men or peoples to boast about . 
The immeasurable beauty of life is a very fine thing to write about , and there are , indeed , some who resign themselves to it and accept it as it is , and even some who would persuade us that there is no problem in the `` trap . '' 
But it has been said by Calderón that `` to seek to persuade a man that the misfortunes which he suffers are not misfortunes , does not console him for them , but is another misfortune in addition . '' 
-LSB- 61 -RSB- And , furthermore , `` only the heart can speak to the heart , '' as Fray Diego de Estella said -LRB- Vanidad del Mundo , cap . 
xxi . -RRB- . 
A short time ago a reply that I made to those who reproached us Spaniards for our scientific incapacity appeared to scandalize some people . 
After having remarked that the electric light and the steam engine function here in Spain just as well as in the countries where they were invented , and that we make use of logarithms as much as they do in the country where the idea of them was first conceived , I exclaimed , `` Let others invent ! '' 
-- a paradoxical expression which I do not retract . 
We Spaniards ought to appropriate to ourselves some of those sage counsels which Count Joseph de Maistre gave to the Russians , a people not unlike ourselves . 
In his admirable letters to Count Rasoumowski on public education in Russia , he said that a nation should not think the worse of itself because it was not made for science ; that the Romans had no understanding of the arts , neither did they possess a mathematician , which , however , did not prevent them from playing their part in the world ; and in particular we should take to heart everything that he said about that crowd of arrogant sciolists who idolize the tastes , the fashions , and the languages of foreign countries , and are ever ready to pull down whatever they despise -- and they despise everything . 
We have not the scientific spirit ? 
And what of that , if we have some other spirit ? 
And who can tell if the spirit that we have is or is not compatible with the scientific spirit ? 
But in saying `` Let others invent ! '' 
I did not mean to imply that we must be content with playing a passive rôle . 
No . 
For them their science , by which we shall profit ; for us , our own work . 
It is not enough to be on the defensive , we must attack . 
But we must attack wisely and cautiously . 
Reason must be our weapon . 
It is the weapon even of the fool . 
Our sublime fool and our exemplar , Don Quixote , after he had destroyed with two strokes of his sword that pasteboard visor `` which he had fitted to his head-piece , made it anew , placing certain iron bars within it , in such a manner that he rested satisfied with its solidity , and without wishing to make a second trial of it , he deputed and held it in estimation of a most excellent visor . '' 
-LSB- 62 -RSB- And with the pasteboard visor on his head he made himself immortal -- that is to say , he made himself ridiculous . 
For it was by making himself ridiculous that Don Quixote achieved his immortality . 
And there are so many ways of making ourselves ridiculous I ... Cournot said -LRB- Traité de l'enchaînement des idées fondamentales , etc. , § 510 -RRB- : `` It is best not to speak to either princes or peoples of the probabilities of death ; princes will punish this temerity with disgrace ; the public will revenge itself with ridicule . '' 
True , and therefore it is said that we must live as the age lives . 
Corrumpere et corrumpi sæculum vocatur -LRB- Tacitus : Germania 19 -RRB- . 
It is necessary to know how to make ourselves ridiculous , and not only to others but to ourselves . 
And more than ever to-day , when there is so much chatter about our backwardness compared with other civilized peoples , to-day when a parcel of shallow-brained critics say that we have had no science , no art , no philosophy , no Renaissance , -LRB- of this we had perhaps too much -RRB- , no anything , these same critics being ignorant of our real history , a history that remains yet to be written , the first task being to undo the web of calumniation and protest that has been woven around it . 
Carducci , the author of the phrase about the contorcimenti dell ` affannosa grandiositá spagnola , has written -LRB- in Mosche Cochiere -RRB- that `` even Spain , which never attained the hegemony of the world of thought , had her Cervantes . '' 
But was Cervantes a solitary and isolated phenomenon , without roots , without ancestry , without a foundation ? 
That an Italian rationalist , remembering that it was Spain that reacted against the Renaissance in his country , should say that Spain non ebbe egemonia mai di pensiero is , however , readily comprehended . 
Was there no importance , was there nothing akin to cultural hegemony , in the Counter-Reformation , of which Spain was the champion , and which in point of fact began with the sack of Rome by the Spaniards , a providential chastisement of the city of the pagan popes of the pagan Renaissance ? 
Apart from the question as to whether the Counter-Reformation was good or bad , was there nothing akin to hegemony in Loyola or the Council of Trent ? 
Previous to this Council , Italy witnessed a nefarious and unnatural union between Christianity and Paganism , or rather , between immortalism and mortalism , a union to which even some of the Popes themselves consented in their souls ; theological error was philosophical truth , and all difficulties were solved by the accommodating formula salva fide . 
But it was otherwise after the Council ; after the Council came the open and avowed struggle between reason and faith , science and religion . 
And does not the fact that this change was brought about , thanks principally to Spanish obstinacy , point to something akin to hegemony ? 
Without the Counter-Reformation , would the Reformation have followed the course that it did actually follow ? 
Without the Counter-Reformation might not the Reformation , deprived of the support of pietism , have perished in the gross rationalism of the Aufklärung , of the age of Enlightenment ? 
Would nothing have been changed had there been no Charles I. , no Philip II. , our great Philip ? 
A negative achievement , it will be said . 
But what is that ? 
What is negative ? 
what is positive ? 
At what point in time -- a line always continuing in the same direction , from the past to the future -- does the zero occur which denotes the boundary between the positive and the negative ? 
Spain , which is said to be the land of knights and rogues -- and all of them rogues -- has been the country most slandered by history precisely because it championed the Counter-Reformation . 
And because its arrogance has prevented it from stepping down into the public forum , into the world 's vanity fair , and publishing its own justification . 
Let us leave on one side Spain 's eight centuries of warfare against the Moors , during which she defended Europe from Mohammedanism , her work of internal unification , her discovery of America and the Indies -- for this was the achievement of Spain and Portugal , and not of Columbus and Vasco da Gama -- let us leave all this , and more than this , on one side , and it is not a little thing . 
Is it not a cultural achievement to have created a score of nations , reserving nothing for herself , and to have begotten , as the Conquistadores did , free men on poor Indian slaves ? 
Apart from all this , does our mysticism count for nothing in the world of thought ? 
Perhaps the peoples whose souls Helen will ravish away with her kisses may some day have to return to this mysticism to find their souls again . 
But , as everybody knows , Culture is composed of ideas and only of ideas , and man is only Culture 's instrument . 
Man for the idea , and not the idea for man ; the substance for the shadow . 
The end of man is to create science , to catalogue the Universe , so that it may be handed back to God in order , as I wrote years ago in my novel , Amor y Pedagogia . 
Man , apparently , is not even an idea . 
And at the end of all , the human race will fall exhausted at the foot of a pile of libraries -- whole woods rased to the ground to provide the paper that is stored away in them -- museums , machines , factories , laboratories ... in order to bequeath them -- to whom ? 
For God will surely not accept them . 
That horrible regenerationist literature , almost all of it an imposture , which the loss of our last American colonies provoked , led us into the pedantry of extolling persevering and silent effort -- and this with great vociferation , vociferating silence -- of extolling prudence , exactitude , moderation , spiritual fortitude , synteresis , equanimity , the social virtues , and the chiefest advocates of them were those of us who lacked them most . 
Almost all of us Spaniards fell into this ridiculous mode of literature , some more and some less . 
And so it befell that that arch-Spaniard Joaquín Costa , one of the least European spirits we ever had , invented his famous saying that we must Europeanize Spain , and , while proclaiming that we must lock up the sepulchre of the Cid with a sevenfold lock , Cid-like urged us to -- conquer Africa ! 
And I myself uttered the cry , `` Down with Don Quixote ! '' 
and from this blasphemy , which meant the very opposite of what it said -- such was the fashion of the hour -- sprang my Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho and my cult of Quixotism as the national religion . 
I wrote that book in order to rethink Don Quixote in opposition to the Cervantists and erudite persons , in order to make a living work of what was and still is for the majority a dead letter . 
What does it matter to me what Cervantes intended or did not intend to put into it and what he actually did put into it ? 
What is living in it is what I myself discover in it , whether Cervantes put it there or not , what I myself put into and under and over it , and what we all put into it . 
I wanted to hunt down our philosophy in it . 
For the conviction continually grows upon me that our philosophy , the Spanish philosophy , is liquescent and diffused in our literature , in our life , in our action , in our mysticism , above all , and not in philosophical systems . 
It is concrete . 
And is there not perhaps as much philosophy or more in Goethe , for example , as in Hegel ? 
The poetry of Jorge Manrique , the Romancero , Don Quijote , La Vida es Sueño , the Subida al Monte Carmelo , imply an intuition of the world and a concept of life -LRB- Weltanschauung und Lebensansicht -RRB- . 
And it was difficult for this philosophy of ours to formulate itself in the second half of the nineteenth century , a period that was aphilosophical , positivist , technicist , devoted to pure history and the natural sciences , a period essentially materialist and pessimist . 
Our language itself , like every cultured language , contains within itself an implicit philosophy . 
A language , in effect , is a potential philosophy . 
Platonism is the Greek language which discourses in Plato , unfolding its secular metaphors ; scholasticism is the philosophy of the dead Latin of the Middle Ages wrestling with the popular tongues ; the French language discourses in Descartes , the German in Kant and in Hegel , and the English in Hume and in Stuart Mill . 
For the truth is that the logical starting-point of all philosophical speculation is not the I , neither is it representation -LRB- Vorstellung -RRB- , nor the world as it presents itself immediately to the senses ; but it is mediate or historical representation , humanly elaborated and such as it is given to us principally in the language by means of which we know the world ; it is not psychical but spiritual representation . 
When we think , we are obliged to set out , whether we know it not and whether we will or not , from what has been thought by others who came before us and who environ us . 
Thought is an inheritance . 
Kant thought in German , and into German he translated Hume and Rousseau , who thought in English and French respectively . 
And did not Spinoza think in Judeo-Portuguese , obstructed by and contending with Dutch ? 
Thought rests upon prejudgements , and prejudgements pass into language . 
To language Bacon rightly ascribed not a few of the errors of the idola fori . 
But is it possible to philosophize in pure algebra or even in Esperanto ? 
In order to see the result of such an attempt one has only to read the work of Avenarius on the criticism of pure experience -LRB- reine Erfahrung -RRB- , of this prehuman or inhuman experience . 
And even Avenarius , who was obliged to invent a language , invented one that was based upon the Latin tradition , with roots which carry in their metaphorical implications a content of impure experience , of human social experience . 
All philosophy is , therefore , at bottom philology . 
And philology , with its great and fruitful law of analogical formations , opens wide the door to chance , to the irrational , to the absolutely incommensurable . 
History is not mathematics , neither is philosophy . 
And how many philosophical ideas are not strictly owing to something akin to rhyme , to the necessity of rightly placing a consonant ! 
In Kant himself there is a great deal of this , of esthetic symmetry , rhyme . 
Representation is , therefore , like language , like reason itself -- which is simply internal language -- a social and racial product , and race , the blood of the spirit , is language , as Oliver Wendell Holmes has said , and as I have often repeated . 
It was in Athens and with Socrates that our Western philosophy first became mature , conscious of itself , and it arrived at this consciousness by means of the dialogue , of social conversation . 
And it is profoundly significant that the doctrine of innate ideas , of the objective and normative value of ideas , of what Scholasticism afterwards knew as Realism , should have formulated itself in dialogues . 
And these ideas , which constitute reality , are names , as Nominalism showed . 
Not that they may not be more than names -LRB- flatus vocis -RRB- , but that they are nothing less than names . 
Language is that which gives us reality , and not as a mere vehicle of reality , but as its true flesh , of which all the rest , dumb or inarticulate representation , is merely the skeleton . 
And thus logic operates upon esthetics , the concept upon the expression , upon the word , and not upon the brute perception . 
And this is true even in the matter of love . 
Love does not discover that it is love until it speaks , until it says , I love thee ! 
In Stendhal 's novel , La Chartreuse de Parme , it is with a very profound intuition that Count Mosca , furious with jealousy because of the love which he believes unites the Duchess of Sanseverina with his nephew Fabrice , is made to say , `` I must be calm ; if my manner is violent the duchess , simply because her vanity is piqued , is capable of following Belgirate , and then , during the journey , chance may lead to a word which will give a name to the feelings they bear towards each other , and thereupon in a moment all the consequences will follow . '' 
Even so -- all things were made by the word , and the word was in the beginning . 
Thought , reason -- that is , living language -- is an inheritance , and the solitary thinker of Aben Tofail , the Arab philosopher of Guadix , is as absurd as the ego of Descartes . 
The real and concrete truth , not the methodical and ideal , is : homo sum , ergo cogito . 
To feel oneself a man is more immediate than to think . 
But , on the other hand , History , the process of culture , finds its perfection and complete effectivity only in the individual ; the end of History and Humanity is man , each man , each individual . 
Homo sum , ergo cogito ; cogito ut sim Michael de Unamuno . 
The individual is the end of the Universe . 
And we Spaniards feel this very strongly , that the individual is the end of the Universe . 
The introspective individuality of the Spaniard was pointed out by Martin A.S. Hume in a passage in The Spanish People , -LSB- 63 -RSB- upon which I commented in an essay published in La España Moderna . 
-LSB- 64 -RSB- And it is perhaps this same introspective individualism which has not permitted the growth on Spanish soil of strictly philosophical -- or , rather , metaphysical -- systems . 
And this in spite of Suárez , whose formal subtilties do not merit the name of philosophy . 
Our metaphysics , if we can be said to possess such a thing , has been metanthropics , and our metaphysicians have been philologists -- or , rather , humanists -- in the most comprehensive sense of the term . 
Menéndez de Pelayo , as Benedetto Croce very truly said -LRB- Estetica , bibliographical appendix -RRB- , was inclined towards metaphysical idealism , but he appeared to wish to take something from other systems , even from empirical theories . 
For this reason Croce considers that his work -LRB- referring to his Historia de las ideas estéticas de España -RRB- suffers from a certain uncertainty , from the theoretical point of view of its author , Menéndez de Pelayo , which was that of a perfervid Spanish humanist , who , not wishing to disown the Renaissance , invented what he called Vivism , the philosophy of Luis Vives , and perhaps for no other reason than because he himself , like Vives , was an eclectic Spaniard of the Renaissance . 
And it is true that Menéndez de Pelayo , whose philosophy is certainly all uncertainty , educated in Barcelona in the timidities of the Scottish philosophy as it had been imported into the Catalan spirit -- that creeping philosophy of common sense , which was anxious not to compromise itself and yet was all compromise , and which is so well exemplified in Balmes -- always shunned all strenuous inward combat and formed his consciousness upon compromises . 
Angel Ganivet , a man all divination and instinct , was more happily inspired , in my opinion , when he proclaimed that the Spanish philosophy was that of Seneca , the pagan Stoic of Cordoba , whom not a few Christians regarded as one of themselves , a philosophy lacking in originality of thought but speaking with great dignity of tone and accent . 
His accent was a Spanish , Latino-African accent , not Hellenic , and there are echoes of him in Tertullian -- Spanish , too , at heart -- who believed in the corporal and substantial nature of God and the soul , and who was a kind of Don Quixote in the world of Christian thought in the second century . 
But perhaps we must look for the hero of Spanish thought , not in any actual flesh-and-bone philosopher , but in a creation of fiction , a man of action , who is more real than all the philosophers -- Don Quixote . 
There is undoubtedly a philosophical Quixotism , but there is also a Quixotic philosophy .
