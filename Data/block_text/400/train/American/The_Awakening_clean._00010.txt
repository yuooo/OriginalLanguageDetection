When La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that surrounded the house , she moved slowly and with delight over the springy turf , that was delicious beneath her tread . 
She stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were assailing her senses with memories from a time far gone . 
There they were , stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that peeped out from green , luxuriant beds . 
There they were , showering down from the big waxen bells of the magnolias far above her head , and from the jessamine clumps around her . 
There were roses , too , without number . 
To right and left palms spread in broad and graceful curves . 
It all looked like enchantment beneath the sparkling sheen of dew . 
When La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps that led up to the veranda , she turned to look back at the perilous ascent she had made . 
Then she caught sight of the river , bending like a silver bow at the foot of Bellissime . 
Exultation possessed her soul . 
La Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand . 
Cheri 's mother soon cautiously opened it . 
Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the astonishment she felt at seeing La Folle . 
`` Ah , La Folle ! 
Is it you , so early ? '' 
`` Oui , madame . 
I come ax how my po ' li'l e Cheri do , 's mo ` nin ' . '' 
`` He is feeling easier , thank you , La Folle . 
Dr. Bonfils says it will be nothing serious . 
He 's sleeping now . 
Will you come back when he awakes ? '' 
`` Non , madame . 
I 'm goin ' wait yair tell Cheri wake up . '' 
La Folle seated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda . 
A look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she watched for the first time the sun rise upon the new , the beautiful world beyond the bayou . 
When the war began , there stood on Cote Joyeuse an imposing mansion of red brick , shaped like the Pantheon . 
A grove of majestic live-oaks surrounded it . 
Thirty years later , only the thick walls were standing , with the dull red brick showing here and there through a matted growth of clinging vines . 
The huge round pillars were intact ; so to some extent was the stone flagging of hall and portico . 
There had been no home so stately along the whole stretch of Cote Joyeuse . 
Every one knew that , as they knew it had cost Philippe Valmet sixty thousand dollars to build , away back in 1840 . 
No one was in danger of forgetting that fact , so long as his daughter Pelagie survived . 
She was a queenly , white-haired woman of fifty . 
`` Ma'ame Pelagie , '' they called her , though she was unmarried , as was her sister Pauline , a child in Ma'ame Pelagie 's eyes ; a child of thirty-five . 
The two lived alone in a three-roomed cabin , almost within the shadow of the ruin . 
They lived for a dream , for Ma'ame Pelagie 's dream , which was to rebuild the old home . 
It would be pitiful to tell how their days were spent to accomplish this end ; how the dollars had been saved for thirty years and the picayunes hoarded ; and yet , not half enough gathered ! 
But Ma'ame Pelagie felt sure of twenty years of life before her , and counted upon as many more for her sister . 
And what could not come to pass in twenty -- in forty -- years ? 
Often , of pleasant afternoons , the two would drink their black coffee , seated upon the stone-flagged portico whose canopy was the blue sky of Louisiana . 
They loved to sit there in the silence , with only each other and the sheeny , prying lizards for company , talking of the old times and planning for the new ; while light breezes stirred the tattered vines high up among the columns , where owls nested . 
`` We can never hope to have all just as it was , Pauline , '' Ma'ame Pelagie would say ; `` perhaps the marble pillars of the salon will have to be replaced by wooden ones , and the crystal candelabra left out . 
Should you be willing , Pauline ? '' 
`` Oh , yes Sesoeur , I shall be willing . '' 
It was always , `` Yes , Sesoeur , '' or `` No , Sesoeur , '' `` Just as you please , Sesoeur , '' with poor little Mam ` selle Pauline . 
For what did she remember of that old life and that old spendor ? 
Only a faint gleam here and there ; the half-consciousness of a young , uneventful existence ; and then a great crash . 
That meant the nearness of war ; the revolt of slaves ; confusion ending in fire and flame through which she was borne safely in the strong arms of Pelagie , and carried to the log cabin which was still their home . 
Their brother , Leandre , had known more of it all than Pauline , and not so much as Pelagie . 
He had left the management of the big plantation with all its memories and traditions to his older sister , and had gone away to dwell in cities . 
That was many years ago . 
Now , Leandre 's business called him frequently and upon long journeys from home , and his motherless daughter was coming to stay with her aunts at Cote Joyeuse . 
They talked about it , sipping their coffee on the ruined portico . 
Mam ` selle Pauline was terribly excited ; the flush that throbbed into her pale , nervous face showed it ; and she locked her thin fingers in and out incessantly . 
`` But what shall we do with La Petite , Sesoeur ? 
Where shall we put her ? 
How shall we amuse her ? 
Ah , Seigneur ! '' 
`` She will sleep upon a cot in the room next to ours , '' responded Ma'ame Pelagie , `` and live as we do . 
She knows how we live , and why we live ; her father has told her . 
She knows we have money and could squander it if we chose . 
Do not fret , Pauline ; let us hope La Petite is a true Valmet . '' 
Then Ma'ame Pelagie rose with stately deliberation and went to saddle her horse , for she had yet to make her last daily round through the fields ; and Mam ` selle Pauline threaded her way slowly among the tangled grasses toward the cabin . 
The coming of La Petite , bringing with her as she did the pungent atmosphere of an outside and dimly known world , was a shock to these two , living their dream-life . 
The girl was quite as tall as her aunt Pelagie , with dark eyes that reflected joy as a still pool reflects the light of stars ; and her rounded cheek was tinged like the pink crepe myrtle . 
Mam ` selle Pauline kissed her and trembled . 
Ma'ame Pelagie looked into her eyes with a searching gaze , which seemed to seek a likeness of the past in the living present . 
And they made room between them for this young life . 
La Petite had determined upon trying to fit herself to the strange , narrow existence which she knew awaited her at Cote Joyeuse . 
It went well enough at first . 
Sometimes she followed Ma'ame Pelagie into the fields to note how the cotton was opening , ripe and white ; or to count the ears of corn upon the hardy stalks . 
But oftener she was with her aunt Pauline , assisting in household offices , chattering of her brief past , or walking with the older woman arm-in-arm under the trailing moss of the giant oaks . 
Mam ` selle Pauline 's steps grew very buoyant that summer , and her eyes were sometimes as bright as a bird 's , unless La Petite were away from her side , when they would lose all other light but one of uneasy expectancy . 
The girl seemed to love her well in return , and called her endearingly Ta n'tante . 
But as the time went by , La Petite became very quiet , -- not listless , but thoughtful , and slow in her movements . 
Then her cheeks began to pale , till they were tinged like the creamy plumes of the white crepe myrtle that grew in the ruin . 
One day when she sat within its shadow , between her aunts , holding a hand of each , she said : `` Tante Pelagie , I must tell you something , you and Ta n'tante . '' 
She spoke low , but clearly and firmly . 
`` I love you both , -- please remember that I love you both . 
But I must go away from you . 
I ca n't live any longer here at Cote Joyeuse . '' 
A spasm passed through Mam ` selle Pauline 's delicate frame . 
La Petite could feel the twitch of it in the wiry fingers that were intertwined with her own . 
Ma'ame Pelagie remained unchanged and motionless . 
No human eye could penetrate so deep as to see the satisfaction which her soul felt . 
She said : `` What do you mean , Petite ? 
Your father has sent you to us , and I am sure it is his wish that you remain . '' 
`` My father loves me , tante Pelagie , and such will not be his wish when he knows . 
Oh ! '' 
she continued with a restless , movement , `` it is as though a weight were pressing me backward here . 
I must live another life ; the life I lived before . 
I want to know things that are happening from day to day over the world , and hear them talked about . 
I want my music , my books , my companions . 
If I had known no other life but this one of privation , I suppose it would be different . 
If I had to live this life , I should make the best of it . 
But I do not have to ; and you know , tante Pelagie , you do not need to . 
It seems to me , '' she added in a whisper , `` that it is a sin against myself . 
Ah , Ta n'tante ! 
-- what is the matter with Ta n'tante ? '' 
It was nothing ; only a slight feeling of faintness , that would soon pass . 
She entreated them to take no notice ; but they brought her some water and fanned her with a palmetto leaf . 
But that night , in the stillness of the room , Mam ` selle Pauline sobbed and would not be comforted . 
Ma'ame Pelagie took her in her arms . 
`` Pauline , my little sister Pauline , '' she entreated , `` I never have seen you like this before . 
Do you no longer love me ? 
Have we not been happy together , you and I ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , Sesoeur . '' 
`` Is it because La Petite is going away ? '' 
`` Yes , Sesoeur . '' 
`` Then she is dearer to you than I ! '' 
spoke Ma'ame Pelagie with sharp resentment . 
`` Than I , who held you and warmed you in my arms the day you were born ; than I , your mother , father , sister , everything that could cherish you . 
Pauline , do n't tell me that . '' 
Mam ` selle Pauline tried to talk through her sobs . 
`` I ca n't explain it to you , Sesoeur . 
I do n't understand it myself . 
I love you as I have always loved you ; next to God . 
But if La Petite goes away I shall die . 
I ca n't understand , -- help me , Sesoeur . 
She seems -- she seems like a saviour ; like one who had come and taken me by the hand and was leading me somewhere-somewhere I want to go . '' 
Ma'ame Pelagie had been sitting beside the bed in her peignoir and slippers . 
She held the hand of her sister who lay there , and smoothed down the woman 's soft brown hair . 
She said not a word , and the silence was broken only by Mam ` selle Pauline 's continued sobs . 
Once Ma'ame Pelagie arose to mix a drink of orange-flower water , which she gave to her sister , as she would have offered it to a nervous , fretful child . 
Almost an hour passed before Ma'ame Pelagie spoke again . 
Then she said : -- `` Pauline , you must cease that sobbing , now , and sleep . 
You will make yourself ill . 
La Petite will not go away . 
Do you hear me ? 
Do you understand ? 
She will stay , I promise you . '' 
Mam ` selle Pauline could not clearly comprehend , but she had great faith in the word of her sister , and soothed by the promise and the touch of Ma'ame Pelagie 's strong , gentle hand , she fell asleep . 
Ma'ame Pelagie , when she saw that her sister slept , arose noiselessly and stepped outside upon the low-roofed narrow gallery . 
She did not linger there , but with a step that was hurried and agitated , she crossed the distance that divided her cabin from the ruin . 
The night was not a dark one , for the sky was clear and the moon resplendent . 
But light or dark would have made no difference to Ma'ame Pelagie . 
It was not the first time she had stolen away to the ruin at night-time , when the whole plantation slept ; but she never before had been there with a heart so nearly broken . 
She was going there for the last time to dream her dreams ; to see the visions that hitherto had crowded her days and nights , and to bid them farewell . 
There was the first of them , awaiting her upon the very portal ; a robust old white-haired man , chiding her for returning home so late . 
There are guests to be entertained . 
Does she not know it ? 
Guests from the city and from the near plantations . 
Yes , she knows it is late . 
She had been abroad with Felix , and they did not notice how the time was speeding . 
Felix is there ; he will explain it all . 
He is there beside her , but she does not want to hear what he will tell her father . 
Ma'ame Pelagie had sunk upon the bench where she and her sister so often came to sit . 
Turning , she gazed in through the gaping chasm of the window at her side . 
The interior of the ruin is ablaze . 
Not with the moonlight , for that is faint beside the other one -- the sparkle from the crystal candelabra , which negroes , moving noiselessly and respectfully about , are lighting , one after the other . 
How the gleam of them reflects and glances from the polished marble pillars ! 
The room holds a number of guests . 
There is old Monsieur Lucien Santien , leaning against one of the pillars , and laughing at something which Monsieur Lafirme is telling him , till his fat shoulders shake . 
His son Jules is with him -- Jules , who wants to marry her . 
She laughs . 
She wonders if Felix has told her father yet . 
There is young Jerome Lafirme playing at checkers upon the sofa with Leandre . 
Little Pauline stands annoying them and disturbing the game . 
Leandre reproves her . 
She begins to cry , and old black Clementine , her nurse , who is not far off , limps across the room to pick her up and carry her away . 
How sensitive the little one is ! 
But she trots about and takes care of herself better than she did a year or two ago , when she fell upon the stone hall floor and raised a great `` bo-bo '' on her forehead . 
Pelagie was hurt and angry enough about it ; and she ordered rugs and buffalo robes to be brought and laid thick upon the tiles , till the little one 's steps were surer . 
`` Il ne faut pas faire mal a Pauline . '' 
She was saying it aloud -- `` faire mal a Pauline . '' 
But she gazes beyond the salon , back into the big dining hall , where the white crepe myrtle grows . 
Ha ! 
how low that bat has circled . 
It has struck Ma'ame Pelagie full on the breast . 
She does not know it . 
She is beyond there in the dining hall , where her father sits with a group of friends over their wine . 
As usual they are talking politics . 
How tiresome ! 
She has heard them say `` la guerre '' oftener than once . 
La guerre . 
Bah ! 
She and Felix have something pleasanter to talk about , out under the oaks , or back in the shadow of the oleanders . 
But they were right ! 
The sound of a cannon , shot at Sumter , has rolled across the Southern States , and its echo is heard along the whole stretch of Cote Joyeuse . 
Yet Pelagie does not believe it . 
Not till La Ricaneuse stands before her with bare , black arms akimbo , uttering a volley of vile abuse and of brazen impudence . 
Pelagie wants to kill her . 
But yet she will not believe . 
Not till Felix comes to her in the chamber above the dining hall -- there where that trumpet vine hangs -- comes to say good-by to her . 
The hurt which the big brass buttons of his new gray uniform pressed into the tender flesh of her bosom has never left it . 
She sits upon the sofa , and he beside her , both speechless with pain . 
That room would not have been altered . 
Even the sofa would have been there in the same spot , and Ma'ame Pelagie had meant all along , for thirty years , all along , to lie there upon it some day when the time came to die . 
But there is no time to weep , with the enemy at the door . 
The door has been no barrier . 
They are clattering through the halls now , drinking the wines , shattering the crystal and glass , slashing the portraits . 
One of them stands before her and tells her to leave the house . 
She slaps his face . 
How the stigma stands out red as blood upon his blanched cheek ! 
Now there is a roar of fire and the flames are bearing down upon her motionless figure . 
She wants to show them how a daughter of Louisiana can perish before her conquerors . 
But little Pauline clings to her knees in an agony of terror . 
Little Pauline must be saved . 
`` Il ne faut pas faire mal a Pauline . '' 
Again she is saying it aloud -- `` faire mal a Pauline . '' 
The night was nearly spent ; Ma'ame Pelagie had glided from the bench upon which she had rested , and for hours lay prone upon the stone flagging , motionless . 
When she dragged herself to her feet it was to walk like one in a dream . 
About the great , solemn pillars , one after the other , she reached her arms , and pressed her cheek and her lips upon the senseless brick . 
`` Adieu , adieu ! '' 
whispered Ma'ame Pelagie . 
There was no longer the moon to guide her steps across the familiar pathway to the cabin . 
The brightest light in the sky was Venus , that swung low in the east . 
The bats had ceased to beat their wings about the ruin . 
Even the mocking-bird that had warbled for hours in the old mulberry-tree had sung himself asleep . 
That darkest hour before the day was mantling the earth . 
Ma'ame Pelagie hurried through the wet , clinging grass , beating aside the heavy moss that swept across her face , walking on toward the cabin-toward Pauline . 
Not once did she look back upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster -- a black spot in the darkness that enveloped it . 
Little more than a year later the transformation which the old Valmet place had undergone was the talk and wonder of Cote Joyeuse . 
One would have looked in vain for the ruin ; it was no longer there ; neither was the log cabin . 
But out in the open , where the sun shone upon it , and the breezes blew about it , was a shapely structure fashioned from woods that the forests of the State had furnished . 
It rested upon a solid foundation of brick . 
Upon a corner of the pleasant gallery sat Leandre smoking his afternoon cigar , and chatting with neighbors who had called . 
This was to be his pied a terre now ; the home where his sisters and his daughter dwelt . 
The laughter of young people was heard out under the trees , and within the house where La Petite was playing upon the piano . 
With the enthusiasm of a young artist she drew from the keys strains that seemed marvelously beautiful to Mam ` selle Pauline , who stood enraptured near her . 
Mam ` selle Pauline had been touched by the re-creation of Valmet . 
Her cheek was as full and almost as flushed as La Petite 's . 
The years were falling away from her . 
Ma'ame Pelagie had been conversing with her brother and his friends . 
Then she turned and walked away ; stopping to listen awhile to the music which La Petite was making . 
But it was only for a moment . 
She went on around the curve of the veranda , where she found herself alone . 
She stayed there , erect , holding to the banister rail and looking out calmly in the distance across the fields . 
She was dressed in black , with the white kerchief she always wore folded across her bosom . 
Her thick , glossy hair rose like a silver diadem from her brow . 
In her deep , dark eyes smouldered the light of fires that would never flame . 
She had grown very old . 
Years instead of months seemed to have passed over her since the night she bade farewell to her visions . 
Poor Ma'ame Pelagie ! 
How could it be different ! 
While the outward pressure of a young and joyous existence had forced her footsteps into the light , her soul had stayed in the shadow of the ruin . 
As the day was pleasant , Madame Valmonde drove over to L'Abri to see Desiree and the baby . 
It made her laugh to think of Desiree with a baby . 
Why , it seemed but yesterday that Desiree was little more than a baby herself ; when Monsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmonde had found her lying asleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar . 
The little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for `` Dada . '' 
That was as much as she could do or say . 
Some people thought she might have strayed there of her own accord , for she was of the toddling age . 
The prevailing belief was that she had been purposely left by a party of Texans , whose canvas-covered wagon , late in the day , had crossed the ferry that Coton Mais kept , just below the plantation . 
In time Madame Valmonde abandoned every speculation but the one that Desiree had been sent to her by a beneficent Providence to be the child of her affection , seeing that she was without child of the flesh . 
For the girl grew to be beautiful and gentle , affectionate and sincere , -- the idol of Valmonde . 
It was no wonder , when she stood one day against the stone pillar in whose shadow she had lain asleep , eighteen years before , that Armand Aubigny riding by and seeing her there , had fallen in love with her . 
That was the way all the Aubignys fell in love , as if struck by a pistol shot . 
The wonder was that he had not loved her before ; for he had known her since his father brought him home from Paris , a boy of eight , after his mother died there . 
The passion that awoke in him that day , when he saw her at the gate , swept along like an avalanche , or like a prairie fire , or like anything that drives headlong over all obstacles . 
Monsieur Valmonde grew practical and wanted things well considered : that is , the girl 's obscure origin . 
Armand looked into her eyes and did not care . 
He was reminded that she was nameless . 
What did it matter about a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in Louisiana ? 
He ordered the corbeille from Paris , and contained himself with what patience he could until it arrived ; then they were married . 
Madame Valmonde had not seen Desiree and the baby for four weeks . 
When she reached L'Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it , as she always did . 
It was a sad looking place , which for many years had not known the gentle presence of a mistress , old Monsieur Aubigny having married and buried his wife in France , and she having loved her own land too well ever to leave it . 
The roof came down steep and black like a cowl , reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house . 
Big , solemn oaks grew close to it , and their thick-leaved , far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall . 
Young Aubigny 's rule was a strict one , too , and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay , as they had been during the old master 's easy-going and indulgent lifetime . 
The young mother was recovering slowly , and lay full length , in her soft white muslins and laces , upon a couch . 
The baby was beside her , upon her arm , where he had fallen asleep , at her breast . 
The yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself . 
Madame Valmonde bent her portly figure over Desiree and kissed her , holding her an instant tenderly in her arms . 
Then she turned to the child . 
`` This is not the baby ! '' 
she exclaimed , in startled tones . 
French was the language spoken at Valmonde in those days . 
`` I knew you would be astonished , '' laughed Desiree , `` at the way he has grown . 
The little cochon de lait ! 
Look at his legs , mamma , and his hands and fingernails , -- real finger-nails . 
Zandrine had to cut them this morning . 
Is n't it true , Zandrine ? '' 
The woman bowed her turbaned head majestically , `` Mais si , Madame . '' 
`` And the way he cries , '' went on Desiree , `` is deafening . 
Armand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche 's cabin . '' 
Madame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child . 
She lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was lightest . 
She scanned the baby narrowly , then looked as searchingly at Zandrine , whose face was turned to gaze across the fields . 
`` Yes , the child has grown , has changed , '' said Madame Valmonde , slowly , as she replaced it beside its mother . 
`` What does Armand say ? '' 
Desiree 's face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself . 
`` Oh , Armand is the proudest father in the parish , I believe , chiefly because it is a boy , to bear his name ; though he says not , -- that he would have loved a girl as well . 
But I know it is n't true . 
I know he says that to please me . 
And mamma , '' she added , drawing Madame Valmonde 's head down to her , and speaking in a whisper , `` he has n't punished one of them -- not one of them -- since baby is born . 
Even Negrillon , who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from work -- he only laughed , and said Negrillon was a great scamp . 
Oh , mamma , I 'm so happy ; it frightens me . '' 
What Desiree said was true . 
Marriage , and later the birth of his son had softened Armand Aubigny 's imperious and exacting nature greatly . 
This was what made the gentle Desiree so happy , for she loved him desperately . 
When he frowned she trembled , but loved him . 
When he smiled , she asked no greater blessing of God . 
But Armand 's dark , handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her . 
When the baby was about three months old , Desiree awoke one day to the conviction that there was something in the air menacing her peace . 
It was at first too subtle to grasp . 
It had only been a disquieting suggestion ; an air of mystery among the blacks ; unexpected visits from far-off neighbors who could hardly account for their coming . 
Then a strange , an awful change in her husband 's manner , which she dared not ask him to explain . 
When he spoke to her , it was with averted eyes , from which the old love-light seemed to have gone out . 
He absented himself from home ; and when there , avoided her presence and that of her child , without excuse . 
And the very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to take hold of him in his dealings with the slaves . 
Desiree was miserable enough to die . 
She sat in her room , one hot afternoon , in her peignoir , listlessly drawing through her fingers the strands of her long , silky brown hair that hung about her shoulders . 
The baby , half naked , lay asleep upon her own great mahogany bed , that was like a sumptuous throne , with its satin-lined half-canopy . 
One of La Blanche 's little quadroon boys -- half naked too -- stood fanning the child slowly with a fan of peacock feathers . 
Desiree 's eyes had been fixed absently and sadly upon the baby , while she was striving to penetrate the threatening mist that she felt closing about her . 
She looked from her child to the boy who stood beside him , and back again ; over and over . 
`` Ah ! '' 
It was a cry that she could not help ; which she was not conscious of having uttered . 
The blood turned like ice in her veins , and a clammy moisture gathered upon her face . 
She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy ; but no sound would come , at first . 
When he heard his name uttered , he looked up , and his mistress was pointing to the door . 
He laid aside the great , soft fan , and obediently stole away , over the polished floor , on his bare tiptoes . 
She stayed motionless , with gaze riveted upon her child , and her face the picture of fright . 
Presently her husband entered the room , and without noticing her , went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it . 
`` Armand , '' she called to him , in a voice which must have stabbed him , if he was human . 
But he did not notice . 
`` Armand , '' she said again . 
Then she rose and tottered towards him . 
`` Armand , '' she panted once more , clutching his arm , `` look at our child . 
What does it mean ? 
tell me . '' 
He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him . 
`` Tell me what it means ! '' 
she cried despairingly . 
`` It means , '' he answered lightly , `` that the child is not white ; it means that you are not white . '' 
A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it . 
`` It is a lie ; it is not true , I am white ! 
Look at my hair , it is brown ; and my eyes are gray , Armand , you know they are gray . 
And my skin is fair , '' seizing his wrist . 
`` Look at my hand ; whiter than yours , Armand , '' she laughed hysterically . 
`` As white as La Blanche 's , '' he returned cruelly ; and went away leaving her alone with their child . 
When she could hold a pen in her hand , she sent a despairing letter to Madame Valmonde . 
`` My mother , they tell me I am not white . 
Armand has told me I am not white . 
For God 's sake tell them it is not true . 
You must know it is not true . 
I shall die . 
I must die . 
I can not be so unhappy , and live . '' 
The answer that came was brief : `` My own Desiree : Come home to Valmonde ; back to your mother who loves you . 
Come with your child . '' 
When the letter reached Desiree she went with it to her husband 's study , and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat . 
She was like a stone image : silent , white , motionless after she placed it there . 
In silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words . 
He said nothing . 
`` Shall I go , Armand ? '' 
she asked in tones sharp with agonized suspense . 
`` Yes , go . '' 
`` Do you want me to go ? '' 
`` Yes , I want you to go . '' 
He thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him ; and felt , somehow , that he was paying Him back in kind when he stabbed thus into his wife 's soul . 
Moreover he no longer loved her , because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name . 
She turned away like one stunned by a blow , and walked slowly towards the door , hoping he would call her back . 
`` Good-by , Armand , '' she moaned . 
He did not answer her . 
That was his last blow at fate . 
Desiree went in search of her child . 
Zandrine was pacing the sombre gallery with it . 
She took the little one from the nurse 's arms with no word of explanation , and descending the steps , walked away , under the live-oak branches . 
It was an October afternoon ; the sun was just sinking . 
Out in the still fields the negroes were picking cotton . 
Desiree had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which she wore . 
Her hair was uncovered and the sun 's rays brought a golden gleam from its brown meshes . 
She did not take the broad , beaten road which led to the far-off plantation of Valmonde . 
She walked across a deserted field , where the stubble bruised her tender feet , so delicately shod , and tore her thin gown to shreds . 
She disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick along the banks of the deep , sluggish bayou ; and she did not come back again . 
Some weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L'Abri . 
In the centre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire . 
Armand Aubigny sat in the wide hallway that commanded a view of the spectacle ; and it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the material which kept this fire ablaze . 
A graceful cradle of willow , with all its dainty furbishings , was laid upon the pyre , which had already been fed with the richness of a priceless layette . 
Then there were silk gowns , and velvet and satin ones added to these ; laces , too , and embroideries ; bonnets and gloves ; for the corbeille had been of rare quality . 
The last thing to go was a tiny bundle of letters ; innocent little scribblings that Desiree had sent to him during the days of their espousal . 
There was the remnant of one back in the drawer from which he took them . 
But it was not Desiree 's ; it was part of an old letter from his mother to his father . 
He read it . 
She was thanking God for the blessing of her husband 's love : -- `` But above all , '' she wrote , `` night and day , I thank the good God for having so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that his mother , who adores him , belongs to the race that is cursed with the brand of slavery . '' 
WOMAN Mrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband expected his friend , Gouvernail , up to spend a week or two on the plantation . 
They had entertained a good deal during the winter ; much of the time had also been passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild dissipation . 
She was looking forward to a period of unbroken rest , now , and undisturbed tete-a-tete with her husband , when he informed her that Gouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two . 
This was a man she had heard much of but never seen . 
He had been her husband 's college friend ; was now a journalist , and in no sense a society man or `` a man about town , '' which were , perhaps , some of the reasons she had never met him . 
But she had unconsciously formed an image of him in her mind . 
She pictured him tall , slim , cynical ; with eye-glasses , and his hands in his pockets ; and she did not like him . 
Gouvernail was slim enough , but he was n't very tall nor very cynical ; neither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in his pockets . 
And she rather liked him when he first presented himself . 
But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly attempted to do so . 
She could discover in him none of those brilliant and promising traits which Gaston , her husband , had often assured her that he possessed . 
On the contrary , he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home and in face of Gaston 's frank and wordy hospitality . 
His manner was as courteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require ; but he made no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem . 
Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide portico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars , smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston 's experience as a sugar planter . 
`` This is what I call living , '' he would utter with deep satisfaction , as the air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and scented velvety touch . 
It pleased him also to get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him , rubbing themselves sociably against his legs . 
He did not care to fish , and displayed no eagerness to go out and kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so . 
Gouvernail 's personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda , but she liked him . 
Indeed , he was a lovable , inoffensive fellow . 
After a few days , when she could understand him no better than at first , she gave over being puzzled and remained piqued . 
In this mood she left her husband and her guest , for the most part , alone together . 
Then finding that Gouvernail took no manner of exception to her action , she imposed her society upon him , accompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along the batture . 
She persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which he had unconsciously enveloped himself .
