`` The good Lord have pity on us ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe . 
`` O ! 
it do n't seem as if it was true ! 
What has he done , that Mas ' r should sell him ? '' 
`` He has n't done anything , -- it is n't for that . 
Master do n't want to sell , and Missis she 's always good . 
I heard her plead and beg for us ; but he told her ' t was no use ; that he was in this man 's debt , and that this man had got the power over him ; and that if he did n't pay him off clear , it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people , and move off . 
Yes , I heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all , the man was driving him so hard . 
Master said he was sorry ; but oh , Missis -- you ought to have heard her talk ! 
If she a n't a Christian and an angel , there never was one . 
I 'm a wicked girl to leave her so ; but , then , I ca n't help it . 
She said , herself , one soul was worth more than the world ; and this boy has a soul , and if I let him be carried off , who knows what 'll become of it ? 
It must be right : but , if it a n't right , the Lord forgive me , for I ca n't help doing it ! '' 
`` Well , old man ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , `` why do n't you go , too ? 
Will you wait to be toted down river , where they kill niggers with hard work and starving ? 
I 'd a heap rather die than go there , any day ! 
There 's time for ye , -- be off with Lizy , -- you 've got a pass to come and go any time . 
Come , bustle up , and I 'll get your things together . '' 
Tom slowly raised his head , and looked sorrowfully but quietly around , and said , `` No , no -- I a n't going . 
Let Eliza go -- it 's her right ! 
I would n't be the one to say no -- ` ta n't in natur for her to stay ; but you heard what she said ! 
If I must be sold , or all the people on the place , and everything go to rack , why , let me be sold . 
I s ` pose I can bar it as well as any on 'em , '' he added , while something like a sob and a sigh shook his broad , rough chest convulsively . 
`` Mas ' r always found me on the spot -- he always will . 
I never have broke trust , nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word , and I never will . 
It 's better for me alone to go , than to break up the place and sell all . 
Mas ' r a n't to blame , Chloe , and he 'll take care of you and the poor -- '' Here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads , and broke fairly down . 
He leaned over the back of the chair , and covered his face with his large hands . 
Sobs , heavy , hoarse and loud , shook the chair , and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor ; just such tears , sir , as you dropped into the coffin where lay your first-born son ; such tears , woman , as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe . 
For , sir , he was a man , -- and you are but another man . 
And , woman , though dressed in silk and jewels , you are but a woman , and , in life 's great straits and mighty griefs , ye feel but one sorrow ! 
`` And now , '' said Eliza , as she stood in the door , `` I saw my husband only this afternoon , and I little knew then what was to come . 
They have pushed him to the very last standing place , and he told me , today , that he was going to run away . 
Do try , if you can , to get word to him . 
Tell him how I went , and why I went ; and tell him I 'm going to try and find Canada . 
You must give my love to him , and tell him , if I never see him again , '' she turned away , and stood with her back to them for a moment , and then added , in a husky voice , `` tell him to be as good as he can , and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven . '' 
`` Call Bruno in there , '' she added . 
`` Shut the door on him , poor beast ! 
He must n't go with me ! '' 
A few last words and tears , a few simple adieus and blessings , and clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms , she glided noiselessly away . 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby , after their protracted discussion of the night before , did not readily sink to repose , and , in consequence , slept somewhat later than usual , the ensuing morning . 
`` I wonder what keeps Eliza , '' said Mrs. Shelby , after giving her bell repeated pulls , to no purpose . 
Mr. Shelby was standing before his dressing-glass , sharpening his razor ; and just then the door opened , and a colored boy entered , with his shaving-water . 
`` Andy , '' said his mistress , `` step to Eliza 's door , and tell her I have rung for her three times . 
Poor thing ! '' 
she added , to herself , with a sigh . 
Andy soon returned , with eyes very wide in astonishment . 
`` Lor , Missis ! 
Lizy 's drawers is all open , and her things all lying every which way ; and I believe she 's just done clared out ! '' 
The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment . 
He exclaimed , `` Then she suspected it , and she 's off ! '' 
`` The Lord be thanked ! '' 
said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` I trust she is . '' 
`` Wife , you talk like a fool ! 
Really , it will be something pretty awkward for me , if she is . 
Haley saw that I hesitated about selling this child , and he 'll think I connived at it , to get him out of the way . 
It touches my honor ! '' 
And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily . 
There was great running and ejaculating , and opening and shutting of doors , and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different places , for about a quarter of an hour . 
One person only , who might have shed some light on the matter , was entirely silent , and that was the head cook , Aunt Chloe . 
Silently , and with a heavy cloud settled down over her once joyous face , she proceeded making out her breakfast biscuits , as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her . 
Very soon , about a dozen young imps were roosting , like so many crows , on the verandah railings , each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange Mas ' r of his ill luck . 
`` He 'll be rael mad , I 'll be bound , '' said Andy . '' 
Wo n't he swar ! '' 
said little black Jake . 
`` Yes , for he does swar , '' said woolly-headed Mandy . 
`` I hearn him yesterday , at dinner . 
I hearn all about it then , 'cause I got into the closet where Missis keeps the great jugs , and I hearn every word . '' 
And Mandy , who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard , more than a black cat , now took airs of superior wisdom , and strutted about , forgetting to state that , though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified , she had been fast asleep all the time . 
When , at last , Haley appeared , booted and spurred , he was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand . 
The young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him `` swar , '' which he did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly , as they ducked and dodged hither and thither , to be out of the reach of his riding-whip ; and , all whooping off together , they tumbled , in a pile of immeasurable giggle , on the withered turf under the verandah , where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction . 
`` If I had the little devils ! '' 
muttered Haley , between his teeth . 
`` But you ha ` nt got 'em , though ! '' 
said Andy , with a triumphant flourish , and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader 's back , when he was fairly beyond hearing . 
`` I say now , Shelby , this yer 's a most extro ` rnary business ! '' 
said Haley , as he abruptly entered the parlor . 
`` It seems that gal 's off , with her young un . '' 
`` Mr. Haley , Mrs. Shelby is present , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` I beg pardon , ma'am , '' said Haley , bowing slightly , with a still lowering brow ; `` but still I say , as I said before , this yer 's a sing ` lar report . 
Is it true , sir ? '' 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` if you wish to communicate with me , you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman . 
Andy , take Mr. Haley 's hat and riding-whip . 
Take a seat , sir . 
Yes , sir ; I regret to say that the young woman , excited by overhearing , or having reported to her , something of this business , has taken her child in the night , and made off . '' 
`` I did expect fair dealing in this matter , I confess , '' said Haley . 
`` Well , sir , '' said Mr. Shelby , turning sharply round upon him , `` what am I to understand by that remark ? 
If any man calls my honor in question , I have but one answer for him . '' 
The trader cowered at this , and in a somewhat lower tone said that `` it was plaguy hard on a fellow , that had made a fair bargain , to be gulled that way . '' 
`` Mr. Haley , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` if I did not think you had some cause for disappointment , I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning . 
I say thus much , however , since appearances call for it , that I shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me , as if I were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter . 
Moreover , I shall feel bound to give you every assistance , in the use of horses , servants , & c. , in the recovery of your property . 
So , in short , Haley , '' said he , suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness , `` the best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast , and we will then see what is to be done . '' 
Mrs. Shelby now rose , and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfast-table that morning ; and , deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen 's coffee at the side-board , she left the room . 
`` Old lady do n't like your humble servant , over and above , '' said Haley , with an uneasy effort to be very familiar . 
`` I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom , '' said Mr. Shelby , dryly . 
`` Beg pardon ; of course , only a joke , you know , '' said Haley , forcing a laugh . 
`` Some jokes are less agreeable than others , '' rejoined Shelby . 
`` Devilish free , now I 've signed those papers , cuss him ! '' 
muttered Haley to himself ; `` quite grand , since yesterday ! '' 
Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of Tom 's fate among his compeers on the place . 
It was the topic in every mouth , everywhere ; and nothing was done in the house or in the field , but to discuss its probable results . 
Eliza 's flight -- an unprecedented event on the place -- was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement . 
Black Sam , as he was commonly called , from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place , was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings , with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being , that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington . 
`` It 's an ill wind dat blow nowhar , -- dat ar a fact , '' said Sam , sententiously , giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons , and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender-button , with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted . 
`` Yes , it 's an ill wind blows nowhar , '' he repeated . 
`` Now , dar , Tom 's down -- wal , course der 's room for some nigger to be up -- and why not dis nigger ? 
-- dat 's de idee . 
Tom , a ridin ' round de country -- boots blacked -- pass in his pocket -- all grand as Cuffee -- but who he ? 
Now , why should n't Sam ? 
-- dat 's what I want to know . '' 
`` Halloo , Sam -- O Sam ! 
Mas ' r wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry , '' said Andy , cutting short Sam 's soliloquy . 
`` High ! 
what 's afoot now , young un ? '' 
`` Why , you do n't know , I s ` pose , that Lizy 's cut stick , and clared out , with her young un ? '' 
`` You teach your granny ! '' 
said Sam , with infinite contempt ; `` knowed it a heap sight sooner than you did ; this nigger a n't so green , now ! '' 
`` Well , anyhow , Mas ' r wants Bill and Jerry geared right up ; and you and I 's to go with Mas ' r Haley , to look arter her . '' 
`` Good , now ! 
dat 's de time o ' day ! '' 
said Sam . 
`` It 's Sam dat 's called for in dese yer times . 
He 's de nigger . 
See if I do n't cotch her , now ; Mas ` r 'll see what Sam can do ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
but , Sam , '' said Andy , `` you 'd better think twice ; for Missis do n't want her cotched , and she 'll be in yer wool . '' 
`` High ! '' 
said Sam , opening his eyes . 
`` How you know dat ? '' 
`` Heard her say so , my own self , dis blessed mornin ' , when I bring in Mas ` r 's shaving-water . 
She sent me to see why Lizy did n't come to dress her ; and when I telled her she was off , she jest ris up , and ses she , ` The Lord be praised ; ' and Mas ` r , he seemed rael mad , and ses he , ` Wife , you talk like a fool . ' 
But Lor ! 
she 'll bring him to ! 
I knows well enough how that 'll be , -- it 's allers best to stand Missis ' side the fence , now I tell yer . '' 
Black Sam , upon this , scratched his woolly pate , which , if it did not contain very profound wisdom , still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and countries , and vulgarly denominated `` knowing which side the bread is buttered ; '' so , stopping with grave consideration , he again gave a hitch to his pantaloons , which was his regularly organized method of assisting his mental perplexities . 
`` Der a n't no saying ' -- never -- ` bout no kind o ' thing in dis yer world , '' he said , at last . 
Sam spoke like a philosopher , emphasizing this -- as if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds , and therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly . 
`` Now , sartin I 'd a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world after Lizy , '' added Sam , thoughtfully . 
`` So she would , '' said Andy ; `` but ca n't ye see through a ladder , ye black nigger ? 
Missis do n't want dis yer Mas ' r Haley to get Lizy 's boy ; dat 's de go ! '' 
`` High ! '' 
said Sam , with an indescribable intonation , known only to those who have heard it among the negroes . 
`` And I 'll tell yer more 'n all , '' said Andy ; `` I specs you 'd better be making tracks for dem hosses , -- mighty sudden , too , -- for I hearn Missis ` quirin ' arter yer , -- so you 've stood foolin ' long enough . '' 
Sam , upon this , began to bestir himself in real earnest , and after a while appeared , bearing down gloriously towards the house , with Bill and Jerry in a full canter , and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping , he brought them up alongside of the horse-post like a tornado . 
Haley 's horse , which was a skittish young colt , winced , and bounced , and pulled hard at his halter . 
`` Ho , ho ! '' 
said Sam , `` skeery , ar ye ? '' 
and his black visage lighted up with a curious , mischievous gleam . 
`` I 'll fix ye now ! '' 
said he . 
There was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place , and the small , sharp , triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground . 
With one of these in his fingers , Sam approached the colt , stroked and patted , and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation . 
On pretence of adjusting the saddle , he adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut , in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal , without leaving any perceptible graze or wound . 
`` Dar ! '' 
he said , rolling his eyes with an approving grin ; `` me fix 'em ! '' 
At this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony , beckoning to him . 
Sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at St. James ' or Washington . 
`` Why have you been loitering so , Sam ? 
I sent Andy to tell you to hurry . '' 
`` Lord bless you , Missis ! '' 
said Sam , `` horses wo n't be cotched all in a minit ; they 'd done clared out way down to the south pasture , and the Lord knows whar ! '' 
`` Sam , how often must I tell you not to say ` Lord bless you , and the Lord knows , ' and such things ? 
It 's wicked . '' 
`` O , Lord bless my soul ! 
I done forgot , Missis ! 
I wo n't say nothing of de sort no more . '' 
`` Why , Sam , you just have said it again . '' 
`` Did I ? 
O , Lord ! 
I mean -- I did n't go fur to say it . '' 
`` You must be careful , Sam . '' 
`` Just let me get my breath , Missis , and I 'll start fair . 
I 'll be bery careful . '' 
`` Well , Sam , you are to go with Mr. Haley , to show him the road , and help him . 
Be careful of the horses , Sam ; you know Jerry was a little lame last week ; do n't ride them too fast . '' 
Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice , and strong emphasis . 
`` Let dis child alone for dat ! '' 
said Sam , rolling up his eyes with a volume of meaning . 
`` Lord knows ! 
High ! 
Did n't say dat ! '' 
said he , suddenly catching his breath , with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension , which made his mistress laugh , spite of herself . 
`` Yes , Missis , I 'll look out for de hosses ! '' 
`` Now , Andy , '' said Sam , returning to his stand under the beech-trees , `` you see I would n't be ' t all surprised if dat ar gen ` lman 's crittur should gib a fling , by and by , when he comes to be a gettin ' up . 
You know , Andy , critturs will do such things ; '' and therewith Sam poked Andy in the side , in a highly suggestive manner . 
`` High ! '' 
said Andy , with an air of instant appreciation . 
`` Yes , you see , Andy , Missis wants to make time , -- dat ar 's clar to der most or ` nary ` bserver . 
I jis make a little for her . 
Now , you see , get all dese yer hosses loose , caperin ' permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar , and I spec Mas ' r wo n't be off in a hurry . '' 
Andy grinned . 
`` Yer see , '' said Sam , `` yer see , Andy , if any such thing should happen as that Mas ' r Haley 's horse should begin to act contrary , and cut up , you and I jist lets go of our 'n to help him , and we 'll help him -- oh yes ! '' 
And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders , and broke into a low , immoderate laugh , snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight . 
At this instant , Haley appeared on the verandah . 
Somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee , he came out smiling and talking , in tolerably restored humor . 
Sam and Andy , clawing for certain fragmentary palm-leaves , which they were in the habit of considering as hats , flew to the horseposts , to be ready to `` help Mas ` r. '' Sam 's palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid , as respects its brim ; and the slivers starting apart , and standing upright , gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance , quite equal to that of any Fejee chief ; while the whole brim of Andy 's being departed bodily , he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump , and looked about well pleased , as if to say , `` Who says I have n't got a hat ? '' 
`` Well , boys , '' said Haley , `` look alive now ; we must lose no time . '' 
`` Not a bit of him , Mas ` r ! '' 
said Sam , putting Haley 's rein in his hand , and holding his stirrup , while Andy was untying the other two horses . 
The instant Haley touched the saddle , the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring , that threw his master sprawling , some feet off , on the soft , dry turf . 
Sam , with frantic ejaculations , made a dive at the reins , but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm-leaf afore-named into the horse 's eyes , which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his nerves . 
So , with great vehemence , he overturned Sam , and , giving two or three contemptuous snorts , flourished his heels vigorously in the air , and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn , followed by Bill and Jerry , whom Andy had not failed to let loose , according to contract , speeding them off with various direful ejaculations . 
And now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion . 
Sam and Andy ran and shouted , -- dogs barked here and there , -- and Mike , Mose , Mandy , Fanny , and all the smaller specimens on the place , both male and female , raced , clapped hands , whooped , and shouted , with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal . 
Haley 's horse , which was a white one , and very fleet and spirited , appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto ; and having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent , gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland , he appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers to approach him , and then , when within a hand 's breadth , whisk off with a start and a snort , like a mischievous beast as he was and career far down into some alley of the wood-lot . 
Nothing was further from Sam 's mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him most befitting , -- and the exertions that he made were certainly most heroic . 
Like the sword of Coeur De Lion , which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle , Sam 's palm-leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught ; there he would bear down full tilt , shouting , `` Now for it ! 
cotch him ! 
cotch him ! '' 
in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment . 
Haley ran up and down , and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously . 
Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony , and Mrs. Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered , -- not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion . 
At last , about twelve o'clock , Sam appeared triumphant , mounted on Jerry , with Haley 's horse by his side , reeking with sweat , but with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils , showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided . 
`` He 's cotched ! '' 
he exclaimed , triumphantly . 
`` If ' t had n't been for me , they might a bust themselves , all on 'em ; but I cotched him ! '' 
`` You ! '' 
growled Haley , in no amiable mood . 
`` If it had n't been for you , this never would have happened . '' 
`` Lord bless us , Mas ` r , '' said Sam , in a tone of the deepest concern , `` and me that has been racin ' and chasin ' till the sweat jest pours off me ! '' 
`` Well , well ! '' 
said Haley , `` you 've lost me near three hours , with your cursed nonsense . 
Now let 's be off , and have no more fooling . '' 
`` Why , Mas ` r , '' said Sam , in a deprecating tone , `` I believe you mean to kill us all clar , horses and all . 
Here we are all just ready to drop down , and the critters all in a reek of sweat . 
Why , Mas ' r wo n't think of startin ' on now till arter dinner . 
Mas ` r 's hoss wants rubben down ; see how he splashed hisself ; and Jerry limps too ; do n't think Missis would be willin ' to have us start dis yer way , no how . 
Lord bless you , Mas ` r , we can ketch up , if we do stop . 
Lizy never was no great of a walker . '' 
Mrs. Shelby , who , greatly to her amusement , had overheard this conversation from the verandah , now resolved to do her part . 
She came forward , and , courteously expressing her concern for Haley 's accident , pressed him to stay to dinner , saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately . 
Thus , all things considered , Haley , with rather an equivocal grace , proceeded to the parlor , while Sam , rolling his eyes after him with unutterable meaning , proceeded gravely with the horses to the stable-yard . 
`` Did yer see him , Andy ? 
did yer see him ? '' 
said Sam , when he had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn , and fastened the horse to a post . 
`` O , Lor , if it war n't as good as a meetin ' , now , to see him a dancin ' and kickin ' and swarin ' at us . 
Did n't I hear him ? 
Swar away , ole fellow -LRB- says I to myself -RRB- ; will yer have yer hoss now , or wait till you cotch him ? 
-LRB- says I -RRB- . 
Lor , Andy , I think I can see him now . '' 
And Sam and Andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their hearts ' content . 
`` Yer oughter seen how mad he looked , when I brought the hoss up . 
Lord , he 'd a killed me , if he durs ' to ; and there I was a standin ' as innercent and as humble . '' 
`` Lor , I seed you , '' said Andy ; `` a n't you an old hoss , Sam ? '' 
`` Rather specks I am , '' said Sam ; `` did yer see Missis up stars at the winder ? 
I seed her laughin ' . '' 
`` I 'm sure , I was racin ' so , I did n't see nothing , '' said Andy . 
`` Well , yer see , '' said Sam , proceeding gravely to wash down Haley 's pony , `` I ` se ` quired what yer may call a habit o ' bobservation , Andy . 
It 's a very ` portant habit , Andy ; and I ` commend yer to be cultivatin ' it , now yer young . 
Hist up that hind foot , Andy . 
Yer see , Andy , it 's bobservation makes all de difference in niggers . 
Did n't I see which way the wind blew dis yer mornin ' ? 
Did n't I see what Missis wanted , though she never let on ? 
Dat ar 's bobservation , Andy . 
I ` spects it 's what you may call a faculty . 
Faculties is different in different peoples , but cultivation of 'em goes a great way . '' 
`` I guess if I had n't helped your bobservation dis mornin ' , yer would n't have seen your way so smart , '' said Andy . 
`` Andy , '' said Sam , `` you 's a promisin ' child , der a n't no manner o ' doubt . 
I thinks lots of yer , Andy ; and I do n't feel no ways ashamed to take idees from you . 
We oughtenter overlook nobody , Andy , cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes . 
And so , Andy , let 's go up to the house now . 
I 'll be boun ' Missis 'll give us an uncommon good bite , dis yer time . '' 
It is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than Eliza , when she turned her footsteps from Uncle Tom 's cabin . 
Her husband 's suffering and dangers , and the danger of her child , all blended in her mind , with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she was running , in leaving the only home she had ever known , and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered . 
Then there was the parting from every familiar object , -- the place where she had grown up , the trees under which she had played , the groves where she had walked many an evening in happier days , by the side of her young husband , -- everything , as it lay in the clear , frosty starlight , seemed to speak reproachfully to her , and ask her whither could she go from a home like that ? 
But stronger than all was maternal love , wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger . 
Her boy was old enough to have walked by her side , and , in an indifferent case , she would only have led him by the hand ; but now the bare thought of putting him out of her arms made her shudder , and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp , as she went rapidly forward . 
The frosty ground creaked beneath her feet , and she trembled at the sound ; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her heart , and quickened her footsteps . 
She wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her ; for she felt the weight of her boy as if it had been a feather , and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on , while from her pale lips burst forth , in frequent ejaculations , the prayer to a Friend above -- `` Lord , help ! 
Lord , save me ! '' 
If it were your Harry , mother , or your Willie , that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader , tomorrow morning , -- if you had seen the man , and heard that the papers were signed and delivered , and you had only from twelve o'clock till morning to make good your escape , -- how fast could you walk ? 
How many miles could you make in those few brief hours , with the darling at your bosom , -- the little sleepy head on your shoulder , -- the small , soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck ? 
For the child slept . 
At first , the novelty and alarm kept him waking ; but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound , and so assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him , that he clung quietly round her neck , only asking , as he found himself sinking to sleep , `` Mother , I do n't need to keep awake , do I ? '' 
`` No , my darling ; sleep , if you want to . '' 
`` But , mother , if I do get asleep , you wo n't let him get me ? '' 
`` No ! 
so may God help me ! '' 
said his mother , with a paler cheek , and a brighter light in her large dark eyes . 
`` You 're sure , a n't you , mother ? '' 
`` Yes , sure ! '' 
said the mother , in a voice that startled herself ; for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within , that was no part of her ; and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder , and was soon asleep . 
How the touch of those warm arms , the gentle breathings that came in her neck , seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements ! 
It seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams , from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping , confiding child . 
Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body , that , for a time , can make flesh and nerve impregnable , and string the sinews like steel , so that the weak become so mighty . 
The boundaries of the farm , the grove , the wood-lot , passed by her dizzily , as she walked on ; and still she went , leaving one familiar object after another , slacking not , pausing not , till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway . 
She had often been , with her mistress , to visit some connections , in the little village of T -- , not far from the Ohio river , and knew the road well . 
To go thither , to escape across the Ohio river , were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape ; beyond that , she could only hope in God . 
When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway , with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement , and which seems to be a sort of inspiration , she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion . 
She therefore put the boy on the ground , and , adjusting her dress and bonnet , she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances . 
In her little bundle she had provided a store of cakes and apples , which she used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child , rolling the apple some yards before them , when the boy would run with all his might after it ; and this ruse , often repeated , carried them over many a half-mile . 
After a while , they came to a thick patch of woodland , through which murmured a clear brook . 
As the child complained of hunger and thirst , she climbed over the fence with him ; and , sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road , she gave him a breakfast out of her little package . 
The boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat ; and when , putting his arms round her neck , he tried to wedge some of his cake into her mouth , it seemed to her that the rising in her throat would choke her . 
`` No , no , Harry darling ! 
mother ca n't eat till you are safe ! 
We must go on -- on -- till we come to the river ! '' 
And she hurried again into the road , and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward . 
She was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known . 
If she should chance to meet any who knew her , she reflected that the well-known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion , as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a fugitive . 
As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage , without a critical survey , and her child was white also , it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected . 
On this presumption , she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse , to rest herself , and buy some dinner for her child and self ; for , as the danger decreased with the distance , the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened , and she found herself both weary and hungry . 
The good woman , kindly and gossipping , seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with ; and accepted , without examination , Eliza 's statement , that she `` was going on a little piece , to spend a week with her friends , '' -- all which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true . 
An hour before sunset , she entered the village of T -- , by the Ohio river , weary and foot-sore , but still strong in heart . 
Her first glance was at the river , which lay , like Jordan , between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side . 
It was now early spring , and the river was swollen and turbulent ; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters . 
Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side , the land bending far out into the water , the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities , and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice , piled one cake over another , thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice , which lodged , and formed a great , undulating raft , filling up the whole river , and extending almost to the Kentucky shore . 
Eliza stood , for a moment , contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things , which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from running , and then turned into a small public house on the bank , to make a few inquiries . 
The hostess , who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire , preparatory to the evening meal , stopped , with a fork in her hand , as Eliza 's sweet and plaintive voice arrested her . 
`` What is it ? '' 
she said . 
`` Is n't there any ferry or boat , that takes people over to B -- , now ? '' 
she said . 
`` No , indeed ! '' 
said the woman ; `` the boats has stopped running . '' 
Eliza 's look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman , and she said , inquiringly , `` May be you 're wanting to get over ? 
-- anybody sick ? 
Ye seem mighty anxious ? '' 
`` I 've got a child that 's very dangerous , '' said Eliza . 
`` I never heard of it till last night , and I 've walked quite a piece today , in hopes to get to the ferry . '' 
`` Well , now , that 's onlucky , '' said the woman , whose motherly sympathies were much aroused ; `` I 'm re ` lly consarned for ye . 
Solomon ! '' 
she called , from the window , towards a small back building . 
A man , in leather apron and very dirty hands , appeared at the door . 
`` I say , Sol , '' said the woman , `` is that ar man going to tote them bar ` ls over tonight ? '' 
`` He said he should try , if ' t was any way prudent , '' said the man . 
`` There 's a man a piece down here , that 's going over with some truck this evening , if he durs ' to ; he 'll be in here to supper tonight , so you 'd better set down and wait . 
That 's a sweet little fellow , '' added the woman , offering him a cake . 
But the child , wholly exhausted , cried with weariness . 
`` Poor fellow ! 
he is n't used to walking , and I 've hurried him on so , '' said Eliza . 
`` Well , take him into this room , '' said the woman , opening into a small bed-room , where stood a comfortable bed . 
Eliza laid the weary boy upon it , and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep . 
For her there was no rest . 
As a fire in her bones , the thought of the pursuer urged her on ; and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen , surging waters that lay between her and liberty . 
Here we must take our leave of her for the present , to follow the course of her pursuers . 
Though Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table , yet it was soon seen , as the thing has often been seen before , that it required more than one to make a bargain . 
So , although the order was fairly given out in Haley 's hearing , and carried to Aunt Chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers , that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts , and tosses of her head , and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner . 
For some singular reason , an impression seemed to reign among the servants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay ; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly , to retard the course of things . 
One luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy ; and then gravy had to be got up de novo , with due care and formality , Aunt Chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision , answering shortly , to all suggestions of haste , that she `` war n't a going to have raw gravy on the table , to help nobody 's catchings . '' 
One tumbled down with the water , and had to go to the spring for more ; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events ; and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that `` Mas ' r Haley was mighty oneasy , and that he could n't sit in his cheer no ways , but was a walkin ' and stalkin ' to the winders and through the porch . '' 
`` Sarves him right ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , indignantly . 
`` He 'll get wus nor oneasy , one of these days , if he do n't mend his ways . 
His master 'll be sending for him , and then see how he 'll look ! '' 
`` He 'll go to torment , and no mistake , '' said little Jake . 
`` He desarves it ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe , grimly ; `` he 's broke a many , many , many hearts , -- I tell ye all ! '' 
she said , stopping , with a fork uplifted in her hands ; `` it 's like what Mas ' r George reads in Ravelations , -- souls a callin ' under the altar ! 
and a callin ' on the Lord for vengeance on sich ! 
-- and by and by the Lord he 'll hear 'em -- so he will ! '' 
Aunt Chloe , who was much revered in the kitchen , was listened to with open mouth ; and , the dinner being now fairly sent in , the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her , and to listen to her remarks . 
`` Sich 'll be burnt up forever , and no mistake ; wo n't ther ? '' 
said Andy . 
`` I 'd be glad to see it , I 'll be boun ' , '' said little Jake . 
`` Chil ` en ! '' 
said a voice , that made them all start . 
It was Uncle Tom , who had come in , and stood listening to the conversation at the door . 
`` Chil ` en ! '' 
he said , `` I 'm afeard you do n't know what ye 're sayin ' . 
Forever is a dre ` ful word , chil ` en ; it 's awful to think on ` t . 
You oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur . '' 
`` We would n't to anybody but the soul-drivers , '' said Andy ; `` nobody can help wishing it to them , they 's so awful wicked . '' 
`` Do n't natur herself kinder cry out on 'em ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe . 
`` Do n't dey tear der suckin ' baby right off his mother 's breast , and sell him , and der little children as is crying and holding on by her clothes , -- do n't dey pull 'em off and sells 'em ? 
Do n't dey tear wife and husband apart ? '' 
said Aunt Chloe , beginning to cry , `` when it 's jest takin ' the very life on 'em ? 
-- and all the while does they feel one bit , do n't dey drink and smoke , and take it oncommon easy ? 
Lor , if the devil do n't get them , what 's he good for ? '' 
And Aunt Chloe covered her face with her checked apron , and began to sob in good earnest . 
`` Pray for them that ` spitefully use you , the good book says , '' says Tom . 
`` Pray for 'em ! '' 
said Aunt Chloe ; `` Lor , it 's too tough ! 
I ca n't pray for 'em . '' 
`` It 's natur , Chloe , and natur 's strong , '' said Tom , `` but the Lord 's grace is stronger ; besides , you oughter think what an awful state a poor crittur 's soul 's in that 'll do them ar things , -- you oughter thank God that you a n't like him , Chloe . 
I 'm sure I 'd rather be sold , ten thousand times over , than to have all that ar poor crittur 's got to answer for . '' 
`` So 'd I , a heap , '' said Jake . 
`` Lor , should n't we cotch it , Andy ? '' 
Andy shrugged his shoulders , and gave an acquiescent whistle . 
`` I 'm glad Mas ' r did n't go off this morning , as he looked to , '' said Tom ; `` that ar hurt me more than sellin ' , it did . 
Mebbe it might have been natural for him , but ' t would have come desp ' t hard on me , as has known him from a baby ; but I 've seen Mas ` r , and I begin ter feel sort o ' reconciled to the Lord 's will now . 
Mas ' r could n't help hisself ; he did right , but I 'm feared things will be kinder goin ' to rack , when I 'm gone Mas ' r ca n't be spected to be a pryin ' round everywhar , as I 've done , a keepin ' up all the ends . 
The boys all means well , but they 's powerful car ` less . 
That ar troubles me . '' 
The bell here rang , and Tom was summoned to the parlor . 
`` Tom , '' said his master , kindly , `` I want you to notice that I give this gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the spot when he wants you ; he 's going today to look after his other business , and you can have the day to yourself . 
Go anywhere you like , boy . '' 
`` Thank you , Mas ` r , '' said Tom . 
`` And mind yourself , '' said the trader , `` and do n't come it over your master with any o ' yer nigger tricks ; for I 'll take every cent out of him , if you a n't thar . 
If he 'd hear to me , he would n't trust any on ye -- slippery as eels ! '' 
`` Mas ` r , '' said Tom , -- and he stood very straight , -- `` I was jist eight years old when ole Missis put you into my arms , and you was n't a year old . 
` Thar , ' says she , ` Tom , that 's to be your young Mas ` r ; take good care on him , ' says she . 
And now I jist ask you , Mas ` r , have I ever broke word to you , or gone contrary to you , ` specially since I was a Christian ? '' 
Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome , and the tears rose to his eyes . 
`` My good boy , '' said he , `` the Lord knows you say but the truth ; and if I was able to help it , all the world should n't buy you . ''
