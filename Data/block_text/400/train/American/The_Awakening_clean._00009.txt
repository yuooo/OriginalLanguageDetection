He had not stirred . 
She put her arms about his neck . 
`` Good-by , my sweet Robert . 
Tell me good-by . '' 
He kissed her with a degree of passion which had not before entered into his caress , and strained her to him . 
`` I love you , '' she whispered , `` only you ; no one but you . 
It was you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long , stupid dream . 
Oh ! 
you have made me so unhappy with your indifference . 
Oh ! 
I have suffered , suffered ! 
Now you are here we shall love each other , my Robert . 
We shall be everything to each other . 
Nothing else in the world is of any consequence . 
I must go to my friend ; but you will wait for me ? 
No matter how late ; you will wait for me , Robert ? '' 
`` Do n't go ; do n't go ! 
Oh ! 
Edna , stay with me , '' he pleaded . 
`` Why should you go ? 
Stay with me , stay with me . '' 
`` I shall come back as soon as I can ; I shall find you here . '' 
She buried her face in his neck , and said good-by again . 
Her seductive voice , together with his great love for her , had enthralled his senses , had deprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her . 
Edna looked in at the drug store . 
Monsieur Ratignolle was putting up a mixture himself , very carefully , dropping a red liquid into a tiny glass . 
He was grateful to Edna for having come ; her presence would be a comfort to his wife . 
Madame Ratignolle 's sister , who had always been with her at such trying times , had not been able to come up from the plantation , and Adele had been inconsolable until Mrs. Pontellier so kindly promised to come to her . 
The nurse had been with them at night for the past week , as she lived a great distance away . 
And Dr. Mandelet had been coming and going all the afternoon . 
They were then looking for him any moment . 
Edna hastened upstairs by a private stairway that led from the rear of the store to the apartments above . 
The children were all sleeping in a back room . 
Madame Ratignolle was in the salon , whither she had strayed in her suffering impatience . 
She sat on the sofa , clad in an ample white peignoir , holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a nervous clutch . 
Her face was drawn and pinched , her sweet blue eyes haggard and unnatural . 
All her beautiful hair had been drawn back and plaited . 
It lay in a long braid on the sofa pillow , coiled like a golden serpent . 
The nurse , a comfortable looking Griffe woman in white apron and cap , was urging her to return to her bedroom . 
`` There is no use , there is no use , '' she said at once to Edna . 
`` We must get rid of Mandelet ; he is getting too old and careless . 
He said he would be here at half-past seven ; now it must be eight . 
See what time it is , Josephine . '' 
The woman was possessed of a cheerful nature , and refused to take any situation too seriously , especially a situation with which she was so familiar . 
She urged Madame to have courage and patience . 
But Madame only set her teeth hard into her under lip , and Edna saw the sweat gather in beads on her white forehead . 
After a moment or two she uttered a profound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a ball . 
She appeared exhausted . 
The nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief , sprinkled with cologne water . 
`` This is too much ! '' 
she cried . 
`` Mandelet ought to be killed ! 
Where is Alphonse ? 
Is it possible I am to be abandoned like this -- neglected by every one ? '' 
`` Neglected , indeed ! '' 
exclaimed the nurse . 
Was n't she there ? 
And here was Mrs. Pontellier leaving , no doubt , a pleasant evening at home to devote to her ? 
And was n't Monsieur Ratignolle coming that very instant through the hall ? 
And Josephine was quite sure she had heard Doctor Mandelet 's coupe . 
Yes , there it was , down at the door . 
Adele consented to go back to her room . 
She sat on the edge of a little low couch next to her bed . 
Doctor Mandelet paid no attention to Madame Ratignolle 's upbraidings . 
He was accustomed to them at such times , and was too well convinced of her loyalty to doubt it . 
He was glad to see Edna , and wanted her to go with him into the salon and entertain him . 
But Madame Ratignolle would not consent that Edna should leave her for an instant . 
Between agonizing moments , she chatted a little , and said it took her mind off her sufferings . 
Edna began to feel uneasy . 
She was seized with a vague dread . 
Her own like experiences seemed far away , unreal , and only half remembered . 
She recalled faintly an ecstasy of pain , the heavy odor of chloroform , a stupor which had deadened sensation , and an awakening to find a little new life to which she had given being , added to the great unnumbered multitude of souls that come and go . 
She began to wish she had not come ; her presence was not necessary . 
She might have invented a pretext for staying away ; she might even invent a pretext now for going . 
But Edna did not go . 
With an inward agony , with a flaming , outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature , she witnessed the scene of torture . 
She was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned over her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by . 
Adele , pressing her cheek , whispered in an exhausted voice : `` Think of the children , Edna . 
Oh think of the children ! 
Remember them ! '' 
Edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air . 
The Doctor 's coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere . 
She did not wish to enter the coupe , and told Doctor Mandelet she would walk ; she was not afraid , and would go alone . 
He directed his carriage to meet him at Mrs. Pontellier 's , and he started to walk home with her . 
Up -- away up , over the narrow street between the tall houses , the stars were blazing . 
The air was mild and caressing , but cool with the breath of spring and the night . 
They walked slowly , the Doctor with a heavy , measured tread and his hands behind him ; Edna , in an absent-minded way , as she had walked one night at Grand Isle , as if her thoughts had gone ahead of her and she was striving to overtake them . 
`` You should n't have been there , Mrs. Pontellier , '' he said . 
`` That was no place for you . 
Adele is full of whims at such times . 
There were a dozen women she might have had with her , unimpressionable women . 
I felt that it was cruel , cruel . 
You should n't have gone . '' 
`` Oh , well ! '' 
she answered , indifferently . 
`` I do n't know that it matters after all . 
One has to think of the children some time or other ; the sooner the better . '' 
`` When is Leonce coming back ? '' 
`` Quite soon . 
Some time in March . '' 
`` And you are going abroad ? '' 
`` Perhaps -- no , I am not going . 
I 'm not going to be forced into doing things . 
I do n't want to go abroad . 
I want to be let alone . 
Nobody has any right -- except children , perhaps -- and even then , it seems to me -- or it did seem -- '' She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of her thoughts , and stopped abruptly . 
`` The trouble is , '' sighed the Doctor , grasping her meaning intuitively , `` that youth is given up to illusions . 
It seems to be a provision of Nature ; a decoy to secure mothers for the race . 
And Nature takes no account of moral consequences , of arbitrary conditions which we create , and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost . '' 
`` Yes , '' she said . 
`` The years that are gone seem like dreams -- if one might go on sleeping and dreaming -- but to wake up and find -- oh ! 
well ! 
perhaps it is better to wake up after all , even to suffer , rather than to remain a dupe to illusions all one 's life . '' 
`` It seems to me , my dear child , '' said the Doctor at parting , holding her hand , `` you seem to me to be in trouble . 
I am not going to ask for your confidence . 
I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to me , perhaps I might help you . 
I know I would understand . 
And I tell you there are not many who would -- not many , my dear . '' 
`` Some way I do n't feel moved to speak of things that trouble me . 
Do n't think I am ungrateful or that I do n't appreciate your sympathy . 
There are periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me . 
But I do n't want anything but my own way . 
That is wanting a good deal , of course , when you have to trample upon the lives , the hearts , the prejudices of others -- but no matter -- still , I should n't want to trample upon the little lives . 
Oh ! 
I do n't know what I 'm saying , Doctor . 
Good night . 
Do n't blame me for anything . '' 
`` Yes , I will blame you if you do n't come and see me soon . 
We will talk of things you never have dreamt of talking about before . 
It will do us both good . 
I do n't want you to blame yourself , whatever comes . 
Good night , my child . '' 
She let herself in at the gate , but instead of entering she sat upon the step of the porch . 
The night was quiet and soothing . 
All the tearing emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a somber , uncomfortable garment , which she had but to loosen to be rid of . 
She went back to that hour before Adele had sent for her ; and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert 's words , the pressure of his arms , and the feeling of his lips upon her own . 
She could picture at that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one . 
His expression of love had already given him to her in part . 
When she thought that he was there at hand , waiting for her , she grew numb with the intoxication of expectancy . 
It was so late ; he would be asleep perhaps . 
She would awaken him with a kiss . 
She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with her caresses . 
Still , she remembered Adele 's voice whispering , `` Think of the children ; think of them . '' 
She meant to think of them ; that determination had driven into her soul like a death wound -- but not to-night . 
To-morrow would be time to think of everything . 
Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor . 
He was nowhere at hand . 
The house was empty . 
But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight : `` I love you . 
Good-by -- because I love you . '' 
Edna grew faint when she read the words . 
She went and sat on the sofa . 
Then she stretched herself out there , never uttering a sound . 
She did not sleep . 
She did not go to bed . 
The lamp sputtered and went out . 
She was still awake in the morning , when Celestine unlocked the kitchen door and came in to light the fire . 
Victor , with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling , was patching a corner of one of the galleries . 
Mariequita sat near by , dangling her legs , watching him work , and handing him nails from the tool-box . 
The sun was beating down upon them . 
The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad . 
They had been talking for an hour or more . 
She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs. Pontellier 's . 
He exaggerated every detail , making it appear a veritable Lucullean feast . 
The flowers were in tubs , he said . 
The champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets . 
Venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier , blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board , while the other women were all of them youthful houris , possessed of incomparable charms . 
She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier , and he gave her evasive answers , framed so as to confirm her belief . 
She grew sullen and cried a little , threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies . 
There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere ; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people , why , she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina 's husband . 
Celina 's husband was a fool , a coward , and a pig , and to prove it to her , Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him . 
This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita . 
She dried her eyes , and grew cheerful at the prospect . 
They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house . 
The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition . 
But it was really she in flesh and blood , looking tired and a little travel-stained . 
`` I walked up from the wharf , '' she said , `` and heard the hammering . 
I supposed it was you , mending the porch . 
It 's a good thing . 
I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer . 
How dreary and deserted everything looks ! '' 
It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet 's lugger , that she had come alone , and for no purpose but to rest . 
`` There 's nothing fixed up yet , you see . 
I 'll give you my room ; it 's the only place . '' 
`` Any corner will do , '' she assured him . 
`` And if you can stand Philomel 's cooking , '' he went on , `` though I might try to get her mother while you are here . 
Do you think she would come ? '' 
turning to Mariequita . 
Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel 's mother might come for a few days , and money enough . 
Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance , the girl had at once suspected a lovers ' rendezvous . 
But Victor 's astonishment was so genuine , and Mrs. Pontellier 's indifference so apparent , that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain . 
She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America , and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet . 
`` What time will you have dinner ? '' 
asked Edna . 
`` I 'm very hungry ; but do n't get anything extra . '' 
`` I 'll have it ready in little or no time , '' he said , bustling and packing away his tools . 
`` You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself . 
Mariequita will show you . '' 
`` Thank you , '' said Edna . 
`` But , do you know , I have a notion to go down to the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim , before dinner ? '' 
`` The water is too cold ! '' 
they both exclaimed . 
`` Do n't think of it . '' 
`` Well , I might go down and try -- dip my toes in . 
Why , it seems to me the sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean . 
Could you get me a couple of towels ? 
I 'd better go right away , so as to be back in time . 
It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this afternoon . '' 
Mariequita ran over to Victor 's room , and returned with some towels , which she gave to Edna . 
`` I hope you have fish for dinner , '' said Edna , as she started to walk away ; `` but do n't do anything extra if you have n't . '' 
`` Run and find Philomel 's mother , '' Victor instructed the girl . 
`` I 'll go to the kitchen and see what I can do . 
By Gimminy ! 
Women have no consideration ! 
She might have sent me word . '' 
Edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically , not noticing anything special except that the sun was hot . 
She was not dwelling upon any particular train of thought . 
She had done all the thinking which was necessary after Robert went away , when she lay awake upon the sofa till morning . 
She had said over and over to herself : `` To-day it is Arobin ; to-morrow it will be some one else . 
It makes no difference to me , it does n't matter about Leonce Pontellier -- but Raoul and Etienne ! '' 
She understood now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Adele Ratignolle that she would give up the unessential , but she would never sacrifice herself for her children . 
Despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night , and had never lifted . 
There was no one thing in the world that she desired . 
There was no human being whom she wanted near her except Robert ; and she even realized that the day would come when he , too , and the thought of him would melt out of her existence , leaving her alone . 
The children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her ; who had overpowered and sought to drag her into the soul 's slavery for the rest of her days . 
But she knew a way to elude them . 
She was not thinking of these things when she walked down to the beach . 
The water of the Gulf stretched out before her , gleaming with the million lights of the sun . 
The voice of the sea is seductive , never ceasing , whispering , clamoring , murmuring , inviting the soul to wander in abysses of solitude . 
All along the white beach , up and down , there was no living thing in sight . 
A bird with a broken wing was beating the air above , reeling , fluttering , circling disabled down , down to the water . 
Edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging , faded , upon its accustomed peg . 
She put it on , leaving her clothing in the bath-house . 
But when she was there beside the sea , absolutely alone , she cast the unpleasant , pricking garments from her , and for the first time in her life she stood naked in the open air , at the mercy of the sun , the breeze that beat upon her , and the waves that invited her . 
How strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky ! 
how delicious ! 
She felt like some new-born creature , opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had never known . 
The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet , and coiled like serpents about her ankles . 
She walked out . 
The water was chill , but she walked on . 
The water was deep , but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long , sweeping stroke . 
The touch of the sea is sensuous , enfolding the body in its soft , close embrace . 
She went on and on . 
She remembered the night she swam far out , and recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore . 
She did not look back now , but went on and on , thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child , believing that it had no beginning and no end . 
Her arms and legs were growing tired . 
She thought of Leonce and the children . 
They were a part of her life . 
But they need not have thought that they could possess her , body and soul . 
How Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed , perhaps sneered , if she knew ! 
`` And you call yourself an artist ! 
What pretensions , Madame ! 
The artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies . '' 
Exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her . 
`` Good-by -- because I love you . '' 
He did not know ; he did not understand . 
He would never understand . 
Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have understood if she had seen him -- but it was too late ; the shore was far behind her , and her strength was gone . 
She looked into the distance , and the old terror flamed up for an instant , then sank again . 
Edna heard her father 's voice and her sister Margaret 's . 
She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree . 
The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch . 
There was the hum of bees , and the musky odor of pinks filled the air . 
The bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La Folle 's cabin stood . 
Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned field , where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with water enough . 
Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line , and past this circle she never stepped . 
This was the form of her only mania . 
She was now a large , gaunt black woman , past thirty-five . 
Her real name was Jacqueline , but every one on the plantation called her La Folle , because in childhood she had been frightened literally `` out of her senses , '' and had never wholly regained them . 
It was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in the woods . 
Evening was near when P'tit Maitre , black with powder and crimson with blood , had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline 's mother , his pursuers close at his heels . 
The sight had stunned her childish reason . 
She dwelt alone in her solitary cabin , for the rest of the quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge . 
She had more physical strength than most men , and made her patch of cotton and corn and tobacco like the best of them . 
But of the world beyond the bayou she had long known nothing , save what her morbid fancy conceived . 
People at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way , and they thought nothing of it . 
Even when `` Old Mis ' '' died , they did not wonder that La Folle had not crossed the bayou , but had stood upon her side of it , wailing and lamenting . 
P'tit Maitre was now the owner of Bellissime . 
He was a middle-aged man , with a family of beautiful daughters about him , and a little son whom La Folle loved as if he had been her own . 
She called him Cheri , and so did every one else because she did . 
None of the girls had ever been to her what Cheri was . 
They had each and all loved to be with her , and to listen to her wondrous stories of things that always happened `` yonda , beyon ' de bayou . '' 
But none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Cheri did , nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly , nor fallen asleep in her arms as he used to do . 
For Cheri hardly did such things now , since he had become the proud possessor of a gun , and had had his black curls cut off . 
That summer -- the summer Cheri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a knot of red ribbon -- the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot , and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river . 
La Folle was sorry when they were gone , for she loved these dumb companions well , and liked to feel that they were there , and to hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure . 
It was Saturday afternoon , when the fields were deserted . 
The men had flocked to a neighboring village to do their week 's trading , and the women were occupied with household affairs , -- La Folle as well as the others . 
It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes , scoured her house , and did her baking . 
In this last employment she never forgot Cheri . 
To-day she had fashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for him . 
So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with his gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder , she called out gayly to him , `` Cheri ! 
Cheri ! '' 
But Cheri did not need the summons , for he was coming straight to her . 
His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given that day up at his father 's house . 
He was a sunny-faced youngster of ten . 
When he had emptied his pockets , La Folle patted his round red cheek , wiped his soiled hands on her apron , and smoothed his hair . 
Then she watched him as , with his cakes in his hand , he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin , and disappeared into the wood . 
He had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there . 
`` You think they got plenty deer in the wood , La Folle ? '' 
he had inquired , with the calculating air of an experienced hunter . 
`` Non , non ! '' 
the woman laughed . 
`` Do n't you look fo ' no deer , Cheri . 
Dat 's too big . 
But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo ' her dinner to-morrow , an ' she goin ' be satisfi ' . '' 
`` One squirrel ai n't a bite . 
I 'll bring you mo ' ` an one , La Folle , '' he had boasted pompously as he went away . 
When the woman , an hour later , heard the report of the boy 's rifle close to the wood 's edge , she would have thought nothing of it if a sharp cry of distress had not followed the sound . 
She withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been plunged , dried them upon her apron , and as quickly as her trembling limbs would bear her , hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had come . 
It was as she feared . 
There she found Cheri stretched upon the ground , with his rifle beside him . 
He moaned piteously : -- `` I 'm dead , La Folle ! 
I 'm dead ! 
I 'm gone ! '' 
`` Non , non ! '' 
she exclaimed resolutely , as she knelt beside him . 
`` Put you ' arm ` roun ' La Folle 's nake , Cheri . 
Dat 's nuttin ' ; dat goin ' be nuttin ' . '' 
She lifted him in her powerful arms . 
Cheri had carried his gun muzzle-downward . 
He had stumbled , -- he did not know how . 
He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg , and he thought that his end was at hand . 
Now , with his head upon the woman 's shoulder , he moaned and wept with pain and fright . 
`` Oh , La Folle ! 
La Folle ! 
it hurt so bad ! 
I can ' stan ' it , La Folle ! '' 
`` Do n't cry , mon bebe , mon bebe , mon Cheri ! '' 
the woman spoke soothingly as she covered the ground with long strides . 
`` La Folle goin ' mine you ; Doctor Bonfils goin ' come make mon Cheri well agin . '' 
She had reached the abandoned field . 
As she crossed it with her precious burden , she looked constantly and restlessly from side to side . 
A terrible fear was upon her , -- the fear of the world beyond the bayou , the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood . 
When she was at the bayou 's edge she stood there , and shouted for help as if a life depended upon it : -- `` Oh , P'tit Maitre ! 
P'tit Maitre ! 
Venez donc ! 
Au secours ! 
Au secours ! '' 
No voice responded . 
Cheri 's hot tears were scalding her neck . 
She called for each and every one upon the place , and still no answer came . 
She shouted , she wailed ; but whether her voice remained unheard or unheeded , no reply came to her frenzied cries . 
And all the while Cheri moaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his mother . 
La Folle gave a last despairing look around her . 
Extreme terror was upon her . 
She clasped the child close against her breast , where he could feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer . 
Then shutting her eyes , she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou , and never stopped till she had climbed the opposite shore . 
She stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes . 
Then she plunged into the footpath through the trees . 
She spoke no more to Cheri , but muttered constantly , `` Bon Dieu , ayez pitie La Folle ! 
Bon Dieu , ayez pitie moi ! '' 
Instinct seemed to guide her . 
When the pathway spread clear and smooth enough before her , she again closed her eyes tightly against the sight of that unknown and terrifying world . 
A child , playing in some weeds , caught sight of her as she neared the quarters . 
The little one uttered a cry of dismay . 
`` La Folle ! '' 
she screamed , in her piercing treble . 
`` La Folle done cross de bayer ! '' 
Quickly the cry passed down the line of cabins . 
`` Yonda , La Folle done cross de bayou ! '' 
Children , old men , old women , young ones with infants in their arms , flocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring spectacle . 
Most of them shuddered with superstitious dread of what it might portend . 
`` She totin ' Cheri ! '' 
some of them shouted . 
Some of the more daring gathered about her , and followed at her heels , only to fall back with new terror when she turned her distorted face upon them . 
Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a white foam on her black lips . 
Some one had run ahead of her to where P'tit Maitre sat with his family and guests upon the gallery . 
`` P'tit Maitre ! 
La Folle done cross de bayou ! 
Look her ! 
Look her yonda totin ' Cheri ! '' 
This startling intimation was the first which they had of the woman 's approach . 
She was now near at hand . 
She walked with long strides . 
Her eyes were fixed desperately before her , and she breathed heavily , as a tired ox . 
At the foot of the stairway , which she could not have mounted , she laid the boy in his father 's arms . 
Then the world that had looked red to La Folle suddenly turned black , -- like that day she had seen powder and blood . 
She reeled for an instant . 
Before a sustaining arm could reach her , she fell heavily to the ground . 
When La Folle regained consciousness , she was at home again , in her own cabin and upon her own bed . 
The moon rays , streaming in through the open door and windows , gave what light was needed to the old black mammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs . 
It was very late . 
Others who had come , and found that the stupor clung to her , had gone again . 
P'tit Maitre had been there , and with him Doctor Bonfils , who said that La Folle might die . 
But death had passed her by . 
The voice was very clear and steady with which she spoke to Tante Lizette , brewing her tisane there in a corner . 
`` Ef you will give me one good drink tisane , Tante Lizette , I b ` lieve I 'm goin ' sleep , me . '' 
And she did sleep ; so soundly , so healthfully , that old Lizette without compunction stole softly away , to creep back through the moonlit fields to her own cabin in the new quarters . 
The first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle . 
She arose , calmly , as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her existence but yesterday . 
She donned her new blue cottonade and white apron , for she remembered that this was Sunday . 
When she had made for herself a cup of strong black coffee , and drunk it with relish , she quitted the cabin and walked across the old familiar field to the bayou 's edge again . 
She did not stop there as she had always done before , but crossed with a long , steady stride as if she had done this all her life . 
When she had made her way through the brush and scrub cottonwood-trees that lined the opposite bank , she found herself upon the border of a field where the white , bursting cotton , with the dew upon it , gleamed for acres and acres like frosted silver in the early dawn . 
La Folle drew a long , deep breath as she gazed across the country . 
She walked slowly and uncertainly , like one who hardly knows how , looking about her as she went . 
The cabins , that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue her , were quiet now . 
No one was yet astir at Bellissime . 
Only the birds that darted here and there from hedges were awake , and singing their matins .
