`` Drawers , socks , slippers would be a comfort , '' said the Unseen , curtly . 
`` And food . '' 
`` Anything . 
But this is the insanest thing I ever was in , in my life ! '' 
He turned out his drawers for the articles , and then went downstairs to ransack his larder . 
He came back with some cold cutlets and bread , pulled up a light table , and placed them before his guest . 
`` Never mind knives , '' said his visitor , and a cutlet hung in mid-air , with a sound of gnawing . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
said Kemp , and sat down on a bedroom chair . 
`` I always like to get something about me before I eat , '' said the Invisible Man , with a full mouth , eating greedily . 
`` Queer fancy ! '' 
`` I suppose that wrist is all right , '' said Kemp . 
`` Trust me , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Of all the strange and wonderful -- '' `` Exactly . 
But it 's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging . 
My first stroke of luck ! 
Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night . 
You must stand that ! 
It 's a filthy nuisance , my blood showing , is n't it ? 
Quite a clot over there . 
Gets visible as it coagulates , I see . 
It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive ... . 
I 've been in the house three hours . '' 
`` But how 's it done ? '' 
began Kemp , in a tone of exasperation . 
`` Confound it ! 
The whole business -- it 's unreasonable from beginning to end . '' 
`` Quite reasonable , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Perfectly reasonable . '' 
He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle . 
Kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown . 
A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder , made a triangle of light under the left ribs . 
`` What were the shots ? '' 
he asked . 
`` How did the shooting begin ? '' 
`` There was a real fool of a man -- a sort of confederate of mine -- curse him ! 
-- who tried to steal my money . 
Has done so . '' 
`` Is he invisible too ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Ca n't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that ? 
I 'm hungry -- in pain . 
And you want me to tell stories ! '' 
Kemp got up . '' 
You did n't do any shooting ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Not me , '' said his visitor . 
`` Some fool I 'd never seen fired at random . 
A lot of them got scared . 
They all got scared at me . 
Curse them ! 
-- I say -- I want more to eat than this , Kemp . '' 
`` I 'll see what there is to eat downstairs , '' said Kemp . 
`` Not much , I 'm afraid . '' 
After he had done eating , and he made a heavy meal , the Invisible Man demanded a cigar . 
He bit the end savagely before Kemp could find a knife , and cursed when the outer leaf loosened . 
It was strange to see him smoking ; his mouth , and throat , pharynx and nares , became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast . 
`` This blessed gift of smoking ! '' 
he said , and puffed vigorously . 
`` I 'm lucky to have fallen upon you , Kemp . 
You must help me . 
Fancy tumbling on you just now ! 
I 'm in a devilish scrape -- I 've been mad , I think . 
The things I have been through ! 
But we will do things yet . 
Let me tell you -- '' He helped himself to more whiskey and soda . 
Kemp got up , looked about him , and fetched a glass from his spare room . 
`` It 's wild -- but I suppose I may drink . '' 
`` You have n't changed much , Kemp , these dozen years . 
You fair men do n't . 
Cool and methodical -- after the first collapse . 
I must tell you . 
We will work together ! '' 
`` But how was it all done ? '' 
said Kemp , `` and how did you get like this ? '' 
`` For God 's sake , let me smoke in peace for a little while ! 
And then I will begin to tell you . '' 
But the story was not told that night . 
The Invisible Man 's wrist was growing painful ; he was feverish , exhausted , and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn . 
He spoke in fragments of Marvel , he smoked faster , his voice grew angry . 
Kemp tried to gather what he could . 
`` He was afraid of me , I could see that he was afraid of me , '' said the Invisible Man many times over . 
`` He meant to give me the slip -- he was always casting about ! 
What a fool I was ! 
`` The cur ! 
`` I should have killed him ! '' 
`` Where did you get the money ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
The Invisible Man was silent for a space . 
`` I ca n't tell you to-night , '' he said . 
He groaned suddenly and leant forward , supporting his invisible head on invisible hands . 
`` Kemp , '' he said , `` I 've had no sleep for near three days , except a couple of dozes of an hour or so . 
I must sleep soon . '' 
`` Well , have my room -- have this room . '' 
`` But how can I sleep ? 
If I sleep -- he will get away . 
Ugh ! 
What does it matter ? '' 
`` What 's the shot wound ? '' 
asked Kemp , abruptly . 
`` Nothing -- scratch and blood . 
Oh , God ! 
How I want sleep ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
The Invisible Man appeared to be regarding Kemp . 
`` Because I 've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men , '' he said slowly . 
Kemp started . 
`` Fool that I am ! '' 
said the Invisible Man , striking the table smartly . 
`` I 've put the idea into your head . '' 
Exhausted and wounded as the Invisible Man was , he refused to accept Kemp 's word that his freedom should be respected . 
He examined the two windows of the bedroom , drew up the blinds and opened the sashes , to confirm Kemp 's statement that a retreat by them would be possible . 
Outside the night was very quiet and still , and the new moon was setting over the down . 
Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors , to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom . 
Finally he expressed himself satisfied . 
He stood on the hearth rug and Kemp heard the sound of a yawn . 
`` I 'm sorry , '' said the Invisible Man , `` if I can not tell you all that I have done to-night . 
But I am worn out . 
It 's grotesque , no doubt . 
It 's horrible ! 
But believe me , Kemp , in spite of your arguments of this morning , it is quite a possible thing . 
I have made a discovery . 
I meant to keep it to myself . 
I ca n't . 
I must have a partner . 
And you ... . 
We can do such things ... But to-morrow . 
Now , Kemp , I feel as though I must sleep or perish . '' 
Kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment . 
`` I suppose I must leave you , '' he said . 
`` It 's -- incredible . 
Three things happening like this , overturning all my preconceptions -- would make me insane . 
But it 's real ! 
Is there anything more that I can get you ? '' 
`` Only bid me good-night , '' said Griffin . 
`` Good-night , '' said Kemp , and shook an invisible hand . 
He walked sideways to the door . 
Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him . 
`` Understand me ! '' 
said the dressing-gown . 
`` No attempts to hamper me , or capture me ! 
Or -- '' Kemp 's face changed a little . 
`` I thought I gave you my word , '' he said . 
Kemp closed the door softly behind him , and the key was turned upon him forthwith . 
Then , as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face , the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked . 
Kemp slapped his brow with his hand . 
`` Am I dreaming ? 
Has the world gone mad -- or have I ? '' 
He laughed , and put his hand to the locked door . 
`` Barred out of my own bedroom , by a flagrant absurdity ! '' 
he said . 
He walked to the head of the staircase , turned , and stared at the locked doors . 
`` It 's fact , '' he said . 
He put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck . 
`` Undeniable fact ! 
`` But -- '' He shook his head hopelessly , turned , and went downstairs . 
He lit the dining-room lamp , got out a cigar , and began pacing the room , ejaculating . 
Now and then he would argue with himself . 
`` Invisible ! '' 
he said . 
`` Is there such a thing as an invisible animal ? 
... In the sea , yes . 
Thousands -- millions . 
All the larvae , all the little nauplii and tornarias , all the microscopic things , the jelly-fish . 
In the sea there are more things invisible than visible ! 
I never thought of that before . 
And in the ponds too ! 
All those little pond-life things -- specks of colourless translucent jelly ! 
But in air ? 
No ! 
`` It ca n't be . 
`` But after all -- why not ? 
`` If a man was made of glass he would still be visible . '' 
His meditation became profound . 
The bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again . 
Then it was merely an exclamation . 
He turned aside , walked out of the room , and went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there . 
It was a little room , because Dr. Kemp did not live by practice , and in it were the day 's newspapers . 
The morning 's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside . 
He caught it up , turned it over , and read the account of a `` Strange Story from Iping '' that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to Mr. Marvel . 
Kemp read it swiftly . 
`` Wrapped up ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` Disguised ! 
Hiding it ! 
` No one seems to have been aware of his misfortune . ' 
What the devil is his game ? '' 
He dropped the paper , and his eye went seeking . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he said , and caught up the St. James ' Gazette , lying folded up as it arrived . 
`` Now we shall get at the truth , '' said Dr. Kemp . 
He rent the paper open ; a couple of columns confronted him . 
`` An Entire Village in Sussex goes Mad '' was the heading . 
`` Good Heavens ! '' 
said Kemp , reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in Iping , of the previous afternoon , that have already been described . 
Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted . 
He re-read it . 
`` Ran through the streets striking right and left . 
Jaffers insensible . 
Mr. Huxter in great pain -- still unable to describe what he saw . 
Painful humiliation -- vicar . 
Woman ill with terror ! 
Windows smashed . 
This extraordinary story probably a fabrication . 
Too good not to print -- cum grano ! '' 
He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him . 
`` Probably a fabrication ! '' 
He caught up the paper again , and re-read the whole business . 
`` But when does the Tramp come in ? 
Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp ? '' 
He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench . 
`` He 's not only invisible , '' he said , `` but he 's mad ! 
Homicidal ! '' 
When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room , Kemp was still pacing up and down , trying to grasp the incredible . 
He was altogether too excited to sleep . 
His servants , descending sleepily , discovered him , and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill on him . 
He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere study -- and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor . 
Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning 's paper came . 
That had much to say and little to tell , beyond the confirmation of the evening before , and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock . 
This gave Kemp the essence of the happenings at the `` Jolly Cricketers , '' and the name of Marvel . 
`` He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours , '' Marvel testified . 
Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story , notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire . 
But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp ; for Mr. Marvel had supplied no information about the three books , or the money with which he was lined . 
The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter . 
Kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get every one of the morning papers she could . 
These also he devoured . 
`` He is invisible ! '' 
he said . 
`` And it reads like rage growing to mania ! 
The things he may do ! 
The things he may do ! 
And he 's upstairs free as the air . 
What on earth ought I to do ? '' 
`` For instance , would it be a breach of faith if -- ? 
No . '' 
He went to a little untidy desk in the corner , and began a note . 
He tore this up half written , and wrote another . 
He read it over and considered it . 
Then he took an envelope and addressed it to `` Colonel Adye , Port Burdock . '' 
The Invisible Man awoke even as Kemp was doing this . 
He awoke in an evil temper , and Kemp , alert for every sound , heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead . 
Then a chair was flung over and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed . 
Kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Kemp , when the Invisible Man admitted him . 
`` Nothing , '' was the answer . 
`` But , confound it ! 
The smash ? '' 
`` Fit of temper , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Forgot this arm ; and it 's sore . '' 
`` You 're rather liable to that sort of thing . '' 
`` I am . '' 
Kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass . 
`` All the facts are out about you , '' said Kemp , standing up with the glass in his hand ; `` all that happened in Iping , and down the hill . 
The world has become aware of its invisible citizen . 
But no one knows you are here . '' 
The Invisible Man swore . 
`` The secret 's out . 
I gather it was a secret . 
I do n't know what your plans are , but of course I 'm anxious to help you . '' 
The Invisible Man sat down on the bed . 
`` There 's breakfast upstairs , '' said Kemp , speaking as easily as possible , and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly . 
Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere . 
`` Before we can do anything else , '' said Kemp , `` I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours . '' 
He had sat down , after one nervous glance out of the window , with the air of a man who has talking to do . 
His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the breakfast-table -- a headless , handless dressing-gown , wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette . 
`` It 's simple enough -- and credible enough , '' said Griffin , putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand . 
`` No doubt , to you , but -- '' Kemp laughed . 
`` Well , yes ; to me it seemed wonderful at first , no doubt . 
But now , great God ! 
... But we will do great things yet ! 
I came on the stuff first at Chesilstowe . '' 
`` Chesilstowe ? '' 
`` I went there after I left London . 
You know I dropped medicine and took up physics ? 
No ; well , I did . 
Light fascinated me . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` Optical density ! 
The whole subject is a network of riddles -- a network with solutions glimmering elusively through . 
And being but two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm , I said , ' I will devote my life to this . 
This is worth while . ' 
You know what fools we are at two-and-twenty ? '' 
`` Fools then or fools now , '' said Kemp . 
`` As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man ! 
`` But I went to work -- like a slave . 
And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly -- blindingly ! 
I found a general principle of pigments and refraction -- a formula , a geometrical expression involving four dimensions . 
Fools , common men , even common mathematicians , do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics . 
In the books -- the books that tramp has hidden -- there are marvels , miracles ! 
But this was not a method , it was an idea , that might lead to a method by which it would be possible , without changing any other property of matter -- except , in some instances colours -- to lower the refractive index of a substance , solid or liquid , to that of air -- so far as all practical purposes are concerned . '' 
`` Phew ! '' 
said Kemp . 
`` That 's odd ! 
But still I do n't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone , but personal invisibility is a far cry . '' 
`` Precisely , '' said Griffin . 
`` But consider , visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light . 
Either a body absorbs light , or it reflects or refracts it , or does all these things . 
If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light , it can not of itself be visible . 
You see an opaque red box , for instance , because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest , all the red part of the light , to you . 
If it did not absorb any particular part of the light , but reflected it all , then it would be a shining white box . 
Silver ! 
A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface , but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted , so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies -- a sort of skeleton of light . 
A glass box would not be so brilliant , nor so clearly visible , as a diamond box , because there would be less refraction and reflection . 
See that ? 
From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it . 
Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others , a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass . 
A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light , because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little . 
And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water , still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water , it would vanish almost altogether , because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way . 
It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air . 
And for precisely the same reason ! '' 
`` Yes , '' said Kemp , `` that is pretty plain sailing . '' 
`` And here is another fact you will know to be true . 
If a sheet of glass is smashed , Kemp , and beaten into a powder , it becomes much more visible while it is in the air ; it becomes at last an opaque white powder . 
This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur . 
In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces ; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through , and very little gets right through the powder . 
But if the white powdered glass is put into water , it forthwith vanishes . 
The powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index ; that is , the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other . 
`` You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index ; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index . 
And if you will consider only a second , you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air , if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air ; for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air . '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' said Kemp . 
`` But a man 's not powdered glass ! '' 
`` No , '' said Griffin . 
`` He 's more transparent ! '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
`` That from a doctor ! 
How one forgets ! 
Have you already forgotten your physics , in ten years ? 
Just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so . 
Paper , for instance , is made up of transparent fibres , and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque . 
Oil white paper , fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces , and it becomes as transparent as glass . 
And not only paper , but cotton fibre , linen fibre , wool fibre , woody fibre , and bone , Kemp , flesh , Kemp , hair , Kemp , nails and nerves , Kemp , in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair , are all made up of transparent , colourless tissue . 
So little suffices to make us visible one to the other . 
For the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water . '' 
`` Great Heavens ! '' 
cried Kemp . 
`` Of course , of course ! 
I was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish ! '' '' 
Now you have me ! 
And all that I knew and had in mind a year after I left London -- six years ago . 
But I kept it to myself . 
I had to do my work under frightful disadvantages . 
Oliver , my professor , was a scientific bounder , a journalist by instinct , a thief of ideas -- he was always prying ! 
And you know the knavish system of the scientific world . 
I simply would not publish , and let him share my credit . 
I went on working ; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment , a reality . 
I told no living soul , because I meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow . 
I took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps . 
And suddenly , not by design but by accident , I made a discovery in physiology . '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` You know the red colouring matter of blood ; it can be made white -- colourless -- and remain with all the functions it has now ! '' 
Kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement . 
The Invisible Man rose and began pacing the little study . 
`` You may well exclaim . 
I remember that night . 
It was late at night -- in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping , silly students -- and I worked then sometimes till dawn . 
It came suddenly , splendid and complete in my mind . 
I was alone ; the laboratory was still , with the tall lights burning brightly and silently . 
In all my great moments I have been alone . 
` One could make an animal -- a tissue -- transparent ! 
One could make it invisible ! 
All except the pigments -- I could be invisible ! ' 
I said , suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge . 
It was overwhelming . 
I left the filtering I was doing , and went and stared out of the great window at the stars . ' 
I could be invisible ! ' 
I repeated . 
`` To do such a thing would be to transcend magic . 
And I beheld , unclouded by doubt , a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man -- the mystery , the power , the freedom . 
Drawbacks I saw none . 
You have only to think ! 
And I , a shabby , poverty-struck , hemmed-in demonstrator , teaching fools in a provincial college , might suddenly become -- this . 
I ask you , Kemp if you ... Anyone , I tell you , would have flung himself upon that research . 
And I worked three years , and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its summit . 
The infinite details ! 
And the exasperation ! 
A professor , a provincial professor , always prying . 
` When are you going to publish this work of yours ? ' 
was his everlasting question . 
And the students , the cramped means ! 
Three years I had of it -- `` And after three years of secrecy and exasperation , I found that to complete it was impossible -- impossible . '' 
`` How ? '' 
asked Kemp . 
`` Money , '' said the Invisible Man , and went again to stare out of the window . 
He turned around abruptly . 
`` I robbed the old man -- robbed my father . 
`` The money was not his , and he shot himself . '' 
For a moment Kemp sat in silence , staring at the back of the headless figure at the window . 
Then he started , struck by a thought , rose , took the Invisible Man 's arm , and turned him away from the outlook . 
`` You are tired , '' he said , `` and while I sit , you walk about . 
Have my chair . '' 
He placed himself between Griffin and the nearest window . 
For a space Griffin sat silent , and then he resumed abruptly : `` I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already , '' he said , `` when that happened . 
It was last December . 
I had taken a room in London , a large unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near Great Portland Street . 
The room was soon full of the appliances I had bought with his money ; the work was going on steadily , successfully , drawing near an end . 
I was like a man emerging from a thicket , and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy . 
I went to bury him . 
My mind was still on this research , and I did not lift a finger to save his character .
