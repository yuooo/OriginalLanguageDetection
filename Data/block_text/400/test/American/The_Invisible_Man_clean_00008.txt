cried one , and ` Stop there ! ' 
shouted the other . 
I dashed around a corner and came full tilt -- a faceless figure , mind you ! 
-- on a lanky lad of fifteen . 
He yelled and I bowled him over , rushed past him , turned another corner , and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter . 
In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , ` All hands to the doors ! ' 
asking what was ` up , ' and giving one another advice how to catch me . 
`` Lying on the ground , I felt scared out of my wits . 
But -- odd as it may seem -- it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I should have done . 
I had made up my mind , I suppose , to get away in them , and that ruled me . 
And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of ` Here he is ! ' 
`` I sprang to my feet , whipped a chair off the counter , and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted , turned , came into another round a corner , sent him spinning , and rushed up the stairs . 
He kept his footing , gave a view hallo , and came up the staircase hot after me . 
Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot things -- what are they ? '' 
`` Art pots , '' suggested Kemp . 
`` That 's it ! 
Art pots . 
Well , I turned at the top step and swung round , plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me . 
The whole pile of pots went headlong , and I heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts . 
I made a mad rush for the refreshment place , and there was a man in white like a man cook , who took up the chase . 
I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery . 
I went behind the counter of this , and waited for my cook , and as he bolted in at the head of the chase , I doubled him up with a lamp . 
Down he went , and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could . 
Coat , jacket , trousers , shoes were all right , but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin . 
I heard more men coming , my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter , stunned or scared speechless , and I had to make another dash for it , like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile . '' 
` This way , policeman ! ' 
I heard someone shouting . 
I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . 
I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . 
They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers . 
` He 's dropping his plunder , ' said one of the young men . 
` He must be somewhere here . ' 
`` But they did not find me all the same . 
`` I stood watching them hunt for me for a time , and cursing my ill-luck in losing the clothes . 
Then I went into the refreshment-room , drank a little milk I found there , and sat down by the fire to consider my position . 
`` In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the business very excitedly and like the fools they were . 
I heard a magnified account of my depredations , and other speculations as to my whereabouts . 
Then I fell to scheming again . 
The insurmountable difficulty of the place , especially now it was alarmed , was to get any plunder out of it . 
I went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel , but I could not understand the system of checking . 
About eleven o'clock , the snow having thawed as it fell , and the day being finer and a little warmer than the previous one , I decided that the Emporium was hopeless , and went out again , exasperated at my want of success , with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind . '' 
`` But you begin now to realise , '' said the Invisible Man , `` the full disadvantage of my condition . 
I had no shelter -- no covering -- to get clothing was to forego all my advantage , to make myself a strange and terrible thing . 
I was fasting ; for to eat , to fill myself with unassimilated matter , would be to become grotesquely visible again . '' 
`` I never thought of that , '' said Kemp . 
`` Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers . 
I could not go abroad in snow -- it would settle on me and expose me . 
Rain , too , would make me a watery outline , a glistening surface of a man -- a bubble . 
And fog -- I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog , a surface , a greasy glimmer of humanity . 
Moreover , as I went abroad -- in the London air -- I gathered dirt about my ankles , floating smuts and dust upon my skin . 
I did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also . 
But I saw clearly it could not be for long . 
`` Not in London at any rate . 
`` I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street , and found myself at the end of the street in which I had lodged . 
I did not go that way , because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I had fired . 
My most immediate problem was to get clothing . 
What to do with my face puzzled me . 
Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops -- news , sweets , toys , stationery , belated Christmas tomfoolery , and so forth -- an array of masks and noses . 
I realised that problem was solved . 
In a flash I saw my course . 
I turned about , no longer aimless , and went -- circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways , towards the back streets north of the Strand ; for I remembered , though not very distinctly where , that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district . 
`` The day was cold , with a nipping wind down the northward running streets . 
I walked fast to avoid being overtaken . 
Every crossing was a danger , every passenger a thing to watch alertly . 
One man as I was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street , turned upon me abruptly and came into me , sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom . 
The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke . 
I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets , panting and trembling . 
I found I had caught a fresh cold , and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention . 
`` At last I reached the object of my quest , a dirty , fly-blown little shop in a by-way near Drury Lane , with a window full of tinsel robes , sham jewels , wigs , slippers , dominoes and theatrical photographs . 
The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark , and the house rose above it for four storeys , dark and dismal . 
I peered through the window and , seeing no one within , entered . 
The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing . 
I left it open , and walked round a bare costume stand , into a corner behind a cheval glass . 
For a minute or so no one came . 
Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room , and a man appeared down the shop . 
`` My plans were now perfectly definite . 
I proposed to make my way into the house , secrete myself upstairs , watch my opportunity , and when everything was quiet , rummage out a wig , mask , spectacles , and costume , and go into the world , perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure . 
And incidentally of course I could rob the house of any available money . 
`` The man who had just entered the shop was a short , slight , hunched , beetle-browed man , with long arms and very short bandy legs . 
Apparently I had interrupted a meal . 
He stared about the shop with an expression of expectation . 
This gave way to surprise , and then to anger , as he saw the shop empty . 
` Damn the boys ! ' 
he said . 
He went to stare up and down the street . 
He came in again in a minute , kicked the door to with his foot spitefully , and went muttering back to the house door . 
`` I came forward to follow him , and at the noise of my movement he stopped dead . 
I did so too , startled by his quickness of ear . 
He slammed the house door in my face . 
`` I stood hesitating . 
Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning , and the door reopened . 
He stood looking about the shop like one who was still not satisfied . 
Then , murmuring to himself , he examined the back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures . 
Then he stood doubtful . 
He had left the house door open and I slipped into the inner room . 
`` It was a queer little room , poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner . 
On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me , Kemp , to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal . 
And his table manners were irritating . 
Three doors opened into the little room , one going upstairs and one down , but they were all shut . 
I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back . 
Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time . 
`` The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel , but for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating . 
But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot , and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth , he took the whole lot of things after him . 
His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him -- as he would have done ; I never saw such a man for shutting doors -- and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery . 
I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up , and then , finding no good in keeping down there , and the brick floor being cold on my feet , I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire . 
It was burning low , and scarcely thinking , I put on a little coal . 
The noise of this brought him up at once , and he stood aglare . 
He peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me . 
Even after that examination , he scarcely seemed satisfied . 
He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down . 
`` I waited in the little parlour for an age , and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door . 
I just managed to get by him . 
`` On the staircase he stopped suddenly , so that I very nearly blundered into him . 
He stood looking back right into my face and listening . ' 
I could have sworn , ' he said . 
His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip . 
His eye went up and down the staircase . 
Then he grunted and went on up again . 
`` His hand was on the handle of a door , and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face . 
He was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him . 
The man must have had diabolically acute hearing . 
He suddenly flashed into rage . 
` If there 's anyone in this house -- ' he cried with an oath , and left the threat unfinished . 
He put his hand in his pocket , failed to find what he wanted , and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs . 
But I did not follow him . 
I sat on the head of the staircase until his return . 
`` Presently he came up again , still muttering . 
He opened the door of the room , and before I could enter , slammed it in my face . 
`` I resolved to explore the house , and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible . 
The house was very old and tumble-down , damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls , and rat infested . 
Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them . 
Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished , and others were littered with theatrical lumber , bought second-hand , I judged , from its appearance . 
In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes . 
I began routing among these , and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears . 
I heard a stealthy footstep and , looking up just in time , saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand . 
I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and suspicious . 
` It must have been her , ' he said slowly . 
` Damn her ! ' 
`` He shut the door quietly , and immediately I heard the key turn in the lock . 
Then his footsteps retreated . 
I realised abruptly that I was locked in . 
For a minute I did not know what to do . 
I walked from door to window and back , and stood perplexed . 
A gust of anger came upon me . 
But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further , and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf . 
This brought him back , more sinister than ever . 
That time he actually touched me , jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room . 
`` Presently he calmed a little . 
` Rats , ' he said in an undertone , fingers on lips . 
He was evidently a little scared . 
I edged quietly out of the room , but a plank creaked . 
Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house , revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys . 
When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage -- I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity . 
By this time I knew he was alone in the house , and so I made no more ado , but knocked him on the head . '' 
`` Knocked him on the head ? '' 
exclaimed Kemp . 
`` Yes -- stunned him -- as he was going downstairs . 
Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing . 
He went downstairs like a bag of old boots . '' 
`` But -- I say ! 
The common conventions of humanity -- '' `` Are all very well for common people . 
But the point was , Kemp , that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me . 
I could n't think of any other way of doing it . 
And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet . '' 
`` Tied him up in a sheet ! '' 
`` Made a sort of bag of it . 
It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet , and a devilish hard thing to get out of -- head away from the string . 
My dear Kemp , it 's no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer . 
It had to be done . 
He had his revolver . 
If once he saw me he would be able to describe me -- '' `` But still , '' said Kemp , `` in England -- to-day . 
And the man was in his own house , and you were -- well , robbing . '' 
`` Robbing ! 
Confound it ! 
You 'll call me a thief next ! 
Surely , Kemp , you 're not fool enough to dance on the old strings . 
Ca n't you see my position ? '' 
`` And his too , '' said Kemp . 
The Invisible Man stood up sharply . 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
Kemp 's face grew a trifle hard . 
He was about to speak and checked himself . 
`` I suppose , after all , '' he said with a sudden change of manner , `` the thing had to be done . 
You were in a fix . 
But still -- '' `` Of course I was in a fix -- an infernal fix . 
And he made me wild too -- hunting me about the house , fooling about with his revolver , locking and unlocking doors . 
He was simply exasperating . 
You do n't blame me , do you ? 
You do n't blame me ? '' 
`` I never blame anyone , '' said Kemp . 
`` It 's quite out of fashion . 
What did you do next ? '' 
`` I was hungry . 
Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese -- more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger . 
I took some brandy and water , and then went up past my impromptu bag -- he was lying quite still -- to the room containing the old clothes . 
This looked out upon the street , two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window . 
I went and peered out through their interstices . 
Outside the day was bright -- by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself , dazzlingly bright . 
A brisk traffic was going by , fruit carts , a hansom , a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes , a fishmonger 's cart . 
I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me . 
My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again . 
The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline , used , I suppose , in cleaning the garments . 
`` I began a systematic search of the place . 
I should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time . 
He was a curious person . 
Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom , and then I made a deliberate selection . 
I found a handbag I thought a suitable possession , and some powder , rouge , and sticking-plaster . 
`` I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me , in order to render myself visible , but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again . 
Finally I chose a mask of the better type , slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings , dark glasses , greyish whiskers , and a wig . 
I could find no underclothing , but that I could buy subsequently , and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs . 
I could find no socks , but the hunchback 's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed . 
In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings ' worth of silver , and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold . 
I could go forth into the world again , equipped . 
`` Then came a curious hesitation . 
Was my appearance really credible ? 
I tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass , inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink , but it all seemed sound . 
I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch , a stage miser , but I was certainly not a physical impossibility . 
Gathering confidence , I took my looking-glass down into the shop , pulled down the shop blinds , and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner . 
`` I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street , leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked . 
In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier 's shop . 
No one appeared to notice me very pointedly . 
My last difficulty seemed overcome . '' 
He stopped again . 
`` And you troubled no more about the hunchback ? '' 
said Kemp . 
`` No , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Nor have I heard what became of him . 
I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out . 
The knots were pretty tight . '' 
He became silent and went to the window and stared out . 
`` What happened when you went out into the Strand ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
-- disillusionment again . 
I thought my troubles were over . 
Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose , everything -- save to give away my secret . 
So I thought . 
Whatever I did , whatever the consequences might be , was nothing to me . 
I had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish . 
No person could hold me . 
I could take my money where I found it . 
I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast , and then put up at a good hotel , and accumulate a new outfit of property . 
I felt amazingly confident ; it 's not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass . 
I went into a place and was already ordering lunch , when it occurred to me that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face . 
I finished ordering the lunch , told the man I should be back in ten minutes , and went out exasperated . 
I do n't know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite . '' 
`` Not quite so badly , '' said Kemp , `` but I can imagine it . '' 
`` I could have smashed the silly devils . 
At last , faint with the desire for tasteful food , I went into another place and demanded a private room . ' 
I am disfigured , ' I said . 
` Badly . ' 
They looked at me curiously , but of course it was not their affair -- and so at last I got my lunch . 
It was not particularly well served , but it sufficed ; and when I had had it , I sat over a cigar , trying to plan my line of action . 
And outside a snowstorm was beginning . 
`` The more I thought it over , Kemp , the more I realised what a helpless absurdity an Invisible Man was -- in a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city . 
Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt of a thousand advantages . 
That afternoon it seemed all disappointment . 
I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable . 
No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them , but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got . 
Ambition -- what is the good of pride of place when you can not appear there ? 
What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah ? 
I have no taste for politics , for the blackguardisms of fame , for philanthropy , for sport . 
What was I to do ? 
And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery , a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man ! '' 
He paused , and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window . 
`` But how did you get to Iping ? '' 
said Kemp , anxious to keep his guest busy talking . 
`` I went there to work . 
I had one hope . 
It was a half idea ! 
I have it still . 
It is a full blown idea now . 
A way of getting back ! 
Of restoring what I have done . 
When I choose . 
When I have done all I mean to do invisibly . 
And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now . '' 
`` You went straight to Iping ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my cheque-book , my luggage and underclothing , order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of mine -- I will show you the calculations as soon as I get my books -- and then I started . 
Jove ! 
I remember the snowstorm now , and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose . '' 
`` At the end , '' said Kemp , `` the day before yesterday , when they found you out , you rather -- to judge by the papers -- '' `` I did . 
Rather . 
Did I kill that fool of a constable ? '' 
`` No , '' said Kemp . 
`` He 's expected to recover . '' 
`` That 's his luck , then . 
I clean lost my temper , the fools ! 
Why could n't they leave me alone ? 
And that grocer lout ? '' 
`` There are no deaths expected , '' said Kemp . 
`` I do n't know about that tramp of mine , '' said the Invisible Man , with an unpleasant laugh . 
`` By Heaven , Kemp , you do n't know what rage is ! 
... To have worked for years , to have planned and plotted , and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course ! 
... Every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me . 
`` If I have much more of it , I shall go wild -- I shall start mowing 'em . 
`` As it is , they 've made things a thousand times more difficult . '' 
`` No doubt it 's exasperating , '' said Kemp , drily . 
`` But now , '' said Kemp , with a side glance out of the window , `` what are we to do ? '' 
He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill road -- with an intolerable slowness , as it seemed to Kemp . 
`` What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock ? 
Had you any plan ? '' 
`` I was going to clear out of the country . 
But I have altered that plan rather since seeing you . 
I thought it would be wise , now the weather is hot and invisibility possible , to make for the South . 
Especially as my secret was known , and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man . 
You have a line of steamers from here to France . 
My idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage . 
Thence I could go by train into Spain , or else get to Algiers . 
It would not be difficult . 
There a man might always be invisible -- and yet live . 
And do things . 
I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier , until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me . '' 
`` That 's clear . '' 
`` And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me ! 
He has hidden my books , Kemp . 
Hidden my books ! 
If I can lay my hands on him ! '' 
`` Best plan to get the books out of him first . '' 
`` But where is he ? 
Do you know ? '' 
`` He 's in the town police station , locked up , by his own request , in the strongest cell in the place . '' 
`` Cur ! '' 
said the Invisible Man . 
`` But that hangs up your plans a little . '' 
`` We must get those books ; those books are vital . '' 
`` Certainly , '' said Kemp , a little nervously , wondering if he heard footsteps outside . 
`` Certainly we must get those books . 
But that wo n't be difficult , if he does n't know they 're for you . '' 
`` No , '' said the Invisible Man , and thought . 
Kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going , but the Invisible Man resumed of his own accord . 
`` Blundering into your house , Kemp , '' he said , `` changes all my plans . 
For you are a man that can understand . 
In spite of all that has happened , in spite of this publicity , of the loss of my books , of what I have suffered , there still remain great possibilities , huge possibilities -- '' `` You have told no one I am here ? '' 
he asked abruptly . 
Kemp hesitated . 
`` That was implied , '' he said . 
`` No one ? '' 
insisted Griffin . 
`` Not a soul . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Now -- '' The Invisible Man stood up , and sticking his arms akimbo began to pace the study . 
`` I made a mistake , Kemp , a huge mistake , in carrying this thing through alone . 
I have wasted strength , time , opportunities . 
Alone -- it is wonderful how little a man can do alone ! 
To rob a little , to hurt a little , and there is the end . 
`` What I want , Kemp , is a goal-keeper , a helper , and a hiding-place , an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace , and unsuspected . 
I must have a confederate . 
With a confederate , with food and rest -- a thousand things are possible . 
`` Hitherto I have gone on vague lines . 
We have to consider all that invisibility means , all that it does not mean . 
It means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forth -- one makes sounds . 
It 's of little help -- a little help perhaps -- in housebreaking and so forth . 
Once you 've caught me you could easily imprison me . 
But on the other hand I am hard to catch . 
This invisibility , in fact , is only good in two cases : It 's useful in getting away , it 's useful in approaching . 
It 's particularly useful , therefore , in killing . 
I can walk round a man , whatever weapon he has , choose my point , strike as I like . 
Dodge as I like . 
Escape as I like . '' 
Kemp 's hand went to his moustache . 
Was that a movement downstairs ? 
`` And it is killing we must do , Kemp . '' 
`` It is killing we must do , '' repeated Kemp . 
`` I 'm listening to your plan , Griffin , but I 'm not agreeing , mind . 
Why killing ? '' 
`` Not wanton killing , but a judicious slaying . 
The point is , they know there is an Invisible Man -- as well as we know there is an Invisible Man . 
And that Invisible Man , Kemp , must now establish a Reign of Terror . 
Yes ; no doubt it 's startling . 
But I mean it . 
A Reign of Terror . 
He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it . 
He must issue his orders . 
He can do that in a thousand ways -- scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice . 
And all who disobey his orders he must kill , and kill all who would defend them . '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
said Kemp , no longer listening to Griffin but to the sound of his front door opening and closing . 
`` It seems to me , Griffin , '' he said , to cover his wandering attention , `` that your confederate would be in a difficult position . '' 
`` No one would know he was a confederate , '' said the Invisible Man , eagerly . 
And then suddenly , `` Hush ! 
What 's that downstairs ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' said Kemp , and suddenly began to speak loud and fast . 
`` I do n't agree to this , Griffin , '' he said . 
`` Understand me , I do n't agree to this . 
Why dream of playing a game against the race ? 
How can you hope to gain happiness ? 
Do n't be a lone wolf . 
Publish your results ; take the world -- take the nation at least -- into your confidence . 
Think what you might do with a million helpers -- '' The Invisible Man interrupted -- arm extended . 
`` There are footsteps coming upstairs , '' he said in a low voice . 
`` Nonsense , '' said Kemp . 
`` Let me see , '' said the Invisible Man , and advanced , arm extended , to the door . 
And then things happened very swiftly . 
Kemp hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him . 
The Invisible Man started and stood still . 
`` Traitor ! '' 
cried the Voice , and suddenly the dressing-gown opened , and sitting down the Unseen began to disrobe . 
Kemp made three swift steps to the door , and forthwith the Invisible Man -- his legs had vanished -- sprang to his feet with a shout . 
Kemp flung the door open .
