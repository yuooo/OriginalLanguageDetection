Even thus much of truth would save me ! 
But now , it is all falsehood ! 
-- all emptiness ! 
-- all death ! '' 
Hester Prynne looked into his face , but hesitated to speak . 
Yet , uttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he did , his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say . 
She conquered her fears , and spoke : `` Such a friend as thou hast even now wished for , '' said she , `` with whom to weep over thy sin , thou hast in me , the partner of it ! '' 
Again she hesitated , but brought out the words with an effort . 
-- `` Thou hast long had such an enemy , and dwellest with him , under the same roof ! '' 
The minister started to his feet , gasping for breath , and clutching at his heart , as if he would have torn it out of his bosom . 
`` Ha ! 
What sayest thou ? '' 
cried he . 
`` An enemy ! 
And under mine own roof ! 
What mean you ? '' 
Hester Prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man , in permitting him to lie for so many years , or , indeed , for a single moment , at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent . 
The very contiguity of his enemy , beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself , was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as Arthur Dimmesdale . 
There had been a period when Hester was less alive to this consideration ; or , perhaps , in the misanthropy of her own trouble , she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom . 
But of late , since the night of his vigil , all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated . 
She now read his heart more accurately . 
She doubted not that the continual presence of Roger Chillingworth -- the secret poison of his malignity , infecting all the air about him -- and his authorised interference , as a physician , with the minister 's physical and spiritual infirmities -- that these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose . 
By means of them , the sufferer 's conscience had been kept in an irritated state , the tendency of which was , not to cure by wholesome pain , but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being . 
Its result , on earth , could hardly fail to be insanity , and hereafter , that eternal alienation from the Good and True , of which madness is perhaps the earthly type . 
Such was the ruin to which she had brought the man , once -- nay , why should we not speak it ? 
-- still so passionately loved ! 
Hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergyman 's good name , and death itself , as she had already told Roger Chillingworth , would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose . 
And now , rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess , she would gladly have laid down on the forest leaves , and died there , at Arthur Dimmesdale 's feet . 
`` Oh , Arthur ! '' 
cried she , `` forgive me ! 
In all things else , I have striven to be true ! 
Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast , and did hold fast , through all extremity ; save when thy good -- thy life -- thy fame -- were put in question ! 
Then I consented to a deception . 
But a lie is never good , even though death threaten on the other side ! 
Dost thou not see what I would say ? 
That old man ! 
-- the physician ! 
-- he whom they call Roger Chillingworth ! 
-- he was my husband ! '' 
The minister looked at her for an instant , with all that violence of passion , which -- intermixed in more shapes than one with his higher , purer , softer qualities -- was , in fact , the portion of him which the devil claimed , and through which he sought to win the rest . 
Never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than Hester now encountered . 
For the brief space that it lasted , it was a dark transfiguration . 
But his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering , that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle . 
He sank down on the ground , and buried his face in his hands . 
`` I might have known it , '' murmured he -- `` I did know it ! 
Was not the secret told me , in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him , and as often as I have seen him since ? 
Why did I not understand ? 
Oh , Hester Prynne , thou little , little knowest all the horror of this thing ! 
And the shame ! 
-- the indelicacy ! 
-- the horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it ! 
Woman , woman , thou art accountable for this ! 
-- I can not forgive thee ! '' 
`` Thou shalt forgive me ! '' 
cried Hester , flinging herself on the fallen leaves beside him . 
`` Let God punish ! 
Thou shalt forgive ! '' 
With sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him , and pressed his head against her bosom , little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter . 
He would have released himself , but strove in vain to do so . 
Hester would not set him free , lest he should look her sternly in the face . 
All the world had frowned on her -- for seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely woman -- and still she bore it all , nor ever once turned away her firm , sad eyes . 
Heaven , likewise , had frowned upon her , and she had not died . 
But the frown of this pale , weak , sinful , and sorrow-stricken man was what Hester could not bear , and live ! 
`` Wilt thou yet forgive me ? '' 
she repeated , over and over again . 
`` Wilt thou not frown ? 
Wilt thou forgive ? '' 
`` I do forgive you , Hester , '' replied the minister at length , with a deep utterance , out of an abyss of sadness , but no anger . 
`` I freely forgive you now . 
May God forgive us both . 
We are not , Hester , the worst sinners in the world . 
There is one worse than even the polluted priest ! 
That old man 's revenge has been blacker than my sin . 
He has violated , in cold blood , the sanctity of a human heart . 
Thou and I , Hester , never did so ! '' 
`` Never , never ! '' 
whispered she . 
`` What we did had a consecration of its own . 
We felt it so ! 
We said so to each other . 
Hast thou forgotten it ? '' 
`` Hush , Hester ! '' 
said Arthur Dimmesdale , rising from the ground . 
`` No ; I have not forgotten ! '' 
They sat down again , side by side , and hand clasped in hand , on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree . 
Life had never brought them a gloomier hour ; it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending , and darkening ever , as it stole along -- and yet it unclosed a charm that made them linger upon it , and claim another , and another , and , after all , another moment . 
The forest was obscure around them , and creaked with a blast that was passing through it . 
The boughs were tossing heavily above their heads ; while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another , as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath , or constrained to forbode evil to come . 
And yet they lingered . 
How dreary looked the forest-track that led backward to the settlement , where Hester Prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name ! 
So they lingered an instant longer . 
No golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest . 
Here seen only by his eyes , the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman ! 
Here seen only by her eyes , Arthur Dimmesdale , false to God and man , might be , for one moment true ! 
He started at a thought that suddenly occurred to him . 
`` Hester ! '' 
cried he , `` here is a new horror ! 
Roger Chillingworth knows your purpose to reveal his true character . 
Will he continue , then , to keep our secret ? 
What will now be the course of his revenge ? '' 
`` There is a strange secrecy in his nature , '' replied Hester , thoughtfully ; `` and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge . 
I deem it not likely that he will betray the secret . 
He will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion . '' 
`` And I ! 
-- how am I to live longer , breathing the same air with this deadly enemy ? '' 
exclaimed Arthur Dimmesdale , shrinking within himself , and pressing his hand nervously against his heart -- a gesture that had grown involuntary with him . 
`` Think for me , Hester ! 
Thou art strong . 
Resolve for me ! '' 
`` Thou must dwell no longer with this man , '' said Hester , slowly and firmly . 
`` Thy heart must be no longer under his evil eye ! '' 
`` It were far worse than death ! '' 
replied the minister . 
`` But how to avoid it ? 
What choice remains to me ? 
Shall I lie down again on these withered leaves , where I cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was ? 
Must I sink down there , and die at once ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
what a ruin has befallen thee ! '' 
said Hester , with the tears gushing into her eyes . 
`` Wilt thou die for very weakness ? 
There is no other cause ! '' 
`` The judgment of God is on me , '' answered the conscience-stricken priest . 
`` It is too mighty for me to struggle with ! '' 
`` Heaven would show mercy , '' rejoined Hester , `` hadst thou but the strength to take advantage of it . '' 
`` Be thou strong for me ! '' 
answered he . 
`` Advise me what to do . '' 
`` Is the world , then , so narrow ? '' 
exclaimed Hester Prynne , fixing her deep eyes on the minister 's , and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect . 
`` Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town , which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert , as lonely as this around us ? 
Whither leads yonder forest-track ? 
Backward to the settlement , thou sayest ! 
Yes ; but , onward , too ! 
Deeper it goes , and deeper into the wilderness , less plainly to be seen at every step ; until some few miles hence the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white man 's tread . 
There thou art free ! 
So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched , to one where thou mayest still be happy ! 
Is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth ? '' 
`` Yes , Hester ; but only under the fallen leaves ! '' 
replied the minister , with a sad smile . 
`` Then there is the broad pathway of the sea ! '' 
continued Hester . 
`` It brought thee hither . 
If thou so choose , it will bear thee back again . 
In our native land , whether in some remote rural village , or in vast London -- or , surely , in Germany , in France , in pleasant Italy -- thou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge ! 
And what hast thou to do with all these iron men , and their opinions ? 
They have kept thy better part in bondage too long already ! '' 
`` It can not be ! '' 
answered the minister , listening as if he were called upon to realise a dream . 
`` I am powerless to go . 
Wretched and sinful as I am , I have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where Providence hath placed me . 
Lost as my own soul is , I would still do what I may for other human souls ! 
I dare not quit my post , though an unfaithful sentinel , whose sure reward is death and dishonour , when his dreary watch shall come to an end ! '' 
`` Thou art crushed under this seven years ' weight of misery , '' replied Hester , fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy . 
`` But thou shalt leave it all behind thee ! 
It shall not cumber thy steps , as thou treadest along the forest-path : neither shalt thou freight the ship with it , if thou prefer to cross the sea . 
Leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened . 
Meddle no more with it ! 
Begin all anew ! 
Hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial ? 
Not so ! 
The future is yet full of trial and success . 
There is happiness to be enjoyed ! 
There is good to be done ! 
Exchange this false life of thine for a true one . 
Be , if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission , the teacher and apostle of the red men . 
Or , as is more thy nature , be a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world . 
Preach ! 
Write ! 
Act ! 
Do anything , save to lie down and die ! 
Give up this name of Arthur Dimmesdale , and make thyself another , and a high one , such as thou canst wear without fear or shame . 
Why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy life ? 
that have made thee feeble to will and to do ? 
that will leave thee powerless even to repent ? 
Up , and away ! '' 
`` Oh , Hester ! '' 
cried Arthur Dimmesdale , in whose eyes a fitful light , kindled by her enthusiasm , flashed up and died away , `` thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him ! 
I must die here ! 
There is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide , strange , difficult world alone ! '' 
It was the last expression of the despondency of a broken spirit . 
He lacked energy to grasp the better fortune that seemed within his reach . 
He repeated the word -- `` Alone , Hester ! '' 
`` Thou shall not go alone ! '' 
answered she , in a deep whisper . 
Then , all was spoken ! 
Arthur Dimmesdale gazed into Hester 's face with a look in which hope and joy shone out , indeed , but with fear betwixt them , and a kind of horror at her boldness , who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at , but dared not speak . 
But Hester Prynne , with a mind of native courage and activity , and for so long a period not merely estranged , but outlawed from society , had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman . 
She had wandered , without rule or guidance , in a moral wilderness , as vast , as intricate , and shadowy as the untamed forest , amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate . 
Her intellect and heart had their home , as it were , in desert places , where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods . 
For years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions , and whatever priests or legislators had established ; criticising all with hardly more reverence than the Indian would feel for the clerical band , the judicial robe , the pillory , the gallows , the fireside , or the church . 
The tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free . 
The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread . 
Shame , Despair , Solitude ! 
These had been her teachers -- stern and wild ones -- and they had made her strong , but taught her much amiss . 
The minister , on the other hand , had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws ; although , in a single instance , he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them . 
But this had been a sin of passion , not of principle , nor even purpose . 
Since that wretched epoch , he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness , not his acts -- for those it was easy to arrange -- but each breath of emotion , and his every thought . 
At the head of the social system , as the clergymen of that day stood , he was only the more trammelled by its regulations , its principles , and even its prejudices . 
As a priest , the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in . 
As a man who had once sinned , but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound , he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all . 
Thus we seem to see that , as regarded Hester Prynne , the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour . 
But Arthur Dimmesdale ! 
Were such a man once more to fall , what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime ? 
None ; unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering ; that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it ; that , between fleeing as an avowed criminal , and remaining as a hypocrite , conscience might find it hard to strike the balance ; that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy , and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy ; that , finally , to this poor pilgrim , on his dreary and desert path , faint , sick , miserable , there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy , a new life , and a true one , in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating . 
And be the stern and sad truth spoken , that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never , in this mortal state , repaired . 
It may be watched and guarded , so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel , and might even in his subsequent assaults , select some other avenue , in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded . 
But there is still the ruined wall , and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph . 
The struggle , if there were one , need not be described . 
Let it suffice that the clergyman resolved to flee , and not alone . 
`` If in all these past seven years , '' thought he , `` I could recall one instant of peace or hope , I would yet endure , for the sake of that earnest of Heaven 's mercy . 
But now -- since I am irrevocably doomed -- wherefore should I not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution ? 
Or , if this be the path to a better life , as Hester would persuade me , I surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it ! 
Neither can I any longer live without her companionship ; so powerful is she to sustain -- so tender to soothe ! 
O Thou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes , wilt Thou yet pardon me ? '' 
`` Thou wilt go ! '' 
said Hester calmly , as he met her glance . 
The decision once made , a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast . 
It was the exhilarating effect -- upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heart -- of breathing the wild , free atmosphere of an unredeemed , unchristianised , lawless region . 
His spirit rose , as it were , with a bound , and attained a nearer prospect of the sky , than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth . 
Of a deeply religious temperament , there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood . 
`` Do I feel joy again ? '' 
cried he , wondering at himself . 
`` Methought the germ of it was dead in me ! 
Oh , Hester , thou art my better angel ! 
I seem to have flung myself -- sick , sin-stained , and sorrow-blackened -- down upon these forest leaves , and to have risen up all made anew , and with new powers to glorify Him that hath been merciful ! 
This is already the better life ! 
Why did we not find it sooner ? '' 
`` Let us not look back , '' answered Hester Prynne . 
`` The past is gone ! 
Wherefore should we linger upon it now ? 
See ! 
With this symbol I undo it all , and make it as if it had never been ! '' 
So speaking , she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter , and , taking it from her bosom , threw it to a distance among the withered leaves . 
The mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream . 
With a hand 's - breadth further flight , it would have fallen into the water , and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward , besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about . 
But there lay the embroidered letter , glittering like a lost jewel , which some ill-fated wanderer might pick up , and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt , sinkings of the heart , and unaccountable misfortune . 
The stigma gone , Hester heaved a long , deep sigh , in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit . 
O exquisite relief ! 
She had not known the weight until she felt the freedom ! 
By another impulse , she took off the formal cap that confined her hair , and down it fell upon her shoulders , dark and rich , with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance , and imparting the charm of softness to her features . 
There played around her mouth , and beamed out of her eyes , a radiant and tender smile , that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood . 
A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek , that had been long so pale . 
Her sex , her youth , and the whole richness of her beauty , came back from what men call the irrevocable past , and clustered themselves with her maiden hope , and a happiness before unknown , within the magic circle of this hour . 
And , as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts , it vanished with their sorrow . 
All at once , as with a sudden smile of heaven , forth burst the sunshine , pouring a very flood into the obscure forest , gladdening each green leaf , transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold , and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees . 
The objects that had made a shadow hitherto , embodied the brightness now . 
The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood 's heart of mystery , which had become a mystery of joy . 
Such was the sympathy of Nature -- that wild , heathen Nature of the forest , never subjugated by human law , nor illumined by higher truth -- with the bliss of these two spirits ! 
Love , whether newly-born , or aroused from a death-like slumber , must always create a sunshine , filling the heart so full of radiance , that it overflows upon the outward world . 
Had the forest still kept its gloom , it would have been bright in Hester 's eyes , and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale 's ! 
Hester looked at him with a thrill of another joy . 
`` Thou must know Pearl ! '' 
said she . 
`` Our little Pearl ! 
Thou hast seen her -- yes , I know it ! 
-- but thou wilt see her now with other eyes . 
She is a strange child ! 
I hardly comprehend her ! 
But thou wilt love her dearly , as I do , and wilt advise me how to deal with her ! '' 
`` Dost thou think the child will be glad to know me ? '' 
asked the minister , somewhat uneasily . 
`` I have long shrunk from children , because they often show a distrust -- a backwardness to be familiar with me . 
I have even been afraid of little Pearl ! '' 
`` Ah , that was sad ! '' 
answered the mother . 
`` But she will love thee dearly , and thou her . 
She is not far off . 
I will call her . 
Pearl ! 
Pearl ! '' 
`` I see the child , '' observed the minister . 
`` Yonder she is , standing in a streak of sunshine , a good way off , on the other side of the brook . 
So thou thinkest the child will love me ? '' 
Hester smiled , and again called to Pearl , who was visible at some distance , as the minister had described her , like a bright-apparelled vision in a sunbeam , which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs . 
The ray quivered to and fro , making her figure dim or distinct -- now like a real child , now like a child 's spirit -- as the splendour went and came again . 
She heard her mother 's voice , and approached slowly through the forest . 
Pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat talking with the clergyman . 
The great black forest -- stern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosom -- became the playmate of the lonely infant , as well as it knew how . 
Sombre as it was , it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her . 
It offered her the partridge-berries , the growth of the preceding autumn , but ripening only in the spring , and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves . 
These Pearl gathered , and was pleased with their wild flavour . 
The small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path . 
A partridge , indeed , with a brood of ten behind her , ran forward threateningly , but soon repented of her fierceness , and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid . 
A pigeon , alone on a low branch , allowed Pearl to come beneath , and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm . 
A squirrel , from the lofty depths of his domestic tree , chattered either in anger or merriment -- for the squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage , that it is hard to distinguish between his moods -- so he chattered at the child , and flung down a nut upon her head . 
It was a last year 's nut , and already gnawed by his sharp tooth . 
A fox , startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves , looked inquisitively at Pearl , as doubting whether it were better to steal off , or renew his nap on the same spot . 
A wolf , it is said -- but here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable -- came up and smelt of Pearl 's robe , and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand . 
The truth seems to be , however , that the mother-forest , and these wild things which it nourished , all recognised a kindred wilderness in the human child . 
And she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets of the settlement , or in her mother 's cottage . 
The Bowers appeared to know it , and one and another whispered as she passed , `` Adorn thyself with me , thou beautiful child , adorn thyself with me ! '' 
-- and , to please them , Pearl gathered the violets , and anemones , and columbines , and some twigs of the freshest green , which the old trees held down before her eyes . 
With these she decorated her hair and her young waist , and became a nymph child , or an infant dryad , or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood . 
In such guise had Pearl adorned herself , when she heard her mother 's voice , and came slowly back . 
Slowly -- for she saw the clergyman ! 
`` Thou wilt love her dearly , '' repeated Hester Prynne , as she and the minister sat watching little Pearl . 
`` Dost thou not think her beautiful ? 
And see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her ! 
Had she gathered pearls , and diamonds , and rubies in the wood , they could not have become her better ! 
She is a splendid child ! 
But I know whose brow she has ! '' 
`` Dost thou know , Hester , '' said Arthur Dimmesdale , with an unquiet smile , `` that this dear child , tripping about always at thy side , hath caused me many an alarm ? 
Methought -- oh , Hester , what a thought is that , and how terrible to dread it ! 
-- that my own features were partly repeated in her face , and so strikingly that the world might see them ! 
But she is mostly thine ! '' 
`` No , no ! 
Not mostly ! '' 
answered the mother , with a tender smile . 
`` A little longer , and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child she is . 
But how strangely beautiful she looks with those wild flowers in her hair ! 
It is as if one of the fairies , whom we left in dear old England , had decked her out to meet us . '' 
It was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced , that they sat and watched Pearl 's slow advance . 
In her was visible the tie that united them . 
She had been offered to the world , these seven past years , as the living hieroglyphic , in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hide -- all written in this symbol -- all plainly manifest -- had there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame ! 
And Pearl was the oneness of their being . 
Be the foregone evil what it might , how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they beheld at once the material union , and the spiritual idea , in whom they met , and were to dwell immortally together ; thoughts like these -- and perhaps other thoughts , which they did not acknowledge or define -- threw an awe about the child as she came onward . 
`` Let her see nothing strange -- no passion or eagerness -- in thy way of accosting her , '' whispered Hester . 
`` Our Pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf sometimes . 
Especially she is generally intolerant of emotion , when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore . 
But the child hath strong affections ! 
She loves me , and will love thee ! '' 
`` Thou canst not think , '' said the minister , glancing aside at Hester Prynne , `` how my heart dreads this interview , and yearns for it ! 
But , in truth , as I already told thee , children are not readily won to be familiar with me . 
They will not climb my knee , nor prattle in my ear , nor answer to my smile , but stand apart , and eye me strangely . 
Even little babes , when I take them in my arms , weep bitterly . 
Yet Pearl , twice in her little lifetime , hath been kind to me ! 
The first time -- thou knowest it well ! 
The last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old Governor . '' 
`` And thou didst plead so bravely in her behalf and mine ! '' 
answered the mother . 
`` I remember it ; and so shall little Pearl . 
Fear nothing . 
She may be strange and shy at first , but will soon learn to love thee ! '' 
By this time Pearl had reached the margin of the brook , and stood on the further side , gazing silently at Hester and the clergyman , who still sat together on the mossy tree-trunk waiting to receive her . 
Just where she had paused , the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure , with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty , in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage , but more refined and spiritualized than the reality . 
This image , so nearly identical with the living Pearl , seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself . 
It was strange , the way in which Pearl stood , looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forest gloom , herself , meanwhile , all glorified with a ray of sunshine , that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy . 
In the brook beneath stood another child -- another and the same -- with likewise its ray of golden light . 
Hester felt herself , in some indistinct and tantalizing manner , estranged from Pearl , as if the child , in her lonely ramble through the forest , had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together , and was now vainly seeking to return to it . 
There were both truth and error in the impression ; the child and mother were estranged , but through Hester 's fault , not Pearl 's . 
Since the latter rambled from her side , another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mother 's feelings , and so modified the aspect of them all , that Pearl , the returning wanderer , could not find her wonted place , and hardly knew where she was . 
`` I have a strange fancy , '' observed the sensitive minister , `` that this brook is the boundary between two worlds , and that thou canst never meet thy Pearl again . 
Or is she an elfish spirit , who , as the legends of our childhood taught us , is forbidden to cross a running stream ? 
Pray hasten her , for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves . '' 
`` Come , dearest child ! '' 
said Hester encouragingly , and stretching out both her arms . 
`` How slow thou art ! 
When hast thou been so sluggish before now ? 
Here is a friend of mine , who must be thy friend also . 
Thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could give thee ! 
Leap across the brook and come to us . 
Thou canst leap like a young deer ! '' 
Pearl , without responding in any manner to these honey-sweet expressions , remained on the other side of the brook . 
Now she fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother , now on the minister , and now included them both in the same glance , as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another . 
For some unaccountable reason , as Arthur Dimmesdale felt the child 's eyes upon himself , his hand -- with that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntary -- stole over his heart . 
At length , assuming a singular air of authority , Pearl stretched out her hand , with the small forefinger extended , and pointing evidently towards her mother 's breast . 
And beneath , in the mirror of the brook , there was the flower-girdled and sunny image of little Pearl , pointing her small forefinger too . 
`` Thou strange child ! 
why dost thou not come to me ? '' 
exclaimed Hester . 
Pearl still pointed with her forefinger , and a frown gathered on her brow -- the more impressive from the childish , the almost baby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it . 
As her mother still kept beckoning to her , and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles , the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture . 
In the brook , again , was the fantastic beauty of the image , with its reflected frown , its pointed finger , and imperious gesture , giving emphasis to the aspect of little Pearl . 
`` Hasten , Pearl , or I shall be angry with thee ! '' 
cried Hester Prynne , who , however , inured to such behaviour on the elf-child 's part at other seasons , was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now . 
`` Leap across the brook , naughty child , and run hither ! 
Else I must come to thee ! '' 
But Pearl , not a whit startled at her mother 's threats any more than mollified by her entreaties , now suddenly burst into a fit of passion , gesticulating violently , and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions . 
She accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks , which the woods reverberated on all sides , so that , alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath , it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement . 
Seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of Pearl 's image , crowned and girdled with flowers , but stamping its foot , wildly gesticulating , and , in the midst of all , still pointing its small forefinger at Hester 's bosom . 
`` I see what ails the child , '' whispered Hester to the clergyman , and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance , `` Children will not abide any , the slightest , change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes . 
Pearl misses something that she has always seen me wear ! '' 
`` I pray you , '' answered the minister , `` if thou hast any means of pacifying the child , do it forthwith ! 
Save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch like Mistress Hibbins , '' added he , attempting to smile , `` I know nothing that I would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child . 
In Pearl 's young beauty , as in the wrinkled witch , it has a preternatural effect . 
Pacify her if thou lovest me ! '' 
Hester turned again towards Pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek , a conscious glance aside clergyman , and then a heavy sigh , while , even before she had time to speak , the blush yielded to a deadly pallor . 
`` Pearl , '' said she sadly , `` look down at thy feet ! 
There ! 
-- before thee ! 
-- on the hither side of the brook ! '' 
The child turned her eyes to the point indicated , and there lay the scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in it . 
`` Bring it hither ! '' 
said Hester . 
`` Come thou and take it up ! '' 
answered Pearl . 
`` Was ever such a child ! '' 
observed Hester aside to the minister . 
`` Oh , I have much to tell thee about her ! 
But , in very truth , she is right as regards this hateful token . 
I must bear its torture yet a little longer -- only a few days longer -- until we shall have left this region , and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of . 
The forest can not hide it ! 
The mid-ocean shall take it from my hand , and swallow it up for ever ! '' 
With these words she advanced to the margin of the brook , took up the scarlet letter , and fastened it again into her bosom . 
Hopefully , but a moment ago , as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea , there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate . 
She had flung it into infinite space ! 
she had drawn an hour 's free breath ! 
and here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot ! 
So it ever is , whether thus typified or no , that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom .
