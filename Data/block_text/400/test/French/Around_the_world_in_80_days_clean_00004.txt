The priests took their places in front of the judge , and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant , who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion . 
`` You hear the charge ? '' 
asked the judge . 
`` Yes , sir , '' replied Mr. Fogg , consulting his watch , `` and I admit it . '' 
`` You admit it ? '' 
`` I admit it , and I wish to hear these priests admit , in their turn , what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji . '' 
The priests looked at each other ; they did not seem to understand what was said . 
`` Yes , '' cried Passepartout , warmly ; `` at the pagoda of Pillaji , where they were on the point of burning their victim . '' 
The judge stared with astonishment , and the priests were stupefied . 
`` What victim ? '' 
said Judge Obadiah . 
`` Burn whom ? 
In Bombay itself ? '' 
`` Bombay ? '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` Certainly . 
We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji , but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill , at Bombay . '' 
`` And as a proof , '' added the clerk , `` here are the desecrator 's very shoes , which he left behind him . '' 
Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk . 
`` My shoes ! '' 
cried Passepartout , in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him . 
The confusion of master and man , who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay , for which they were now detained at Calcutta , may be imagined . 
Fix the detective , had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout 's escapade gave him , and , delaying his departure for twelve hours , had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill . 
Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour , he promised them a goodly sum in damages , and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train . 
Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow , Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant , the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive . 
Fix 's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined . 
He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces . 
For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety ; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive , accompanied by a young woman , whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain . 
He hastened for a policeman ; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah . 
Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied , he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room , watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood ; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta , as it had done at Bombay and Suez . 
Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout 's rash exclamation , which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall . 
`` The facts are admitted ? '' 
asked the judge . 
`` Admitted , '' replied Mr. Fogg , coldly . 
`` Inasmuch , '' resumed the judge , `` as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people , and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill , at Bombay , on the 20th of October , I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds . '' 
`` Three hundred pounds ! '' 
cried Passepartout , startled at the largeness of the sum . 
`` Silence ! '' 
shouted the constable . 
`` And inasmuch , '' continued the judge , `` as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week 's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds . '' 
Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction ; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week , it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive . 
Passepartout was stupefied . 
This sentence ruined his master . 
A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda ! 
Phileas Fogg , as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him , did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced . 
Just as the clerk was calling the next case , he rose , and said , `` I offer bail . '' 
`` You have that right , '' returned the judge . 
Fix 's blood ran cold , but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds . 
`` I will pay it at once , '' said Mr. Fogg , taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag , which Passepartout had by him , and placing them on the clerk 's desk . 
`` This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , '' said the judge . 
`` Meanwhile , you are liberated on bail . '' 
`` Come ! '' 
said Phileas Fogg to his servant . 
`` But let them at least give me back my shoes ! '' 
cried Passepartout angrily . 
`` Ah , these are pretty dear shoes ! '' 
he muttered , as they were handed to him . 
`` More than a thousand pounds apiece ; besides , they pinch my feet . '' 
Mr. Fogg , offering his arm to Aouda , then departed , followed by the crestfallen Passepartout . 
Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not , after all , leave the two thousand pounds behind him , but would decide to serve out his week in jail , and issued forth on Mr. Fogg 's traces . 
That gentleman took a carriage , and the party were soon landed on one of the quays . 
The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour , its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head . 
Eleven o'clock was striking ; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time . 
Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer , and stamped his feet with disappointment . 
`` The rascal is off , after all ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Two thousand pounds sacrificed ! 
He 's as prodigal as a thief ! 
I 'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary ; but , at the rate he is going on , the stolen money will soon be exhausted . '' 
The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture . 
Since leaving London , what with travelling expenses , bribes , the purchase of the elephant , bails , and fines , Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way , and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives , was rapidly diminishing . 
The Rangoon -- one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company 's boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas -- was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse-power . 
She was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the Mongolia , and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished . 
However , the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please . 
During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done . 
The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda 's comfort . 
He visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk . 
He treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose . 
Aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world . 
After all , she owed Phileas Fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude . 
Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide 's narrative of her touching history . 
She did , indeed , belong to the highest of the native races of India . 
Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton ; and one of them , Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy , was made a baronet by the English government . 
Aouda was a relative of this great man , and it was his cousin , Jeejeeh , whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong . 
Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell ; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties , and to assure her that everything would be mathematically -- he used the very word -- arranged . 
Aouda fastened her great eyes , `` clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya , '' upon him ; but the intractable Fogg , as reserved as ever , did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake . 
The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously , amid favourable weather and propitious winds , and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman , the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal , with its picturesque Saddle Peak , two thousand four hundred feet high , looming above the waters . 
The steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage Papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance . 
The panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb . 
Vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree-like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire . 
The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed , however , and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca , which gave access to the China seas . 
What was detective Fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ? 
He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . 
It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout 's suspicions , who thought him still at Bombay . 
But necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen . 
All the detective 's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong ; for the steamer 's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there . 
The arrest must be made at Hong Kong , or the robber would probably escape him for ever . 
Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot ; beyond , China , Japan , America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge . 
If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong , Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police , and there would be no further trouble . 
But beyond Hong Kong , a simple warrant would be of no avail ; an extradition warrant would be necessary , and that would result in delays and obstacles , of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice . 
Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin , and kept repeating to himself , `` Now , either the warrant will be at Hong Kong , in which case I shall arrest my man , or it will not be there ; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure . 
I have failed at Bombay , and I have failed at Calcutta ; if I fail at Hong Kong , my reputation is lost : Cost what it may , I must succeed ! 
But how shall I prevent his departure , if that should turn out to be my last resource ? '' 
Fix made up his mind that , if worst came to worst , he would make a confidant of Passepartout , and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was . 
That Passepartout was not Fogg 's accomplice , he was very certain . 
The servant , enlightened by his disclosure , and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime , would doubtless become an ally of the detective . 
But this method was a dangerous one , only to be employed when everything else had failed . 
A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all . 
The detective was therefore in a sore strait . 
But suddenly a new idea struck him . 
The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon , in company with Phileas Fogg , gave him new material for reflection . 
Who was this woman ? 
What combination of events had made her Fogg 's travelling companion ? 
They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta ; but where ? 
Had they met accidentally , or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel ? 
Fix was fairly puzzled . 
He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement ; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue . 
Whether the young woman were married or not , he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money . 
But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong ? 
Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another , and , before anything could be effected , might get full under way again for Yokohama . 
Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities , and signal the Rangoon before her arrival . 
This was easy to do , since the steamer stopped at Singapore , whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong . 
He finally resolved , moreover , before acting more positively , to question Passepartout . 
It would not be difficult to make him talk ; and , as there was no time to lose , Fix prepared to make himself known . 
It was now the 30th of October , and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore . 
Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck . 
Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer . 
The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise , and exclaimed , `` You here , on the Rangoon ? '' 
`` What , Monsieur Fix , are you on board ? '' 
returned the really astonished Passepartout , recognising his crony of the Mongolia . 
`` Why , I left you at Bombay , and here you are , on the way to Hong Kong ! 
Are you going round the world too ? '' 
`` No , no , '' replied Fix ; `` I shall stop at Hong Kong -- at least for some days . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said Passepartout , who seemed for an instant perplexed . 
`` But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta ? '' 
`` Oh , a trifle of sea-sickness -- I 've been staying in my berth . 
The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean . 
And how is Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` As well and as punctual as ever , not a day behind time ! 
But , Monsieur Fix , you do n't know that we have a young lady with us . '' 
`` A young lady ? '' 
replied the detective , not seeming to comprehend what was said . 
Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda 's history , the affair at the Bombay pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the Calcutta court , and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail . 
Fix , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related ; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener . 
`` But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives , a rich merchant at Hong Kong . '' 
`` Nothing to be done there , '' said Fix to himself , concealing his disappointment . 
`` A glass of gin , Mr. Passepartout ? '' 
`` Willingly , Monsieur Fix . 
We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon . '' 
The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview , though Fix was reserved , and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg . 
He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice ; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept Aouda company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist . 
Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing . 
It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person , whom he had first met at Suez , had then encountered on board the Mongolia , who disembarked at Bombay , which he announced as his destination , and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon , was following Mr. Fogg 's tracks step by step . 
What was Fix 's object ? 
Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes -- which he religiously preserved -- that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them , and probably on the same steamer . 
Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view . 
He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe . 
But , as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery , Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix 's movements , which was in truth far from unreasonable . 
Fix , he thought , could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg 's friends at the Reform Club , sent to follow him up , and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon . 
`` It 's clear ! '' 
repeated the worthy servant to himself , proud of his shrewdness . 
`` He 's a spy sent to keep us in view ! 
That is n't quite the thing , either , to be spying Mr. Fogg , who is so honourable a man ! 
Ah , gentlemen of the Reform , this shall cost you dear ! '' 
Passepartout , enchanted with his discovery , resolved to say nothing to his master , lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries . 
But he determined to chaff Fix , when he had the chance , with mysterious allusions , which , however , need not betray his real suspicions . 
During the afternoon of Wednesday , 30th October , the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca , which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra . 
The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers . 
The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m. , to receive coal , having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival . 
Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal , and then , accompanied by Aouda , who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore , disembarked . 
Fix , who suspected Mr. Fogg 's every movement , followed them cautiously , without being himself perceived ; while Passepartout , laughing in his sleeve at Fix 's manoeuvres , went about his usual errands . 
The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect , for there are no mountains ; yet its appearance is not without attractions . 
It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues . 
A handsome carriage , drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses , carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage , and of clove-trees , whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower . 
Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields ; sago-bushes , large ferns with gorgeous branches , varied the aspect of this tropical clime ; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume . 
Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees , nor were tigers wanting in the jungles . 
After a drive of two hours through the country , Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town , which is a vast collection of heavy-looking , irregular houses , surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants ; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked , closely followed by the detective , who had kept them constantly in sight . 
Passepartout , who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes -- a fruit as large as good-sized apples , of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within , and whose white pulp , melting in the mouth , affords gourmands a delicious sensation -- was waiting for them on deck . 
He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda , who thanked him very gracefully for them . 
At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . 
Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong , which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast . 
Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama , the principal Japanese port . 
The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers , many of whom disembarked at Singapore , among them a number of Indians , Ceylonese , Chinamen , Malays , and Portuguese , mostly second-class travellers . 
The weather , which had hitherto been fine , changed with the last quarter of the moon . 
The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamer 's progress . 
The captain as often as possible put up his sails , and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China . 
Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather ; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least . 
Passepartout blamed the captain , the engineer , and the crew , and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows . 
Perhaps the thought of the gas , which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row , had something to do with his hot impatience . 
`` You are in a great hurry , then , '' said Fix to him one day , `` to reach Hong Kong ? '' 
`` A very great hurry ! '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , I suppose , is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama ? '' 
`` Terribly anxious . '' 
`` You believe in this journey around the world , then ? '' 
`` Absolutely . 
Do n't you , Mr. Fix ? '' 
`` I ? 
I do n't believe a word of it . '' 
`` You 're a sly dog ! '' 
said Passepartout , winking at him . 
This expression rather disturbed Fix , without his knowing why . 
Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose ? 
He knew not what to think . 
But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ? 
Yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed . 
Passepartout went still further the next day ; he could not hold his tongue . 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said he , in a bantering tone , `` shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong ? '' 
`` Why , '' responded Fix , a little embarrassed , `` I do n't know ; perhaps -- '' `` Ah , if you would only go on with us ! 
An agent of the Peninsular Company , you know , ca n't stop on the way ! 
You were only going to Bombay , and here you are in China . 
America is not far off , and from America to Europe is only a step . '' 
Fix looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him . 
But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation . 
`` Yes , and no , '' returned Fix ; `` there is good and bad luck in such things . 
But you must understand that I do n't travel at my own expense . '' 
`` Oh , I am quite sure of that ! '' 
cried Passepartout , laughing heartily . 
Fix , fairly puzzled , descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections . 
He was evidently suspected ; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective . 
But had he told his master ? 
What part was he playing in all this : was he an accomplice or not ? 
Was the game , then , up ? 
Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind , sometimes thinking that all was lost , then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence , and then undecided what course it was best to take . 
Nevertheless , he preserved his coolness of mind , and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout . 
If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong , and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory , he , Fix , would tell Passepartout all . 
Either the servant was the accomplice of his master , and in this case the master knew of his operations , and he should fail ; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery , and then his interest would be to abandon the robber . 
Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference . 
He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world , regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him . 
Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star , which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman 's heart . 
But no ! 
the charms of Aouda failed to act , to Passepartout 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune . 
It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout , who read in Aouda 's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master . 
Phileas Fogg , though brave and gallant , must be , he thought , quite heartless . 
As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him , there was clearly no trace of such a thing ; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries . 
One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room , and was observing the engine , when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water . 
The steam came hissing out of the valves ; and this made Passepartout indignant . 
`` The valves are not sufficiently charged ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` We are not going . 
Oh , these English ! 
If this was an American craft , we should blow up , perhaps , but we should at all events go faster ! '' 
The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage . 
The wind , obstinately remaining in the north-west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer . 
The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path . 
A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November , the squall knocking the vessel about with fury , and the waves running high . 
The Rangoon reefed all her sails , and even the rigging proved too much , whistling and shaking amid the squall . 
The steamer was forced to proceed slowly , and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time , and more if the storm lasted . 
Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . 
He never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the Yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . 
But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . 
Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him . 
Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . 
The storm greatly pleased him . 
His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . 
Each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . 
It mattered not that they made him sea-sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation . 
Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . 
Everything had gone so well till now ! 
Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master 's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . 
Had the hour of adversity come ? 
Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . 
The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . 
Poor fellow ! 
Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . 
Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . 
He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions . 
He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising . 
Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind . 
On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable . 
Passepartout cleared up with the weather . 
Some of the sails were unfurled , and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed . 
The time lost could not , however , be regained . 
Land was not signalled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th ; the steamer was due on the 5th . 
Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the Yokohama steamer would , of course , be missed . 
The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong . 
Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . 
He had confided his anxiety to Fix who -- the sly rascal ! 
-- tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put Passepartout in a passion . 
Mr. Fogg , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama . 
`` At high tide to-morrow morning , '' answered the pilot . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg , without betraying any astonishment . 
Passepartout , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck . 
`` What is the steamer 's name ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` The Carnatic . '' 
`` Ought she not to have gone yesterday ? '' 
`` Yes , sir ; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow . '' 
`` Thank you , '' returned Mr. Fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon . 
Passepartout clasped the pilot 's hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , `` Pilot , you are the best of good fellows ! '' 
The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . 
He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong . 
At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore . 
Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . 
Mr. Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour . 
The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong , and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama ; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama , this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific . 
He found himself , then , about twenty-four hours behind-hand , thirty-five days after leaving London . 
The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning . 
Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there , which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative . 
On landing , he conducted her to a palanquin , in which they repaired to the Club Hotel . 
A room was engaged for the young woman , and Mr. Fogg , after seeing that she wanted for nothing , set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh . 
He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return , that Aouda might not be left entirely alone . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange , where , he did not doubt , every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant . 
Meeting a broker , he made the inquiry , to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before , and , retiring from business with an immense fortune , had taken up his residence in Europe -- in Holland the broker thought , with the merchants of which country he had principally traded . 
Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel , begged a moment 's conversation with Aouda , and without more ado , apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong , but probably in Holland . 
Aouda at first said nothing . 
She passed her hand across her forehead , and reflected a few moments . 
Then , in her sweet , soft voice , she said : `` What ought I to do , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` It is very simple , '' responded the gentleman . 
`` Go on to Europe . '' 
`` But I can not intrude -- '' `` You do not intrude , nor do you in the least embarrass my project . 
Passepartout ! '' 
`` Monsieur . '' 
`` Go to the Carnatic , and engage three cabins . '' 
Passepartout , delighted that the young woman , who was very gracious to him , was going to continue the journey with them , went off at a brisk gait to obey his master 's order . 
Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin , after the war of 1842 ; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port . 
The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River , and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao , on the opposite coast . 
Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade , and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place . 
Docks , hospitals , wharves , a Gothic cathedral , a government house , macadamised streets , give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes . 
Passepartout wandered , with his hands in his pockets , towards the Victoria port , gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance , and the groups of Chinese , Japanese , and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets . 
Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay , Calcutta , and Singapore , since , like them , it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy . 
At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations : English , French , American , and Dutch , men-of-war and trading vessels , Japanese and Chinese junks , sempas , tankas , and flower-boats , which formed so many floating parterres . 
Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow . 
On going into a barber 's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old , at which age they are permitted to wear yellow , which is the Imperial colour . 
Passepartout , without exactly knowing why , thought this very funny . 
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic , he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down . 
The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed . 
`` This is bad , '' muttered Passepartout , `` for the gentlemen of the Reform Club ! '' 
He accosted Fix with a merry smile , as if he had not perceived that gentleman 's chagrin . 
The detective had , indeed , good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him . 
The warrant had not come ! 
It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days ; and , this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg 's route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him . 
`` Well , Monsieur Fix , '' said Passepartout , `` have you decided to go with us so far as America ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Fix , through his set teeth . 
`` Good ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , laughing heartily . 
`` I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us . 
Come and engage your berth . '' 
They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons . 
The clerk , as he gave them the tickets , informed them that , the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed , the steamer would leave that very evening , and not next morning , as had been announced . 
`` That will suit my master all the better , '' said Passepartout . 
`` I will go and let him know . '' 
Fix now decided to make a bold move ; he resolved to tell Passepartout all . 
It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong . 
He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay . 
On entering , they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated , at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions . 
Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep . 
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer , porter , gin , and brandy ; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose . 
From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed . 
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots . 
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity ! 
The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws . 
It passed gradually from the rich , to whom it was at first exclusively reserved , to the lower classes , and then its ravages could not be arrested . 
Opium is smoked everywhere , at all times , by men and women , in the Celestial Empire ; and , once accustomed to it , the victims can not dispense with it , except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies . 
A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day ; but he dies in five years . 
It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout , in search of a friendly glass , found themselves . 
Passepartout had no money , but willingly accepted Fix 's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time . 
They ordered two bottles of port , to which the Frenchman did ample justice , whilst Fix observed him with close attention . 
They chatted about the journey , and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them . 
When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic . 
Fix caught him by the arm , and said , `` Wait a moment . '' 
`` What for , Mr. Fix ? '' 
`` I want to have a serious talk with you . '' 
`` A serious talk ! '' 
cried Passepartout , drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass . 
`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . '' 
`` Stay ! 
What I have to say concerns your master . '' 
Passepartout , at this , looked attentively at his companion . 
Fix 's face seemed to have a singular expression . 
He resumed his seat . 
`` What is it that you have to say ? '' 
Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Passepartout , smiling . 
`` Then I 'm going to tell you everything -- '' `` Now that I know everything , my friend ! 
Ah ! 
that 's very good . 
But go on , go on . 
First , though , let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense . '' 
`` Useless ! '' 
said Fix . 
`` You speak confidently . 
It 's clear that you do n't know how large the sum is . '' 
`` Of course I do , '' returned Passepartout . 
`` Twenty thousand pounds . '' 
`` Fifty-five thousand ! '' 
answered Fix , pressing his companion 's hand . 
`` What ! '' 
cried the Frenchman . 
`` Has Monsieur Fogg dared -- fifty-five thousand pounds ! 
Well , there 's all the more reason for not losing an instant , '' he continued , getting up hastily . 
Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair , and resumed : `` Fifty-five thousand pounds ; and if I succeed , I get two thousand pounds . 
If you 'll help me , I 'll let you have five hundred of them . '' 
`` Help you ? '' 
cried Passepartout , whose eyes were standing wide open .
