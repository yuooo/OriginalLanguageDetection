`` Excuse me , '' said he , `` if my age deprives me of the honour of accompanying you . 
The King will receive you in a manner that can not displease you ; and no doubt you will make an allowance for the customs of the country , if some things should not be to your liking . '' 
Candide and Cacambo got into the coach , the six sheep flew , and in less than four hours they reached the King 's palace situated at the extremity of the capital . 
The portal was two hundred and twenty feet high , and one hundred wide ; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it was built . 
It is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority over those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones . 
Twenty beautiful damsels of the King 's guard received Candide and Cacambo as they alighted from the coach , conducted them to the bath , and dressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds ; after which the great crown officers , of both sexes , led them to the King 's apartment , between two files of musicians , a thousand on each side . 
When they drew near to the audience chamber Cacambo asked one of the great officers in what way he should pay his obeisance to his Majesty ; whether they should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs ; whether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their backs ; whether they should lick the dust off the floor ; in a word , what was the ceremony ? 
`` The custom , '' said the great officer , `` is to embrace the King , and to kiss him on each cheek . '' 
Candide and Cacambo threw themselves round his Majesty 's neck . 
He received them with all the goodness imaginable , and politely invited them to supper . 
While waiting they were shown the city , and saw the public edifices raised as high as the clouds , the market places ornamented with a thousand columns , the fountains of spring water , those of rose water , those of liqueurs drawn from sugar-cane , incessantly flowing into the great squares , which were paved with a kind of precious stone , which gave off a delicious fragrancy like that of cloves and cinnamon . 
Candide asked to see the court of justice , the parliament . 
They told him they had none , and that they were strangers to lawsuits . 
He asked if they had any prisons , and they answered no . 
But what surprised him most and gave him the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences , where he saw a gallery two thousand feet long , and filled with instruments employed in mathematics and physics . 
After rambling about the city the whole afternoon , and seeing but a thousandth part of it , they were reconducted to the royal palace , where Candide sat down to table with his Majesty , his valet Cacambo , and several ladies . 
Never was there a better entertainment , and never was more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his Majesty . 
Cacambo explained the King 's bon-mots to Candide , and notwithstanding they were translated they still appeared to be bon-mots . 
Of all the things that surprised Candide this was not the least . 
They spent a month in this hospitable place . 
Candide frequently said to Cacambo : `` I own , my friend , once more that the castle where I was born is nothing in comparison with this ; but , after all , Miss Cunegonde is not here , and you have , without doubt , some mistress in Europe . 
If we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest , whereas , if we return to our old world , only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of El Dorado , we shall be richer than all the kings in Europe . 
We shall have no more Inquisitors to fear , and we may easily recover Miss Cunegonde . '' 
This speech was agreeable to Cacambo ; mankind are so fond of roving , of making a figure in their own country , and of boasting of what they have seen in their travels , that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer so , but to ask his Majesty 's leave to quit the country . 
`` You are foolish , '' said the King . 
`` I am sensible that my kingdom is but a small place , but when a person is comfortably settled in any part he should abide there . 
I have not the right to detain strangers . 
It is a tyranny which neither our manners nor our laws permit . 
All men are free . 
Go when you wish , but the going will be very difficult . 
It is impossible to ascend that rapid river on which you came as by a miracle , and which runs under vaulted rocks . 
The mountains which surround my kingdom are ten thousand feet high , and as steep as walls ; they are each over ten leagues in breadth , and there is no other way to descend them than by precipices . 
However , since you absolutely wish to depart , I shall give orders to my engineers to construct a machine that will convey you very safely . 
When we have conducted you over the mountains no one can accompany you further , for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the kingdom , and they are too wise to break it . 
Ask me besides anything that you please . '' 
`` We desire nothing of your Majesty , '' says Candide , `` but a few sheep laden with provisions , pebbles , and the earth of this country . '' 
The King laughed . 
`` I can not conceive , '' said he , `` what pleasure you Europeans find in our yellow clay , but take as much as you like , and great good may it do you . '' 
At once he gave directions that his engineers should construct a machine to hoist up these two extraordinary men out of the kingdom . 
Three thousand good mathematicians went to work ; it was ready in fifteen days , and did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that country . 
They placed Candide and Cacambo on the machine . 
There were two great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were beyond the mountains , twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions , thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country , and fifty with gold , diamonds , and precious stones . 
The King embraced the two wanderers very tenderly . 
Their departure , with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep were hoisted over the mountains , was a splendid spectacle . 
The mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of safety , and Candide had no other desire , no other aim , than to present his sheep to Miss Cunegonde . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` we are able to pay the Governor of Buenos Ayres if Miss Cunegonde can be ransomed . 
Let us journey towards Cayenne . 
Let us embark , and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase . '' 
Our travellers spent the first day very agreeably . 
They were delighted with possessing more treasure than all Asia , Europe , and Africa could scrape together . 
Candide , in his raptures , cut Cunegonde 's name on the trees . 
The second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass , where they and their burdens were lost ; two more died of fatigue a few days after ; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert ; and others subsequently fell down precipices . 
At length , after travelling a hundred days , only two sheep remained . 
Said Candide to Cacambo : `` My friend , you see how perishable are the riches of this world ; there is nothing solid but virtue , and the happiness of seeing Cunegonde once more . '' 
`` I grant all you say , '' said Cacambo , `` but we have still two sheep remaining , with more treasure than the King of Spain will ever have ; and I see a town which I take to be Surinam , belonging to the Dutch . 
We are at the end of all our troubles , and at the beginning of happiness . '' 
As they drew near the town , they saw a negro stretched upon the ground , with only one moiety of his clothes , that is , of his blue linen drawers ; the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand . 
`` Good God ! '' 
said Candide in Dutch , `` what art thou doing there , friend , in that shocking condition ? '' 
`` I am waiting for my master , Mynheer Vanderdendur , the famous merchant , '' answered the negro . 
`` Was it Mynheer Vanderdendur , '' said Candide , `` that treated thee thus ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' said the negro , `` it is the custom . 
They give us a pair of linen drawers for our whole garment twice a year . 
When we work at the sugar-canes , and the mill snatches hold of a finger , they cut off the hand ; and when we attempt to run away , they cut off the leg ; both cases have happened to me . 
This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe . 
Yet when my mother sold me for ten patagons on the coast of Guinea , she said to me : ` My dear child , bless our fetiches , adore them for ever ; they will make thee live happily ; thou hast the honour of being the slave of our lords , the whites , which is making the fortune of thy father and mother . ' 
Alas ! 
I know not whether I have made their fortunes ; this I know , that they have not made mine . 
Dogs , monkeys , and parrots are a thousand times less wretched than I . 
The Dutch fetiches , who have converted me , declare every Sunday that we are all of us children of Adam -- blacks as well as whites . 
I am not a genealogist , but if these preachers tell truth , we are all second cousins . 
Now , you must agree , that it is impossible to treat one 's relations in a more barbarous manner . '' 
`` Oh , Pangloss ! '' 
cried Candide , `` thou hadst not guessed at this abomination ; it is the end . 
I must at last renounce thy optimism . '' 
`` What is this optimism ? '' 
said Cacambo . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Candide , `` it is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong . '' 
Looking at the negro , he shed tears , and weeping , he entered Surinam . 
The first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in the harbour which could be sent to Buenos Ayres . 
The person to whom they applied was a Spanish sea-captain , who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms . 
He appointed to meet them at a public-house , whither Candide and the faithful Cacambo went with their two sheep , and awaited his coming . 
Candide , who had his heart upon his lips , told the Spaniard all his adventures , and avowed that he intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde . 
`` Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres , '' said the seaman . 
`` I should be hanged , and so would you . 
The fair Cunegonde is my lord 's favourite mistress . '' 
This was a thunderclap for Candide : he wept for a long while . 
At last he drew Cacambo aside . 
`` Here , my dear friend , '' said he to him , `` this thou must do . 
We have , each of us in his pocket , five or six millions in diamonds ; you are more clever than I ; you must go and bring Miss Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres . 
If the Governor makes any difficulty , give him a million ; if he will not relinquish her , give him two ; as you have not killed an Inquisitor , they will have no suspicion of you ; I 'll get another ship , and go and wait for you at Venice ; that 's a free country , where there is no danger either from Bulgarians , Abares , Jews , or Inquisitors . '' 
Cacambo applauded this wise resolution . 
He despaired at parting from so good a master , who had become his intimate friend ; but the pleasure of serving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him . 
They embraced with tears ; Candide charged him not to forget the good old woman . 
Cacambo set out that very same day . 
This Cacambo was a very honest fellow . 
Candide stayed some time longer in Surinam , waiting for another captain to carry him and the two remaining sheep to Italy . 
After he had hired domestics , and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage , Mynheer Vanderdendur , captain of a large vessel , came and offered his services . 
`` How much will you charge , '' said he to this man , `` to carry me straight to Venice -- me , my servants , my baggage , and these two sheep ? '' 
The skipper asked ten thousand piastres . 
Candide did not hesitate . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself , `` this stranger gives ten thousand piastres unhesitatingly ! 
He must be very rich . '' 
Returning a little while after , he let him know that upon second consideration , he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand piastres . 
`` Well , you shall have them , '' said Candide . 
`` Ay ! '' 
said the skipper to himself , `` this man agrees to pay twenty thousand piastres with as much ease as ten . '' 
He went back to him again , and declared that he could not carry him to Venice for less than thirty thousand piastres . 
`` Then you shall have thirty thousand , '' replied Candide . 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
said the Dutch skipper once more to himself , `` thirty thousand piastres are a trifle to this man ; surely these sheep must be laden with an immense treasure ; let us say no more about it . 
First of all , let him pay down the thirty thousand piastres ; then we shall see . '' 
Candide sold two small diamonds , the least of which was worth more than what the skipper asked for his freight . 
He paid him in advance . 
The two sheep were put on board . 
Candide followed in a little boat to join the vessel in the roads . 
The skipper seized his opportunity , set sail , and put out to sea , the wind favouring him . 
Candide , dismayed and stupefied , soon lost sight of the vessel . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said he , `` this is a trick worthy of the old world ! '' 
He put back , overwhelmed with sorrow , for indeed he had lost sufficient to make the fortune of twenty monarchs . 
He waited upon the Dutch magistrate , and in his distress he knocked over loudly at the door . 
He entered and told his adventure , raising his voice with unnecessary vehemence . 
The magistrate began by fining him ten thousand piastres for making a noise ; then he listened patiently , promised to examine into his affair at the skipper 's return , and ordered him to pay ten thousand piastres for the expense of the hearing . 
This drove Candide to despair ; he had , indeed , endured misfortunes a thousand times worse ; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper who had robbed him , roused his choler and flung him into a deep melancholy . 
The villainy of mankind presented itself before his imagination in all its deformity , and his mind was filled with gloomy ideas . 
At length hearing that a French vessel was ready to set sail for Bordeaux , as he had no sheep laden with diamonds to take along with him he hired a cabin at the usual price . 
He made it known in the town that he would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastres to any honest man who would make the voyage with him , upon condition that this man was the most dissatisfied with his state , and the most unfortunate in the whole province . 
Such a crowd of candidates presented themselves that a fleet of ships could hardly have held them . 
Candide being desirous of selecting from among the best , marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be sociable men , and who all pretended to merit his preference . 
He assembled them at his inn , and gave them a supper on condition that each took an oath to relate his history faithfully , promising to choose him who appeared to be most justly discontented with his state , and to bestow some presents upon the rest . 
They sat until four o'clock in the morning . 
Candide , in listening to all their adventures , was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to Buenos Ayres , and of her wager that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes . 
He dreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him . 
`` This Pangloss , '' said he , `` would be puzzled to demonstrate his system . 
I wish that he were here . 
Certainly , if all things are good , it is in El Dorado and not in the rest of the world . '' 
At length he made choice of a poor man of letters , who had worked ten years for the booksellers of Amsterdam . 
He judged that there was not in the whole world a trade which could disgust one more . 
This philosopher was an honest man ; but he had been robbed by his wife , beaten by his son , and abandoned by his daughter who got a Portuguese to run away with her . 
He had just been deprived of a small employment , on which he subsisted ; and he was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam , who took him for a Socinian . 
We must allow that the others were at least as wretched as he ; but Candide hoped that the philosopher would entertain him during the voyage . 
All the other candidates complained that Candide had done them great injustice ; but he appeased them by giving one hundred piastres to each . 
The old philosopher , whose name was Martin , embarked then with Candide for Bordeaux . 
They had both seen and suffered a great deal ; and if the vessel had sailed from Surinam to Japan , by the Cape of Good Hope , the subject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain one another during the whole voyage . 
Candide , however , had one great advantage over Martin , in that he always hoped to see Miss Cunegonde ; whereas Martin had nothing at all to hope . 
Besides , Candide was possessed of money and jewels , and though he had lost one hundred large red sheep , laden with the greatest treasure upon earth ; though the knavery of the Dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his mind ; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left , and when he mentioned the name of Cunegonde , especially towards the latter end of a repast , he inclined to Pangloss 's doctrine . 
`` But you , Mr. Martin , '' said he to the philosopher , `` what do you think of all this ? 
what are your ideas on moral and natural evil ? '' 
`` Sir , '' answered Martin , `` our priests accused me of being a Socinian , but the real fact is I am a Manichean . '' 
`` You jest , '' said Candide ; `` there are no longer Manicheans in the world . '' 
`` I am one , '' said Martin . 
`` I can not help it ; I know not how to think otherwise . '' 
`` Surely you must be possessed by the devil , '' said Candide . 
`` He is so deeply concerned in the affairs of this world , '' answered Martin , `` that he may very well be in me , as well as in everybody else ; but I own to you that when I cast an eye on this globe , or rather on this little ball , I can not help thinking that God has abandoned it to some malignant being . 
I except , always , El Dorado . 
I scarcely ever knew a city that did not desire the destruction of a neighbouring city , nor a family that did not wish to exterminate some other family . 
Everywhere the weak execrate the powerful , before whom they cringe ; and the powerful beat them like sheep whose wool and flesh they sell . 
A million regimented assassins , from one extremity of Europe to the other , get their bread by disciplined depredation and murder , for want of more honest employment . 
Even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace , and where the arts flourish , the inhabitants are devoured by more envy , care , and uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town . 
Secret griefs are more cruel than public calamities . 
In a word I have seen so much , and experienced so much that I am a Manichean . '' 
`` There are , however , some things good , '' said Candide . 
`` That may be , '' said Martin ; `` but I know them not . '' 
In the middle of this dispute they heard the report of cannon ; it redoubled every instant . 
Each took out his glass . 
They saw two ships in close fight about three miles off . 
The wind brought both so near to the French vessel that our travellers had the pleasure of seeing the fight at their ease . 
At length one let off a broadside , so low and so truly aimed , that the other sank to the bottom . 
Candide and Martin could plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sinking vessel ; they raised their hands to heaven and uttered terrible outcries , and the next moment were swallowed up by the sea . 
`` Well , '' said Martin , `` this is how men treat one another . '' 
`` It is true , '' said Candide ; `` there is something diabolical in this affair . '' 
While speaking , he saw he knew not what , of a shining red , swimming close to the vessel . 
They put out the long-boat to see what it could be : it was one of his sheep ! 
Candide was more rejoiced at the recovery of this one sheep than he had been grieved at the loss of the hundred laden with the large diamonds of El Dorado . 
The French captain soon saw that the captain of the victorious vessel was a Spaniard , and that the other was a Dutch pirate , and the very same one who had robbed Candide . 
The immense plunder which this villain had amassed , was buried with him in the sea , and out of the whole only one sheep was saved . 
`` You see , '' said Candide to Martin , `` that crime is sometimes punished . 
This rogue of a Dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserved . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Martin ; `` but why should the passengers be doomed also to destruction ? 
God has punished the knave , and the devil has drowned the rest . '' 
The French and Spanish ships continued their course , and Candide continued his conversation with Martin . 
They disputed fifteen successive days , and on the last of those fifteen days , they were as far advanced as on the first . 
But , however , they chatted , they communicated ideas , they consoled each other . 
Candide caressed his sheep . 
`` Since I have found thee again , '' said he , `` I may likewise chance to find my Cunegonde . '' 
At length they descried the coast of France . 
`` Were you ever in France , Mr. Martin ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` Yes , '' said Martin , `` I have been in several provinces . 
In some one-half of the people are fools , in others they are too cunning ; in some they are weak and simple , in others they affect to be witty ; in all , the principal occupation is love , the next is slander , and the third is talking nonsense . '' 
`` But , Mr. Martin , have you seen Paris ? '' 
`` Yes , I have . 
All these kinds are found there . 
It is a chaos -- a confused multitude , where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it , at least as it appeared to me . 
I made a short stay there . 
On my arrival I was robbed of all I had by pickpockets at the fair of St. Germain . 
I myself was taken for a robber and was imprisoned for eight days , after which I served as corrector of the press to gain the money necessary for my return to Holland on foot . 
I knew the whole scribbling rabble , the party rabble , the fanatic rabble . 
It is said that there are very polite people in that city , and I wish to believe it . '' 
`` For my part , I have no curiosity to see France , '' said Candide . 
`` You may easily imagine that after spending a month at El Dorado I can desire to behold nothing upon earth but Miss Cunegonde . 
I go to await her at Venice . 
We shall pass through France on our way to Italy . 
Will you bear me company ? '' 
`` With all my heart , '' said Martin . 
`` It is said that Venice is fit only for its own nobility , but that strangers meet with a very good reception if they have a good deal of money . 
I have none of it ; you have , therefore I will follow you all over the world . '' 
`` But do you believe , '' said Candide , `` that the earth was originally a sea , as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the captain ? '' 
`` I do not believe a word of it , '' said Martin , `` any more than I do of the many ravings which have been published lately . '' 
`` But for what end , then , has this world been formed ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` To plague us to death , '' answered Martin . 
`` Are you not greatly surprised , '' continued Candide , `` at the love which these two girls of the Oreillons had for those monkeys , of which I have already told you ? '' 
`` Not at all , '' said Martin . 
`` I do not see that that passion was strange . 
I have seen so many extraordinary things that I have ceased to be surprised . '' 
`` Do you believe , '' said Candide , `` that men have always massacred each other as they do to-day , that they have always been liars , cheats , traitors , ingrates , brigands , idiots , thieves , scoundrels , gluttons , drunkards , misers , envious , ambitious , bloody-minded , calumniators , debauchees , fanatics , hypocrites , and fools ? '' 
`` Do you believe , '' said Martin , `` that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they have found them ? '' 
`` Yes , without doubt , '' said Candide . 
`` Well , then , '' said Martin , `` if hawks have always had the same character why should you imagine that men may have changed theirs ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Candide , `` there is a vast deal of difference , for free will -- '' And reasoning thus they arrived at Bordeaux . 
Candide stayed in Bordeaux no longer than was necessary for the selling of a few of the pebbles of El Dorado , and for hiring a good chaise to hold two passengers ; for he could not travel without his Philosopher Martin . 
He was only vexed at parting with his sheep , which he left to the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences , who set as a subject for that year 's prize , `` to find why this sheep 's wool was red ; '' and the prize was awarded to a learned man of the North , who demonstrated by A plus B minus C divided by Z , that the sheep must be red , and die of the rot . 
Meanwhile , all the travellers whom Candide met in the inns along his route , said to him , `` We go to Paris . '' 
This general eagerness at length gave him , too , a desire to see this capital ; and it was not so very great a détour from the road to Venice . 
He entered Paris by the suburb of St. Marceau , and fancied that he was in the dirtiest village of Westphalia . 
Scarcely was Candide arrived at his inn , than he found himself attacked by a slight illness , caused by fatigue . 
As he had a very large diamond on his finger , and the people of the inn had taken notice of a prodigiously heavy box among his baggage , there were two physicians to attend him , though he had never sent for them , and two devotees who warmed his broths . 
`` I remember , '' Martin said , `` also to have been sick at Paris in my first voyage ; I was very poor , thus I had neither friends , devotees , nor doctors , and I recovered . '' 
However , what with physic and bleeding , Candide 's illness became serious . 
A parson of the neighborhood came with great meekness to ask for a bill for the other world payable to the bearer . 
Candide would do nothing for him ; but the devotees assured him it was the new fashion . 
He answered that he was not a man of fashion . 
Martin wished to throw the priest out of the window . 
The priest swore that they would not bury Candide . 
Martin swore that he would bury the priest if he continued to be troublesome . 
The quarrel grew heated . 
Martin took him by the shoulders and roughly turned him out of doors ; which occasioned great scandal and a law-suit . 
Candide got well again , and during his convalescence he had very good company to sup with him . 
They played high . 
Candide wondered why it was that the ace never came to him ; but Martin was not at all astonished . 
Among those who did him the honours of the town was a little Abbé of Perigord , one of those busybodies who are ever alert , officious , forward , fawning , and complaisant ; who watch for strangers in their passage through the capital , tell them the scandalous history of the town , and offer them pleasure at all prices . 
He first took Candide and Martin to La Comédie , where they played a new tragedy . 
Candide happened to be seated near some of the fashionable wits . 
This did not prevent his shedding tears at the well-acted scenes . 
One of these critics at his side said to him between the acts : `` Your tears are misplaced ; that is a shocking actress ; the actor who plays with her is yet worse ; and the play is still worse than the actors . 
The author does not know a word of Arabic , yet the scene is in Arabia ; moreover he is a man that does not believe in innate ideas ; and I will bring you , to-morrow , twenty pamphlets written against him . '' 
`` How many dramas have you in France , sir ? '' 
said Candide to the Abbé . 
`` Five or six thousand . '' 
`` What a number ! '' 
said Candide . 
`` How many good ? '' 
`` Fifteen or sixteen , '' replied the other . 
`` What a number ! '' 
said Martin . 
Candide was very pleased with an actress who played Queen Elizabeth in a somewhat insipid tragedy sometimes acted . 
`` That actress , '' said he to Martin , `` pleases me much ; she has a likeness to Miss Cunegonde ; I should be very glad to wait upon her . '' 
The Perigordian Abbé offered to introduce him . 
Candide , brought up in Germany , asked what was the etiquette , and how they treated queens of England in France . 
`` It is necessary to make distinctions , '' said the Abbé . 
`` In the provinces one takes them to the inn ; in Paris , one respects them when they are beautiful , and throws them on the highway when they are dead . '' 
`` Queens on the highway ! '' 
said Candide . 
`` Yes , truly , '' said Martin , `` the Abbé is right . 
I was in Paris when Miss Monime passed , as the saying is , from this life to the other . 
She was refused what people call the honours of sepulture -- that is to say , of rotting with all the beggars of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery ; she was interred all alone by her company at the corner of the Rue de Bourgogne , which ought to trouble her much , for she thought nobly . '' 
`` That was very uncivil , '' said Candide . 
`` What would you have ? '' 
said Martin ; `` these people are made thus . 
Imagine all contradictions , all possible incompatibilities -- you will find them in the government , in the law-courts , in the churches , in the public shows of this droll nation . '' 
`` Is it true that they always laugh in Paris ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` Yes , '' said the Abbé , `` but it means nothing , for they complain of everything with great fits of laughter ; they even do the most detestable things while laughing . '' 
`` Who , '' said Candide , `` is that great pig who spoke so ill of the piece at which I wept , and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure ? '' 
`` He is a bad character , '' answered the Abbé , `` who gains his livelihood by saying evil of all plays and of all books . 
He hates whatever succeeds , as the eunuchs hate those who enjoy ; he is one of the serpents of literature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite ; he is a folliculaire . '' 
`` What is a folliculaire ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` It is , '' said the Abbé , `` a pamphleteer -- a Fréron . '' 
Thus Candide , Martin , and the Perigordian conversed on the staircase , while watching every one go out after the performance . 
`` Although I am eager to see Cunegonde again , '' said Candide , `` I should like to sup with Miss Clairon , for she appears to me admirable . '' 
The Abbé was not the man to approach Miss Clairon , who saw only good company . 
`` She is engaged for this evening , '' he said , `` but I shall have the honour to take you to the house of a lady of quality , and there you will know Paris as if you had lived in it for years . '' 
Candide , who was naturally curious , let himself be taken to this lady 's house , at the end of the Faubourg St. Honoré . 
The company was occupied in playing faro ; a dozen melancholy punters held each in his hand a little pack of cards ; a bad record of his misfortunes . 
Profound silence reigned ; pallor was on the faces of the punters , anxiety on that of the banker , and the hostess , sitting near the unpitying banker , noticed with lynx-eyes all the doubled and other increased stakes , as each player dog 's - eared his cards ; she made them turn down the edges again with severe , but polite attention ; she showed no vexation for fear of losing her customers . 
The lady insisted upon being called the Marchioness of Parolignac . 
Her daughter , aged fifteen , was among the punters , and notified with a covert glance the cheatings of the poor people who tried to repair the cruelties of fate . 
The Perigordian Abbé , Candide and Martin entered ; no one rose , no one saluted them , no one looked at them ; all were profoundly occupied with their cards . 
`` The Baroness of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was more polite , '' said Candide . 
However , the Abbé whispered to the Marchioness , who half rose , honoured Candide with a gracious smile , and Martin with a condescending nod ; she gave a seat and a pack of cards to Candide , who lost fifty thousand francs in two deals , after which they supped very gaily , and every one was astonished that Candide was not moved by his loss ; the servants said among themselves , in the language of servants : -- `` Some English lord is here this evening . '' 
The supper passed at first like most Parisian suppers , in silence , followed by a noise of words which could not be distinguished , then with pleasantries of which most were insipid , with false news , with bad reasoning , a little politics , and much evil speaking ; they also discussed new books . 
`` Have you seen , '' said the Perigordian Abbé , `` the romance of Sieur Gauchat , doctor of divinity ? '' 
`` Yes , '' answered one of the guests , `` but I have not been able to finish it . 
We have a crowd of silly writings , but all together do not approach the impertinence of ` Gauchat , Doctor of Divinity . ' 
I am so satiated with the great number of detestable books with which we are inundated that I am reduced to punting at faro . '' 
`` And the Mélanges of Archdeacon Trublet , what do you say of that ? '' 
said the Abbé . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the Marchioness of Parolignac , `` the wearisome mortal ! 
How curiously he repeats to you all that the world knows ! 
How heavily he discusses that which is not worth the trouble of lightly remarking upon ! 
How , without wit , he appropriates the wit of others ! 
How he spoils what he steals ! 
How he disgusts me ! 
But he will disgust me no longer -- it is enough to have read a few of the Archdeacon 's pages . '' 
There was at table a wise man of taste , who supported the Marchioness . 
They spoke afterwards of tragedies ; the lady asked why there were tragedies which were sometimes played and which could not be read . 
The man of taste explained very well how a piece could have some interest , and have almost no merit ; he proved in few words that it was not enough to introduce one or two of those situations which one finds in all romances , and which always seduce the spectator , but that it was necessary to be new without being odd , often sublime and always natural , to know the human heart and to make it speak ; to be a great poet without allowing any person in the piece to appear to be a poet ; to know language perfectly -- to speak it with purity , with continuous harmony and without rhythm ever taking anything from sense . 
`` Whoever , '' added he , `` does not observe all these rules can produce one or two tragedies , applauded at a theatre , but he will never be counted in the ranks of good writers . 
There are very few good tragedies ; some are idylls in dialogue , well written and well rhymed , others political reasonings which lull to sleep , or amplifications which repel ; others demoniac dreams in barbarous style , interrupted in sequence , with long apostrophes to the gods , because they do not know how to speak to men , with false maxims , with bombastic commonplaces ! '' 
Candide listened with attention to this discourse , and conceived a great idea of the speaker , and as the Marchioness had taken care to place him beside her , he leaned towards her and took the liberty of asking who was the man who had spoken so well . 
`` He is a scholar , '' said the lady , `` who does not play , whom the Abbé sometimes brings to supper ; he is perfectly at home among tragedies and books , and he has written a tragedy which was hissed , and a book of which nothing has ever been seen outside his bookseller 's shop excepting the copy which he dedicated to me . '' 
`` The great man ! '' 
said Candide . 
`` He is another Pangloss ! '' 
Then , turning towards him , he said : `` Sir , you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and physical world , and that nothing could be otherwise than it is ? '' 
`` I , sir ! '' 
answered the scholar , `` I know nothing of all that ; I find that all goes awry with me ; that no one knows either what is his rank , nor what is his condition , what he does nor what he ought to do ; and that except supper , which is always gay , and where there appears to be enough concord , all the rest of the time is passed in impertinent quarrels ; Jansenist against Molinist , Parliament against the Church , men of letters against men of letters , courtesans against courtesans , financiers against the people , wives against husbands , relatives against relatives -- it is eternal war . '' 
`` I have seen the worst , '' Candide replied . 
`` But a wise man , who since has had the misfortune to be hanged , taught me that all is marvellously well ; these are but the shadows on a beautiful picture . '' 
`` Your hanged man mocked the world , '' said Martin . 
`` The shadows are horrible blots . '' 
`` They are men who make the blots , '' said Candide , `` and they can not be dispensed with . '' 
`` It is not their fault then , '' said Martin . 
Most of the punters , who understood nothing of this language , drank , and Martin reasoned with the scholar , and Candide related some of his adventures to his hostess . 
After supper the Marchioness took Candide into her boudoir , and made him sit upon a sofa . 
`` Ah , well ! '' 
said she to him , `` you love desperately Miss Cunegonde of Thunder-ten-Tronckh ? '' 
`` Yes , madame , '' answered Candide . 
The Marchioness replied to him with a tender smile : `` You answer me like a young man from Westphalia . 
A Frenchman would have said , ` It is true that I have loved Miss Cunegonde , but seeing you , madame , I think I no longer love her . ' '' 
`` Alas ! 
madame , '' said Candide , `` I will answer you as you wish . '' 
`` Your passion for her , '' said the Marchioness , `` commenced by picking up her handkerchief . 
I wish that you would pick up my garter . '' 
`` With all my heart , '' said Candide . 
And he picked it up . 
`` But I wish that you would put it on , '' said the lady . 
And Candide put it on . 
`` You see , '' said she , `` you are a foreigner . 
I sometimes make my Parisian lovers languish for fifteen days , but I give myself to you the first night because one must do the honours of one 's country to a young man from Westphalia . '' 
The lady having perceived two enormous diamonds upon the hands of the young foreigner praised them with such good faith that from Candide 's fingers they passed to her own . 
Candide , returning with the Perigordian Abbé , felt some remorse in having been unfaithful to Miss Cunegonde . 
The Abbé sympathised in his trouble ; he had had but a light part of the fifty thousand francs lost at play and of the value of the two brilliants , half given , half extorted . 
His design was to profit as much as he could by the advantages which the acquaintance of Candide could procure for him . 
He spoke much of Cunegonde , and Candide told him that he should ask forgiveness of that beautiful one for his infidelity when he should see her in Venice . 
The Abbé redoubled his politeness and attentions , and took a tender interest in all that Candide said , in all that he did , in all that he wished to do . 
`` And so , sir , you have a rendezvous at Venice ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur Abbé , '' answered Candide . 
`` It is absolutely necessary that I go to meet Miss Cunegonde . '' 
And then the pleasure of talking of that which he loved induced him to relate , according to his custom , part of his adventures with the fair Westphalian . 
`` I believe , '' said the Abbé , `` that Miss Cunegonde has a great deal of wit , and that she writes charming letters ? '' 
`` I have never received any from her , '' said Candide , `` for being expelled from the castle on her account I had not an opportunity for writing to her . 
Soon after that I heard she was dead ; then I found her alive ; then I lost her again ; and last of all , I sent an express to her two thousand five hundred leagues from here , and I wait for an answer . '' 
The Abbé listened attentively , and seemed to be in a brown study . 
He soon took his leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace . 
The following day Candide received , on awaking , a letter couched in these terms : `` My very dear love , for eight days I have been ill in this town . 
I learn that you are here . 
I would fly to your arms if I could but move . 
I was informed of your passage at Bordeaux , where I left faithful Cacambo and the old woman , who are to follow me very soon . 
The Governor of Buenos Ayres has taken all , but there remains to me your heart . 
Come ! 
your presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure . '' 
This charming , this unhoped-for letter transported Candide with an inexpressible joy , and the illness of his dear Cunegonde overwhelmed him with grief . 
Divided between those two passions , he took his gold and his diamonds and hurried away , with Martin , to the hotel where Miss Cunegonde was lodged . 
He entered her room trembling , his heart palpitating , his voice sobbing ; he wished to open the curtains of the bed , and asked for a light . 
`` Take care what you do , '' said the servant-maid ; `` the light hurts her , '' and immediately she drew the curtain again . 
`` My dear Cunegonde , '' said Candide , weeping , `` how are you ? 
If you can not see me , at least speak to me . '' 
`` She can not speak , '' said the maid . 
The lady then put a plump hand out from the bed , and Candide bathed it with his tears and afterwards filled it with diamonds , leaving a bag of gold upon the easy chair . 
In the midst of these transports in came an officer , followed by the Abbé and a file of soldiers . 
`` There , '' said he , `` are the two suspected foreigners , '' and at the same time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison . 
`` Travellers are not treated thus in El Dorado , '' said Candide . 
`` I am more a Manichean now than ever , '' said Martin . 
`` But pray , sir , where are you going to carry us ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` To a dungeon , '' answered the officer . 
Martin , having recovered himself a little , judged that the lady who acted the part of Cunegonde was a cheat , that the Perigordian Abbé was a knave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of Candide , and that the officer was another knave whom they might easily silence . 
Candide , advised by Martin and impatient to see the real Cunegonde , rather than expose himself before a court of justice , proposed to the officer to give him three small diamonds , each worth about three thousand pistoles . 
`` Ah , sir , '' said the man with the ivory baton , `` had you committed all the imaginable crimes you would be to me the most honest man in the world . 
Three diamonds ! 
Each worth three thousand pistoles ! 
Sir , instead of carrying you to jail I would lose my life to serve you . 
There are orders for arresting all foreigners , but leave it to me . 
I have a brother at Dieppe in Normandy ! 
I 'll conduct you thither , and if you have a diamond to give him he 'll take as much care of you as I would . '' 
`` And why , '' said Candide , `` should all foreigners be arrested ? '' 
`` It is , '' the Perigordian Abbé then made answer , `` because a poor beggar of the country of Atrébatie heard some foolish things said . 
This induced him to commit a parricide , not such as that of 1610 in the month of May , but such as that of 1594 in the month of December , and such as others which have been committed in other years and other months by other poor devils who had heard nonsense spoken . '' 
The officer then explained what the Abbé meant . 
`` Ah , the monsters ! ''
