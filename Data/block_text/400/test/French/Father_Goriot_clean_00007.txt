A father sees his children as God sees all of us ; he looks into the very depths of their hearts ; he knows their intentions ; and both of them are so loving . 
Oh ! 
if I only had good sons-in-law , I should be too happy , and I dare say there is no perfect happiness here below . 
If I might live with them -- simply hear their voices , know that they are there , see them go and come as I used to do at home when they were still with me ; why , my heart bounds at the thought ... . 
Were they nicely dressed ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Eugene . 
`` But , M. Goriot , how is it that your daughters have such fine houses , while you live in such a den as this ? '' 
`` Dear me , why should I want anything better ? '' 
he replied , with seeming carelessness . 
`` I ca n't quite explain to you how it is ; I am not used to stringing words together properly , but it all lies there -- '' he said , tapping his heart . 
`` My real life is in my two girls , you see ; and so long as they are happy , and smartly dressed , and have soft carpets under their feet , what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down of a night ? 
I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm ; I shall never feel dull if they are laughing . 
I have no troubles but theirs . 
When you , too , are a father , and you hear your children 's little voices , you will say to yourself , ` That has all come from me . ' 
You will feel that those little ones are akin to every drop in your veins , that they are the very flower of your life -LRB- and what else are they ? -RRB- 
; you will cleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make . 
Everywhere I hear their voices sounding in my ears . 
If they are sad , the look in their eyes freezes my blood . 
Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another 's happiness than in your own . 
It is something that I can not explain , something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you . 
In short , I live my life three times over . 
Shall I tell you something funny ? 
Well , then , since I have been a father , I have come to understand God . 
He is everywhere in the world , because the whole world comes from Him . 
And it is just the same with my children , monsieur . 
Only , I love my daughters better than God loves the world , for the world is not so beautiful as God Himself is , but my children are more beautiful than I am . 
Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening . 
Great Heaven ! 
If any man would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved , I would black his boots and run on his errands . 
That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur ; I know all about him from her maid . 
A longing to wring his neck comes over me now and then . 
He does not love her ! 
does not love a pearl of a woman , with a voice like a nightingale and shaped like a model . 
Where can her eyes have been when she married that great lump of an Alsatian ? 
They ought both of them to have married young men , good-looking and good-tempered -- but , after all , they had their own way . '' 
Father Goriot was sublime . 
Eugene had never yet seen his face light up as it did now with the passionate fervor of a father 's love . 
It is worthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive power ; the roughest nature , in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection , communicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the voice , and eloquence into every gesture , wrought a change in the very features of the speaker ; for under the inspiration of passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas , if not of language , and seems to move in some sphere of light . 
In the old man 's tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell that a great actor exerts over his audience . 
But does not the poet in us find expression in our affections ? 
`` Well , '' said Eugene , `` perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long . 
That sprig of fashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne . 
For my part , I fell in love with Mme. Delphine this evening . '' 
`` Stuff ! '' 
said Father Goriot . 
`` I did indeed , and she did not regard me with aversion . 
For a whole hour we talked of love , and I am to go to call on her on Saturday , the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` Oh ! 
how I should love you , if she should like you . 
You are kind-hearted ; you would never make her miserable . 
If you were to forsake her , I would cut your throat at once . 
A woman does not love twice , you see ! 
Good heavens ! 
what nonsense I am talking , M. Eugene ! 
It is cold ; you ought not to stay here . 
Mon Dieu ! 
so you have heard her speak ? 
What message did she give you for me ? '' 
`` None at all , '' said Eugene to himself ; aloud he answered , `` She told me to tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss . '' 
`` Good-night , neighbor ! 
Sleep well , and pleasant dreams to you ! 
I have mine already made for me by that message from her . 
May God grant you all your desires ! 
You have come in like a good angel on me to-night , and brought with you the air that my daughter breathes . '' 
`` Poor old fellow ! '' 
said Eugene as he lay down . 
`` It is enough to melt a heart of stone . 
His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand Turk . '' 
Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend , a confidant such as he had never hoped to find ; and there was established between the two the only relationship that could attach this old man to another man . 
The passions never miscalculate . 
Father Goriot felt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine ; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the Baroness should care for Eugene . 
Moreover , he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man . 
Mme. de Nucingen , for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily , had never known the joys of love . 
Eugene was certainly -LRB- to make use of his own expression -RRB- one of the nicest young men that he had ever seen , and some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness which had not been hers . 
These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the old man and his neighbor ; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery . 
The affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene , by whom he seated himself at breakfast , the change in Goriot 's face , which as a rule , looked as expressionless as a plaster cast , and a few words that passed between the two , surprised the other lodgers . 
Vautrin , who saw Eugene for the first time since their interview , seemed as if he would fain read the student 's very soul . 
During the night Eugene had had some time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him ; and now , as he remembered yesterday 's proposal , the thought of Mlle. Taillefer 's dowry came , of course , to his mind , and he could not help thinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress . 
It chanced that their eyes met . 
The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugene looked very handsome in his new clothes . 
So much was said in the glance , thus exchanged , that Eugene could not doubt but that he was associated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl 's heart and gather round the first attractive newcomer . 
`` Eight hundred thousand francs ! '' 
a voice cried in his ears , but suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening , thinking that his extemporized passion for Mme. de Nucingen was a talisman that would preserve him from this temptation . 
`` They gave Rossini 's Barber of Seville at the Italiens yesterday evening , '' he remarked . 
`` I never heard such delicious music . 
Good gracious ! 
how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens ! '' 
Father Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall , and watched him as a dog watches his master 's slightest movement . 
`` You men are like fighting cocks , '' said Mme. Vauquer ; `` you do what you like . '' 
`` How did you get back ? '' 
inquired Vautrin . 
`` I walked , '' answered Eugene . 
`` For my own part , '' remarked the tempter , `` I do not care about doing things by halves . 
If I want to enjoy myself that way , I should prefer to go in my carriage , sit in my own box , and do the thing comfortably . 
Everything or nothing ; that is my motto . '' 
`` And a good one , too , '' commented Mme. Vauquer . 
`` Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day , '' said Eugene , addressing Goriot in an undertone . 
`` She will welcome you with open arms , I am sure ; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me . 
I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin Mme. de Beauseant ; do n't forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this . '' 
Rastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit . 
He had no mind to stay a moment longer than was necessary in that odious house . 
He wasted his time that day ; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth . 
Vautrin 's arguments had set him meditating on social life , and he was deep in these reflections when he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg . 
`` What makes you look so solemn ? '' 
said the medical student , putting an arm through Eugene 's as they went towards the Palais . 
`` I am tormented by temptations . '' 
`` What kind ? 
There is a cure for temptation . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Yielding to it . '' 
`` You laugh , but you do n't know what it is all about . 
Have you read Rousseau ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere force of wishing it , and without stirring from Paris ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , then ? '' 
`` Pshaw ! 
I am at my thirty-third mandarin . '' 
`` Seriously , though . 
Look here , suppose you were sure that you could do it , and had only to give a nod . 
Would you do it ? '' 
`` Is he well stricken in years , this mandarin of yours ? 
Pshaw ! 
after all , young or old , paralytic , or well and sound , my word for it . 
... Well , then . 
Hang it , no ! '' 
`` You are a good fellow , Bianchon . 
But suppose you loved a woman well enough to lose your soul in hell for her , and that she wanted money for dresses and a carriage , and all her whims , in fact ? '' 
`` Why , here you are taking away my reason , and want me to reason ! '' 
`` Well , then , Bianchon , I am mad ; bring me to my senses . 
I have two sisters as beautiful and innocent as angels , and I want them to be happy . 
How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in the next five years ? 
Now and then in life , you see , you must play for heavy stakes , and it is no use wasting your luck on low play . '' 
`` But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the outset of his life , and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword . 
If that is the way of it , dear boy , you must be an Alexander , or to the hulks you go . 
For my own part , I am quite contented with the little lot I mean to make for myself somewhere in the country , when I mean to step into my father 's shoes and plod along . 
A man 's affections are just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference . 
Napoleon himself could only dine once , and he could not have more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins . 
Happiness , old man , depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your head ; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis , the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you , and is just exactly the same in any case . 
I am for letting that Chinaman live . '' 
`` Thank you , Bianchon ; you have done me good . 
We will always be friends . '' 
`` I say , '' remarked the medical student , as they came to the end of a broad walk in the Jardin des Plantes , `` I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see in last year 's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies ; he seems to me , in fact , to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman . 
Let us keep an eye on that couple ; I will tell you why some time . 
Good-bye ; it is nearly four o'clock , and I must be in to answer to my name . '' 
When Eugene reached the lodging-house , he found Father Goriot waiting for him . 
`` Here , '' cried the old man , `` here is a letter from her . 
Pretty handwriting , eh ? '' 
Eugene broke the seal and read : -- `` Sir , -- I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian music . 
I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of accepting a seat in my box . 
La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on Saturday , so I am sure that you will not refuse me . 
M. de Nucingen and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us ; we shall be quite by ourselves . 
If you will come and be my escort , my husband will be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties . 
Do not answer , but simply come . 
-- Yours sincerely , D. DE N. '' `` Let me see it , '' said Father Goriot , when Eugene had read the letter . 
`` You are going , are n't you ? '' 
he added , when he had smelled the writing-paper . 
`` How nice it smells ! 
Her fingers have touched it , that is certain . '' 
`` A woman does not fling herself at a man 's head in this way , '' the student was thinking . 
`` She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay ; nothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this . '' 
`` Well , '' said Father Goriot , `` what are you thinking about ? '' 
Eugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those days ; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a banker 's wife would go to almost any length . 
For the coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle , and the women who moved in it were at that time the queens of society ; and among the greatest of these Dames du Petit-Chateau , as they were called , were Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the Duchesse de Maufrigneause . 
Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausee-d'Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their sex . 
But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead , and kept his judgment cool , and the not altogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions . 
`` Yes , I am going , '' he replied . 
So it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen ; while , if she had treated him disdainfully , passion perhaps might have brought him to her feet . 
Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow , and the hour when he could go to her . 
There is almost as much charm for a young man in a first flirtation as there is in first love . 
The certainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do not confess , and all the charm of certain women lies in this . 
The desire of conquest springs no less from the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph , and every passion is excited or sustained by one or the other of these two motives which divide the empire of love . 
Perhaps this division is one result of the great question of temperaments ; which , after all , dominates social life . 
The melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of coquetry , while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too stubborn resistance . 
In other words , the lymphatic temperament is essentially despondent , and the rhapsodic is bilious . 
Eugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little details that is grateful to a young man 's self-love , though he will not own to it for fear of being laughed at . 
He thought , as he arranged his hair , that a pretty woman 's glances would wander through the dark curls . 
He indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance , and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the creases of his coat . 
`` There are worse figures , that is certain , '' he said to himself . 
Then he went downstairs , just as the rest of the household were sitting down to dinner , and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited by his elegant appearance . 
The amazement with which any attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait . 
No one can put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it . 
`` Clk ! 
clk ! 
clk ! '' 
cried Bianchon , making the sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth , like a driver urging on a horse . 
`` He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` Are you going a-courting ? '' 
inquired Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Cock-a-doodle-doo ! '' 
cried the artist . 
`` My compliments to my lady your wife , '' from the employe at the Museum . 
`` Your wife ; have you a wife ? '' 
asked Poiret . 
`` Yes , in compartments , water-tight and floats , guaranteed fast color , all prices from twenty-five to forty sous , neat check patterns in the latest fashion and best taste , will wash , half-linen , half-cotton , half-wool ; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the Royal College of Physicians ! 
children like it ! 
a remedy for headache , indigestion , and all other diseases affecting the throat , eyes , and ears ! '' 
cried Vautrin , with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a fair . 
`` And how much shall we say for this marvel , gentlemen ? 
Twopence ? 
No . 
Nothing of the sort . 
All that is left in stock after supplying the Great Mogul . 
All the crowned heads of Europe , including the Gr-r-rand Duke of Baden , have been anxious to get a sight of it . 
Walk up ! 
walk up ! 
gentlemen ! 
Pay at the desk as you go in ! 
Strike up the music there ! 
Brooum , la , la , trinn ! 
la , la , boum ! 
boum ! 
Mister Clarinette , there you are out of tune ! '' 
he added gruffly ; `` I will rap your knuckles for you ! '' 
`` Goodness ! 
what an amusing man ! '' 
said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture ; `` I should never feel dull with him in the house . '' 
This burlesque of Vautrin 's was the signal for an outburst of merriment , and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle. Taillefer ; she had leaned over to say a few words in Mme. Couture 's ear . 
`` The cab is at the door , '' announced Sylvie . 
`` But where is he going to dine ? '' 
asked Bianchon . 
`` With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen . '' 
`` M. Goriot 's daughter , '' said the law student . 
At this , all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker ; he was gazing at Eugene with something like envy in his eyes . 
Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare , one of those many-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns , which are considered the thing in Paris , a typical banker 's house , decorated in the most ostentatious fashion ; the walls lined with stucco , the landings of marble mosaic . 
Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in a little drawing-room ; the room was painted in the Italian fashion , and decorated like a restaurant . 
The Baroness seemed depressed . 
The effort that she made to hide her feelings aroused Eugene 's interest ; it was plain that she was not playing a part . 
He had expected a little flutter of excitement at his coming , and he found her dispirited and sad . 
The disappointment piqued his vanity . 
`` My claim to your confidence is very small , madame , '' he said , after rallying her on her abstracted mood ; `` but if I am in the way , please tell me so frankly ; I count on your good faith . '' 
`` No , stay with me , '' she said ; `` I shall be all alone if you go . 
Nucingen is dining in town , and I do not want to be alone ; I want to be taken out of myself . '' 
`` But what is the matter ? '' 
`` You are the very last person whom I should tell , '' she exclaimed . 
`` Then I am connected in some way in this secret . 
I wonder what it is ? '' 
`` Perhaps . 
Yet , no , '' she went on ; `` it is a domestic quarrel , which ought to be buried in the depths of the heart . 
I am very unhappy ; did I not tell you so the day before yesterday ? 
Golden chains are the heaviest of all fetters . '' 
When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy , and when the young man is clever , and well dressed , and has fifteen hundred francs lying idle in his pocket , he is sure to think as Eugene said , and he becomes a coxcomb . 
`` What can you have left to wish for ? '' 
he answered . 
`` You are young , beautiful , beloved , and rich . '' 
`` Do not let us talk of my affairs , '' she said shaking her head mournfully . 
`` We will dine together tete-a-tete , and afterwards we will go to hear the most exquisite music . 
Am I to your taste ? '' 
she went on , rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere , covered with Persian designs in the most superb taste . 
`` I wish that you were altogether mine , '' said Eugene ; `` you are charming . '' 
`` You would have a forlorn piece of property , '' she said , smiling bitterly . 
`` There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness ; and yet , in spite of appearances , I am in despair . 
I can not sleep ; my troubles have broken my night 's rest ; I shall grow ugly . '' 
`` Oh ! 
that is impossible , '' cried the law student ; `` but I am curious to know what these troubles can be that a devoted love can not efface . '' 
`` Ah ! 
if I were to tell you about them , you would shun me , '' she said . 
`` Your love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men use to masquerade in ; and , if you really loved me , you would be driven to despair . 
I must keep silence , you see . 
Let us talk of something else , for pity 's sake , '' she added . 
`` Let me show you my rooms . '' 
`` No ; let us stay here , '' answered Eugene ; he sat down on the sofa before the fire , and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen 's hand in his . 
She surrendered it to him ; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one of the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation . 
`` Listen , '' said Rastignac ; `` if you are in trouble , you ought to tell me about it . 
I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone . 
You must speak to me frankly about your troubles , so that I can put an end to them , even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men ; or I shall go , never to return . '' 
`` Very well , '' she cried , putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of despair , `` I will put you to the proof , and this very moment . 
Yes , '' she said to herself , `` I have no other resource left . '' 
She rang the bell . 
`` Are the horses put in for the master ? '' 
she asked of the servant . 
`` Yes , madame . '' 
`` I shall take his carriage myself . 
He can have mine and my horses . 
Serve dinner at seven o'clock . '' 
`` Now , come with me , '' she said to Eugene , who thought as he sat in the banker 's carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming . 
`` To the Palais-Royal , '' she said to the coachman ; `` stop near the Theatre-Francais . '' 
She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable questions that Eugene put to her . 
He was at a loss what to think of her mute resistance , her obstinate silence . 
`` Another moment and she will escape me , '' he said to himself . 
When the carriage stopped at last , the Baroness gave the law student a glance that silenced his wild words , for he was almost beside himself . 
`` Is it true that you love me ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Yes , '' he answered , and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the uneasiness that he felt . 
`` You will not think ill of me , will you , whatever I may ask of you ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Are you ready to do my bidding ? '' 
`` Blindly . '' 
`` Have you ever been to a gaming-house ? '' 
she asked in a tremulous voice . 
`` Never . '' 
`` Ah ! 
now I can breathe . 
You will have luck . 
Here is my purse , '' she said . 
`` Take it ! 
there are a hundred francs in it , all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own . 
Go up into one of the gaming-houses -- I do not know where they are , but there are some near the Palais-Royal . 
Try your luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette ; lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs . 
I will tell you about my troubles when you come back . '' 
`` Devil take me , I 'm sure , if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am about , but I will obey you , '' he added , with inward exultation , as he thought , `` She has gone too far to draw back -- she can refuse me nothing now ! '' 
Eugene took the dainty little purse , inquired the way of a second-hand clothes-dealer , and hurried to number 9 , which happened to be the nearest gaming-house . 
He mounted the staircase , surrendered his hat , and asked the way to the roulette-table , whither the attendant took him , not a little to the astonishment of the regular comers . 
All eyes were fixed on Eugene as he asked , without bashfulness , where he was to deposit his stakes . 
`` If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers , and it turns up , you will win thirty-six louis , '' said a respectable-looking , white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry . 
Eugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 -LRB- his own age -RRB- . 
There was a cry of surprise ; before he knew what he had done , he had won . 
`` Take your money off , sir , '' said the old gentleman ; `` you do n't often win twice running by that system . '' 
Eugene took the rake that the old man handed to him , and drew in his three thousand six hundred francs , and , still perfectly ignorant of what he was about , staked again on the red . 
The bystanders watched him enviously as they saw him continue to play . 
The disc turned , and again he won ; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once more . 
`` You have seven thousand , two hundred francs of your own , '' the old gentleman said in his ear . 
`` Take my advice and go away with your winnings ; red has turned up eight times already . 
If you are charitable , you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck . '' 
Rastignac 's head was swimming ; he saw ten of his louis pass into the white-haired man 's possession , and went down-stairs with his seven thousand francs ; he was still ignorant of the game , and stupefied by his luck . 
`` So , that is over ; and now where will you take me ? '' 
he asked , as soon as the door was closed , and he showed the seven thousand francs to Mme. de Nucingen . 
Delphine flung her arms about him , but there was no passion in that wild embrace . 
`` You have saved me ! '' 
she cried , and tears of joy flowed fast . 
`` I will tell you everything , my friend . 
For you will be my friend , will you not ? 
I am rich , you think , very rich ; I have everything I want , or I seem as if I had everything . 
Very well , you must know that M. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny ; he pays all the bills for the house expenses ; he pays for my carriages and opera box ; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress , and he reduces me to poverty in secret on purpose . 
I am too proud to beg from him . 
I should be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it . 
Do you ask how I , with seven hundred thousand francs of my own , could let myself be robbed ? 
It is because I was proud , and scorned to speak . 
We are so young , so artless when our married life begins ! 
I never could bring myself to ask my husband for money ; the words would have made my lips bleed , I did not dare to ask ; I spent my savings first , and then the money that my poor father gave me , then I ran into debt . 
Marriage for me is a hideous farce ; I can not talk about it , let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms , and that I would fling myself out of the window sooner than consent to any other manner of life . 
I suffered agonies when I had to confess to my girlish extravagance , my debts for jewelry and trifles -LRB- for our poor father had never refused us anything , and spoiled us -RRB- , but at last I found courage to tell him about them . 
After all , I had a fortune of my own . 
Nucingen flew into a rage ; he said that I should be the ruin of him , and used frightful language ! 
I wished myself a hundred feet down in the earth . 
He had my dowry , so he paid my debts , but he stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed sum , and I gave way for the sake of peace . 
And then , '' she went on , `` I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom you know . 
He may have deceived me , but I should do him the justice to say that there was nothing petty in his character . 
But , after all , he threw me over disgracefully . 
If , at a woman 's utmost need , somebody heaps gold upon her , he ought never to forsake her ; that love should last for ever ! 
But you , at one-and-twenty , you , the soul of honor , with the unsullied conscience of youth , will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept money in such a way ? 
Mon Dieu ! 
is it not natural to share everything with the one to whom we owe our happiness ? 
When all has been given , why should we pause and hesitate over a part ? 
Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together ceases to exist . 
Were we not bound to each other for life ? 
Who that believes in love foresees such an end to love ? 
You swear to love us eternally ; how , then , can our interests be separate ? 
`` You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give me six thousand francs ; he spends as much as that every month on his mistress , an opera dancer ! 
I thought of killing myself . 
The wildest thoughts came into my head . 
There have been moments in my life when I have envied my servants , and would have changed places with my maid . 
It was madness to think of going to our father , Anastasie and I have bled him dry ; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six thousand francs that way . 
I should have driven him frantic to no purpose . 
You have saved me from shame and death ; I was beside myself with anguish . 
Ah ! 
monsieur , I owed you this explanation after my mad ravings . 
When you left me just now , as soon as you were out of sight , I longed to escape , to run away ... where , I did not know . 
Half the women in Paris lead such lives as mine ; they live in apparent luxury , and in their souls are tormented by anxiety . 
I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I ; there are women who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills , women who rob their husbands . 
Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs , others that a shawl costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis . 
There are women , too , with narrow incomes , who scrape and save and starve their children to pay for a dress . 
I am innocent of these base meannesses . 
But this is the last extremity of my torture . 
Some women will sell themselves to their husbands , and so obtain their way , but I , at any rate , am free . 
If I chose , Nucingen would cover me with gold , but I would rather weep on the breast of a man whom I can respect . 
Ah ! 
tonight , M. de Marsay will no longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid . '' 
She tried to conceal her tears from him , hiding her face in her hands ; Eugene drew them away and looked at her ; she seemed to him sublime at that moment . 
`` It is hideous , is it not , '' she cried , `` to speak in a breath of money and affection . 
You can not love me after this , '' she added . 
The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great , and the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of society , had thrown Eugene 's thoughts into confusion ; he uttered soothing and consoling words , and wondered at the beautiful woman before him , and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain . 
`` You will not remember this against me ? '' 
she asked ; `` promise me that you will not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
madame , I am incapable of doing so , '' he said .

`` In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns , for I really ought to go halves with you . '' 
Eugene 's maiden conscience resisted ; but when the Baroness said , `` I am bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy , '' he took the money .

`` Oh , if you would that I should be anything to you , swear to me that you will never re-enter a gaming-house . 
Great Heaven ! 
that I should corrupt you ! 
I should die of sorrow ! '' 
They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time . 
The contrast between the ostentation of wealth in the house , and the wretched condition of its mistress , dazed the student ; and Vautrin 's cynical words began to ring in his ears . 
`` Seat yourself there , '' said the Baroness , pointing to a low chair beside the fire . 
`` I have a difficult letter to write , '' she added . 
`` Tell me what to say . '' 
`` Say nothing , '' Eugene answered her . 
`` Put the bills in an envelope , direct it , and send it by your maid . '' 
`` Why , you are a love of a man , '' she said .
