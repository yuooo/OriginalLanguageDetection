My daily vows rose for revenge -- a deep and deadly revenge , such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured . 
`` After some weeks my wound healed , and I continued my journey . 
The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring ; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure . 
`` But my toils now drew near a close , and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva . 
`` It was evening when I arrived , and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you . 
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura . 
`` At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection , which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child , who came running into the recess I had chosen , with all the sportiveness of infancy . 
Suddenly , as I gazed on him , an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity . 
If , therefore , I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend , I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth . 
`` Urged by this impulse , I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me . 
As soon as he beheld my form , he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream ; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said , ` Child , what is the meaning of this ? 
I do not intend to hurt you ; listen to me . ' 
`` He struggled violently . 
` Let me go , ' he cried ; ` monster ! 
Ugly wretch ! 
You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces . 
You are an ogre . 
Let me go , or I will tell my papa . ' '' 
` Boy , you will never see your father again ; you must come with me . ' '' 
` Hideous monster ! 
Let me go . 
My papa is a syndic -- he is M. Frankenstein -- he will punish you . 
You dare not keep me . ' '' 
` Frankenstein ! 
you belong then to my enemy -- to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge ; you shall be my first victim . ' 
`` The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart ; I grasped his throat to silence him , and in a moment he lay dead at my feet . 
`` I gazed on my victim , and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph ; clapping my hands , I exclaimed , ' I too can create desolation ; my enemy is not invulnerable ; this death will carry despair to him , and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him . ' 
`` As I fixed my eyes on the child , I saw something glittering on his breast . 
I took it ; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman . 
In spite of my malignity , it softened and attracted me . 
For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes , fringed by deep lashes , and her lovely lips ; but presently my rage returned ; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would , in regarding me , have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright . 
`` Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage ? 
I only wonder that at that moment , instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony , I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them . 
`` While I was overcome by these feelings , I left the spot where I had committed the murder , and seeking a more secluded hiding-place , I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty . 
A woman was sleeping on some straw ; she was young , not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held , but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health . 
Here , I thought , is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me . 
And then I bent over her and whispered , ` Awake , fairest , thy lover is near -- he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes ; my beloved , awake ! ' 
`` The sleeper stirred ; a thrill of terror ran through me . 
Should she indeed awake , and see me , and curse me , and denounce the murderer ? 
Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me . 
The thought was madness ; it stirred the fiend within me -- not I , but she , shall suffer ; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me , she shall atone . 
The crime had its source in her ; be hers the punishment ! 
Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man , I had learned now to work mischief . 
I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress . 
She moved again , and I fled . 
`` For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place , sometimes wishing to see you , sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever . 
At length I wandered towards these mountains , and have ranged through their immense recesses , consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify . 
We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition . 
I am alone and miserable ; man will not associate with me ; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me . 
My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects . 
This being you must create . '' 
The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply . 
But I was bewildered , perplexed , and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition . 
He continued , `` You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being . 
This you alone can do , and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede . '' 
The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers , and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me . 
`` I do refuse it , '' I replied ; `` and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me . 
You may render me the most miserable of men , but you shall never make me base in my own eyes . 
Shall I create another like yourself , whose joint wickedness might desolate the world . 
Begone ! 
I have answered you ; you may torture me , but I will never consent . '' 
`` You are in the wrong , '' replied the fiend ; `` and instead of threatening , I am content to reason with you . 
I am malicious because I am miserable . 
Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind ? 
You , my creator , would tear me to pieces and triumph ; remember that , and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me ? 
You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame , the work of your own hands . 
Shall I respect man when he condemns me ? 
Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness , and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance . 
But that can not be ; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union . 
Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery . 
I will revenge my injuries ; if I can not inspire love , I will cause fear , and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy , because my creator , do I swear inextinguishable hatred . 
Have a care ; I will work at your destruction , nor finish until I desolate your heart , so that you shall curse the hour of your birth . '' 
A fiendish rage animated him as he said this ; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold ; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded -- `` I intended to reason . 
This passion is detrimental to me , for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess . 
If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me , I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold ; for that one creature 's sake I would make peace with the whole kind ! 
But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that can not be realized . 
What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate ; I demand a creature of another sex , but as hideous as myself ; the gratification is small , but it is all that I can receive , and it shall content me . 
It is true , we shall be monsters , cut off from all the world ; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another . 
Our lives will not be happy , but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel . 
Oh ! 
My creator , make me happy ; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit ! 
Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing ; do not deny me my request ! '' 
I was moved . 
I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent , but I felt that there was some justice in his argument . 
His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations , and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow ? 
He saw my change of feeling and continued , `` If you consent , neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again ; I will go to the vast wilds of South America . 
My food is not that of man ; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite ; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment . 
My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare . 
We shall make our bed of dried leaves ; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food . 
The picture I present to you is peaceful and human , and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty . 
Pitiless as you have been towards me , I now see compassion in your eyes ; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire . '' 
`` You propose , '' replied I , `` to fly from the habitations of man , to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions . 
How can you , who long for the love and sympathy of man , persevere in this exile ? 
You will return and again seek their kindness , and you will meet with their detestation ; your evil passions will be renewed , and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction . 
This may not be ; cease to argue the point , for I can not consent . '' 
`` How inconstant are your feelings ! 
But a moment ago you were moved by my representations , and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints ? 
I swear to you , by the earth which I inhabit , and by you that made me , that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell , as it may chance , in the most savage of places . 
My evil passions will have fled , for I shall meet with sympathy ! 
My life will flow quietly away , and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker . '' 
His words had a strange effect upon me . 
I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him , but when I looked upon him , when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked , my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred . 
I tried to stifle these sensations ; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him , I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow . 
`` You swear , '' I said , `` to be harmless ; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you ? 
May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge ? '' 
`` How is this ? 
I must not be trifled with , and I demand an answer . 
If I have no ties and no affections , hatred and vice must be my portion ; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes , and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant . 
My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor , and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal . 
I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded . '' 
I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed . 
I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him . 
His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations ; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with . 
After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request . 
Turning to him , therefore , I said , `` I consent to your demand , on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever , and every other place in the neighbourhood of man , as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile . '' 
`` I swear , '' he cried , `` by the sun , and by the blue sky of heaven , and by the fire of love that burns my heart , that if you grant my prayer , while they exist you shall never behold me again . 
Depart to your home and commence your labours ; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety ; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear . '' 
Saying this , he suddenly quitted me , fearful , perhaps , of any change in my sentiments . 
I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle , and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice . 
His tale had occupied the whole day , and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed . 
I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley , as I should soon be encompassed in darkness ; but my heart was heavy , and my steps slow . 
The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me , occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced . 
Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain . 
The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them ; the dark pines rose before me , and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground ; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me . 
I wept bitterly , and clasping my hands in agony , I exclaimed , `` Oh ! 
Stars and clouds and winds , ye are all about to mock me ; if ye really pity me , crush sensation and memory ; let me become as nought ; but if not , depart , depart , and leave me in darkness . '' 
These were wild and miserable thoughts , but I can not describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me . 
Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix ; I took no rest , but returned immediately to Geneva . 
Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations -- they weighed on me with a mountain 's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them . 
Thus I returned home , and entering the house , presented myself to the family . 
My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm , but I answered no question , scarcely did I speak . 
I felt as if I were placed under a ban -- as if I had no right to claim their sympathies -- as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them . 
Yet even thus I loved them to adoration ; and to save them , I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task . 
The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream , and that thought only had to me the reality of life . 
Day after day , week after week , passed away on my return to Geneva ; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work . 
I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend , yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me . 
I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition . 
I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher , the knowledge of which was material to my success , and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father 's consent to visit England for this purpose ; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me . 
A change indeed had taken place in me ; my health , which had hitherto declined , was now much restored ; and my spirits , when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise , rose proportionably . 
My father saw this change with pleasure , and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy , which every now and then would return by fits , and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine . 
At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude . 
I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat , watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves , silent and listless . 
But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure , and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart . 
It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father , calling me aside , thus addressed me , `` I am happy to remark , my dear son , that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself . 
And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society . 
For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this , but yesterday an idea struck me , and if it is well founded , I conjure you to avow it . 
Reserve on such a point would be not only useless , but draw down treble misery on us all . '' 
I trembled violently at his exordium , and my father continued -- `` I confess , my son , that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years . 
You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy ; you studied together , and appeared , in dispositions and tastes , entirely suited to one another . 
But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it . 
You , perhaps , regard her as your sister , without any wish that she might become your wife . 
Nay , you may have met with another whom you may love ; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth , this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel . '' 
`` My dear father , reassure yourself . 
I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely . 
I never saw any woman who excited , as Elizabeth does , my warmest admiration and affection . 
My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union . '' 
`` The expression of your sentiments of this subject , my dear Victor , gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced . 
If you feel thus , we shall assuredly be happy , however present events may cast a gloom over us . 
But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate . 
Tell me , therefore , whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage . 
We have been unfortunate , and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities . 
You are younger ; yet I do not suppose , possessed as you are of a competent fortune , that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed . 
Do not suppose , however , that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness . 
Interpret my words with candour and answer me , I conjure you , with confidence and sincerity . '' 
I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply . 
I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion . 
Alas ! 
To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay . 
I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break , or if I did , what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family ! 
Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground ? 
I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace . 
I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking . 
The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory ; besides , I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father 's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved . 
I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur , the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror . 
I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command , all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation . 
I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed . 
Once commenced , it would quickly be achieved , and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness . 
My promise fulfilled , the monster would depart forever . 
Or -LRB- so my fond fancy imaged -RRB- some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever . 
These feelings dictated my answer to my father . 
I expressed a wish to visit England , but concealing the true reasons of this request , I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion , while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply . 
After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects , he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey , and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would , before my return , have restored me entirely to myself . 
The duration of my absence was left to my own choice ; a few months , or at most a year , was the period contemplated . 
One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion . 
Without previously communicating with me , he had , in concert with Elizabeth , arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg . 
This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task ; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment , and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely , maddening reflection . 
Nay , Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe . 
If I were alone , would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress ? 
To England , therefore , I was bound , and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return . 
My father 's age rendered him extremely averse to delay . 
For myself , there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils -- one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings ; it was the prospect of that day when , enfranchised from my miserable slavery , I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her . 
I now made arrangements for my journey , but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation . 
During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks , exasperated as he might be by my departure . 
But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go , and would he not accompany me to England ? 
This imagination was dreadful in itself , but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends . 
I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen . 
But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment ; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations . 
It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country . 
My journey had been my own suggestion , and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced , but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering , away from her , the inroads of misery and grief . 
It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval -- and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman 's sedulous attention . 
She longed to bid me hasten my return ; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful , silent farewell . 
I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away , hardly knowing whither I was going , and careless of what was passing around . 
I remembered only , and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it , to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me . 
Filled with dreary imaginations , I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes , but my eyes were fixed and unobserving . 
I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured . 
After some days spent in listless indolence , during which I traversed many leagues , I arrived at Strasbourg , where I waited two days for Clerval . 
He came . 
Alas , how great was the contrast between us ! 
He was alive to every new scene , joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun , and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day . 
He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky . 
`` This is what it is to live , '' he cried ; `` how I enjoy existence ! 
But you , my dear Frankenstein , wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful ! '' 
In truth , I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine . 
And you , my friend , would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval , who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight , than in listening to my reflections . 
I , a miserable wretch , haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment . 
We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam , whence we might take shipping for London . 
During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns . 
We stayed a day at Mannheim , and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg , arrived at Mainz . 
The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque . 
The river descends rapidly and winds between hills , not high , but steep , and of beautiful forms . 
We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices , surrounded by black woods , high and inaccessible . 
This part of the Rhine , indeed , presents a singularly variegated landscape . 
In one spot you view rugged hills , ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices , with the dark Rhine rushing beneath ; and on the sudden turn of a promontory , flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene . 
We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream . 
Even I , depressed in mind , and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings , even I was pleased . 
I lay at the bottom of the boat , and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky , I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger . 
And if these were my sensations , who can describe those of Henry ? 
He felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man . 
`` I have seen , '' he said , `` the most beautiful scenes of my own country ; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri , where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water , casting black and impenetrable shades , which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay appearance ; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest , when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean ; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain , where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind ; I have seen the mountains of La Valais , and the Pays de Vaud ; but this country , Victor , pleases me more than all those wonders . 
The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange , but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled . 
Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice ; and that also on the island , almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees ; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines ; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain . 
Oh , surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country . '' 
Clerval ! 
Beloved friend ! 
Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving . 
He was a being formed in the `` very poetry of nature . '' 
His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart . 
His soul overflowed with ardent affections , and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination . 
But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind . 
The scenery of external nature , which others regard only with admiration , he loved with ardour : -- -- The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion : the tall rock , The mountain , and the deep and gloomy wood , Their colours and their forms , were then to him An appetite ; a feeling , and a love , That had no need of a remoter charm , By thought supplied , or any interest Unborrow 'd from the eye .

And where does he now exist ? 
Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever ? 
Has this mind , so replete with ideas , imaginations fanciful and magnificent , which formed a world , whose existence depended on the life of its creator ; -- has this mind perished ? 
Does it now only exist in my memory ? 
No , it is not thus ; your form so divinely wrought , and beaming with beauty , has decayed , but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend . 
Pardon this gush of sorrow ; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry , but they soothe my heart , overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates . 
I will proceed with my tale . 
Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland ; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way , for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us . 
Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery , but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam , whence we proceeded by sea to England . 
It was on a clear morning , in the latter days of December , that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain . 
The banks of the Thames presented a new scene ; they were flat but fertile , and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story . 
We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada , Gravesend , Woolwich , and Greenwich -- places which I had heard of even in my country . 
At length we saw the numerous steeples of London , St. Paul 's towering above all , and the Tower famed in English history . 
London was our present point of rest ; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city . 
Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time , but this was with me a secondary object ; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me , addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers . 
If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness , it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure . 
But a blight had come over my existence , and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound . 
Company was irksome to me ; when alone , I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth ; the voice of Henry soothed me , and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace . 
But busy , uninteresting , joyous faces brought back despair to my heart . 
I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men ; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine , and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish . 
But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self ; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction . 
The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement . 
He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view . 
His design was to visit India , in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages , and in the views he had taken of its society , the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade . 
In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan . 
He was forever busy , and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind . 
I tried to conceal this as much as possible , that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life , undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection . 
I often refused to accompany him , alleging another engagement , that I might remain alone . 
I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation , and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head . 
Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish , and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver , and my heart to palpitate . 
After passing some months in London , we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva . 
He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth , where he resided . 
Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation , and I , although I abhorred society , wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places . 
We had arrived in England at the beginning of October , and it was now February . 
We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month . 
In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh , but to visit Windsor , Oxford , Matlock , and the Cumberland lakes , resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July . 
I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected , resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland . 
We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor , rambling in its beautiful forest . 
This was a new scene to us mountaineers ; the majestic oaks , the quantity of game , and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us . 
From thence we proceeded to Oxford . 
As we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before . 
It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces . 
This city had remained faithful to him , after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty . 
The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions , the amiable Falkland , the insolent Goring , his queen , and son , gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited . 
The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here , and we delighted to trace its footsteps . 
If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification , the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration . 
The colleges are ancient and picturesque ; the streets are almost magnificent ; and the lovely Isis , which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure , is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters , which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers , and spires , and domes , embosomed among aged trees . 
I enjoyed this scene , and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future . 
I was formed for peaceful happiness . 
During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind , and if I was ever overcome by ennui , the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits . 
But I am a blasted tree ; the bolt has entered my soul ; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be -- a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity , pitiable to others and intolerable to myself . 
We passed a considerable period at Oxford , rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history . 
Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves . 
We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell . 
For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers . 
For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit , but the iron had eaten into my flesh , and I sank again , trembling and hopeless , into my miserable self . 
We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock , which was our next place of rest . 
The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled , to a greater degree , the scenery of Switzerland ; but everything is on a lower scale , and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country . 
We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history , where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix . 
The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry , and I hastened to quit Matlock , with which that terrible scene was thus associated . 
From Derby , still journeying northwards , we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland . 
I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains . 
The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains , the lakes , and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me . 
Here also we made some acquaintances , who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness . 
The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine ; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent , and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors . 
`` I could pass my life here , '' said he to me ; `` and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine . '' 
But he found that a traveller 's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments . 
His feelings are forever on the stretch ; and when he begins to sink into repose , he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new , which again engages his attention , and which also he forsakes for other novelties . 
We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached , and we left them to travel on . 
For my own part I was not sorry . 
I had now neglected my promise for some time , and I feared the effects of the daemon 's disappointment . 
He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives . 
This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace . 
I waited for my letters with feverish impatience ; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears ; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father , I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate . 
Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion . 
When these thoughts possessed me , I would not quit Henry for a moment , but followed him as his shadow , to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer . 
I felt as if I had committed some great crime , the consciousness of which haunted me . 
I was guiltless , but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head , as mortal as that of crime . 
I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind ; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being . 
Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford , for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him . 
But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh , its romantic castle and its environs , the most delightful in the world , Arthur 's Seat , St. Bernard 's Well , and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration . 
But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey . 
We left Edinburgh in a week , passing through Coupar , St. Andrew 's , and along the banks of the Tay , to Perth , where our friend expected us . 
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest ; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone . 
`` Do you , '' said I , `` enjoy yourself , and let this be our rendezvous . 
I may be absent a month or two ; but do not interfere with my motions , I entreat you ; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time ; and when I return , I hope it will be with a lighter heart , more congenial to your own temper . '' 
Henry wished to dissuade me , but seeing me bent on this plan , ceased to remonstrate . 
He entreated me to write often . 
`` I had rather be with you , '' he said , `` in your solitary rambles , than with these Scotch people , whom I do not know ; hasten , then , my dear friend , to return , that I may again feel myself somewhat at home , which I can not do in your absence . '' 
Having parted from my friend , I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude . 
I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished , that he might receive his companion . 
With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours . 
It was a place fitted for such a work , being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves . 
The soil was barren , scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows , and oatmeal for its inhabitants , which consisted of five persons , whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare . 
Vegetables and bread , when they indulged in such luxuries , and even fresh water , was to be procured from the mainland , which was about five miles distant . 
On the whole island there were but three miserable huts , and one of these was vacant when I arrived . 
This I hired . 
It contained but two rooms , and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury . 
The thatch had fallen in , the walls were unplastered , and the door was off its hinges . 
I ordered it to be repaired , bought some furniture , and took possession , an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty . 
As it was , I lived ungazed at and unmolested , hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave , so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men . 
In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour ; but in the evening , when the weather permitted , I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet . 
It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene . 
I thought of Switzerland ; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape . 
Its hills are covered with vines , and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains . 
Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky , and when troubled by the winds , their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean . 
In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived , but as I proceeded in my labour , it became every day more horrible and irksome to me . 
Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days , and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work . 
It was , indeed , a filthy process in which I was engaged . 
During my first experiment , a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment ; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour , and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings . 
But now I went to it in cold blood , and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands . 
Thus situated , employed in the most detestable occupation , immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged , my spirits became unequal ; I grew restless and nervous . 
Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor . 
Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground , fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold . 
I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion . 
In the mean time I worked on , and my labour was already considerably advanced . 
I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope , which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom . 
I sat one evening in my laboratory ; the sun had set , and the moon was just rising from the sea ; I had not sufficient light for my employment , and I remained idle , in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it . 
As I sat , a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing . 
Three years before , I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse . 
I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant ; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight , for its own sake , in murder and wretchedness . 
He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts , but she had not ; and she , who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal , might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation . 
They might even hate each other ; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity , and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form ? 
She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man ; she might quit him , and he be again alone , exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species . 
Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world , yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children , and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror . 
Had I right , for my own benefit , to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations ? 
I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created ; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats ; but now , for the first time , the wickedness of my promise burst upon me ; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest , whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price , perhaps , of the existence of the whole human race . 
I trembled and my heart failed within me , when , on looking up , I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement . 
A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me , where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me . 
Yes , he had followed me in my travels ; he had loitered in forests , hid himself in caves , or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths ; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise . 
As I looked on him , his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery . 
I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him , and trembling with passion , tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged . 
The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness , and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge , withdrew . 
I left the room , and locking the door , made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours ; and then , with trembling steps , I sought my own apartment . 
I was alone ; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries . 
Several hours passed , and I remained near my window gazing on the sea ; it was almost motionless , for the winds were hushed , and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon . 
A few fishing vessels alone specked the water , and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another . 
I felt the silence , although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity , until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore , and a person landed close to my house . 
In a few minutes after , I heard the creaking of my door , as if some one endeavoured to open it softly . 
I trembled from head to foot ; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine ; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness , so often felt in frightful dreams , when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger , and was rooted to the spot . 
Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage ; the door opened , and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared . 
Shutting the door , he approached me and said in a smothered voice , `` You have destroyed the work which you began ; what is it that you intend ? 
Do you dare to break your promise ? 
I have endured toil and misery ; I left Switzerland with you ; I crept along the shores of the Rhine , among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills . 
I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland . 
I have endured incalculable fatigue , and cold , and hunger ; do you dare destroy my hopes ? '' 
`` Begone ! 
I do break my promise ; never will I create another like yourself , equal in deformity and wickedness . '' 
`` Slave , I before reasoned with you , but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension . 
Remember that I have power ; you believe yourself miserable , but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you . 
You are my creator , but I am your master ; obey ! '' 
`` The hour of my irresolution is past , and the period of your power is arrived . 
Your threats can not move me to do an act of wickedness ; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice . 
Shall I , in cool blood , set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness ? 
Begone ! 
I am firm , and your words will only exasperate my rage . '' 
The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger . 
`` Shall each man , '' cried he , `` find a wife for his bosom , and each beast have his mate , and I be alone ? 
I had feelings of affection , and they were requited by detestation and scorn .
