I had been the author of unalterable evils , and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness . 
I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime , which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past . 
There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind . 
My abhorrence of this fiend can not be conceived . 
When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth , my eyes became inflamed , and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed . 
When I reflected on his crimes and malice , my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation . 
I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes , could I when there have precipitated him to their base . 
I wished to see him again , that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine . 
Our house was the house of mourning . 
My father 's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events . 
Elizabeth was sad and desponding ; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations ; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead ; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed . 
She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects . 
The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her , and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles . 
`` When I reflect , my dear cousin , '' said she , `` on the miserable death of Justine Moritz , I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me . 
Before , I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils ; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination ; but now misery has come home , and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other 's blood . 
Yet I am certainly unjust . 
Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty ; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered , assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures . 
For the sake of a few jewels , to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend , a child whom she had nursed from its birth , and appeared to love as if it had been her own ! 
I could not consent to the death of any human being , but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men . 
But she was innocent . 
I know , I feel she was innocent ; you are of the same opinion , and that confirms me . 
Alas ! 
Victor , when falsehood can look so like the truth , who can assure themselves of certain happiness ? 
I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice , towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss . 
William and Justine were assassinated , and the murderer escapes ; he walks about the world free , and perhaps respected . 
But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes , I would not change places with such a wretch . '' 
I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony . 
I , not in deed , but in effect , was the true murderer . 
Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance , and kindly taking my hand , said , `` My dearest friend , you must calm yourself . 
These events have affected me , God knows how deeply ; but I am not so wretched as you are . 
There is an expression of despair , and sometimes of revenge , in your countenance that makes me tremble . 
Dear Victor , banish these dark passions . 
Remember the friends around you , who centre all their hopes in you . 
Have we lost the power of rendering you happy ? 
Ah ! 
While we love , while we are true to each other , here in this land of peace and beauty , your native country , we may reap every tranquil blessing -- what can disturb our peace ? '' 
And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart ? 
Even as she spoke I drew near to her , as if in terror , lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her . 
Thus not the tenderness of friendship , nor the beauty of earth , nor of heaven , could redeem my soul from woe ; the very accents of love were ineffectual . 
I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate . 
The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake , there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it , and to die , was but a type of me . 
Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me , but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek , by bodily exercise and by change of place , some relief from my intolerable sensations . 
It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home , and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys , sought in the magnificence , the eternity of such scenes , to forget myself and my ephemeral , because human , sorrows . 
My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix . 
I had visited it frequently during my boyhood . 
Six years had passed since then : I was a wreck , but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes . 
I performed the first part of my journey on horseback . 
I afterwards hired a mule , as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads . 
The weather was fine ; it was about the middle of the month of August , nearly two months after the death of Justine , that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe . 
The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve . 
The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side , the sound of the river raging among the rocks , and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence -- and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements , here displayed in their most terrific guise . 
Still , as I ascended higher , the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character . 
Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains , the impetuous Arve , and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty . 
But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps , whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all , as belonging to another earth , the habitations of another race of beings . 
I passed the bridge of Pelissier , where the ravine , which the river forms , opened before me , and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it . 
Soon after , I entered the valley of Chamounix . 
This valley is more wonderful and sublime , but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox , through which I had just passed . 
The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries , but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields . 
Immense glaciers approached the road ; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage . 
Mont Blanc , the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc , raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles , and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley . 
A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey . 
Some turn in the road , some new object suddenly perceived and recognized , reminded me of days gone by , and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood . 
The very winds whispered in soothing accents , and maternal Nature bade me weep no more . 
Then again the kindly influence ceased to act -- I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection . 
Then I spurred on my animal , striving so to forget the world , my fears , and more than all , myself -- or , in a more desperate fashion , I alighted and threw myself on the grass , weighed down by horror and despair . 
At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix . 
Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured . 
For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve , which pursued its noisy way beneath . 
The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations ; when I placed my head upon my pillow , sleep crept over me ; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion . 
I spent the following day roaming through the valley . 
I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron , which take their rise in a glacier , that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley . 
The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me ; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me ; a few shattered pines were scattered around ; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment , the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking , reverberated along the mountains , of the accumulated ice , which , through the silent working of immutable laws , was ever and anon rent and torn , as if it had been but a plaything in their hands . 
These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving . 
They elevated me from all littleness of feeling , and although they did not remove my grief , they subdued and tranquillized it . 
In some degree , also , they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month . 
I retired to rest at night ; my slumbers , as it were , waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day . 
They congregated round me ; the unstained snowy mountain-top , the glittering pinnacle , the pine woods , and ragged bare ravine , the eagle , soaring amidst the clouds -- they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace . 
Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke ? 
All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep , and dark melancholy clouded every thought . 
The rain was pouring in torrents , and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains , so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends . 
Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats . 
What were rain and storm to me ? 
My mule was brought to the door , and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert . 
I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it . 
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy . 
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life . 
I determined to go without a guide , for I was well acquainted with the path , and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene . 
The ascent is precipitous , but the path is cut into continual and short windings , which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain . 
It is a scene terrifically desolate . 
In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived , where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground , some entirely destroyed , others bent , leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees . 
The path , as you ascend higher , is intersected by ravines of snow , down which stones continually roll from above ; one of them is particularly dangerous , as the slightest sound , such as even speaking in a loud voice , produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker . 
The pines are not tall or luxuriant , but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene . 
I looked on the valley beneath ; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains , whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds , while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me . 
Alas ! 
Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute ; it only renders them more necessary beings . 
If our impulses were confined to hunger , thirst , and desire , we might be nearly free ; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us . 
We rest ; a dream has power to poison sleep . 
We rise ; one wand ` ring thought pollutes the day . 
We feel , conceive , or reason ; laugh or weep , Embrace fond woe , or cast our cares away ; It is the same : for , be it joy or sorrow , The path of its departure still is free . 
Man 's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow ; Nought may endure but mutability ! 
It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent . 
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice . 
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains . 
Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud , and I descended upon the glacier . 
The surface is very uneven , rising like the waves of a troubled sea , descending low , and interspersed by rifts that sink deep . 
The field of ice is almost a league in width , but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it . 
The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock . 
From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite , at the distance of a league ; and above it rose Mont Blanc , in awful majesty . 
I remained in a recess of the rock , gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene . 
The sea , or rather the vast river of ice , wound among its dependent mountains , whose aerial summits hung over its recesses . 
Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds . 
My heart , which was before sorrowful , now swelled with something like joy ; I exclaimed , `` Wandering spirits , if indeed ye wander , and do not rest in your narrow beds , allow me this faint happiness , or take me , as your companion , away from the joys of life . '' 
As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man , at some distance , advancing towards me with superhuman speed . 
He bounded over the crevices in the ice , among which I had walked with caution ; his stature , also , as he approached , seemed to exceed that of man . 
I was troubled ; a mist came over my eyes , and I felt a faintness seize me , but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains . 
I perceived , as the shape came nearer -LRB- sight tremendous and abhorred ! -RRB- 
that it was the wretch whom I had created . 
I trembled with rage and horror , resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat . 
He approached ; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish , combined with disdain and malignity , while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes . 
But I scarcely observed this ; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance , and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt . 
`` Devil , '' I exclaimed , `` do you dare approach me ? 
And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head ? 
Begone , vile insect ! 
Or rather , stay , that I may trample you to dust ! 
And , oh ! 
That I could , with the extinction of your miserable existence , restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered ! '' 
`` I expected this reception , '' said the daemon . 
`` All men hate the wretched ; how , then , must I be hated , who am miserable beyond all living things ! 
Yet you , my creator , detest and spurn me , thy creature , to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us . 
You purpose to kill me . 
How dare you sport thus with life ? 
Do your duty towards me , and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind . 
If you will comply with my conditions , I will leave them and you at peace ; but if you refuse , I will glut the maw of death , until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends . '' 
`` Abhorred monster ! 
Fiend that thou art ! 
The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes . 
Wretched devil ! 
You reproach me with your creation , come on , then , that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed . '' 
My rage was without bounds ; I sprang on him , impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another . 
He easily eluded me and said , `` Be calm ! 
I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head . 
Have I not suffered enough , that you seek to increase my misery ? 
Life , although it may only be an accumulation of anguish , is dear to me , and I will defend it . 
Remember , thou hast made me more powerful than thyself ; my height is superior to thine , my joints more supple . 
But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee . 
I am thy creature , and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part , the which thou owest me . 
Oh , Frankenstein , be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone , to whom thy justice , and even thy clemency and affection , is most due . 
Remember that I am thy creature ; I ought to be thy Adam , but I am rather the fallen angel , whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed . 
Everywhere I see bliss , from which I alone am irrevocably excluded . 
I was benevolent and good ; misery made me a fiend . 
Make me happy , and I shall again be virtuous . '' 
`` Begone ! 
I will not hear you . 
There can be no community between you and me ; we are enemies . 
Begone , or let us try our strength in a fight , in which one must fall . '' 
`` How can I move thee ? 
Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature , who implores thy goodness and compassion ? 
Believe me , Frankenstein , I was benevolent ; my soul glowed with love and humanity ; but am I not alone , miserably alone ? 
You , my creator , abhor me ; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures , who owe me nothing ? 
They spurn and hate me . 
The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge . 
I have wandered here many days ; the caves of ice , which I only do not fear , are a dwelling to me , and the only one which man does not grudge . 
These bleak skies I hail , for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings . 
If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence , they would do as you do , and arm themselves for my destruction . 
Shall I not then hate them who abhor me ? 
I will keep no terms with my enemies . 
I am miserable , and they shall share my wretchedness . 
Yet it is in your power to recompense me , and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great , that not only you and your family , but thousands of others , shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage . 
Let your compassion be moved , and do not disdain me . 
Listen to my tale ; when you have heard that , abandon or commiserate me , as you shall judge that I deserve . 
But hear me . 
The guilty are allowed , by human laws , bloody as they are , to speak in their own defence before they are condemned . 
Listen to me , Frankenstein . 
You accuse me of murder , and yet you would , with a satisfied conscience , destroy your own creature . 
Oh , praise the eternal justice of man ! 
Yet I ask you not to spare me ; listen to me , and then , if you can , and if you will , destroy the work of your hands . '' 
`` Why do you call to my remembrance , '' I rejoined , `` circumstances of which I shudder to reflect , that I have been the miserable origin and author ? 
Cursed be the day , abhorred devil , in which you first saw light ! 
Cursed -LRB- although I curse myself -RRB- be the hands that formed you ! 
You have made me wretched beyond expression . 
You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not . 
Begone ! 
Relieve me from the sight of your detested form . '' 
`` Thus I relieve thee , my creator , '' he said , and placed his hated hands before my eyes , which I flung from me with violence ; `` thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor . 
Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion . 
By the virtues that I once possessed , I demand this from you . 
Hear my tale ; it is long and strange , and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations ; come to the hut upon the mountain . 
The sun is yet high in the heavens ; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world , you will have heard my story and can decide . 
On you it rests , whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life , or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin . '' 
As he said this he led the way across the ice ; I followed . 
My heart was full , and I did not answer him , but as I proceeded , I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale . 
I was partly urged by curiosity , and compassion confirmed my resolution . 
I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother , and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion . 
For the first time , also , I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were , and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness . 
These motives urged me to comply with his demand . 
We crossed the ice , therefore , and ascended the opposite rock . 
The air was cold , and the rain again began to descend ; we entered the hut , the fiend with an air of exultation , I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits . 
But I consented to listen , and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted , he thus began his tale . 
`` It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being ; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct . 
A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me , and I saw , felt , heard , and smelt at the same time ; and it was , indeed , a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses . 
By degrees , I remember , a stronger light pressed upon my nerves , so that I was obliged to shut my eyes . 
Darkness then came over me and troubled me , but hardly had I felt this when , by opening my eyes , as I now suppose , the light poured in upon me again . 
I walked and , I believe , descended , but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations . 
Before , dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me , impervious to my touch or sight ; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty , with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid . 
The light became more and more oppressive to me , and the heat wearying me as I walked , I sought a place where I could receive shade . 
This was the forest near Ingolstadt ; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue , until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst . 
This roused me from my nearly dormant state , and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground . 
I slaked my thirst at the brook , and then lying down , was overcome by sleep . 
`` It was dark when I awoke ; I felt cold also , and half frightened , as it were , instinctively , finding myself so desolate . 
Before I had quitted your apartment , on a sensation of cold , I had covered myself with some clothes , but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night . 
I was a poor , helpless , miserable wretch ; I knew , and could distinguish , nothing ; but feeling pain invade me on all sides , I sat down and wept . 
`` Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure . 
I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees . 
-LSB- The moon -RSB- I gazed with a kind of wonder . 
It moved slowly , but it enlightened my path , and I again went out in search of berries . 
I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak , with which I covered myself , and sat down upon the ground . 
No distinct ideas occupied my mind ; all was confused . 
I felt light , and hunger , and thirst , and darkness ; innumerable sounds rang in my ears , and on all sides various scents saluted me ; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon , and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure . 
`` Several changes of day and night passed , and the orb of night had greatly lessened , when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other . 
I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage . 
I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound , which often saluted my ears , proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes . 
I began also to observe , with greater accuracy , the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me . 
Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable . 
Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode , but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again . 
`` The moon had disappeared from the night , and again , with a lessened form , showed itself , while I still remained in the forest . 
My sensations had by this time become distinct , and my mind received every day additional ideas . 
My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms ; I distinguished the insect from the herb , and by degrees , one herb from another . 
I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes , whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing . 
`` One day , when I was oppressed by cold , I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars , and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it . 
In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers , but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain . 
How strange , I thought , that the same cause should produce such opposite effects ! 
I examined the materials of the fire , and to my joy found it to be composed of wood . 
I quickly collected some branches , but they were wet and would not burn . 
I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire . 
The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed . 
I reflected on this , and by touching the various branches , I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood , that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire . 
When night came on and brought sleep with it , I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished . 
I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it ; and then , spreading my cloak , I lay on the ground and sank into sleep . 
`` It was morning when I awoke , and my first care was to visit the fire . 
I uncovered it , and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame . 
I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches , which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished . 
When night came again I found , with pleasure , that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food , for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted , and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees . 
I tried , therefore , to dress my food in the same manner , placing it on the live embers . 
I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation , and the nuts and roots much improved . 
`` Food , however , became scarce , and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger . 
When I found this , I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited , to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied . 
In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it . 
I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty , but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it , and wrapping myself up in my cloak , I struck across the wood towards the setting sun . 
I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country . 
A great fall of snow had taken place the night before , and the fields were of one uniform white ; the appearance was disconsolate , and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground . 
`` It was about seven in the morning , and I longed to obtain food and shelter ; at length I perceived a small hut , on a rising ground , which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd . 
This was a new sight to me , and I examined the structure with great curiosity . 
Finding the door open , I entered . 
An old man sat in it , near a fire , over which he was preparing his breakfast . 
He turned on hearing a noise , and perceiving me , shrieked loudly , and quitting the hut , ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable . 
His appearance , different from any I had ever before seen , and his flight somewhat surprised me . 
But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut ; here the snow and rain could not penetrate ; the ground was dry ; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire . 
I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd 's breakfast , which consisted of bread , cheese , milk , and wine ; the latter , however , I did not like . 
Then , overcome by fatigue , I lay down among some straw and fell asleep . 
`` It was noon when I awoke , and allured by the warmth of the sun , which shone brightly on the white ground , I determined to recommence my travels ; and , depositing the remains of the peasant 's breakfast in a wallet I found , I proceeded across the fields for several hours , until at sunset I arrived at a village . 
How miraculous did this appear ! 
The huts , the neater cottages , and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns . 
The vegetables in the gardens , the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages , allured my appetite . 
One of the best of these I entered , but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked , and one of the women fainted . 
The whole village was roused ; some fled , some attacked me , until , grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons , I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel , quite bare , and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village . 
This hovel however , joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance , but after my late dearly bought experience , I dared not enter it . 
My place of refuge was constructed of wood , but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it . 
No wood , however , was placed on the earth , which formed the floor , but it was dry ; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks , I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain . 
`` Here , then , I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter , however miserable , from the inclemency of the season , and still more from the barbarity of man . 
As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel , that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found . 
It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water . 
One part was open , and by that I had crept in ; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood , yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out ; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty , and that was sufficient for me . 
`` Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw , I retired , for I saw the figure of a man at a distance , and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power . 
I had first , however , provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread , which I purloined , and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat . 
The floor was a little raised , so that it was kept perfectly dry , and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm . 
`` Being thus provided , I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination . 
It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest , my former residence , the rain-dropping branches , and dank earth . 
I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step , and looking through a small chink , I beheld a young creature , with a pail on her head , passing before my hovel . 
The girl was young and of gentle demeanour , unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be . 
Yet she was meanly dressed , a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb ; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned : she looked patient yet sad . 
I lost sight of her , and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail , which was now partly filled with milk . 
As she walked along , seemingly incommoded by the burden , a young man met her , whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence . 
Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy , he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself . 
She followed , and they disappeared . 
Presently I saw the young man again , with some tools in his hand , cross the field behind the cottage ; and the girl was also busied , sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard . 
`` On examining my dwelling , I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it , but the panes had been filled up with wood . 
In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate . 
Through this crevice a small room was visible , whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture . 
In one corner , near a small fire , sat an old man , leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude . 
The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage ; but presently she took something out of a drawer , which employed her hands , and she sat down beside the old man , who , taking up an instrument , began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale . 
It was a lovely sight , even to me , poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before . 
The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence , while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love . 
He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion , of which the old man took no notice , until she sobbed audibly ; he then pronounced a few sounds , and the fair creature , leaving her work , knelt at his feet . 
He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature ; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure , such as I had never before experienced , either from hunger or cold , warmth or food ; and I withdrew from the window , unable to bear these emotions . 
`` Soon after this the young man returned , bearing on his shoulders a load of wood . 
The girl met him at the door , helped to relieve him of his burden , and taking some of the fuel into the cottage , placed it on the fire ; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage , and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese . 
She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants , which she placed in water , and then upon the fire . 
She afterwards continued her work , whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots . 
After he had been employed thus about an hour , the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together . 
`` The old man had , in the meantime , been pensive , but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air , and they sat down to eat . 
The meal was quickly dispatched . 
The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage , the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes , leaning on the arm of the youth . 
Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures . 
One was old , with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love ; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure , and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry , yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency . 
The old man returned to the cottage , and the youth , with tools different from those he had used in the morning , directed his steps across the fields . 
`` Night quickly shut in , but to my extreme wonder , I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers , and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours . 
In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand ; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning . 
So soon as he had finished , the youth began , not to play , but to utter sounds that were monotonous , and neither resembling the harmony of the old man 's instrument nor the songs of the birds ; I since found that he read aloud , but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters . 
`` The family , after having been thus occupied for a short time , extinguished their lights and retired , as I conjectured , to rest . '' 
`` I lay on my straw , but I could not sleep . 
I thought of the occurrences of the day . 
What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people , and I longed to join them , but dared not . 
I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers , and resolved , whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue , that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel , watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions . 
`` The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun . 
The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food , and the youth departed after the first meal . 
`` This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it . 
The young man was constantly employed out of doors , and the girl in various laborious occupations within . 
The old man , whom I soon perceived to be blind , employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation . 
Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion . 
They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness , and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles . 
`` They were not entirely happy . 
The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep . 
I saw no cause for their unhappiness , but I was deeply affected by it . 
If such lovely creatures were miserable , it was less strange that I , an imperfect and solitary being , should be wretched . 
Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy ? 
They possessed a delightful house -LRB- for such it was in my eyes -RRB- and every luxury ; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry ; they were dressed in excellent clothes ; and , still more , they enjoyed one another 's company and speech , interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness . 
What did their tears imply ? 
Did they really express pain ? 
I was at first unable to solve these questions , but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic . 
`` A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family : it was poverty , and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree . 
Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow , which gave very little during the winter , when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it . 
They often , I believe , suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly , especially the two younger cottagers , for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves . 
`` This trait of kindness moved me sensibly . 
I had been accustomed , during the night , to steal a part of their store for my own consumption , but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers , I abstained and satisfied myself with berries , nuts , and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood . 
`` I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours . 
I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire , and during the night I often took his tools , the use of which I quickly discovered , and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days . 
`` I remember , the first time that I did this , the young woman , when she opened the door in the morning , appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside . 
She uttered some words in a loud voice , and the youth joined her , who also expressed surprise . 
I observed , with pleasure , that he did not go to the forest that day , but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden . 
`` By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment . 
I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds . 
I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain , smiles or sadness , in the minds and countenances of the hearers . 
This was indeed a godlike science , and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it . 
But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose . 
Their pronunciation was quick , and the words they uttered , not having any apparent connection with visible objects , I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference . 
By great application , however , and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel , I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse ; I learned and applied the words , ` fire , ' ` milk , ' ` bread , ' and ` wood . ' 
I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves . 
The youth and his companion had each of them several names , but the old man had only one , which was ` father . ' 
The girl was called ` sister ' or ` Agatha , ' and the youth ` Felix , ' ` brother , ' or ` son . ' 
I can not describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them . 
I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them , such as ` good , ' ` dearest , ' ` unhappy . ' 
`` I spent the winter in this manner . 
The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me ; when they were unhappy , I felt depressed ; when they rejoiced , I sympathized in their joys . 
I saw few human beings besides them , and if any other happened to enter the cottage , their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends . 
The old man , I could perceive , often endeavoured to encourage his children , as sometimes I found that he called them , to cast off their melancholy . 
He would talk in a cheerful accent , with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me . 
Agatha listened with respect , her eyes sometimes filled with tears , which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived ; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father . 
It was not thus with Felix . 
He was always the saddest of the group , and even to my unpractised senses , he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends . 
But if his countenance was more sorrowful , his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister , especially when he addressed the old man . 
`` I could mention innumerable instances which , although slight , marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers . 
In the midst of poverty and want , Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground . 
Early in the morning , before she had risen , he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house , drew water from the well , and brought the wood from the outhouse , where , to his perpetual astonishment , he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand . 
In the day , I believe , he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer , because he often went forth and did not return until dinner , yet brought no wood with him . 
At other times he worked in the garden , but as there was little to do in the frosty season , he read to the old man and Agatha . 
`` This reading had puzzled me extremely at first , but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked . 
I conjectured , therefore , that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood , and I ardently longed to comprehend these also ; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs ? 
I improved , however , sensibly in this science , but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation , although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour , for I easily perceived that , although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers , I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language , which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure , for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted . 
`` I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers -- their grace , beauty , and delicate complexions ; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool ! 
At first I started back , unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror ; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am , I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification . 
Alas ! 
I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity . 
`` As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer , the snow vanished , and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth . 
From this time Felix was more employed , and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared . 
Their food , as I afterwards found , was coarse , but it was wholesome ; and they procured a sufficiency of it . 
Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden , which they dressed ; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced . 
`` The old man , leaning on his son , walked each day at noon , when it did not rain , as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters . 
This frequently took place , but a high wind quickly dried the earth , and the season became far more pleasant than it had been . 
`` My mode of life in my hovel was uniform . 
During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers , and when they were dispersed in various occupations , I slept ; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends . 
When they had retired to rest , if there was any moon or the night was star-light , I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage . 
When I returned , as often as it was necessary , I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix . 
I afterwards found that these labours , performed by an invisible hand , greatly astonished them ; and once or twice I heard them , on these occasions , utter the words ` good spirit , ' ` wonderful ' ; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms . 
`` My thoughts now became more active , and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures ; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad . 
I thought -LRB- foolish wretch ! -RRB- 
that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people . 
When I slept or was absent , the forms of the venerable blind father , the gentle Agatha , and the excellent Felix flitted before me . 
I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny . 
I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them , and their reception of me . 
I imagined that they would be disgusted , until , by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words , I should first win their favour and afterwards their love . 
`` These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language . 
My organs were indeed harsh , but supple ; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones , yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease . 
It was as the ass and the lap-dog ; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate , although his manners were rude , deserved better treatment than blows and execration . 
`` The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth . 
Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation . 
The birds sang in more cheerful notes , and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees . 
Happy , happy earth ! 
Fit habitation for gods , which , so short a time before , was bleak , damp , and unwholesome . 
My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature ; the past was blotted from my memory , the present was tranquil , and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy . '' 
`` I now hasten to the more moving part of my story .
