I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which , from what I had been , have made me what I am . 
`` Spring advanced rapidly ; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless . 
It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure . 
My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty . 
`` It was on one of these days , when my cottagers periodically rested from labour -- the old man played on his guitar , and the children listened to him -- that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression ; he sighed frequently , and once his father paused in his music , and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son 's sorrow . 
Felix replied in a cheerful accent , and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door . 
`` It was a lady on horseback , accompanied by a country-man as a guide . 
The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil . 
Agatha asked a question , to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing , in a sweet accent , the name of Felix . 
Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends . 
On hearing this word , Felix came up hastily to the lady , who , when she saw him , threw up her veil , and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression . 
Her hair of a shining raven black , and curiously braided ; her eyes were dark , but gentle , although animated ; her features of a regular proportion , and her complexion wondrously fair , each cheek tinged with a lovely pink . 
`` Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her , every trait of sorrow vanished from his face , and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy , of which I could hardly have believed it capable ; his eyes sparkled , as his cheek flushed with pleasure ; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger . 
She appeared affected by different feelings ; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes , she held out her hand to Felix , who kissed it rapturously and called her , as well as I could distinguish , his sweet Arabian . 
She did not appear to understand him , but smiled . 
He assisted her to dismount , and dismissing her guide , conducted her into the cottage . 
Some conversation took place between him and his father , and the young stranger knelt at the old man 's feet and would have kissed his hand , but he raised her and embraced her affectionately . 
`` I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own , she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers . 
They made many signs which I did not comprehend , but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage , dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists . 
Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian . 
Agatha , the ever-gentle Agatha , kissed the hands of the lovely stranger , and pointing to her brother , made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came . 
Some hours passed thus , while they , by their countenances , expressed joy , the cause of which I did not comprehend . 
Presently I found , by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them , that she was endeavouring to learn their language ; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end . 
The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson ; most of them , indeed , were those which I had before understood , but I profited by the others . 
`` As night came on , Agatha and the Arabian retired early . 
When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said , ` Good night sweet Safie . ' 
He sat up much longer , conversing with his father , and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation . 
I ardently desired to understand them , and bent every faculty towards that purpose , but found it utterly impossible . 
`` The next morning Felix went out to his work , and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished , the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man , and taking his guitar , played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes . 
She sang , and her voice flowed in a rich cadence , swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods . 
`` When she had finished , she gave the guitar to Agatha , who at first declined it . 
She played a simple air , and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents , but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger . 
The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie , and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music . 
`` The days now passed as peaceably as before , with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends . 
Safie was always gay and happy ; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language , so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors . 
`` In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage , and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers , sweet to the scent and the eyes , stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods ; the sun became warmer , the nights clear and balmy ; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me , although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun , for I never ventured abroad during daylight , fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered . 
`` My days were spent in close attention , that I might more speedily master the language ; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian , who understood very little and conversed in broken accents , whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken . 
`` While I improved in speech , I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger , and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight . 
`` The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney 's Ruins of Empires . 
I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix , in reading it , given very minute explanations . 
He had chosen this work , he said , because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors . 
Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world ; it gave me an insight into the manners , governments , and religions of the different nations of the earth . 
I heard of the slothful Asiatics , of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians , of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans -- of their subsequent degenerating -- of the decline of that mighty empire , of chivalry , Christianity , and kings . 
I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants . 
`` These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings . 
Was man , indeed , at once so powerful , so virtuous and magnificent , yet so vicious and base ? 
He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike . 
To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being ; to be base and vicious , as many on record have been , appeared the lowest degradation , a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm . 
For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow , or even why there were laws and governments ; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed , my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing . 
`` Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me . 
While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian , the strange system of human society was explained to me . 
I heard of the division of property , of immense wealth and squalid poverty , of rank , descent , and noble blood . 
`` The words induced me to turn towards myself . 
I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches . 
A man might be respected with only one of these advantages , but without either he was considered , except in very rare instances , as a vagabond and a slave , doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few ! 
And what was I ? 
Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant , but I knew that I possessed no money , no friends , no kind of property . 
I was , besides , endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome ; I was not even of the same nature as man . 
I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet ; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame ; my stature far exceeded theirs . 
When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me . 
Was I , then , a monster , a blot upon the earth , from which all men fled and whom all men disowned ? 
`` I can not describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me ; I tried to dispel them , but sorrow only increased with knowledge . 
Oh , that I had forever remained in my native wood , nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger , thirst , and heat ! 
`` Of what a strange nature is knowledge ! 
It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock . 
I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling , but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain , and that was death -- a state which I feared yet did not understand . 
I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers , but I was shut out from intercourse with them , except through means which I obtained by stealth , when I was unseen and unknown , and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows . 
The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me . 
The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me . 
Miserable , unhappy wretch ! 
`` Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply . 
I heard of the difference of sexes , and the birth and growth of children , how the father doted on the smiles of the infant , and the lively sallies of the older child , how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge , how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge , of brother , sister , and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds . 
`` But where were my friends and relations ? 
No father had watched my infant days , no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses ; or if they had , all my past life was now a blot , a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing . 
From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion . 
I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me . 
What was I ? 
The question again recurred , to be answered only with groans . 
`` I will soon explain to what these feelings tended , but allow me now to return to the cottagers , whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation , delight , and wonder , but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors -LRB- for so I loved , in an innocent , half-painful self-deceit , to call them -RRB- . '' 
`` Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends . 
It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind , unfolding as it did a number of circumstances , each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was . 
`` The name of the old man was De Lacey . 
He was descended from a good family in France , where he had lived for many years in affluence , respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals . 
His son was bred in the service of his country , and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction . 
A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris , surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue , refinement of intellect , or taste , accompanied by a moderate fortune , could afford . 
`` The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin . 
He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years , when , for some reason which I could not learn , he became obnoxious to the government . 
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him . 
He was tried and condemned to death . 
The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant ; all Paris was indignant ; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation . 
`` Felix had accidentally been present at the trial ; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court . 
He made , at that moment , a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means . 
After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison , he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building , which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan , who , loaded with chains , waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence . 
Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour . 
The Turk , amazed and delighted , endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth . 
Felix rejected his offers with contempt , yet when he saw the lovely Safie , who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude , the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard . 
`` The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety . 
Felix was too delicate to accept this offer , yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness . 
`` During the ensuing days , while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant , the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl , who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man , a servant of her father who understood French . 
She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent , and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate . 
`` I have copies of these letters , for I found means , during my residence in the hovel , to procure the implements of writing ; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha . 
Before I depart I will give them to you ; they will prove the truth of my tale ; but at present , as the sun is already far declined , I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you . 
`` Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab , seized and made a slave by the Turks ; recommended by her beauty , she had won the heart of the father of Safie , who married her . 
The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother , who , born in freedom , spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced . 
She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad . 
This lady died , but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie , who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem , allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements , ill-suited to the temper of her soul , now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue . 
The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her . 
`` The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed , but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris . 
Felix had procured passports in the name of his father , sister , and himself . 
He had previously communicated his plan to the former , who aided the deceit by quitting his house , under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself , with his daughter , in an obscure part of Paris . 
`` Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn , where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions . 
`` Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure , before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer ; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event ; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian , who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection . 
They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter , and sometimes with the interpretation of looks ; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country . 
`` The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers , while in his heart he had formed far other plans . 
He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian , but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm , for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited . 
He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary , and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed . 
His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris . 
`` The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer . 
The plot of Felix was quickly discovered , and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison . 
The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure . 
His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved . 
This idea was torture to him . 
He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy , Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn ; and then , quitting the lovely Arabian , he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law , hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding . 
`` He did not succeed . 
They remained confined for five months before the trial took place , the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country . 
`` They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany , where I discovered them . 
Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk , for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression , on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin , became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter , insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him , as he said , in some plan of future maintenance . 
`` Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him , when I first saw him , the most miserable of his family . 
He could have endured poverty , and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue , he gloried in it ; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable . 
The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul . 
`` When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank , the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover , but to prepare to return to her native country . 
The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command ; she attempted to expostulate with her father , but he left her angrily , reiterating his tyrannical mandate . 
`` A few days after , the Turk entered his daughter 's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government ; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople , for which city he should sail in a few hours . 
He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant , to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property , which had not yet arrived at Leghorn . 
`` When alone , Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency . 
A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her ; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it . 
By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided . 
She hesitated some time , but at length she formed her determination . 
Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money , she quitted Italy with an attendant , a native of Leghorn , but who understood the common language of Turkey , and departed for Germany . 
`` She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey , when her attendant fell dangerously ill . 
Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection , but the poor girl died , and the Arabian was left alone , unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world . 
She fell , however , into good hands . 
The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound , and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover . '' 
`` Such was the history of my beloved cottagers . 
It impressed me deeply . 
I learned , from the views of social life which it developed , to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind . 
`` As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil , benevolence and generosity were ever present before me , inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed . 
But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect , I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year . 
`` One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors , I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books . 
I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel . 
Fortunately the books were written in the language , the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage ; they consisted of Paradise Lost , a volume of Plutarch 's Lives , and the Sorrows of Werter . 
The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight ; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories , whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations . 
`` I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books . 
They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings , that sometimes raised me to ecstasy , but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection . 
In the Sorrows of Werter , besides the interest of its simple and affecting story , so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment . 
The gentle and domestic manners it described , combined with lofty sentiments and feelings , which had for their object something out of self , accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom . 
But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined ; his character contained no pretension , but it sank deep . 
The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder . 
I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case , yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero , whose extinction I wept , without precisely understanding it . 
`` As I read , however , I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition . 
I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener . 
I sympathized with and partly understood them , but I was unformed in mind ; I was dependent on none and related to none . 
` The path of my departure was free , ' and there was none to lament my annihilation . 
My person was hideous and my stature gigantic . 
What did this mean ? 
Who was I ? 
What was I ? 
Whence did I come ? 
What was my destination ? 
These questions continually recurred , but I was unable to solve them . 
`` The volume of Plutarch 's Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics . 
This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter . 
I learned from Werter 's imaginations despondency and gloom , but Plutarch taught me high thoughts ; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections , to admire and love the heroes of past ages . 
Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience . 
I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms , wide extents of country , mighty rivers , and boundless seas . 
But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men . 
The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature , but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action . 
I read of men concerned in public affairs , governing or massacring their species . 
I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me , and abhorrence for vice , as far as I understood the signification of those terms , relative as they were , as I applied them , to pleasure and pain alone . 
Induced by these feelings , I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers , Numa , Solon , and Lycurgus , in preference to Romulus and Theseus . 
The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind ; perhaps , if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier , burning for glory and slaughter , I should have been imbued with different sensations . 
`` But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions . 
I read it , as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands , as a true history . 
It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting . 
I often referred the several situations , as their similarity struck me , to my own . 
Like Adam , I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence ; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect . 
He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature , happy and prosperous , guarded by the especial care of his Creator ; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature , but I was wretched , helpless , and alone . 
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition , for often , like him , when I viewed the bliss of my protectors , the bitter gall of envy rose within me . 
`` Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings . 
Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory . 
At first I had neglected them , but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written , I began to study them with diligence . 
It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation . 
You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work ; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences . 
You doubtless recollect these papers . 
Here they are . 
Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin ; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view ; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given , in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible . 
I sickened as I read . 
` Hateful day when I received life ! ' 
I exclaimed in agony . 
` Accursed creator ! 
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust ? 
God , in pity , made man beautiful and alluring , after his own image ; but my form is a filthy type of yours , more horrid even from the very resemblance . 
Satan had his companions , fellow devils , to admire and encourage him , but I am solitary and abhorred . ' 
`` These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude ; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers , their amiable and benevolent dispositions , I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity . 
Could they turn from their door one , however monstrous , who solicited their compassion and friendship ? 
I resolved , at least , not to despair , but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate . 
I postponed this attempt for some months longer , for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail . 
Besides , I found that my understanding improved so much with every day 's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity . 
`` Several changes , in the meantime , took place in the cottage . 
The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants , and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there . 
Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation , and were assisted in their labours by servants . 
They did not appear rich , but they were contented and happy ; their feelings were serene and peaceful , while mine became every day more tumultuous . 
Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was . 
I cherished hope , it is true , but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine , even as that frail image and that inconstant shade . 
`` I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo ; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts , unchecked by reason , to ramble in the fields of Paradise , and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom ; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation . 
But it was all a dream ; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts ; I was alone . 
I remembered Adam 's supplication to his Creator . 
But where was mine ? 
He had abandoned me , and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him . 
`` Autumn passed thus . 
I saw , with surprise and grief , the leaves decay and fall , and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon . 
Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather ; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat . 
But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers , the birds , and all the gay apparel of summer ; when those deserted me , I turned with more attention towards the cottagers . 
Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer . 
They loved and sympathized with one another ; and their joys , depending on each other , were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them . 
The more I saw of them , the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness ; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures ; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition . 
I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror . 
The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away . 
I asked , it is true , for greater treasures than a little food or rest : I required kindness and sympathy ; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it . 
`` The winter advanced , and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life . 
My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors . 
I revolved many projects , but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone . 
I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me . 
My voice , although harsh , had nothing terrible in it ; I thought , therefore , that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey , I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors . 
`` One day , when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness , although it denied warmth , Safie , Agatha , and Felix departed on a long country walk , and the old man , at his own desire , was left alone in the cottage . 
When his children had departed , he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs , more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before . 
At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure , but as he continued , thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded ; at length , laying aside the instrument , he sat absorbed in reflection . 
`` My heart beat quick ; this was the hour and moment of trial , which would decide my hopes or realize my fears . 
The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair . 
All was silent in and around the cottage ; it was an excellent opportunity ; yet , when I proceeded to execute my plan , my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground . 
Again I rose , and exerting all the firmness of which I was master , removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat . 
The fresh air revived me , and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage . 
`` I knocked . 
` Who is there ? ' 
said the old man . 
` Come in . ' 
`` I entered . 
` Pardon this intrusion , ' said I ; ' I am a traveller in want of a little rest ; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire . ' '' 
` Enter , ' said De Lacey , ` and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants ; but , unfortunately , my children are from home , and as I am blind , I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you . ' '' 
` Do not trouble yourself , my kind host ; I have food ; it is warmth and rest only that I need . ' 
`` I sat down , and a silence ensued . 
I knew that every minute was precious to me , yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview , when the old man addressed me . 
` By your language , stranger , I suppose you are my countryman ; are you French ? ' '' 
` No ; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only . 
I am now going to claim the protection of some friends , whom I sincerely love , and of whose favour I have some hopes . ' '' 
` Are they Germans ? ' '' 
` No , they are French . 
But let us change the subject . 
I am an unfortunate and deserted creature , I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth . 
These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me . 
I am full of fears , for if I fail there , I am an outcast in the world forever . ' '' 
` Do not despair . 
To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate , but the hearts of men , when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest , are full of brotherly love and charity . 
Rely , therefore , on your hopes ; and if these friends are good and amiable , do not despair . ' '' 
` They are kind -- they are the most excellent creatures in the world ; but , unfortunately , they are prejudiced against me . 
I have good dispositions ; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial ; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes , and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend , they behold only a detestable monster . ' '' 
` That is indeed unfortunate ; but if you are really blameless , can not you undeceive them ? ' '' ' 
I am about to undertake that task ; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors . 
I tenderly love these friends ; I have , unknown to them , been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them ; but they believe that I wish to injure them , and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome . ' '' 
` Where do these friends reside ? ' '' 
` Near this spot . ' 
`` The old man paused and then continued , ` If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale , I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them . 
I am blind and can not judge of your countenance , but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere . 
I am poor and an exile , but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature . ' '' 
` Excellent man ! 
I thank you and accept your generous offer . 
You raise me from the dust by this kindness ; and I trust that , by your aid , I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures . ' '' 
` Heaven forbid ! 
Even if you were really criminal , for that can only drive you to desperation , and not instigate you to virtue . 
I also am unfortunate ; I and my family have been condemned , although innocent ; judge , therefore , if I do not feel for your misfortunes . ' '' 
` How can I thank you , my best and only benefactor ? 
From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me ; I shall be forever grateful ; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting . ' '' 
` May I know the names and residence of those friends ? ' 
`` I paused . 
This , I thought , was the moment of decision , which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever . 
I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him , but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength ; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud . 
At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors . 
I had not a moment to lose , but seizing the hand of the old man , I cried , ` Now is the time ! 
Save and protect me ! 
You and your family are the friends whom I seek . 
Do not you desert me in the hour of trial ! ' '' 
` Great God ! ' 
exclaimed the old man . 
` Who are you ? ' 
`` At that instant the cottage door was opened , and Felix , Safie , and Agatha entered . 
Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me ? 
Agatha fainted , and Safie , unable to attend to her friend , rushed out of the cottage . 
Felix darted forward , and with supernatural force tore me from his father , to whose knees I clung , in a transport of fury , he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick . 
I could have torn him limb from limb , as the lion rends the antelope . 
But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness , and I refrained . 
I saw him on the point of repeating his blow , when , overcome by pain and anguish , I quitted the cottage , and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel . '' 
`` Cursed , cursed creator ! 
Why did I live ? 
Why , in that instant , did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed ? 
I know not ; despair had not yet taken possession of me ; my feelings were those of rage and revenge . 
I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery . 
`` When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood ; and now , no longer restrained by the fear of discovery , I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings . 
I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils , destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness . 
Oh ! 
What a miserable night I passed ! 
The cold stars shone in mockery , and the bare trees waved their branches above me ; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness . 
All , save I , were at rest or in enjoyment ; I , like the arch-fiend , bore a hell within me , and finding myself unsympathized with , wished to tear up the trees , spread havoc and destruction around me , and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin . 
`` But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure ; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair . 
There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me ; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies ? 
No ; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species , and more than all , against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery . 
`` The sun rose ; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day . 
Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood , determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation . 
`` The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity ; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage , I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions . 
I had certainly acted imprudently . 
It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf , and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children . 
I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me , and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family , when they should have been prepared for my approach . 
But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable , and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage , seek the old man , and by my representations win him to my party . 
`` These thoughts calmed me , and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep ; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams . 
The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes ; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father 's feet . 
I awoke exhausted , and finding that it was already night , I crept forth from my hiding-place , and went in search of food . 
`` When my hunger was appeased , I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage . 
All there was at peace . 
I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose . 
That hour passed , the sun mounted high in the heavens , but the cottagers did not appear . 
I trembled violently , apprehending some dreadful misfortune . 
The inside of the cottage was dark , and I heard no motion ; I can not describe the agony of this suspense . 
`` Presently two countrymen passed by , but pausing near the cottage , they entered into conversation , using violent gesticulations ; but I did not understand what they said , as they spoke the language of the country , which differed from that of my protectors . 
Soon after , however , Felix approached with another man ; I was surprised , as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning , and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances . '' 
` Do you consider , ' said his companion to him , ` that you will be obliged to pay three months ' rent and to lose the produce of your garden ? 
I do not wish to take any unfair advantage , and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination . ' '' 
` It is utterly useless , ' replied Felix ; ` we can never again inhabit your cottage . 
The life of my father is in the greatest danger , owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related . 
My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror . 
I entreat you not to reason with me any more . 
Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place . ' 
`` Felix trembled violently as he said this . 
He and his companion entered the cottage , in which they remained for a few minutes , and then departed . 
I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more . 
`` I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair . 
My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world . 
For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom , and I did not strive to control them , but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream , I bent my mind towards injury and death . 
When I thought of my friends , of the mild voice of De Lacey , the gentle eyes of Agatha , and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian , these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me . 
But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me , anger returned , a rage of anger , and unable to injure anything human , I turned my fury towards inanimate objects . 
As night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage , and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden , I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations . 
`` As the night advanced , a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens ; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection . 
I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage , my eyes still fixed on the western horizon , the edge of which the moon nearly touched . 
A part of its orb was at length hid , and I waved my brand ; it sank , and with a loud scream I fired the straw , and heath , and bushes , which I had collected . 
The wind fanned the fire , and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames , which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues . 
`` As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation , I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods . 
`` And now , with the world before me , whither should I bend my steps ? 
I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes ; but to me , hated and despised , every country must be equally horrible . 
At length the thought of you crossed my mind . 
I learned from your papers that you were my father , my creator ; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life ? 
Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie , geography had not been omitted ; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth . 
You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town , and towards this place I resolved to proceed . 
`` But how was I to direct myself ? 
I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination , but the sun was my only guide . 
I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through , nor could I ask information from a single human being ; but I did not despair . 
From you only could I hope for succour , although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred . 
Unfeeling , heartless creator ! 
You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind . 
But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress , and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form . 
`` My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense . 
It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided . 
I travelled only at night , fearful of encountering the visage of a human being . 
Nature decayed around me , and the sun became heatless ; rain and snow poured around me ; mighty rivers were frozen ; the surface of the earth was hard and chill , and bare , and I found no shelter . 
Oh , earth ! 
How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being ! 
The mildness of my nature had fled , and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness . 
The nearer I approached to your habitation , the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart . 
Snow fell , and the waters were hardened , but I rested not . 
A few incidents now and then directed me , and I possessed a map of the country ; but I often wandered wide from my path . 
The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite ; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food ; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland , when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green , confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings . 
`` I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man . 
One morning , however , finding that my path lay through a deep wood , I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen ; the day , which was one of the first of spring , cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air . 
I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure , that had long appeared dead , revive within me . 
Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations , I allowed myself to be borne away by them , and forgetting my solitude and deformity , dared to be happy . 
Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks , and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun , which bestowed such joy upon me . 
`` I continued to wind among the paths of the wood , until I came to its boundary , which was skirted by a deep and rapid river , into which many of the trees bent their branches , now budding with the fresh spring . 
Here I paused , not exactly knowing what path to pursue , when I heard the sound of voices , that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress . 
I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed , laughing , as if she ran from someone in sport . 
She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river , when suddenly her foot slipped , and she fell into the rapid stream . 
I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour , from the force of the current , saved her and dragged her to shore . 
She was senseless , and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation , when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic , who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled . 
On seeing me , he darted towards me , and tearing the girl from my arms , hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood . 
I followed speedily , I hardly knew why ; but when the man saw me draw near , he aimed a gun , which he carried , at my body and fired . 
I sank to the ground , and my injurer , with increased swiftness , escaped into the wood . 
`` This was then the reward of my benevolence ! 
I had saved a human being from destruction , and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone . 
The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth . 
Inflamed by pain , I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind . 
But the agony of my wound overcame me ; my pulses paused , and I fainted . 
`` For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods , endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received . 
The ball had entered my shoulder , and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through ; at any rate I had no means of extracting it . 
My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction .
