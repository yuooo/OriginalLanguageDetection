I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood . 
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices . 
`` Flag of truce ! '' 
I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! '' 
And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall . 
SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by . 
It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow . 
The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun . 
But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass . 
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island . 
It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot . 
`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain . 
`` Ten to one this is a trick . '' 
Then he hailed the buccaneer . 
`` Who goes ? 
Stand , or we fire . '' 
`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver . 
The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended . 
He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout . 
Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west . 
The watch below , all hands to load muskets . 
Lively , men , and careful . '' 
And then he turned again to the mutineers . 
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? '' 
he cried . 
This time it was the other man who replied . 
`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted . 
`` Cap'n Silver ! 
Do n't know him . 
Who 's he ? '' 
cried the captain . 
And we could hear him adding to himself , `` Cap'n , is it ? 
My heart , and here 's promotion ! '' 
Long John answered for himself . 
`` Me , sir . 
These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir '' -- laying a particular emphasis upon the word `` desertion . '' 
`` We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it . 
All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . '' 
`` My man , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I have not the slightest desire to talk to you . 
If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all . 
If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . '' 
`` That 's enough , cap'n , '' shouted Long John cheerily . 
`` A word from you 's enough . 
I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . '' 
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back . 
Nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain 's answer . 
But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd . 
Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side . 
I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand . 
He was whistling `` Come , Lasses and Lads . '' 
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll . 
What with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays . 
But he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style . 
He was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head . 
`` Here you are , my man , '' said the captain , raising his head . 
`` You had better sit down . '' 
`` You ai n't a-going to let me inside , cap'n ? '' 
complained Long John . 
`` It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . '' 
`` Why , Silver , '' said the captain , `` if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley . 
It 's your own doing . 
You 're either my ship 's cook -- and then you were treated handsome -- or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! '' 
`` Well , well , cap'n , '' returned the sea-cook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , `` you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all . 
A sweet pretty place you have of it here . 
Ah , there 's Jim ! 
The top of the morning to you , Jim . 
Doctor , here 's my service . 
Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . '' 
`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain . 
`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver . 
`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure . 
Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night . 
I do n't deny it was a good lay . 
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end . 
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms . 
But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder ! 
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum . 
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye . 
But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would . 
He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be . 
All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone . 
As for me , I began to have an inkling . 
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind . 
I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with . 
`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver . 
`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point ! 
You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours . 
You have a chart , have n't you ? '' 
`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain . 
`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John . 
`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it . 
What I mean is , we want your chart . 
Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . '' 
`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain . 
`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . '' 
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe . 
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out . 
`` Avast there ! '' 
cried Mr. Smollett . 
`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first . 
So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . '' 
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down . 
He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together . 
`` Like enough , '' said he . 
`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were . 
And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . '' 
And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit . 
It was as good as the play to see them . 
`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is . 
You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep . 
You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice . 
Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore . 
Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can . 
We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up . 
Now , you 'll own that 's talking . 
Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you . 
And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . '' 
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand . 
`` Is that all ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Every last word , by thunder ! '' 
answered John . 
`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . '' 
`` Very good , '' said the captain . 
`` Now you 'll hear me . 
If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England . 
If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones . 
You ca n't find the treasure . 
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship . 
You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you . 
Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find . 
I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you . 
Tramp , my lad . 
Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . '' 
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath . 
He shook the fire out of his pipe . 
`` Give me a hand up ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Not I , '' returned the captain . 
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? '' 
he roared . 
Not a man among us moved . 
Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch . 
Then he spat into the spring . 
`` There ! '' 
he cried . 
`` That 's what I think of ye . 
Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon . 
Laugh , by thunder , laugh ! 
Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side . 
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . '' 
And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees . 
AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray . 
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry . 
`` Quarters ! '' 
he roared . 
And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman . 
Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir . 
Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat ! 
If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . '' 
The doctor 's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is . 
The captain looked on for a while in silence . 
Then he spoke . 
`` My lads , '' said he , `` I 've given Silver a broadside . 
I pitched it in red-hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded . 
We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline . 
I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . '' 
Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear . 
On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five . 
There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders . 
In the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged . 
`` Toss out the fire , '' said the captain ; `` the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . '' 
The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand . 
`` Hawkins has n't had his breakfast . 
Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , '' continued Captain Smollett . 
`` Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done . 
Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . '' 
And while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence . 
`` Doctor , you will take the door , '' he resumed . 
`` See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch . 
Hunter , take the east side , there . 
Joyce , you stand by the west , my man . 
Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is . 
If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty . 
Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . '' 
As the captain had said , the chill was past . 
As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught . 
Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house . 
Jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety . 
An hour passed away . 
`` Hang them ! '' 
said the captain . 
`` This is as dull as the doldrums . 
Gray , whistle for a wind . '' 
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack . 
`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? '' 
`` I told you so ! '' 
cried the captain . 
`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility . 
Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face . 
So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired . 
The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure . 
Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before . 
Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes . 
`` Did you hit your man ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce . 
`` I believe not , sir . '' 
`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett . 
`` Load his gun , Hawkins . 
How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? '' 
`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey . 
`` Three shots were fired on this side . 
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . '' 
`` Three ! '' 
repeated the captain . 
`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? '' 
But this was not so easily answered . 
There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray . 
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired . 
It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities . 
But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements . 
If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade , he argued , they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold . 
Nor had we much time left to us for thought . 
Suddenly , with a loud huzza , a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade . 
At the same moment , the fire was once more opened from the woods , and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor 's musket into bits . 
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys . 
Squire and Gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside . 
But of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees . 
Two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house . 
The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building , shouting as they ran , and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them . 
Several shots were fired , but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect . 
In a moment , the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us . 
The head of Job Anderson , the boatswain , appeared at the middle loophole . 
`` At 'em , all hands -- all hands ! '' 
he roared in a voice of thunder . 
At the same moment , another pirate grasped Hunter 's musket by the muzzle , wrenched it from his hands , plucked it through the loophole , and with one stunning blow , laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor . 
Meanwhile a third , running unharmed all around the house , appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor . 
Our position was utterly reversed . 
A moment since we were firing , under cover , at an exposed enemy ; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow . 
The log-house was full of smoke , to which we owed our comparative safety . 
Cries and confusion , the flashes and reports of pistol-shots , and one loud groan rang in my ears . 
`` Out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open ! 
Cutlasses ! '' 
cried the captain . 
I snatched a cutlass from the pile , and someone , at the same time snatching another , gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt . 
I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight . 
Someone was close behind , I knew not whom . 
Right in front , the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill , and just as my eyes fell upon him , beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face . 
`` Round the house , lads ! 
Round the house ! '' 
cried the captain ; and even in the hurly-burly , I perceived a change in his voice . 
Mechanically , I obeyed , turned eastwards , and with my cutlass raised , ran round the corner of the house . 
Next moment I was face to face with Anderson . 
He roared aloud , and his hanger went up above his head , flashing in the sunlight . 
I had not time to be afraid , but as the blow still hung impending , leaped in a trice upon one side , and missing my foot in the soft sand , rolled headlong down the slope . 
When I had first sallied from the door , the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us . 
One man , in a red night-cap , with his cutlass in his mouth , had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across . 
Well , so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture , the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over , another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade . 
And yet , in this breath of time , the fight was over and the victory was ours . 
Gray , following close behind me , had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow . 
Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony , the pistol still smoking in his hand . 
A third , as I had seen , the doctor had disposed of at a blow . 
Of the four who had scaled the palisade , one only remained unaccounted for , and he , having left his cutlass on the field , was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him . 
`` Fire -- fire from the house ! '' 
cried the doctor . 
`` And you , lads , back into cover . '' 
But his words were unheeded , no shot was fired , and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood . 
In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen , four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade . 
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter . 
The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets , and at any moment the fire might recommence . 
The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke , and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory . 
Hunter lay beside his loophole , stunned ; Joyce by his , shot through the head , never to move again ; while right in the centre , the squire was supporting the captain , one as pale as the other . 
`` The captain 's wounded , '' said Mr. Trelawney . 
`` Have they run ? '' 
asked Mr. Smollett . 
`` All that could , you may be bound , '' returned the doctor ; `` but there 's five of them will never run again . '' 
`` Five ! '' 
cried the captain . 
`` Come , that 's better . 
Five against three leaves us four to nine . 
That 's better odds than we had at starting . 
We were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that 's as bad to bear . '' 
* * The mutineers were soon only eight in number , for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound . 
But this was , of course , not known till after by the faithful party . 
THERE was no return of the mutineers -- not so much as another shot out of the woods . 
They had `` got their rations for that day , '' as the captain put it , and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner . 
Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger , and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at , for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor 's patients . 
Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action , only three still breathed -- that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole , Hunter , and Captain Smollett ; and of these , the first two were as good as dead ; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor 's knife , and Hunter , do what we could , never recovered consciousness in this world . 
He lingered all day , breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit , but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling , and some time in the following night , without sign or sound , he went to his Maker . 
As for the captain , his wounds were grievous indeed , but not dangerous . 
No organ was fatally injured . 
Anderson 's ball -- for it was Job that shot him first -- had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung , not badly ; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf . 
He was sure to recover , the doctor said , but in the meantime , and for weeks to come , he must not walk nor move his arm , nor so much as speak when he could help it . 
My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite . 
Doctor Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain . 
After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain 's side awhile in consultation ; and when they had talked to their hearts ' content , it being then a little past noon , the doctor took up his hat and pistols , girt on a cutlass , put the chart in his pocket , and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees . 
Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house , to be out of earshot of our officers consulting ; and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again , so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence . 
`` Why , in the name of Davy Jones , '' said he , `` is Dr. Livesey mad ? '' 
`` Why no , '' says I. `` He 's about the last of this crew for that , I take it . '' 
`` Well , shipmate , '' said Gray , `` mad he may not be ; but if HE 'S not , you mark my words , I am . '' 
`` I take it , '' replied I , `` the doctor has his idea ; and if I am right , he 's going now to see Ben Gunn . '' 
I was right , as appeared later ; but in the meantime , the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun , I began to get another thought into my head , which was not by any means so right . 
What I began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines , while I sat grilling , with my clothes stuck to the hot resin , and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear . 
All the time I was washing out the block house , and then washing up the things from dinner , this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger , till at last , being near a bread-bag , and no one then observing me , I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit . 
I was a fool , if you like , and certainly I was going to do a foolish , over-bold act ; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power . 
These biscuits , should anything befall me , would keep me , at least , from starving till far on in the next day . 
The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols , and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets , I felt myself well supplied with arms . 
As for the scheme I had in my head , it was not a bad one in itself . 
I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea , find the white rock I had observed last evening , and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat , a thing quite worth doing , as I still believe . 
But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure , my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when nobody was watching , and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong . 
But I was only a boy , and I had made my mind up . 
Well , as things at last fell out , I found an admirable opportunity . 
The squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages , the coast was clear , I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees , and before my absence was observed I was out of cry of my companions . 
This was my second folly , far worse than the first , as I left but two sound men to guard the house ; but like the first , it was a help towards saving all of us . 
I took my way straight for the east coast of the island , for I was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage . 
It was already late in the afternoon , although still warm and sunny . 
As I continued to thread the tall woods , I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf , but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual . 
Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me , and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the grove , and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach . 
I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island . 
The sun might blaze overhead , the air be without a breath , the surface smooth and blue , but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast , thundering and thundering by day and night ; and I scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise . 
I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment , till , thinking I was now got far enough to the south , I took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit . 
Behind me was the sea , in front the anchorage . 
The sea breeze , as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence , was already at an end ; it had been succeeded by light , variable airs from the south and south-east , carrying great banks of fog ; and the anchorage , under lee of Skeleton Island , lay still and leaden as when first we entered it . 
The HISPANIOLA , in that unbroken mirror , was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline , the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak . 
Alongside lay one of the gigs , Silver in the stern-sheets -- him I could always recognize -- while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks , one of them with a red cap -- the very rogue that I had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade . 
Apparently they were talking and laughing , though at that distance -- upwards of a mile -- I could , of course , hear no word of what was said . 
All at once there began the most horrid , unearthly screaming , which at first startled me badly , though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her master 's wrist . 
Soon after , the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore , and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion . 
Just about the same time , the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass , and as the fog was collecting rapidly , it began to grow dark in earnest . 
I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening . 
The white rock , visible enough above the brush , was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit , and it took me a goodish while to get up with it , crawling , often on all fours , among the scrub . 
Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides . 
Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf , hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep , that grew there very plentifully ; and in the centre of the dell , sure enough , a little tent of goat-skins , like what the gipsies carry about with them in England . 
I dropped into the hollow , lifted the side of the tent , and there was Ben Gunn 's boat -- home-made if ever anything was home-made ; a rude , lop-sided framework of tough wood , and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin , with the hair inside . 
The thing was extremely small , even for me , and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man . 
There was one thwart set as low as possible , a kind of stretcher in the bows , and a double paddle for propulsion . 
I had not then seen a coracle , such as the ancient Britons made , but I have seen one since , and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn 's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man . 
But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed , for it was exceedingly light and portable . 
Well , now that I had found the boat , you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once , but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out , I believe , in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself . 
This was to slip out under cover of the night , cut the HISPANIOLA adrift , and let her go ashore where she fancied . 
I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers , after their repulse of the morning , had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea ; this , I thought , it would be a fine thing to prevent , and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat , I thought it might be done with little risk . 
Down I sat to wait for darkness , and made a hearty meal of biscuit . 
It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose . 
The fog had now buried all heaven . 
As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared , absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island . 
And when , at last , I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped , there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage . 
One was the great fire on shore , by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp . 
The other , a mere blur of light upon the darkness , indicated the position of the anchored ship . 
She had swung round to the ebb -- her bow was now towards me -- the only lights on board were in the cabin , and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window . 
The ebb had already run some time , and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand , where I sank several times above the ankle , before I came to the edge of the retreating water , and wading a little way in , with some strength and dexterity , set my coracle , keel downwards , on the surface . 
THE coracle -- as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her -- was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight , both buoyant and clever in a seaway ; but she was the most cross-grained , lop-sided craft to manage . 
Do as you pleased , she always made more leeway than anything else , and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at . 
Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was `` queer to handle till you knew her way . '' 
Certainly I did not know her way . 
She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go ; the most part of the time we were broadside on , and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide . 
By good fortune , paddle as I pleased , the tide was still sweeping me down ; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway , hardly to be missed . 
First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness , then her spars and hull began to take shape , and the next moment , as it seemed -LRB- for , the farther I went , the brisker grew the current of the ebb -RRB- , I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold . 
The hawser was as taut as a bowstring , and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor . 
All round the hull , in the blackness , the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream . 
One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the tide . 
So far so good , but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser , suddenly cut , is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse . 
Ten to one , if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor , I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water . 
This brought me to a full stop , and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me , I should have had to abandon my design . 
But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west . 
Just while I was meditating , a puff came , caught the HISPANIOLA , and forced her up into the current ; and to my great joy , I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp , and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water . 
With that I made my mind up , took out my gully , opened it with my teeth , and cut one strand after another , till the vessel swung only by two . 
Then I lay quiet , waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind . 
All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin , but to say truth , my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear . 
Now , however , when I had nothing else to do , I began to pay more heed . 
One I recognized for the coxswain 's , Israel Hands , that had been Flint 's gunner in former days . 
The other was , of course , my friend of the red night-cap . 
Both men were plainly the worse of drink , and they were still drinking , for even while I was listening , one of them , with a drunken cry , opened the stern window and threw out something , which I divined to be an empty bottle . 
But they were not only tipsy ; it was plain that they were furiously angry . 
Oaths flew like hailstones , and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows . 
But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while , until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result . 
On shore , I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees . 
Someone was singing , a dull , old , droning sailor 's song , with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse , and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer . 
I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words : `` But one man of her crew alive , What put to sea with seventy-five . '' 
And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning . 
But , indeed , from what I saw , all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on . 
At last the breeze came ; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark ; I felt the hawser slacken once more , and with a good , tough effort , cut the last fibres through . 
The breeze had but little action on the coracle , and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA . 
At the same time , the schooner began to turn upon her heel , spinning slowly , end for end , across the current . 
I wrought like a fiend , for I expected every moment to be swamped ; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off , I now shoved straight astern . 
At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour , and just as I gave the last impulsion , my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks . 
Instantly I grasped it . 
Why I should have done so I can hardly say . 
It was at first mere instinct , but once I had it in my hands and found it fast , curiosity began to get the upper hand , and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window . 
I pulled in hand over hand on the cord , and when I judged myself near enough , rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin . 
By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water ; indeed , we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire . 
The ship was talking , as sailors say , loudly , treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash ; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm . 
One glance , however , was sufficient ; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff . 
It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle , each with a hand upon the other 's throat . 
I dropped upon the thwart again , none too soon , for I was near overboard . 
I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious , encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp , and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness . 
The endless ballad had come to an end at last , and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! 
Drink and the devil had done for the rest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''
