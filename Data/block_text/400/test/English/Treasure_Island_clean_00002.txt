There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . '' 
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay . 
`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried . 
I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it . 
Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him . 
`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us . 
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . '' 
`` Is it there ? '' 
roared Pew . 
`` The money 's there . '' 
The blind man cursed the money . 
`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried . 
`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man . 
`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? '' 
cried the blind man again . 
At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn . 
`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . '' 
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy . 
I wish I had put his eyes out ! '' 
cried the blind man , Pew . 
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it . 
Scatter , lads , and find 'em . '' 
`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window . 
`` Scatter and find 'em ! 
Rout the house out ! '' 
reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road . 
Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found . 
And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated . 
I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger . 
`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one . 
`` Twice ! 
We 'll have to budge , mates . '' 
`` Budge , you skulk ! '' 
cried Pew . 
`` Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him . 
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hands on it . 
Scatter and look for them , dogs ! 
Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cried , `` if I had eyes ! '' 
This appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road . 
`` You have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg ! 
You 'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulking . 
There was n't one of you dared face Bill , and I did it -- a blind man ! 
And I 'm to lose my chance for you ! 
I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach ! 
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . '' 
`` Hang it , Pew , we 've got the doubloons ! '' 
grumbled one . 
`` They might have hid the blessed thing , '' said another . 
`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squalling . '' 
Squalling was the word for it ; Pew 's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one . 
These , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp . 
This quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horses galloping . 
Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , came from the hedge side . 
And that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew . 
Him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades . 
Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other names , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mates -- not old Pew ! '' 
Just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope . 
At this Pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled . 
But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses . 
The rider tried to save him , but in vain . 
Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by . 
He fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more . 
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders . 
They were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and I soon saw what they were . 
One , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once . 
Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death . 
Pew was dead , stone dead . 
As for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money . 
In the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in . 
He hailed her . 
A voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm . 
Soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared . 
Mr. Dance stood there , as he said , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter . 
`` And that , '' said he , `` is just about as good as nothing . 
They 've got off clean , and there 's an end . 
Only , '' he added , `` I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , '' for by this time he had heard my story . 
I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we were ruined . 
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene . 
`` They got the money , you say ? 
Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ? 
More money , I suppose ? '' 
`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' replied I. `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . '' 
`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' said he . 
`` I 'll take it , if you like . '' 
`` I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I began . 
`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupted very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate . 
And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire . 
Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can . 
Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . '' 
I thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were . 
By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle . 
`` Dogger , '' said Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . '' 
As soon as I was mounted , holding on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house . 
WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey 's door . 
The house was all dark to the front . 
Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock , and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by . 
The door was opened almost at once by the maid . 
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? '' 
I asked . 
No , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire . 
`` So there we go , boys , '' said Mr. Dance . 
This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens . 
Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house . 
The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire . 
I had never seen the squire so near at hand . 
He was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels . 
His eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high . 
`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' says he , very stately and condescending . 
`` Good evening , Dance , '' says the doctor with a nod . 
`` And good evening to you , friend Jim . 
What good wind brings you here ? '' 
The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest . 
When they heard how my mother went back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried `` Bravo ! '' 
and broke his long pipe against the grate . 
Long before it was done , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , was the squire 's name -RRB- had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll . 
At last Mr. Dance finished the story . 
`` Mr. Dance , '' said the squire , `` you are a very noble fellow . 
And as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach . 
This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive . 
Hawkins , will you ring that bell ? 
Mr. Dance must have some ale . '' 
`` And so , Jim , '' said the doctor , `` you have the thing that they were after , have you ? '' 
`` Here it is , sir , '' said I , and gave him the oilskin packet . 
The doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat . 
`` Squire , '' said he , `` when Dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . '' 
`` As you will , Livesey , '' said the squire ; `` Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . '' 
So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and I made a hearty supper , for I was as hungry as a hawk , while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed . 
`` And now , squire , '' said the doctor . 
`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath . 
`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey . 
`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? '' 
`` Heard of him ! '' 
cried the squire . 
`` Heard of him , you say ! 
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed . 
Blackbeard was a child to Flint . 
The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman . 
I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . '' 
`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor . 
`` But the point is , had he money ? '' 
`` Money ! '' 
cried the squire . 
`` Have you heard the story ? 
What were these villains after but money ? 
What do they care for but money ? 
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? '' 
`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor . 
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in . 
What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? '' 
`` Amount , sir ! '' 
cried the squire . 
`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . '' 
`` Very well , '' said the doctor . 
`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table . 
The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors . 
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper . 
`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor . 
The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search . 
On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice . 
One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible . 
I could not help wondering who it was that had `` got itt , '' and what `` itt '' was that he got . 
A knife in his back as like as not . 
`` Not much instruction there , '' said Dr. Livesey as he passed on . 
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries . 
There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two . 
On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause . 
In a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as `` 62o entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , `` Bones , his pile . '' 
`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' said Dr. Livesey . 
`` The thing is as clear as noonday , '' cried the squire . 
`` This is the black-hearted hound 's account-book . 
These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered . 
The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer . 
` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast . 
God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago . '' 
`` Right ! '' 
said the doctor . 
`` See what it is to be a traveller . 
Right ! 
And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . '' 
There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French , English , and Spanish moneys to a common value . 
`` Thrifty man ! '' 
cried the doctor . 
`` He was n't the one to be cheated . '' 
`` And now , '' said the squire , `` for the other . '' 
The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I had found in the captain 's pocket . 
The doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores . 
It was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine land-locked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked `` The Spy-glass . '' 
There were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery characters , these words : `` Bulk of treasure here . '' 
Over on the back the same hand had written this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet . 
The bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it . 
The arms are easy found , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bearing E. and a quarter N. J.F. . 
That was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight . 
`` Livesey , '' said the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once . 
Tomorrow I start for Bristol . 
In three weeks ' time -- three weeks ! 
-- two weeks -- ten days -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England . 
Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy . 
You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins . 
You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral . 
We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter . 
We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . '' 
`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking . 
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . '' 
`` And who 's that ? '' 
cried the squire . 
`` Name the dog , sir ! '' 
`` You , '' replied the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue . 
We are not the only men who know of this paper . 
These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blades , for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money . 
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea . 
Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . '' 
`` Livesey , '' returned the squire , `` you are always in the right of it . 
I 'll be as silent as the grave . '' 
IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended . 
The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures . 
I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered . 
Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects . 
Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures . 
So the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be opened , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . '' 
Obeying this order , we found , or rather I found -- for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both places . 
The ship is bought and fitted . 
She lies at anchor , ready for sea . 
You never imagined a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred tons ; name , HISPANIOLA . 
I got her through my old friend , Blandly , who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump . 
The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest , and so , I may say , did everyone in Bristol , as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for -- treasure , I mean . 
`` Redruth , '' said I , interrupting the letter , `` Dr. Livesey will not like that . 
The squire has been talking , after all . '' 
`` Well , who 's a better right ? '' 
growled the gamekeeper . 
`` A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . '' 
At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on : Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA , and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle . 
There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly . 
They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him , and that he sold it me absurdly high -- the most transparent calumnies . 
None of them dare , however , to deny the merits of the ship . 
So far there was not a hitch . 
The workpeople , to be sure -- riggers and what not -- were most annoyingly slow ; but time cured that . 
It was the crew that troubled me . 
I wished a round score of men -- in case of natives , buccaneers , or the odious French -- and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required . 
I was standing on the dock , when , by the merest accident , I fell in talk with him . 
I found he was an old sailor , kept a public-house , knew all the seafaring men in Bristol , had lost his health ashore , and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again . 
He had hobbled down there that morning , he said , to get a smell of the salt . 
I was monstrously touched -- so would you have been -- and , out of pure pity , I engaged him on the spot to be ship 's cook . 
Long John Silver , he is called , and has lost a leg ; but that I regarded as a recommendation , since he lost it in his country 's service , under the immortal Hawke . 
He has no pension , Livesey . 
Imagine the abominable age we live in ! 
Well , sir , I thought I had only found a cook , but it was a crew I had discovered . 
Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable -- not pretty to look at , but fellows , by their faces , of the most indomitable spirit . 
I declare we could fight a frigate . 
Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged . 
He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance . 
I am in the most magnificent health and spirits , eating like a bull , sleeping like a tree , yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan . 
Seaward , ho ! 
Hang the treasure ! 
It 's the glory of the sea that has turned my head . 
So now , Livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me . 
Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother , with Redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to Bristol . 
John Trelawney Postscript -- I did not tell you that Blandly , who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we do n't turn up by the end of August , had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man , which I regret , but in all other respects a treasure . 
Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named Arrow . 
I have a boatswain who pipes , Livesey ; so things shall go man-o ' - war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA . 
I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance ; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker 's account , which has never been overdrawn . 
He leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving . 
J. T. P.P.S. -- Hawkins may stay one night with his mother . 
J. T . 
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me . 
I was half beside myself with glee ; and if ever I despised a man , it was old Tom Redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament . 
Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire 's pleasure , and the squire 's pleasure was like law among them all . 
Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble . 
The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow , and there I found my mother in good health and spirits . 
The captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling . 
The squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar . 
He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone . 
It was on seeing that boy that I understood , for the first time , my situation . 
I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that I was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , I had my first attack of tears . 
I am afraid I led that boy a dog 's life , for as he was new to the work , I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and I was not slow to profit by them . 
The night passed , and the next day , after dinner , Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road . 
I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born , and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted , no longer quite so dear . 
One of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabre-cut cheek , and his old brass telescope . 
Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight . 
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath . 
I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , I must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Bristol , '' said Tom . 
`` Get down . '' 
Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner . 
Thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations . 
In one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider 's . 
Though I had lived by the shore all my life , I seemed never to have been near the sea till then . 
The smell of tar and salt was something new . 
I saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean . 
I saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted . 
And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure ! 
While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk . 
`` Here you are , '' he cried , `` and the doctor came last night from London . 
Bravo ! 
The ship 's company complete ! '' 
`` Oh , sir , '' cried I , `` when do we sail ? '' 
`` Sail ! '' 
says he . 
`` We sail tomorrow ! '' 
WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign . 
I set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until I found the tavern in question . 
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment . 
The sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded . 
There was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke . 
The customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door , almost afraid to enter . 
As I was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John . 
His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird . 
He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling . 
Indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests . 
Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow . 
But one look at the man before me was enough . 
I had seen the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord . 
I plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer . 
`` Mr. Silver , sir ? '' 
I asked , holding out the note . 
`` Yes , my lad , '' said he ; `` such is my name , to be sure . 
And who may you be ? '' 
And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he , quite loud , and offering his hand . 
`` I see . 
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . '' 
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp . 
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door . 
It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment . 
But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance . 
It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow . 
`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him ! 
It 's Black Dog ! '' 
`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver . 
`` But he has n't paid his score . 
Harry , run and catch him . '' 
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit . 
`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Black what ? '' 
`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ? 
He was one of them . '' 
`` So ? '' 
cried Silver . 
`` In my house ! 
Ben , run and help Harry . 
One of those swabs , was he ? 
Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ? 
Step up here . '' 
The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid . 
`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? '' 
`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute . 
`` You did n't know his name , did you ? '' 
`` No , sir . '' 
`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! '' 
exclaimed the landlord . 
`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that . 
And what was he saying to you ? '' 
`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan . 
`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? '' 
cried Long John . 
`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you ! 
Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ? 
Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ? 
Pipe up ! 
What was it ? '' 
`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan . 
`` Keel-hauling , was you ? 
And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that . 
Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . '' 
And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid . 
And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ? 
No , I do n't know the name , not I . 
Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab . 
He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . '' 
`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too . 
His name was Pew . '' 
`` It was ! '' 
cried Silver , now quite excited . 
`` Pew ! 
That were his name for certain . 
Ah , he looked a shark , he did ! 
If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney ! 
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben . 
He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers ! 
He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ? 
I 'LL keel-haul him ! '' 
All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner . 
My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly . 
But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver . 
`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' said he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ? 
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ? 
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum ! 
Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights ! 
Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n . 
You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint . 
I see that when you first come in . 
Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ? 
When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something . 
`` The score ! '' 
he burst out . 
`` Three goes o ' rum ! 
Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! ''
