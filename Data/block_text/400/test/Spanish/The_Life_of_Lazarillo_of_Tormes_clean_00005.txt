One of them belonged to the Franciscan order , and he asked me if I would like to carry his bundle to his monastery . 
I told him I would be glad to because I saw that he certainly would n't trick me the way the whore had done . 
I loaded it onto my back , and it was so heavy I could barely carry it , but I thought of the payment I would get , and that gave me strength . 
When we reached the monastery I was very tired because it had been so far . 
The friar took his bundle and said , `` May heaven reward you , '' and then he closed the door behind him . 
I waited for him to come back out and pay me , but when I saw how long he was taking , I knocked on the door . 
The gatekeeper came out and asked me what I wanted . 
I told him I wanted to be paid for carrying the bundle I 'd brought . 
He told me to go away , that they did n't pay anything there . 
As he closed the door he told me not to knock again because it was the hour for meditations , and if I did he would whip me thoroughly . 
I stood there , stupified . 
A poor man -- one of those who were standing inside the vestibule -- said to me , `` Brother , you might as well go away . 
These fathers never have any money . 
They live on what other people give them . '' 
`` They can live on whatever they want to , but they 'll pay me or I 'm not Lazaro of Tormes . '' 
I began to knock again very angrily . 
The lay brother came out even angrier , and without saying so much as , how do you do ? 
he knocked me to the ground like a ripe pear , and holding me down , he kicked me a good half-dozen times , then pounded me just as much , and left me flattened out as if the clocktower of Saragossa had fallen on top of me . 
I lay there , stretched out , for more than a half-hour without being able to get up . 
I thought about my bad luck and that the strength of that irregular clergyman had been used so badly . 
He would have been better off serving under His Highness , the King , than living from alms for the poor -- although they are n't even good for that since they 're so lazy . 
The Emperor , Charles V , pointed this out when the General of the Franciscans offered him twenty-two-thousand friars , who would n't be over forty or under twenty-two years old , to fight in the war . 
The invincible Emperor answered that he did n't want them because he would have needed twenty-two-thousand pots stew every day to keep them alive , implying that they were more fit for eating than working . 
God forgive me , but from that day to this I 've hated those clergymen so much that whenever I see them they look to me like lazy drones or sieves that lift the meat out of the stew and leave the broth . 
I wanted to leave that work , but first I waited there that night , stretched out like a corpse waiting for his funeral . 
Feeling faint and dying from hunger , I went up the street very slowly , and as I passed by the Plaza of Cebada I ran into an old devout woman with fangs longer than a wild boar . 
She came up to me and asked if I wanted to carry a trunk to the house of a friend of hers , saying that it was n't far away and that she would give me forty coppers . 
When I heard that , I praised God to hear such sweet words coming from such a foul-smelling mouth as hers : she would give me forty coppers ! 
I told her I would , with pleasure -- but my real pleasure was being able to grab onto those forty coppers rather than to carry anything , since I was more in a condition to be carried than to carry . 
I loaded the trunk on my back , but it was so big and heavy I could barely lift it . 
The good old woman told me to handle it carefully because inside were some perfume bottles that she prized highly . 
I told her not to worry because I would walk very slowly . 
-LRB- And even if I had wanted to I could n't have done anything else : I was so hungry I could barely waddle . -RRB- 
We reached the house we were taking the chest to . 
They were very happy to get it , especially a young maiden , plump and dimpled -LRB- I was wishing that after I 'd eaten a good meal and was in bed , the lice there looked like her -RRB- : she smiled happily and said she wanted the trunk in her dressing room . 
I took it there : the old lady gave her the key and told her to keep it until she got back from Segovia . 
She said she was going there to visit a relative of hers , and she thought she would be back in four days . 
She gave the girl a hug before she left and whispered a few words in her ear that turned the maiden as red as a rose . 
And although I thought that was nice , I would have thought it was nicer if I had had plenty to eat . 
She said good-by to everyone in the house , and asked the girl 's father and mother to forgive her for being so bold . 
They told her she was welcome there anytime . 
She gave me forty coppers and whispered in my ear to come back to her house the next morning and I would earn forty more . 
I went away , happier than a bride in June . 
I spent thirty coppers on supper , and kept ten to pay for a room . 
I thought about the power of money . 
As soon as that old woman gave me the forty coppers I found myself lighter than the wind , more valiant than Roland , and stronger than Hercules . 
Oh , money , it is not without reason that most men consider you their God . 
You are the cause of all good , and the root of all evil . 
You are the inventor of the arts and the one who keeps them excellent . 
Because of you some maidens remain pure and other maidens give up their purity . 
Finally , there is no difficulty in the world difficult for you , no hidden place that you do not penetrate , no mountain you do not level , no humble hill you do not raise up . 
The next morning I went to the old lady 's house the way she asked me . 
She told me to go back with her and pick up the trunk she had left the day before . 
She told the people at the house that she had come back for it because when she was about a mile from Madrid , on the way to Segovia , she had met her relative who had had the same idea she did and was coming to visit her , and that she had to have it now because there were clean linens in it that she needed for her relative 's room . 
The plumpish girl gave her back the key , kissing and hugging her more eagerly than the first time ; and after she had whispered to her again , they helped me load the trunk on my back , and it seemed to me lighter than the day before because my belly was fuller . 
As I went down the stairs I stumbled over something that the Devil must have put there . 
I tripped and fell with the baggage , and as I rolled down to the bottom of the stairs where the parents of the innocent girl were waiting , I broke both my nose and my ribs . 
With the knocks that damned chest got , it opened up , and inside there appeared a dashing young man with sword and dagger at his side . 
He was dressed in traveling clothes , without a cloak . 
His trousers and jacket were of green satin , and in his hat he wore a feather of the same color . 
He had on red garters with pearl-white stockings and white sandals . 
He stood up very elegantly , and making a deep bow he walked right out the door . 
Everyone stood there agape at the sudden vision , and they looked at each other like wooden puppets . 
When they came out of their trance , they quickly called two of their sons and told them what had happened . 
With a great outcry the sons grabbed their swords , and shouted , `` Kill him , kill him ! '' 
They ran out looking for that dandy , but since he had left in a hurry , they were n't able to catch up with him . 
The parents had stayed behind in the house , and they closed the door and went to take revenge on the bawd . 
But she had heard the noise and knew what the cause of it was , and she went out a back door with the eternal bride-to-be right behind her . 
So the parents found themselves totally taken in . 
They came back down to take their revenge out on me , and I was all crippled up , unable to move . 
If it had n't been for that , I would have been right behind that fellow who had caused all my damage . 
The brothers came in sweating and panting , vowing and swearing that since they had n't caught that wretch , they would kill their sister and the go-between . 
But when they were told they had gotten away by the back door , there was swearing and cursing everywhere . 
One of them said , `` If only the Devil himself were here right now with all his hellish throng : I would polish them off like flies . 
Come on , you devils , come on ! 
But what am I calling you for ? 
I know that where you are , you 're so afraid of my temper you would n't dare show yourselves here . 
If I 'd seen that coward , I would only have had to breathe hard on him , and he would have blown so far away you 'd never hear of him again . '' 
The other one said , `` If I had caught up with him , I would n't have left a piece of him bigger than his ear . 
But if he 's to be found anywhere in this world -- or even if he 's not -- he wo n't escape my hands . 
I 'll get him even if he hides in the center of the earth . '' 
They kept on with these boasts and other empty threats , and poor Lazaro was expecting all those heavy clouds to unload on him . 
But he was more afraid of the ten or twelve little boys there than of those braggers . 
Everyone , old and young , attacked me in a fury : some kicked me , others hit me with their fists ; some pulled my hair , others boxed my ears . 
My fear had n't been in vain because the girls stuck long penny needles into me , and that made me cry out at the top of my lungs . 
The family slaves pinched me until I saw stars . 
Some of them said , `` Let 's kill him . '' 
Others said , `` Better yet , let 's throw him in the privy . '' 
The clamor was so great it sounded like they were pulverizing chaff , or that they were hammers in a fulling mill that were n't letting up . 
When they saw that I was out of breath , they stopped beating me , but they did n't stop threatening me . 
Since the father was more mature , or more rotten , he told them to leave me alone , and he said that if I would tell the truth about who had robbed him of his honor , they would n't hurt me any more . 
I could n't do what he asked because I did n't know who the fellow was : I had never even seen him before he 'd come out of the casket . 
Since I did n't say anything , they started in again . 
And there I was groaning , crying over my bad luck , sighing , and cursing my misfortune since it was always finding new ways to persecute me . 
I was finally able to tell them to stop and I would tell them the facts of the matter . 
They did , and I told them to the letter what had happened , but they would n't believe the truth . 
Seeing that the storm was n't letting up , I decided to outwit them if I could , and so I promised to show them the villain . 
They stopped hammering on me and offered me wonders . 
They asked me what his name was and where he lived . 
I told them I did n't know his name , much less that of the street he lived on , but if they wanted to carry me -LRB- it was impossible for me to go on foot because of the way they had beaten me -RRB- , I would show them his house . 
They were delighted , and they gave me a little wine , so that I recovered my spirits a bit . 
Then they gathered all their weapons , and two of them picked me up under the arms like a French lady and carried me through the streets of Madrid . 
The people who saw me said , `` They 're taking that man to jail . '' 
And others said , `` No , it 's to the hospital . '' 
And none of them were right . 
I was confused and stunned . 
I did n't know what to do or what to say . 
Because if I cried for help , they would complain about me to the law , and I was more afraid of that than death . 
It was impossible for me to run away , not only because of the beating they had given me , but because I was surrounded by the father , sons , and relatives -- eight or nine of them had gotten together for the enterprise . 
They were walking along , like Saint George , armed to the teeth . 
We crossed streets and passed by alleys without my knowing where I was or where I was taking them . 
We reached the Sol Gate , and I saw a gallant young fellow coming up one of the streets that led to it , prancing on tiptoe , his cape under his arm , with a huge glove in one hand and a carnation in the other , swinging his arms like he was the first cousin of the Duke of Infantado . 
He was moving his hands and swaying back and forth . 
I recognized him immediately : it was my master , the squire , who had stolen my clothes in Murcia . 
I do n't doubt for a minute but that some saint put him there for me -LRB- because there was n't one left in the litany that I had n't called on -RRB- . 
When I saw opportunity knocking , I grabbed it by the head and decided to kill two birds with one stone -- taking vengeance on that bragger and freeing myself from those hangmen . 
So I said to them , `` Look ! 
That libertine who stole your honor is coming this way , and he 's changed his clothes . '' 
They were blind with rage , and without further ado they asked me which one he was . 
I pointed him out . 
They fell on him , and grabbing him by the collar , they threw him to the ground and kicked , trampled , and clouted him . 
One of the boys , a brother of the girl , wanted to run him through with his sword , but his father stopped him and called the law officers over , and they put shackles on the squire . 
When I saw all the turmoil and everyone busy , I made myself scarce and hid as well as I could . 
My good squire had recognized me , and thinking that those were relatives of mine demanding my clothes back , he said , `` Let me go , let me go ! 
I 'll pay you enough for two suits of clothes ! '' 
But they stopped up his mouth with their fists . 
Bleeding , his head pounded in , and beaten to a pulp , they took him off to jail while I left Madrid , damning my job and whoever had invented it . 
the Way I wanted to be on my way , but my strength was n't equal to my intentions , and so I stayed in Madrid for a few days . 
I did n't get along badly there because I used a pair of crutches -- since I could n't walk without them -- and I begged from door to door and from convent to convent until I had enough strength to set out . 
I was quick to do it because of what I heard a beggar tell who was sitting in the sun with some others , picking off fleas . 
It was the story of the trunk I 've just told about , but the beggar added that the man they put in jail , thinking he was the one who had been inside the chest , had proved it was n't him . 
Because at the time it had all happened he was in his room ; and none of his neighbors had ever seen him wearing any other clothes than the ones he had on when they arrested him . 
But even at that , they had still paraded him through the streets for being a vagabond , and had banished him from Madrid . 
The beggar also told how that man and the maiden 's relatives were looking for a baggage carrier , who had contrived the whole business , and they swore that the first one who found him would run him through until he looked like a sieve . 
When I heard that , I was all eyes , and I put a patch over one of them . 
Then I shaved off my beard like a mock priest , and the way I looked then , I was sure that not even the mother who bore me would have recognized me . 
I left Madrid , intending to go to Tejares to see whether fortune would disown me if I went back to the mold . 
I passed by the Escorial , a building that reflects the greatness of the monarch who was having it built -LRB- it was n't finished yet -RRB- and so much so that it can be counted among the wonders of the world , although you ca n't say it is a very pleasant place to have it built at , since the land is barren and mountainous . 
But the summer air is so nice that all you have to do is sit in the shade and you wo n't be bothered by the heat or the cold , and the air is very healthy . 
Less than three miles from there I met a band of gypsies who had set up camp in an old country house . 
When they saw me from a distance they thought I was one of them because my clothes seemed to promise no less ; but when I got close they saw they were mistaken . 
They shunned me a little because , as I saw , they were holding a conference or debate on thievery . 
They told me that was n't the road to Salamanca but to Valladolid . 
Since my business did n't force me to go to one place instead of any other , I told them that if that 's the way it was , I wanted to see that city before I went back to my own town . 
One of the oldest men there asked me where I was from , and when I told him Tejares , he invited me to eat with them because we were almost neighbors : he was from Salamanca . 
I accepted , and afterwards they asked me to tell about myself and my life . 
I did -LRB- they did n't have to ask me twice -RRB- , with the fewest and shortest words that such great things allowed . 
When I came to the part about the barrel and what happened to me at the innkeeper 's place in Madrid , they burst into laughter , especially a man and woman gypsy who nearly split their sides . 
I began to feel ashamed , and my face turned red . 
The gypsy who was my neighbor saw me blushing , and he said , `` Do n't be ashamed , brother . 
These people are n't laughing at you ; your life is more deserving of admiration than laughter . 
And since you have told us so much about yourself , it is only right that we should repay you the same way . 
We will put our trust in you just as you have trusted us . 
And if the people here will allow me , I will tell you the reason for their laughter . '' 
Everyone told him to go ahead because they knew he was discreet and experienced enough not to let things go too far . 
`` For your information , then , '' he continued , `` those people who are laughing over there are the maiden and the priest who jumped in puribus when the deluge from your barrel nearly flooded them . 
If they want to they can tell you how the turns of fortune have brought them to their present state . '' 
The brand new gypsy girl asked them to let her do it , capturing the benevolence of the illustrious audience , and so , with a sonorous , peaceful , and grave voice , she told her story . 
`` The day I left , or leaped -LRB- to be more accurate -RRB- , from my father 's house and they took me off to prison , they put me in a room that was darker than it was clean and that reeked more than it was decorated . 
Father Urbez , who is here and wo n't let me lie , was put in jail until he told them he was a priest . 
Then they immediately gave him over to the bishop , who scolded him severely for having let himself be overcome by a drop in the ocean and for having caused such a scandal . 
But when he promised to be more careful and watch himself so that not even the ground would know of his comings and goings , they let him loose and told him not to say mass for a month . 
`` I stayed in the warden 's charge , and since he was a young , handsome fellow and I was not a bad-looking girl , he took special care of me . 
For me , jail was a palace -- a garden of pleasures . 
My parents were indignant at my looseness but did what they could so I could get loose . 
But it was useless : the warden arranged things so I would n't escape his hands . 
Meanwhile the priest , who is here with us , was walking around the prison like an Irish setter , trying to get to talk to me . 
He was able to do it by means of a third party who was first in the bawdry business . 
She dressed him up like one of her maids , in a skirt and blouse , then she put a muffler over his beard , as if he had a toothache . 
At this interview my escape was planned . 
`` The next night there was a party at the house of Count Miranda , and some gypsies were going to dance at the end of it . 
Canil -LRB- that 's the name of Reverend Urbez now -RRB- arranged for them to help him with his plans . 
The gypsies did everything so well that , because of their cleverness , we got the liberty we wanted and their company , too -- the best on earth . 
The afternoon before the party I smiled at the warden more than a cat at a tripe stand , and I made more promises than a sailor in a storm . 
Feeling favored by them , he answered with just as many and begged me to ask him for anything and he would give it , as long as it was n't to lose sight of me . 
I thanked him very much and told him that if I lost sight of him that would be the worst thing that could happen to me . 
Seeing that I had struck home , I begged him -- since he could do it -- to take me to the party that night . 
He thought it would be difficult , but not to go back on his promise and because the little blind archer had wounded him with an arrow , he gave his word . 
`` The chief constable was in love with me , too , and he had ordered all the guards , and even the warden , to take care of me and not to move me anywhere . 
To keep it secret , the warden dressed me up like a page in a damask green suit , trimmed in gold . 
The cloak was velvet of the same color , lined with yellow satin ; the brimmed cap had feathers and a little diamond band . 
The neck was scalloped lace , the stockings were straw-colored with large , embroidered garters , the shoes were white with a perforated design , and there was a gilded sword and dagger like those made by Ayresvola . 
`` We came to the hall where there were large numbers of ladies and gentlemen : the men were gallant and jovial , the ladies were elegant and beautiful , and many kept their faces covered with shawls and capes . 
Canil was dressed like a braggadocio , and when he saw me he came up to my side , so that I was standing between him and the warden . 
`` The festivities began , and I saw things I wo n't tell about since they 're beside the point . 
The gypsies came out to dance and do tumbling tricks . 
Two of them began to have words about their tumbling ; one word led to another , and the first one called the other a liar . 
The one who had been called a liar brought his knife down on the other one 's head , and so much blood began pouring out you would have thought they had killed an ox . 
The people there , who thought it was a joke until then , began to run around , shouting , ` Help , help ! ' 
Some law officers ran over , and everyone reached for his sword . 
I pulled out my own , and when I saw it in my hand I trembled at the sight of it . 
They grabbed the guilty man , and a man who had been put there for that purpose by the gypsies said the warden was there and would take care of him . 
The chief constable called the warden over to put the murderer in his hands . 
The warden wanted to take me with him , but he was afraid I might be recognized , and he told me to go over to a corner he pointed out and not to move from there until he came back . 
When I saw that that crab louse had let go of me I took hold of Father Canil 's hand . 
He was still by my side , and we were in the street like a shot . 
There we found one of these gentlemen who took us to his camp . 
`` When the wounded man -LRB- whom everyone believed was dead -RRB- thought we must have escaped , he got to his feet and said , ` Gentlemen , the joke is over . 
I 'm not hurt , and we did this to brighten up the party . ' 
`` He took off his cap , and inside was an ox bladder on top of a good steel helmet . 
It had been filled with blood and had burst open when the knife struck it . 
Everyone began to laugh at the joke except the warden , who did n't like it at all . 
He went back to the place where he had told me to wait , and when he did n't find me there he started looking for me . 
He asked an old gypsy woman if she had seen a page of such and such a description , and since she was in on our game she told him she had and that she had heard him say as he was leaving , holding a man 's hand , ` Let 's go hide in the convent of San Felipe . ' 
`` He quickly went after me , but it did no good because he went east and we were running to the west . 
`` Before we left Madrid we exchanged my clothes for these , and they gave me two hundred pieces of silver besides . 
I sold the diamond band for four hundred gold pieces . 
And when we got here I gave these gentlemen two hundred , as Canil had promised them . 
That 's the story of how I was set free , and if Mr. Lazaro wants anything else , let him ask . 
We will do for him whatever the gentleman desires . '' 
I thanked her for the courtesy , and as best I could I took my leave of them all . 
The good old man walked with me for a few miles . 
As we were walking along I asked him if those people were all gypsies born in Egypt . 
He told me there was n't a damned one from Egypt in Spain : all of them there were really priests , friars , nuns , or thieves who had escaped from jail or from their convents . 
But the biggest scoundrels of all were the ones who had left their monasteries , exchanging the contemplative life for the active one . 
The old man went back to his camp , while I rode to Valladolid on the shank 's mare . 
What thoughts I had all along the road about my good gypsies : their way of life , their customs , the way they behaved . 
It really amazed me that the law let such thieves go around so freely , since everyone knows that their life involves nothing but stealing . 
Theirs is an asylum -- a shelter for thieves , a congregation of apostates , and a school for evil . 
I was especially astonished that friars would leave a life of rumination to follow the one of ruination and fatigue of the gypsies . 
I would n't have believed what the gypsy told me if he had n't shown me a gypsy man and woman a mile from the camp , behind the walls of a shelter : he was broad-shouldered , and she was plump . 
He was n't sunburned , and she was n't tanned by harsh weather . 
One of them was singing a verse from the psalms of David , and the other was answering with another verse . 
The good old man told me that they were a friar and a nun who had come to his congregation not more than a week ago , wanting to profess a more austere life . 
I came to an inn three miles from Valladolid , and I saw the old lady from Madrid , along with the young maiden of yore , sitting in the doorway . 
A gallant young fellow came out to call them in to eat . 
They did n't recognize me because of my good disguise : my patch still over one eye and my clothes worn in the roguish style . 
But I knew I was the Lazaro who had come out of the tomb that had been so harsh on me . 
I went up to them to see if they would give me anything . 
But they could n't because they did n't have anything for themselves . 
The young man who served as their steward was so generous that , for himself , his sweetheart , and the old bawd , he 'd had a tiny bit of pork liver prepared with a sauce . 
I could have shoveled down everything on the plate in less than two mouthfuls . 
The bread was as black as the tablecloth , and that looked like a penitent 's tunic or a rag for cleaning stoves . 
`` Eat , my dove , '' the gentleman said . 
`` This meal is fit for a prince . '' 
The go-between ate without a word so as not to lose any time and because she saw there was n't enough for all of them . 
They began to clean up the plate with such gusto that they removed the finish . 
When the poor , sad meal was over -- and it had made them more hungry than full -- the gentle lover made excuses by saying the inn did n't have much food . 
When I saw they did n't have anything for me , I asked the innkeeper what there was to eat . 
He told me , `` It depends how much you want to pay . '' 
He wanted to give me a few chitterlings . 
I asked him if he had anything else . 
He offered me a quarter of kid that the lover had n't wanted because it was too expensive . 
I wanted to impress them , so I told him to give it to me . 
I sat down with it at the end of the table , and their stares were a sight to behold . 
With each mouthful I swallowed six eyes , because those of the lover , the girl , and the bawd were fastened on what I was eating . 
`` What 's going on ? '' 
asked the maiden . 
`` That poor man is eating a quarter of kid , and there was nothing for us but a poor piece of fried liver . '' 
The young fellow answered that he had asked the innkeeper for some partridges , capons or hens , and that he had told him he did n't have anything else to offer . 
I knew the truth of the matter -- that he had put them on that diet because he did n't want to pay or could n't , but I decided to eat and keep quiet . 
The kid was like a magnet . 
Without warning , I found all three of them hovering over my plate . 
The brazen-faced little bitch picked up a piece and said , `` With your permission , brother . '' 
But before she had it , she had the piece in her mouth . 
The old woman said , `` Do n't steal his meal from this poor sinner . '' 
`` I 'm not stealing it , '' she answered . 
`` I intend to pay him for it very well . '' 
And in the same breath she began to eat so fast and furiously that it looked like she had n't eaten in six days . 
The old woman took a bite to see how it tasted . 
`` Is it really that good ? '' 
said the young man . 
And he filled his mouth with an enormous piece . 
When I saw that they were going too far , I picked up everything on the plate and stuck it in my mouth . 
It was so big that it could n't go down or up . 
While I was in this struggle , two armed men came riding up to the door of the inn , wearing vests and helmets and carrying shields . 
Each of them had one musket at his side and another on the saddle . 
They dismounted and gave their mules to a foot servant . 
They asked the innkeeper if there was anything to eat . 
He told them he had a good supply of food , and if they liked they could go into the hall while he was preparing it . 
The old woman had gone over to the door when she heard the noise , and she came back with her hands over her face , bowing as much as a novice monk . 
She spoke with a wee , tiny voice and was laboriously twisting back and forth like she was going into labor . 
As softly and well as she could , she said , `` We 're lost . 
Clara 's brothers -LRB- Clara was the maiden 's name -RRB- are outside . '' 
The girl began to pull and tear at her hair , hitting herself so hard it was like she was possessed . 
The young man was courageous , and he consoled her , telling her not to worry , that he could handle everything . 
I was all ears , with my mouth full of kid , and when I heard that those braggers were there I thought I was going to die of fear . 
And I would have , too , but since my gullet was closed off , my soul did n't find the door standing open , and it went back down . 
The two Cids came in , and as soon as they saw their sister and the bawd they shouted , `` Here they are ! 
At last we have them . 
Now they 'll die ! '' 
I was so frightened by their shouts that I fell to the floor , and when I hit I ejected the goat that was choking me . 
The two women got behind the young man like chicks under a hen 's wing running from a hawk . 
Brave and graceful , he pulled out his sword and went at the brothers so furiously that their fright turned them into statues . 
The words froze in their mouths , and the swords in their sheaths . 
The young man asked them what they wanted or what they were looking for , and as he was talking he grabbed one of them and took away his sword . 
Then he pointed this sword at his eyes , while he held his own sword at the other one 's eyes . 
At every movement he made with the swords , they trembled like leaves . 
When the old woman and the sister saw the two Rolands so subdued , they went up and disarmed them . 
The innkeeper came in at the noise we were all making -LRB- I had gotten up and had one of them by the beard -RRB- . 
It all seemed to me like the gentle bulls in my town : boys , when they see them , run away ; but they gradually get more and more daring , and when they see they are n't as fierce as they look , they lose all their fear and go right up and throw all kinds of garbage on them . 
When I saw that those scarecrows were n't as ferocious as they looked , I plucked up my courage and attacked them more bravely than my earlier terror had allowed . 
`` What 's this ? '' 
asked the innkeeper . 
`` Who dares to cause such an uproar in my house ? '' 
The women , the gentleman , and I began shouting that they were thieves who had been following us to rob us . 
When the innkeeper saw them without any weapons , and at our mercy , he said , `` Thieves in my house ! '' 
He grabbed hold of them and helped us put them in a cellar , not listening to one word of their protests . 
Their servant came back from feeding the mules , and he asked where his masters were : the innkeeper put him in with them . 
He took their bags , their saddle cushions , and their portmanteaus and locked them up , and he gave us the weapons as if they belonged to him . 
He did n't charge us for the food so that we would sign a lawsuit he had drawn up against them . 
He said he was a minister of the Inquisition , and as a law officer in that district , he was condemning the three of them to the galleys for the rest of their lives , and to be whipped two hundred times around the inn . 
They appealed to the Chancery of Valladolid , and the good innkeeper and three of his servants took them there . 
When the poor fellows thought they were before the judges , they found themselves before the Inquisitors , because the sly innkeeper had put down on the record some words they had spoken against the officials of the Holy Inquisition -LRB- an unpardonable crime -RRB- . 
They put the brothers in dark jail cells , and they could n't write their father or ask anyone to help them the way they had thought they could . 
And there we will leave them , well guarded , to get back to our innkeeper , because we met him on the road . 
He told us that the Inquisitors had commanded him to have the witnesses who had signed the lawsuit appear before them . 
But , as a friend , he was advising us to go into hiding . 
The young maiden gave him a ring from her finger , begging him to arrange things so we would n't have to appear . 
He promised he would . 
But the thief said this to make us leave , so that if they wanted to hear witnesses they would n't discover his chicanery -LRB- and it was n't his first -RRB- . 
In two weeks Valladolid was the scene of an auto de fe , and I saw the three poor devils come out with other penitents , with gags in their mouths , as blasphemers who had dared speak against the ministers of the Holy Inquisition -- a group of people as saintly and perfect as the justice they deal out . 
All three of them were wearing pointed hats and sanbenitos , and written on them were their crimes and the sentences they had been given . 
I was sorry to see that poor foot servant paying for something he had n't done . 
But I did n't feel as much pity for the other two because they 'd had so little on me . 
The innkeeper 's sentence was carried out , with the addition of three hundred lashes apiece , so they were given five hundred and sent to the galleys where their fierce bravado melted away . 
I sought out my fortune . 
Many times , on the street of Magdalena , I ran into my two women friends . 
But they never recognized me or were aware that I knew them . 
After a few days I saw the missionary-minded young maiden in the prisoners ' cells where she earned enough to maintain her affair and herself . 
The old woman carried on her business in that city . 
I reached Valladolid with six silver pieces in my purse because the people who saw me looking so skinny and pale gave me money with open hands , and I did n't take it with closed ones . 
I went straight to the clothing store , and for four silver coins and a twenty-copper piece I bought a long baize cloak , worn out , torn and unraveled , that had belonged to a Portuguese . 
With that , and a high , wide-brimmed hat like a Franciscan monk 's that I bought for half a silver piece , and with a cane in my hand , I took a stroll around . 
People who saw me mocked me . 
Everyone had a different name for me . 
Some of them called me a tavern philosopher . 
Others said , `` There goes Saint Peter , all dressed up for his feast day . '' 
And still others : `` Oh , Mr. Portugee , would you like some polish for your boots ? '' 
And somebody even said I must be a quack doctor 's ghost . 
I closed my ears like a shopkeeper and walked right past . 
After I had gone down a few streets I came upon a woman dressed in a full skirt , with very elegant shoes . 
She also had on a silk veil that came down to her bosom and had her hand on a little boy 's head . 
She asked me if I knew of any squires around there . 
I answered that I was the only one I knew of and that if she liked she could use me as her own . 
It was all arranged in the twinkling of an eye . 
She promised me sixty coppers for my meals and wages . 
I took the job and offered her my arm . 
I threw away the cane because I did n't need it anymore , and I was only using it to appear sickly and move people to pity . 
She sent the child home , telling him to have the maid set the table and get dinner ready . 
For more than two hours she took me from pillar to post , up one street and down another . 
The lady told me that when she got to the first house we were going to stop at , I was to go up to the house first and ask for the master or mistress of the house , and say , `` My lady , Juana Perez -LRB- that was her name -RRB- , is here and would like to pay her respects . '' 
She also told me that whenever I was with her and she stopped anywhere , I was always to take off my hat . 
I told her I knew what a servant 's duties were , and I would carry them out . 
I really wanted to see my new mistress 's face , but she kept her veil over it , and I could n't . 
She told me she would n't be able to keep me by herself but that she would arrange for some ladies who were neighbors of hers to use me , and between them they would give me the money she had promised . 
And meanwhile , until they all agreed -- which would n't take long -- she would give me her share . 
She asked me if I had a place to sleep . 
I told her I did n't . 
`` I 'll get you one , '' she said . 
`` My husband is a tailor , and you can sleep with his apprentices . 
You could n't find a better - paying job in the whole city , '' she continued , `` because in three days you 'll have six ladies , and each of them will give you ten coppers . '' 
I was nearly dumbstruck to see the pomposity of that woman who appeared to be , at the very least , the wife of a privileged gentleman or of some wealthy citizen . 
I was also astonished to see that I would have to serve seven mistresses to earn seventy poor coppers a day . 
But I thought that anything was better than nothing , and it was n't hard work . 
That was something I fled from like the Devil , because I was always more for eating cabbage and garlic without working than for working to eat capons and hens . 
When we came to her house , she gave me the veil and the shoes to give to the maid , and I saw what I was longing for . 
The young woman did n't look bad at all to me : she was a sprightly brunette , with a nice figure . 
The only thing I did n't like was that her face gleamed like a glazed earthen pot . 
She gave me the ten coppers and told me to come back two times every day -- at eight in the morning and three in the afternoon -- to see if she wanted to go out . 
I went to a pastry shop , and with a ten-copper piece of pie I put an end to my day 's wages . 
I spent the rest of the day like a chameleon because I had spent the money I 'd begged along the road . 
I did n't dare go begging anymore because if my mistress heard about it she would eat me alive . 
I went to her house at three o'clock ; she told me she did n't want to go out , but she warned me that from then on she would n't pay me on the days she did n't go out , and that if she only went out once a day she would give me five coppers and no more . 
But she said that since she was giving me a place to sleep , she expected to be served before all the others , and she wanted me to call myself her servant . 
For the sort of bed it was , she deserved that and even more . 
She made me sleep with the apprentices on a large table without a damned thing to cover us but a worn-out blanket . 
I spent two days on the miserable food that I could afford with ten coppers . 
Then the wife of a tanner joined the fraternity , and she haggled over the ten coppers for more than an hour . 
Finally , after five days , I had seven mistresses , and my wages were seventy coppers . 
I began to eat splendidly : the wine I drank was n't the worst , but it was n't the best either -LRB- I did n't want to overreach my hand and have it lopped off -RRB- . 
The five other women were the wife of a constable , a gardener 's wife , the niece -LRB- or so she said -RRB- of a chaplain in the Discalced order , a goodlooking , sprightly girl , and a tripe merchant . 
This last woman I liked best because whenever she gave me the ten coppers she invited me to have some tripe soup , and before I left her house I would have guzzled down three or four bowlsful . 
So I was living as content as could be . 
The last mistress was a devout woman : I had more to do with her than with the others because all she ever did was visit with friars , and when she was alone with them she was in her glory . 
Her house was like a beehive : some coming , others going , and they all came with their sleeves stuffed with things for her . 
For me , so I would be a faithful secretary , they brought some pieces of meat from their meals , which they put in their sleeves . 
I have never in my life seen a more hypocritical woman than she was . 
When she walked down the street she never took her eyes off the ground ; her rosary was always in her hand , and she would always be praying on it in the streets . 
Every woman who knew her begged her to pray to God for them since her prayers were so acceptable to Him . 
She told them she was a great sinner -LRB- and that was no lie -RRB- , but she was lying with the truth . 
Each of my mistresses had her own special time for me to come . 
When one of them said she did n't want to go out , I went to the next one 's house , until I finished my rounds . 
They told me what time to come back for them and without fail , because if I -LRB- sinner that I am -RRB- was even a little bit late , the lady would insult me in front of everyone she visited , and she would threaten me , saying that if I kept being so careless she would get another squire who was more diligent , careful , and punctual . 
Anyone hearing her shout and threaten me so haughtily undoubtedly thought she was paying me two pieces of silver every day and a salary of three hundred silver pieces a year besides . 
When my mistresses walked down the street each one looked like the wife of the judge over all Castile , or at least , of a judge of the Chancery . 
One day it happened that the chaplain 's niece and the constable 's wife met in a church , and both of them wanted to go home at the same time . 
The quarrel about which one I would take home first was so loud that it was as though we were in jail . 
They grabbed hold of me and pulled -- one at one side and one at the other -- so fiercely that they tore my cloak to shreds . 
And there I stood , stark naked , because I did n't have a damned thing under it but some ragged underwear that looked like a fish net . 
The people who saw the fish hook peeping out from the torn underwear laughed their heads off . 
The church was like a tavern : some were making fun of poor Lazaro ; others were listening to the two women dig up their grandparents . 
I was in such a hurry to gather up the pieces of my cloak that had fallen in their ripeness that I did n't get a chance to listen to what they were saying . 
I only heard the widow say , ` Where does this whore get all her pride ? 
Yesterday she was a water girl , and today she wears taffeta dresses at the expense of the souls in purgatory . 
The other woman answered , `` This one , the old gossip , got her black frocks at bargain prices from those who pay with a Deo Gratias , or a ` be charitable in God 's name . ' 
And if I was a water girl yesterday , she 's a hot-air merchant today . '' 
The people there separated the women because they had begun to pull each other 's hair . 
I finished picking up the pieces of my poor cloak , and I asked a devout woman there for two pins . 
Then I fixed it as well as I could and covered up my private parts .
