And from that day on , whenever he saw me , he took off his hat and spoke to me the way he was supposed to . '' 
`` But is n't that a good way for one man to greet another : to say ` God keep you ' ? '' 
`` Damn it ! '' 
he said . 
`` That 's what they say to the lower classes . 
But to people who are higher up , like me , they 're only supposed to say , ' I hope you are well today , sir . ' 
Or , at least , ' I hope you feel well today ' if the person talking to me is a gentleman . 
So I did n't want to put up with that man from my town who was filling me up to here with his ` God keep you . ' 
And I would n't put up with him either . 
In fact , I wo n't stand for anyone -- including the King himself -- to say to me ` God keep you , friend . ' '' 
`` Well , I 'll be . . . 
, '' I said . 
`` That 's why God does n't help you out . 
You wo n't let anyone ask Him to . '' 
`` Especially , '' he said , `` because I 'm not so poor . 
In fact , where I 'm from I have a huge estate -LRB- it 's fifty miles from where I was born , right along Costanilla , the main street of Valladolid -RRB- . 
And if the houses on it were still standing and kept up , it would be worth more than six thousand pieces of silver -- just to give you an idea of how big and grand it would be . 
And I have a pigeon house that would produce more than two hundred pigeons a year if it had n't fallen down . 
And there are some other things I wo n't mention , but I left them all because of my honor . 
`` And I came to this city , thinking I 'd find a good position . 
But it has n't turned out the way I thought it would . 
I meet lots of canons and other officials of the church , but those people are so tight with their money that no one could possibly get them to change their ways . 
Lesser men want me , too , but working for them is a lot of trouble . 
They want you to change from a man into a jack-of-all-trades , and if you wo n't , they give you the sack . 
And , generally , the paydays are few and far between ; most of the time your only sure way of being paid is when they feed you . 
And when they want to have a clear conscience and really pay you for the sweat of your brow , your payoff comes from their clothes closet with a sweaty old jacket or a ragged cape or coat . 
And even when a man has a position with someone of the nobility , he still has his troubles . 
`` I ask you : are n't I clever enough to serve one of them and make him happy ? 
Lord , if I ran into one , I really think I 'd be his favorite -- and I could do lots of things for him . 
Why , I could lie to him just as well as anyone else could . 
And I could flatter him like nothing he 'd ever seen before . 
And I 'd laugh at his stories and jokes even if they were n't exactly the funniest things in the world . 
I 'd never tell him anything disturbing even if he would be better off knowing it . 
I would be very conscientious in everything about him , both in word and in deed . 
And I would n't kill myself to do things he would n't see . 
Whenever he was around to hear me , I would always scold the servants so he 'd think I was very concerned about him . 
And if he were scolding one of his servants , I 'd step in with some pointed remarks about the culprit that would make the nobleman even madder , while I was appearing to take the servant 's side . 
I would praise the things he liked , but I 'd mock and slander the people of the house and even the ones who did n't live there . 
I would go prying and try to find out about other people 's lives so I could tell him about them . 
`` And I 'd do all sorts of other things like this that go on in palaces these days and that people in that sort of a position like . 
They do n't want to see good men in their homes . 
In fact , they think they 're useless , and actually , they hate them . 
They say they 're stupid people you ca n't deal with and that a nobleman ca n't confide in them . 
And smart people these days act with the nobility , as I say , just the way I would . 
But with my bad luck , I have n't met one of them . '' 
And so my master complained about his unhappy life , too , telling me how admirable he was . 
Well , about this time , a man and an old woman came in the door . 
The man wanted the rent money for the house , and the old lady had rented him the bed and wanted the money for that . 
They figured up the amount , and for two months ' rent they wanted what he could n't have made in a year . 
I think it was about twelve or thirteen pieces of silver . 
And he answered them very courteously : he said that he would go out to the square to change a doubloon and that they should come back that afternoon . 
But when he left , he never came back . 
So they returned in the afternoon , but it was too late . 
I told them that he still had n't come back . 
And when night came and he did n't , I was afraid to stay in the house alone . 
So I went to the women next door and told them what had happened , and I slept at their place . 
The next morning , the creditors returned . 
But no one was home , so they came to the door of the place I was staying at now and asked about their neighbor . 
And the women told them , `` Here is his servant and the door key . '' 
Then they asked me about him , and I told them I did n't know where he was and that he had n't come back home after going to get the change . 
And I said that I thought he 'd given both them and me the slip . 
When they heard that , they went to get a constable and a notary . 
And then they came back with them and took the key and called me and some witnesses over . 
And they opened the door and went inside to take my master 's property until he paid what he owed them . 
They walked through the entire house and found it empty , just as I 've said . 
And they asked me , `` What 's become of your master 's things -- his chests and drapes and furniture ? '' 
`` I do n't know anything about that , '' I answered . 
`` It 's obvious , '' they said , `` that last night they must have had it all taken out and carted somewhere else . 
Constable , arrest this boy . 
He knows where it is . '' 
Then the constable came over and grabbed me by the collar of my jacket , and he said , `` Boy , you 're under arrest unless you tell us what 's happened to your master 's things . '' 
I 'd never seen myself in such a fix -LRB- I had , of course , been held by the collar lots of times before , but that was done gently so that I could guide that man who could n't see down the road -RRB- , and so I was really scared . 
And while crying , I promised to answer their questions . 
`` All right , '' they said . 
`` Then tell us what you know . 
Do n't be afraid . '' 
The notary sat down on a stone bench so he could write out the inventory , and he asked me what things my master had . 
`` Sir , '' I said , `` according to what my master told me , he has a nice estate with houses on it and a pigeon house that is n't standing any more . '' 
`` All right , '' they said . 
`` Even though it probably is n't worth much , it will be enough to pay off his bill . 
And what part of the city is it located in ? '' 
they asked me . 
`` In his town , '' I answered . 
`` For God 's sake , we 're really getting far , '' they said . 
`` And just where is his town ? '' 
`` He told me that he came from Old Castile , '' I replied . 
And the constable and notary laughed out loud , and said , `` This sort of information would be good enough to pay off your debt even if it was bigger . '' 
The neighbor ladies were there , and they said : `` Gentlemen , this is just an innocent boy , and he 's only been with that squire a few days . 
He does n't know any more about him than you do . 
Besides , the poor little fellow has been coming to our house , and we 've given him what we could to eat out of charity , and at night he 's gone to his master 's place to sleep . '' 
When they saw that I was innocent , they let me loose and said I was free to go . 
And the constable and notary wanted the man and the woman to pay them for their services . 
And there was a lot of shouting and arguing about that . 
They said they were n't obligated to pay : there was no reason for them to , since nothing had been attached . 
But the men said that they had missed out on some other more profitable business just so they could come here . 
Finally , after a lot of shouting , they loaded the old lady 's old mattress onto a deputy -- even though it was n't very much of a load . 
And all five of them went off , shouting at each other . 
I do n't know how it all turned out . 
I think that sinner of a mattress must have paid everyone 's expenses . 
And that was a good use for it because the time it should have spent relaxing and resting from its past strain , it had still been going around being rented out . 
So , as I 've said , my poor third master left me , and I saw the hand of my bad luck in this , too . 
It showed how much it was going against me , because it arranged my affairs so backward that instead of me leaving my master -- which is what normally happens -- my master left and ran away from me . 
and What Happened to Him I had to get a fourth master , and this one turned out to be a friar of the Order of Mercy . 
The women I 've mentioned recommended me to him . 
They said he was a relative . 
He did n't think much of choir duties or eating in the monastery ; he was always running around on the outside ; and he was really devoted to secular business and visiting . 
In fact , he was so dedicated to this that I think he wore out more shoes than the whole monastery put together . 
He gave me the first pair of shoes I ever wore , but they did n't last me a week . 
And I would n't have lasted much longer myself trying to keep up with him . 
So because of this and some other little things that I do n't want to mention , I left him . 
Happened to Him Then As luck would have it , the fifth one I ran into was a seller of papal indulgences . 
He was arrogant , without principles , the biggest hawker of indulgences that I 've ever seen in my life or ever hope to see -- and probably the biggest one of all time . 
He had all sorts of ruses and underhanded tricks , and he was always thinking up new ones . 
When he 'd come to a place where he was going to sell these pardons , first he 'd give the priests and the other clergy some presents -- just little things that really were n't worth much : some lettuce from Murcia ; a couple limes or oranges if they were in season ; maybe a peach ; some pears -- the kind that stay green even after they 're ripe . 
That way he tried to win them over so they 'd look kindly on his business and call out their congregation to buy up the indulgences . 
When they thanked him , he 'd find out how well educated they were . 
If they said they understood Latin , he would n't speak a word of it so they could n't trip him up ; instead he 'd use some refined , polished-sounding words and flowery phrases . 
And if he saw that these clerics were `` appointed reverends '' -- I mean that they bought their way into the priesthood instead of by going through school - - he turned into a Saint Thomas , and for two hours he 'd speak Latin . 
Or , at least , something that sounded like Latin even if it was n't . 
When they would n't take his pardons willingly , he 'd try to find some underhanded way to get them to take them . 
To do that , he 'd sometimes make a nuisance of himself , and other times he 'd use his bag of tricks . 
It would take too long to talk about all the things I saw him do , so I 'll just tell about one that was really sly and clever , and I think that will show how good he was at it . 
In a place called Sagra , in the province of Toledo , he 'd been preaching for two or three days , trying his usual gimmicks , and not one person had bought an indulgence , and I could n't see that they had any intention of buying any . 
He swore up and down , and trying to think of what to do , he decided to call the town together the next morning so he could try to sell all the pardons . 
And that night , after supper , he and the constable began to gamble to see who would pay for the meal . 
They got to quarreling over the game , and there were heated words . 
He called the constable a thief , and the constable called him a swindler . 
At that point my master , the pardoner , picked up a spear that was lying against the door of the room where they were playing . 
The constable reached for his sword , that he kept at his side . 
The guests and neighbors came running at the noise and shouting we all began to make , and they got in between the two of them to break it up . 
Both men were really mad , and they tried to get away from the people who were holding them back so they could kill each other . 
But since those people had come swarming in at all the noise , the house was full of them , and when the two men saw that they could n't use their weapons they began to call each other names . 
And at one point the constable said my master was a swindler and that all the pardons he was selling were counterfeit . 
Finally , the townspeople saw that they could n't make them stop , so they decided to get the constable out of the inn and take him somewhere else . 
And that made my master even madder . 
But after the guests and neighbors pleaded with him to forget about it and go home to bed he left , and then so did everyone else . 
The next morning my master went to the church and told them to ring for mass so he could preach and sell the indulgences . 
And the townspeople came , muttering about the pardons , saying that they were forgeries and that the constable himself had let it out while they were quarreling . 
So , if they had n't wanted to take any pardons before , they were dead set against it now . 
The pardoner went up to the pulpit and began his sermon , trying to stir up the people , telling them that they should n't be without the blessings and the forgiveness that would come to them by buying the indulgences . 
When he was into the sermon in full swing , the constable came in the church door , and after praying he got up , and with a loud and steady voice he began to speak very solemnly : `` My fellow men , let me say a word ; afterward , you can listen to whoever you like . 
I came here with this swindler who 's preaching . 
But he tricked me : he said that if I helped him in his business , we 'd split the profits . 
And now , seeing how it would hurt my conscience and your pocketbooks , I 've repented of what I 've done . 
And I want to tell you openly that the indulgences he 's selling are forgeries . 
Do n't believe him and do n't buy them . 
I 'm not involved with them any longer -- either in an open or a hidden way -- and from now on I 'm giving up my staff , the symbol of my office , and I throw it on the ground so that you 'll see I mean it . 
And if sometime in the future this man is punished for his cheating , I want you to be my witnesses that I 'm not in with him and I 'm not helping him , but that I told you the truth -- that he 's a double-dealing liar . '' 
And he finished his speech . 
When he 'd started , some of the respectable men there wanted to get up and throw the constable out of church so there would n't be any scandal . 
But my master stopped them and told them all not to bother him under penalty of excommunication . 
He told them to let him say anything he wanted to . 
So while the constable was saying all that , my master kept quiet , too . 
When he stopped speaking , my master told him if he wanted to say anything more he should go ahead . 
And the constable said , `` I could say plenty more about you and your dirty tricks , but I 've said enough for now . '' 
Then the pardoner knelt down in the pulpit , and with his hands folded , and looking up toward heaven , he said : `` Lord God , to Whom nothing is hidden and everything is manifest , for Whom nothing is impossible and everything is possible , Thou knowest the truth of how unjustly I have been accused . 
In so far as I am concerned , I forgive him so that Thou , Oh Lord , may forgive me . 
Pay no attention to this man who knows not what he says or does . 
But the harm that has been done to Thee , I beg and beseech Thee in the name of righteousness that Thou wilt not disregard it . 
`` Because someone here may have been thinking of taking this holy indulgence , and now , believing that the false words of that man are true , they will not take it . 
And since that would be so harmful to our fellow men , I beg Thee , Lord , do not disregard it ; instead , grant us a miracle here . 
Let it happen in this way : if what that man says is true -- that I am full of malice and falseness -- let this pulpit collapse with me in it and plunge one hundred feet into the ground , where neither it nor I shall ever be seen again . 
But if what I say is true -- and he , won over by the devil to distrain and deprive those who are here present from such a great blessing -- if he is saying false things , let him be punished and let his malice be known to all . '' 
My reverent master had hardly finished his prayer when the crooked constable fell flat on his face , hitting the floor so hard that it made the whole church echo . 
Then he began to roar and froth at the mouth and to twist it and his whole face , too , kicking and hitting and rolling around all over the floor . 
The people 's shouts and cries were so loud that no one could hear anyone else . 
Some were really terrified . 
Other people were saying , `` God help him . '' 
And others said , `` He got what was coming to him . 
Anyone who lies like he did deserves it . '' 
Finally , some of the people there -LRB- even though I think they were really afraid -RRB- went up to him and grabbed hold of his arms , while he was swinging wildly at everyone around him . 
Other people grabbed his legs , and they really had to hold him tight because he was kicking harder than a mule . 
They held him down for quite a while . 
There were more than fifteen men on top of him , and he was still trying to hit them ; and if they were n't careful he would punch them in the nose . 
All the time that master of mine was on his knees up in the pulpit with his hands and eyes fixed on heaven , caught up by the Holy Spirit . 
And all the noise in the church -- the crying and shouting -- could n't bring him out of that mystical trance . 
Those good men went up to him , and by shouting they aroused him and begged him to help that poor man who was dying . 
They told him to forget about the things that had happened before and the other man 's awful words because he had been paid back for them . 
But if he could somehow do something that would take that man out of his misery and suffering , to do it -- for God 's sake -- because it was obvious that the other man was guilty and that the pardoner was innocent and had been telling the truth , since the Lord had shown His punishment right there when he 'd asked for revenge . 
The pardoner , as if waking from a sweet dream , looked at them and looked at the guilty man and all the people there , and very slowly he said to them : `` Good men , you do not need to pray for a man in whom God has given such a clear sign of Himself . 
But since He commands us not to return evil for evil and to forgive those who harm us , we may confidently ask Him to do what He commands us to do . 
We may ask His Majesty to forgive this man who offended Him by putting such an obstacle in the way of the holy faith . 
Let us all pray to Him . '' 
And so he got down from the pulpit and urged them to pray very devoutly to Our Lord , asking Him to forgive that sinner and bring back his health and sanity and to cast the devil out of him if , because of his great sins , His Majesty had permitted one to go in . 
They all got down on their knees in front of the altar , and with the clergy there they began to softly chant a litany . 
My master brought the cross and the holy water , and after he had chanted over him , he held his hands up to heaven and tilted his eyes upward so that the only thing you could see was a little of their whites . 
Then he began a prayer that was as long as it was pious . 
And it made all the people cry -LRB- just like the sermons at Holy Week , when the preacher and the audience are both fervent -RRB- . 
And he prayed to God , saying that it was not the Lord 's will to give that sinner death but to bring him back to life and make him repent . 
And since the man had been led astray by the devil but was now filled with the thought of death and his sins , he prayed to God to forgive him and give him back his life and his health so he could repent and confess his sins . 
And when this was finished , he told them to bring over the indulgence , and he put it on the man 's head . 
And right away that sinner of a constable got better , and little by little he began to come to . 
And when he was completely back in his senses , he threw himself down at the pardoner 's feet and asked his forgiveness . 
He confessed that the devil had commanded him to say what he did and had put the very words in his mouth . 
First , to hurt him and get revenge . 
Secondly -- and mainly -- because the devil himself would really be hurt by all the good that could be done here if the pardons were bought up . 
My master forgave him , and they shook hands . 
And there was such a rush to buy up the pardons that there was hardly a soul in the whole place that did n't get one : husbands and wives , sons and daughters , boys and girls . 
The news of what had happened spread around to the neighboring towns , and when we got to them , he did n't have to give a sermon or even go to the church . 
People came right up to the inn to get them as if they were going out of style . 
So in the ten or twelve places we went to around there , my master sold a good thousand indulgences in each place without even preaching a sermon . 
While the `` miracle '' was happening , I have to admit that I was astonished , too , and I got taken in just like the others . 
But when I saw the way my master and the constable laughed and joked about the business later , I realized that it had all been cooked up by my sharp and clever master . 
And even though I was only a boy , it really amused me , and I said to myself : I 'll bet these shysters do this all the time to innocent people . 
Well , to be brief , I stayed with my fifth master about four months , and I had some hard times with him , too . 
After this I took up with a man who painted tambourines . 
He wanted me to grind the colors for him , and I had my trials with him , too . 
By now I was pretty well grown up . 
And one day when I went into the cathedral , a chaplain there gave me a job . 
He put me in charge of a donkey , four jugs , and a whip , and I began to sell water around the city . 
This was the first step I took up the ladder to success : my dreams were finally coming true . 
On weekdays I gave my master sixty coppers out of what I earned , while I was able to keep everything I got above that . 
And on Saturdays I got to keep everything I made . 
I did so well at the job that after four years of it , watching my earnings very carefully , I saved enough to buy myself a good secondhand suit of clothes . 
I bought a jacket made out of old cotton , a frayed coat with braid on the sleeves and an open collar , a cape that had once been velvety , and an old sword -- one of the first ones ever made in Cuellar . 
When I saw how good I looked in my gentleman 's clothes , I told my master to take back his donkey : I was n't about to do that kind of work any more . 
Happened to Him After I left the chaplain I was taken on as bailiff by a constable . 
But I did n't stay with him very long : the job as too dangerous for me . 
That 's what I decided after some escaped criminals chased me and my master with clubs and rocks . 
My master stood there and faced them , and they beat him up , but they never did catch me . 
So I quit that job . 
And while I was trying to think of what sort of a life I could lead so that I could have a little peace and quiet and save up something for my old age , God lit up my path and put me on the road to success . 
With the help of some friends and other people , all the trials and troubles I 'd gone through up till then were finally compensated for , seeing as how I got what I wanted : a government job . 
And no one ever gets ahead without a job like that . 
And that 's what I 've been doing right up to now : I work in God 's service -- and yours , too . 
What I do is announce the wines that are being sold around the city . 
Then , too , I call out at auctions and whenever anything lost . 
And I go along with the people who are suffering for righteousness ' sake and call out their crimes : I 'm a town crier , to put it plainly . 
It 's been a good job , and I 've done so well at it that almost all of this sort of work comes to me . 
In fact , it 's gotten to the point where if someone in the city has wine or anything else to put up for sale , they know it wo n't come to anything unless Lazarillo of Tormes is in on it . 
About this time that gentleman , the Archpriest of San Salvador -LRB- your friend and servant -RRB- , began to notice my abilities and how I was making a good living . 
He knew who I was because I 'd been announcing his wines , and he said he wanted me to marry a maid of his . 
And I saw that only good , profitable things could come from a man like him , so I agreed to go along with it . 
So I married her , and I 've never regretted it . 
Because besides the fact that she 's a good woman and she 's hardworking and helpful , through my lord , the archpriest , I have all the help and favors I need . 
During the year he always gives her a few good - sized sacks of wheat , meat on the holidays , a couple loaves of bread sometimes , and his socks after he 's through with them . 
He had us rent a little house right next to his , and on Sundays and almost every holiday we eat at his place . 
But there have always been scandalmongers , and I guess there always will be , and they wo n't leave us in peace . 
They talk about I do n't know what all -- they say that they 've seen my wife go and make up his bed and do his cooking for him . 
And God bless them , but they 're a bunch of liars . 
Because , besides the fact that she 's the kind of woman who 's hardly happy about these gibes , my master made me a promise , and I think he 'll keep it . 
One day he talked to me for a long time in front of her , and he said to me : `` Lazaro of Tormes , anyone who pays attention to what gossips say will never get ahead . 
I 'm telling you this because I would n't be at all surprised if someone did see your wife going in and out of my house . 
In fact , the reason she goes in is very much to your honor and to hers : and that 's the truth . 
So forget what people say . 
Just think of how it concerns you -- I mean , how it benefits you . '' 
`` Sir , '' I said , `` I 've decided to be on the side of good men . 
It is true that some of my friends have told me something of that . 
The truth is , they 've sworn for a fact that my wife had three children before she married me , speaking with reverence to your grace since she 's here with us . '' 
Then my wife began to scream and carry on so much that I thought the house with us in it was going to fall in . 
Then she took to crying , and she cursed the man who had married us . 
It got so bad that I 'd rather I 'd died than have let those words of mine slip out . 
But with me on one side and my master on the other , we talked to her and begged her so much that she finally quit her crying . 
And I swore to her that as long as I lived I 'd never mention another word about the business . 
And I told her I thought it was perfectly all right -- in fact , that it made me happy -- for her to go in and out of his house both day and night because I was so sure of her virtue . 
And so we were all three in complete agreement . 
So , right up to today we 've never said another word about the affair . 
In fact , when I see that someone wants to even start talking about it , I cut him short , and I tell him : `` Look , if you 're my friend , do n't tell me something that will make me mad because anyone who does that is n't my friend at all . 
Especially if they 're trying to cause trouble between me and my wife . 
There 's nothing and nobody in the world that I love more than her . 
And because of her , God gives me all sorts of favors -- many more than I deserve . 
So I 'll swear to God that she 's as good a woman as any here in Toledo , and if anyone tells me otherwise , I 'm his enemy until I die . '' 
So no one ever says anything to me , and I keep peace in my house . 
That was the same year that our victorious emperor came to this illustrious city of Toledo and held his court here , and there were all sorts of celebrations and festivities , as you must have heard . 
Well , at this time I was prosperous and at the height of all good fortune . 
END OF PART ONE -LRB- The following is the first chapter of an anonymous sequel to Lazarillo of Tormes , published in 1555 . 
This chapter became attached to the original work in later editions , but is not to be considered part of the first Lazarillo . 
It is presented here because it serves as a bridge between the first Lazarillo of Tormes and the second part by Juan de Luna -- R.S.R. -RRB- Toledo with Some Germans and What Happened to Them At this time I was prosperous and at the height of all good fortune . 
And because I always carried a good-sized pan full of some of the good fruit that is raised in this land as a sign of what I was announcing , I gathered so many friends and benefactors around me , both natives and foreigners , that wherever I went no door was closed to me . 
The people were so kind to me that I believe if I had killed a man then , or had found myself in difficult straits , everyone would have come to my side , and those benefactors would have given me every sort of aid and assistance . 
But I never left them with their mouths dry because I took them to the places where they could find the best of what I spread throughout the city . 
And there we lived the good life and had fine times together : we would often walk into a place on our own two feet and go out on the feet of other people . 
And the best part of it was that all this time Lazaro of Tormes did n't spend a damned cent , and his friends would n't let him spend anything . 
If I ever started to open my purse , pretending that I wanted to pay , they were offended , and they would look at me angrily and say , `` Nite , nite , Asticot , lanz . '' 
They were scolding me , saying that when they were there no one would have to pay a cent . 
I was , frankly , in love with those people . 
And not only because of that , but because whenever we got together they were always filling my pockets and my shirt full of ham and legs of mutton -- cooked in those good wines -- along with many spices and huge amounts of beef and bread . 
So in my house my wife and I always had enough for an entire week . 
With all this , I remembered the past times when I was hungry , and I praised God and gave thanks that things and times like those pass away . 
But , as the saying goes , all good things must come to an end . 
And that 's how this turned out . 
Because they moved the great court , as they do now and then , and when they were leaving , those good friends of mine urged me to go with them , and they said they would give me their help . 
But I remembered the proverb : Better certain evil than doubtful good . 
So I thanked my friends for their good wishes , and with a great deal of clapping on the shoulders and sadness , I said goodbye to them . 
And I know that if I had n't been married I would never have left their company because they were the salt of the earth and the kind of people that were really to my liking . 
The life they lead is a pleasant one . 
They are n't conceited or presumptuous ; they have no hesitation or dislike for going into any wine cellar , with their hats off if the wine deserves it . 
They are simple , honest people , and they always have so much that I hope God gives me no less when I 'm really thirsty . 
But the love I had for my wife and my land -LRB- `` The land you are born in , . . . '' 
as they say -RRB- held me back . 
So I stayed in this city , and although I was well known by the people who lived here , I missed the pleasure of my friends and the court . 
Still , I was happy , and even happier when my family line was extended by the birth of a beautiful little girl that my wife had then . 
And although I was a little suspicious , she swore to me that the child was mine . 
But then fortune thought it had forgotten me long enough , and it decided to show me its cruel , angry , harsh face once more and disturb these few years of good , peaceful living by bringing others of affliction and bitterness . 
Oh , almighty God ! 
Who could write about such a terrible misfortune and such a disastrous fall without letting the inkwell rest and wiping his eyes with the quill ? 
of Algiers `` A prosperous man who acts unwisely should not be angry when misfortune comes . '' 
I 'm writing this epigram for a reason : I never had the mentality or the ability to keep myself in a good position when fortune had put me there . 
Change was a fundamental part of my life that remained with me both in good , prosperous times and in bad , disastrous ones . 
As it was , I was living as good a life as any patriarch ever had , eating more than a friar who has been invited out to dinner , drinking more than a thirsty quack doctor , better dressed than a priest , and in my pocket were two dozen pieces of silver -- more reliable than a beggar in Madrid . 
My house was as well stocked as a beehive filled with honey , my daughter was born with the odor of saintliness about her , and I had a job that even a pew opener in the church at Toledo would have envied . 
Then I heard about the fleet making ready to sail for Algiers . 
The news intrigued me , and like a good son I decided to follow in the footsteps of my good father Tome Gonzalez -LRB- may he rest in peace -RRB- . 
I wanted to be an example -- a model -- for posterity . 
I did n't want to be remembered for leading that crafty blind man , or for nibbling on the bread of the stingy priest , or for serving that penniless squire , or even for calling out other people 's crimes . 
The kind of example I wanted to be was one who would show those blind Moors the error of their ways , tear open and sink those arrogant pirate ships , serve under a valiant captain who belonged to the Order of Saint John -LRB- and I did enlist with a man like that as his valet , with the condition that everything I took from the Moors I would be able to keep , and it turned out that way -RRB- . 
Finally , what I wanted to do was to be a model for shouting at and rousing the troops with our war cry : `` Saint James be with us ... . 
Attack , Spaniards ! '' 
I said good-by to my adoring wife and my dear daughter . 
My daughter begged me not to forget to bring her back a nice Moorish boy , and my wife told me to be sure to send , by the first messenger , a slave girl to wait on her and some Barbary gold to console her while I was gone . 
I asked my lord the archpriest 's permission , and I put my wife and daughter in his charge so he would take care of them and provide for them . 
He promised me he would treat them as his very own . 
I left Toledo happy , proud , and content , full of high hopes -- the way men are when they go to war . 
With me were a great number of friends and neighbors who were going on the same expedition , hoping to better their fortunes . 
We arrived at Murcia with the intention of going to Cartagena to embark . 
And there something happened me that I had no desire for . 
I saw that fortune had put me at the top of its whimsical wheel and with its usual swiftness had pushed me to the heights of worldly prosperity , and now it was beginning to throw me down to the very bottom . 
It happened that when I went to an inn , I saw a half-man who , with all the loose and knotted threads hanging from his clothes , had more the appearance of an old goat than a man . 
His hat was pulled down so far you could n't see his face , his cheek was resting on his hand , and one leg was lying on his sword , which was in a half scabbard made of strips of cloth . 
He had his hat cocked jauntily over one ear -LRB- there was no crown on it , so all the hot air coming out of his head could evaporate -RRB- . 
His jacket was cut in the French style -- so slashed there was n't a piece big enough to wrap a mustard seed in . 
His shirt was skin : you could see it through the lattice work of his clothes . 
His pants were the same material . 
As for his stockings , one was green and the other red , and they barely covered his ankles . 
His shoes were in the barefoot style : worn both up and down . 
By a feather sewn in his hat , the way soldiers dressed , I suspected that he was , in fact , a soldier . 
With this thought in mind , I asked him where he was from and where he was going . 
He raised his eyes to see who was asking , and we both recognized each other : it was the squire I had served under at Toledo . 
I was astonished to see him in that suit . 
When the squire saw my look of amazement , he said : `` I 'm not surprised to see how startled you are to see me this way , but you wo n't be when I tell you what happened to me from that day I left you in Toledo until today . 
As I was going back to the house with the change from the doubloon to pay my creditors , I came across a veiled woman who pulled at my cloak and , sighing and sobbing , pleaded with me to help her out of the plight she was in . 
I begged her to tell me her troubles , saying that it would take her longer to tell them than for me to take care of them . 
Still crying , and with a maidenly blush , she told me that the favor I could do for her -LRB- and she prayed that I would do it -RRB- was to go with her to Madrid where , according to what people had told her , the man was staying who had not only dishonored her but had taken all her jewelry without fulfilling his promise to marry her . 
She said that if I would do this for her , she would do for me what a grateful woman should . 
I consoled her as best I could , raising her hopes by telling her that if her enemy were to be found anywhere in this world , she would be avenged . 
`` Well , to make a long story short , we went straight to the capital , and I paid her expenses all the way . 
The lady knew exactly where she was going , and she led me to a regiment of soldiers who gave her an enthusiastic welcome and took her to the captain , and there she signed up as a ` nurse ' for the men . 
Then she turned to me , and with a brazen look said , ` All right , fathead . 
Now push off ! ' 
When I saw that she had tricked me , I flew into a rage , and I told her that if she were a man instead of a woman I would tear her heart out by the roots . 
One of the soldiers standing there came up and thumbed his nose at me , but he did n't dare to strike me because if he had they would have had to bury him on the spot . 
` When I saw how badly that business was turning out , I left without saying another word , but I walked out a little faster than usual to see if any brawny soldier was going to follow me so that I could kill him . 
Because if I had fought that first little soldier boy and killed him -LRB- which I would have done , without any doubt -RRB- , what honor or glory would there have been in it for me ? 
But if the captain or some bully had come out , I would have sliced more holes in them than there are grains of sand in the sea . 
When I saw that none of them dared to follow me , I left , very pleased with myself . 
I looked around for work , and since I could n't find any good enough for a man of my station , here I am like this . 
It is true that I could have been a valet or an escort to five or six seamstresses , but I would starve to death before I 'd take a job like that . '' 
My good master finished by telling me that , since he had n't been able to find any merchants from his home town to lend him money , he was penniless , and he did n't know where he was going to spend the night . 
I caught his hint and offered to let him share my bed and my supper . 
He called my hand . 
When we were ready to go to sleep , I told him to take his clothes off the bed because it was too small for so many varmints . 
The next morning , wanting to get up without making any noise , I reached for my clothes -- in vain . 
The traitor had taken them and vanished . 
I lay in bed , thinking I was going to die from pure misery . 
And it might have been better if I had died because I could have avoided all those times I was in agony later . 
I started shouting , `` Thief ! 
Thief ! '' 
The people in the house came up and found me naked as a jaybird , looking in every corner of the room for something to cover myself with . 
They all laughed like fools , while I was swearing like a mule driver . 
I damned to hell that thieving bragger who had kept me up half the night telling about all the splendor of himself and his ancestors . 
The remedy that I took -LRB- since no one was giving me any -RRB- was to see if I could use that hot-air merchant 's clothes until God furnished me with some others . 
But they were a labyrinth , with no beginning or end to them . 
There was no difference between the pants and the jacket . 
I put my legs in the sleeves and used the pants as a coat , and I did n't forget the stockings : they looked more like a court clerk 's sleeves -- loose enough to put his bribes in . 
The shoes were like fetters around my ankles : they did n't have any soles . 
I pulled the hat down over my head , putting the bottom side up so it would n't be so grimy . 
I wo n't say a word about the insects running all over me -- either the crawling infantry or the galloping cavalry . 
In this shape I went to see my master , since he had sent for me . 
He was astonished to see the scarecrow that walked in , and he laughed so hard his rear tether let loose , and -- royal flush . 
Out of respect for him , I think we should pass over that in silence . 
After a thousand unsuccessful attempts to talk , he asked me why I was wearing a disguise . 
I told him , and the result was that instead of pitying me , he swore at me and threw me out of his house . 
He said that just as I had let that man come in and sleep in my bed , one day I would let someone else in , and they would rob him . 
By nature I did n't last very long with my masters . 
And it was that way with this one , too , although I was n't to blame . 
So there I was , miserable , all alone , and in despair ; and with the clothes I was wearing everyone scoffed and made fun of me . 
Some people said to me , `` That 's not a bad little hat you have , with its back door . 
It looks like an old Dutch lady 's bonnet . '' 
Others said , `` Your rags are certainly stylish . 
They look like a pigsty : so many other fat little ones are in there with you that you could kill and salt them and send them home to your wife . '' 
One of the soldiers -- a packhandler -- said to me , `` Mr. Lazarillo , I 'll swear to God your stockings really show off your legs . 
And your sandals look like the kind the barefoot friars wear . '' 
A constable replied , ` That 's because this gentleman is going to preach to the Moors . '' 
They kept teasing and taunting me so much that I was nearly ready to go back home . 
But I did n't because I thought it would be a poor war if I could n't get more than I would lose . 
What hurt me most was that everyone avoided me like the plague . 
We embarked at Cartagena : the ship was large and well stocked . 
They unfurled the sails , and a wind caught them and sent the ship skimming along at a good clip . 
The land disappeared from sight , and a cross wind lashed the sea and sent waves hurling up to the clouds . 
As the storm increased , we began losing hope ; the captain and crew gave us up for lost . 
Everyone was weeping and wailing so much I thought we were at a sermon during Holy Week . 
With all the clamor no one could hear any of the orders that were given . 
Some people were running to one place , others to another : it was as noisy and chaotic as a blacksmith 's shop . 
Everyone was saying confession to whoever they could . 
There was even one man who confessed to a prostitute , and she absolved him so well you would have thought she had been doing it for a hundred years . 
Churning water makes good fishing , they say . 
So when I saw how busy everyone was , I said to myself : If I die , let it be with my belly full . 
I wandered down to the bottom of the ship , and there I found huge quantities of bread , wine , meat pies , and preserves , with no one paying any attention to them . 
I began to eat everything and to fill my stomach so it would be stocked up to last me till judgment day . 
A soldier came up and asked me to give him confession .
