Grushnitski 's passion was declamation . 
He would deluge you with words so soon as the conversation went beyond the sphere of ordinary ideas . 
I have never been able to dispute with him . 
He neither answers your questions nor listens to you . 
So soon as you stop , he begins a lengthy tirade , which has the appearance of being in some sort connected with what you have been saying , but which is , in fact , only a continuation of his own harangue . 
He is witty enough ; his epigrams are frequently amusing , but never malicious , nor to the point . 
He slays nobody with a single word ; he has no knowledge of men and of their foibles , because all his life he has been interested in nobody but himself . 
His aim is to make himself the hero of a novel . 
He has so often endeavoured to convince others that he is a being created not for this world and doomed to certain mysterious sufferings , that he has almost convinced himself that such he is in reality . 
Hence the pride with which he wears his thick soldier 's cloak . 
I have seen through him , and he dislikes me for that reason , although to outward appearance we are on the friendliest of terms . 
Grushnitski is looked upon as a man of distinguished courage . 
I have seen him in action . 
He waves his sabre , shouts , and hurls himself forward with his eyes shut . 
That is not what I should call Russian courage ! 
... I reciprocate Grushnitski 's dislike . 
I feel that some time or other we shall come into collision upon a narrow road , and that one of us will fare badly . 
His arrival in the Caucasus is also the result of his romantic fanaticism . 
I am convinced that on the eve of his departure from his paternal village he said with an air of gloom to some pretty neighbour that he was going away , not so much for the simple purpose of serving in the army as of seeking death , because ... and hereupon , I am sure , he covered his eyes with his hand and continued thus , `` No , you -- or thou -- must not know ! 
Your pure soul would shudder ! 
And what would be the good ? 
What am I to you ? 
Could you understand me ? '' 
... and so on . 
He has himself told me that the motive which induced him to enter the K -- regiment must remain an everlasting secret between him and Heaven . 
However , in moments when he casts aside the tragic mantle , Grushnitski is charming and entertaining enough . 
I am always interested to see him with women -- it is then that he puts forth his finest efforts , I think ! 
We met like a couple of old friends . 
I began to question him about the personages of note and as to the sort of life which was led at the waters . 
`` It is a rather prosaic life , '' he said , with a sigh . 
`` Those who drink the waters in the morning are inert -- like all invalids , and those who drink the wines in the evening are unendurable -- like all healthy people ! 
There are ladies who entertain , but there is no great amusement to be obtained from them . 
They play whist , they dress badly and speak French dreadfully ! 
The only Moscow people here this year are Princess Ligovski and her daughter -- but I am not acquainted with them . 
My soldier 's cloak is like a seal of renunciation . 
The sympathy which it arouses is as painful as charity . '' 
At that moment two ladies walked past us in the direction of the well ; one elderly , the other youthful and slender . 
I could not obtain a good view of their faces on account of their hats , but they were dressed in accordance with the strict rules of the best taste -- nothing superfluous . 
The second lady was wearing a high-necked dress of pearl-grey , and a light silk kerchief was wound round her supple neck . 
Puce-coloured boots clasped her slim little ankle so charmingly , that even those uninitiated into the mysteries of beauty would infallibly have sighed , if only from wonder . 
There was something maidenly in her easy , but aristocratic gait , something eluding definition yet intelligible to the glance . 
As she walked past us an indefinable perfume , like that which sometimes breathes from the note of a charming woman , was wafted from her . 
`` Look ! '' 
said Grushnitski , `` there is Princess Ligovski with her daughter Mary , as she calls her after the English manner . 
They have been here only three days . '' 
`` You already know her name , though ? '' 
`` Yes , I heard it by chance , '' he answered , with a blush . 
`` I confess I do not desire to make their acquaintance . 
These haughty aristocrats look upon us army men just as they would upon savages . 
What care they if there is an intellect beneath a numbered forage-cap , and a heart beneath a thick cloak ? '' 
`` Poor cloak ! '' 
I said , with a laugh . 
`` But who is the gentleman who is just going up to them and handing them a tumbler so officiously ? '' 
`` Oh , that is Raevich , the Moscow dandy . 
He is a gambler ; you can see as much at once from that immense gold chain coiling across his skyblue waistcoat . 
And what a thick cane he has ! 
Just like Robinson Crusoe 's -- and so is his beard too , and his hair is done like a peasant 's . '' 
`` You are embittered against the whole human race ? '' 
`` And I have cause to be '' ... `` Oh , really ? '' 
At that moment the ladies left the well and came up to where we were . 
Grushnitski succeeded in assuming a dramatic pose with the aid of his crutch , and in a loud tone of voice answered me in French : `` Mon cher , je hais les hommes pour ne pas les mepriser , car autrement la vie serait une farce trop degoutante . '' 
The pretty Princess Mary turned round and favoured the orator with a long and curious glance . 
Her expression was quite indefinite , but it was not contemptuous , a fact on which I inwardly congratulated Grushnitski from my heart . 
`` She is an extremely pretty girl , '' I said . 
`` She has such velvet eyes -- yes , velvet is the word . 
I should advise you to appropriate the expression when speaking of her eyes . 
The lower and upper lashes are so long that the sunbeams are not reflected in her pupils . 
I love those eyes without a glitter , they are so soft that they appear to caress you . 
However , her eyes seem to be her only good feature ... Tell me , are her teeth white ? 
That is most important ! 
It is a pity that she did not smile at that high-sounding phrase of yours . '' 
`` You are speaking of a pretty woman just as you might of an English horse , '' said Grushnitski indignantly . 
`` Mon cher , '' I answered , trying to mimic his tone , `` je meprise les femmes , pour ne pas les aimer , car autrement la vie serait un melodrame trop ridicule . '' 
I turned and left him . 
For half an hour or so I walked about the avenues of the vines , the limestone cliffs and the bushes hanging between them . 
The day grew hot , and I hurried homewards . 
Passing the sulphur spring , I stopped at the covered gallery in order to regain my breath under its shade , and by so doing I was afforded the opportunity of witnessing a rather interesting scene . 
This is the position in which the dramatis personae were disposed : Princess Ligovski and the Moscow dandy were sitting on a bench in the covered gallery -- apparently engaged in serious conversation . 
Princess Mary , who had doubtless by this time finished her last tumbler , was walking pensively to and fro by the well . 
Grushnitski was standing by the well itself ; there was nobody else on the square . 
I went up closer and concealed myself behind a corner of the gallery . 
At that moment Grushnitski let his tumbler fall on the sand and made strenuous efforts to stoop in order to pick it up ; but his injured foot prevented him . 
Poor fellow ! 
How he tried all kinds of artifices , as he leaned on his crutch , and all in vain ! 
His expressive countenance was , in fact , a picture of suffering . 
Princess Mary saw the whole scene better than I. Lighter than a bird she sprang towards him , stooped , picked up the tumbler , and handed it to him with a gesture full of ineffable charm . 
Then she blushed furiously , glanced round at the gallery , and , having assured herself that her mother apparently had not seen anything , immediately regained her composure . 
By the time Grushnitski had opened his mouth to thank her she was a long way off . 
A moment after , she came out of the gallery with her mother and the dandy , but , in passing by Grushnitski , she assumed a most decorous and serious air . 
She did not even turn round , she did not even observe the passionate gaze which he kept fixed upon her for a long time until she had descended the mountain and was hidden behind the lime trees of the boulevard ... Presently I caught glimpses of her hat as she walked along the street . 
She hurried through the gate of one of the best houses in Pyatigorsk ; her mother walked behind her and bowed adieu to Raevich at the gate . 
It was only then that the poor , passionate cadet noticed my presence . 
`` Did you see ? '' 
he said , pressing my hand vigorously . 
`` She is an angel , simply an angel ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
I inquired , with an air of the purest simplicity . 
`` Did you not see , then ? '' 
`` No . 
I saw her picking up your tumbler . 
If there had been an attendant there he would have done the same thing -- and quicker too , in the hope of receiving a tip . 
It is quite easy , however , to understand that she pitied you ; you made such a terrible grimace when you walked on the wounded foot . '' 
`` And can it be that seeing her , as you did , at that moment when her soul was shining in her eyes , you were not in the least affected ? '' 
`` No . '' 
I was lying , but I wanted to exasperate him . 
I have an innate passion for contradiction -- my whole life has been nothing but a series of melancholy and vain contradictions of heart or reason . 
The presence of an enthusiast chills me with a twelfth-night cold , and I believe that constant association with a person of a flaccid and phlegmatic temperament would have turned me into an impassioned visionary . 
I confess , too , that an unpleasant but familiar sensation was coursing lightly through my heart at that moment . 
It was -- envy . 
I say `` envy '' boldly , because I am accustomed to acknowledge everything to myself . 
It would be hard to find a young man who , if his idle fancy had been attracted by a pretty woman and he had suddenly found her openly singling out before his eyes another man equally unknown to her -- it would be hard , I say , to find such a young man -LRB- living , of course , in the great world and accustomed to indulge his self-love -RRB- who would not have been unpleasantly taken aback in such a case . 
In silence Grushnitski and I descended the mountain and walked along the boulevard , past the windows of the house where our beauty had hidden herself . 
She was sitting by the window . 
Grushnitski , plucking me by the arm , cast upon her one of those gloomily tender glances which have so little effect upon women . 
I directed my lorgnette at her , and observed that she smiled at his glance and that my insolent lorgnette made her downright angry . 
And how , indeed , should a Caucasian military man presume to direct his eyeglass at a princess from Moscow ? 
... THIS morning the doctor came to see me . 
His name is Werner , but he is a Russian . 
What is there surprising in that ? 
I have known a man named Ivanov , who was a German . 
Werner is a remarkable man , and that for many reasons . 
Like almost all medical men he is a sceptic and a materialist , but , at the same time , he is a genuine poet -- a poet always in deeds and often in words , although he has never written two verses in his life . 
He has mastered all the living chords of the human heart , just as one learns the veins of a corpse , but he has never known how to avail himself of his knowledge . 
In like manner , it sometimes happens that an excellent anatomist does not know how to cure a fever . 
Werner usually made fun of his patients in private ; but once I saw him weeping over a dying soldier ... He was poor , and dreamed of millions , but he would not take a single step out of his way for the sake of money . 
He once told me that he would rather do a favour to an enemy than to a friend , because , in the latter case , it would mean selling his beneficence , whilst hatred only increases proportionately to the magnanimity of the adversary . 
He had a malicious tongue ; and more than one good , simple soul has acquired the reputation of a vulgar fool through being labelled with one of his epigrams . 
His rivals , envious medical men of the watering-place , spread the report that he was in the habit of drawing caricatures of his patients . 
The patients were incensed , and almost all of them discarded him . 
His friends , that is to say all the genuinely well-bred people who were serving in the Caucasus , vainly endeavoured to restore his fallen credit . 
His outward appearance was of the type which , at the first glance , creates an unpleasant impression , but which you get to like in course of time , when the eye learns to read in the irregular features the stamp of a tried and lofty soul . 
Instances have been known of women falling madly in love with men of that sort , and having no desire to exchange their ugliness for the beauty of the freshest and rosiest of Endymions . 
We must give women their due : they possess an instinct for spiritual beauty , for which reason , possibly , men such as Werner love women so passionately . 
Werner was small and lean and as weak as a baby . 
One of his legs was shorter than the other , as was the case with Byron . 
In comparison with his body , his head seemed enormous . 
His hair was cropped close , and the unevennesses of his cranium , thus laid bare , would have struck a phrenologist by reason of the strange intertexture of contradictory propensities . 
His little , ever restless , black eyes seemed as if they were endeavouring to fathom your thoughts . 
Taste and neatness were to be observed in his dress . 
His small , lean , sinewy hands flaunted themselves in bright-yellow gloves . 
His frock-coat , cravat and waistcoat were invariably of black . 
The young men dubbed him Mephistopheles ; he pretended to be angry at the nickname , but in reality it flattered his vanity . 
Werner and I soon understood each other and became friends , because I , for my part , am illadapted for friendship . 
Of two friends , one is always the slave of the other , although frequently neither acknowledges the fact to himself . 
Now , the slave I could not be ; and to be the master would be a wearisome trouble , because , at the same time , deception would be required . 
Besides , I have servants and money ! 
Our friendship originated in the following circumstances . 
I met Werner at S -- , in the midst of a numerous and noisy circle of young people . 
Towards the end of the evening the conversation took a philosophico-metaphysical turn . 
We discussed the subject of convictions , and each of us had some different conviction to declare . 
`` So far as I am concerned , '' said the doctor , `` I am convinced of one thing only '' ... `` And that is -- ? '' 
I asked , desirous of learning the opinion of a man who had been silent till then . 
`` Of the fact , '' he answered , `` that sooner or later , one fine morning , I shall die . '' 
`` I am better off than you , '' I said . 
`` In addition to that , I have a further conviction , namely , that , one very nasty evening , I had the misfortune to be born . '' 
All the others considered that we were talking nonsense , but indeed not one of them said anything more sensible . 
From that moment we singled each other out amongst the crowd . 
We used frequently to meet and discuss abstract subjects in a very serious manner , until each observed that the other was throwing dust in his eyes . 
Then , looking significantly at each other -- as , according to Cicero , the Roman augurs used to do -- we would burst out laughing heartily and , having had our laugh , we would separate , well content with our evening . 
I was lying on a couch , my eyes fixed upon the ceiling and my hands clasped behind my head , when Werner entered my room . 
He sat down in an easy chair , placed his cane in a corner , yawned , and announced that it was getting hot out of doors . 
I replied that the flies were bothering me -- and we both fell silent . 
`` Observe , my dear doctor , '' I said , `` that , but for fools , the world would be a very dull place . 
Look ! 
Here are you and I , both sensible men ! 
We know beforehand that it is possible to dispute ad infinitum about everything -- and so we do not dispute . 
Each of us knows almost all the other 's secret thoughts : to us a single word is a whole history ; we see the grain of every one of our feelings through a threefold husk . 
What is sad , we laugh at ; what is laughable , we grieve at ; but , to tell the truth , we are fairly indifferent , generally speaking , to everything except ourselves . 
Consequently , there can be no interchange of feelings and thoughts between us ; each of us knows all he cares to know about the other , and that knowledge is all he wants . 
One expedient remains -- to tell the news . 
So tell me some news . '' 
Fatigued by this lengthy speech , I closed my eyes and yawned . 
The doctor answered after thinking awhile : `` There is an idea , all the same , in that nonsense of yours . '' 
`` Two , '' I replied . 
`` Tell me one , and I will tell you the other . '' 
`` Very well , begin ! '' 
I said , continuing to examine the ceiling and smiling inwardly . 
`` You are anxious for information about some of the new-comers here , and I can guess who it is , because they , for their part , have already been inquiring about you . '' 
`` Doctor ! 
Decidedly it is impossible for us to hold a conversation ! 
We read into each other 's soul . '' 
`` Now the other idea ? '' 
... `` Here it is : I wanted to make you relate something , for the following reasons : firstly , listening is less fatiguing than talking ; secondly , the listener can not commit himself ; thirdly , he can learn another 's secret ; fourthly , sensible people , such as you , prefer listeners to speakers . 
Now to business ; what did Princess Ligovski tell you about me ? '' 
`` You are quite sure that it was Princess Ligovski ... and not Princess Mary ? '' 
... `` Quite sure . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because Princess Mary inquired about Grushnitski . '' 
`` You are gifted with a fine imagination ! 
Princess Mary said that she was convinced that the young man in the soldier 's cloak had been reduced to the ranks on account of a duel '' ... `` I hope you left her cherishing that pleasant delusion '' ... `` Of course '' ... `` A plot ! '' 
I exclaimed in rapture . 
`` We will make it our business to see to the denouement of this little comedy . 
It is obvious that fate is taking care that I shall not be bored ! '' 
`` I have a presentiment , '' said the doctor , `` that poor Grushnitski will be your victim . '' 
`` Proceed , doctor . '' 
`` Princess Ligovski said that your face was familiar to her . 
I observed that she had probably met you in Petersburg -- somewhere in society ... I told her your name . 
She knew it well . 
It appears that your history created a great stir there ... She began to tell us of your adventures , most likely supplementing the gossip of society with observations of her own ... Her daughter listened with curiosity . 
In her imagination you have become the hero of a novel in a new style ... I did not contradict Princess Ligovski , although I knew that she was talking nonsense . '' 
`` Worthy friend ! '' 
I said , extending my hand to him . 
The doctor pressed it feelingly and continued : `` If you like I will present you '' ... `` Good heavens ! '' 
I said , clapping my hands . 
`` Are heroes ever presented ? 
In no other way do they make the acquaintance of their beloved than by saving her from certain death ! '' 
... `` And you really wish to court Princess Mary ? '' 
`` Not at all , far from it ! 
... Doctor , I triumph at last ! 
You do not understand me ! 
... It vexes me , however , '' I continued after a moment 's silence . 
`` I never reveal my secrets myself , but I am exceedingly fond of their being guessed , because in that way I can always disavow them upon occasion . 
However , you must describe both mother and daughter to me . 
What sort of people are they ? '' 
`` In the first place , Princess Ligovski is a woman of forty-five , '' answered Werner . 
`` She has a splendid digestion , but her blood is out of order -- there are red spots on her cheeks . 
She has spent the latter half of her life in Moscow , and has grown stout from leading an inactive life there . 
She loves spicy stories , and sometimes says improper things herself when her daughter is out of the room . 
She has declared to me that her daughter is as innocent as a dove . 
What does that matter to me ? 
... I was going to answer that she might be at her ease , because I would never tell anyone . 
Princess Ligovski is taking the cure for her rheumatism , and the daughter , for goodness knows what . 
I have ordered each of them to drink two tumblers a day of sulphurous water , and to bathe twice a week in the diluted bath . 
Princess Ligovski is apparently unaccustomed to giving orders . 
She cherishes respect for the intelligence and attainments of her daughter , who has read Byron in English and knows algebra : in Moscow , evidently , the ladies have entered upon the paths of erudition -- and a good thing , too ! 
The men here are generally so unamiable , that , for a clever woman , it must be intolerable to flirt with them . 
Princess Ligovski is very fond of young people ; Princess Mary looks on them with a certain contempt -- a Moscow habit ! 
In Moscow they cherish only wits of not less than forty . '' 
`` You have been in Moscow , doctor ? '' 
`` Yes , I had a practice there . '' 
`` Continue . '' 
`` But I think I have told everything ... No , there is something else : Princess Mary , it seems , loves to discuss emotions , passions , etcetera . 
She was in Petersburg for one winter , and disliked it -- especially the society : no doubt she was coldly received . '' 
`` You have not seen anyone with them today ? '' 
`` On the contrary , there was an aide-de-camp , a stiff guardsman , and a lady -- one of the latest arrivals , a relation of Princess Ligovski on the husband 's side -- very pretty , but apparently very ill ... Have you not met her at the well ? 
She is of medium height , fair , with regular features ; she has the complexion of a consumptive , and there is a little black mole on her right cheek . 
I was struck by the expressiveness of her face . '' 
`` A mole ! '' 
I muttered through my teeth . 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
The doctor looked at me , and , laying his hand on my heart , said triumphantly : `` You know her ! '' 
My heart was , in fact , beating more violently than usual . 
`` It is your turn , now , to triumph , '' I said . 
`` But I rely on you : you will not betray me . 
I have not seen her yet , but I am convinced that I recognise from your portrait a woman whom I loved in the old days ... Do not speak a word to her about me ; if she asks any questions , give a bad report of me . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
said Werner , shrugging his shoulders . 
When he had departed , my heart was compressed with terrible grief . 
Has destiny brought us together again in the Caucasus , or has she come hither on purpose , knowing that she would meet me ? 
... And how shall we meet ? 
... And then , is it she ? 
... My presentiments have never deceived me . 
There is not a man in the world over whom the past has acquired such a power as over me . 
Every recollection of bygone grief or joy strikes my soul with morbid effect , and draws forth ever the same sounds ... I am stupidly constituted : I forget nothing -- nothing ! 
After dinner , about six o'clock , I went on to the boulevard . 
It was crowded . 
The two princesses were sitting on a bench , surrounded by young men , who were vying with each other in paying them attention . 
I took up my position on another bench at a little distance off , stopped two Dragoon officers whom I knew , and proceeded to tell them something . 
Evidently it was amusing , because they began to laugh loudly like a couple of madmen . 
Some of those who were surrounding Princess Mary were attracted to my side by curiosity , and gradually all of them left her and joined my circle . 
I did not stop talking ; my anecdotes were clever to the point of absurdity , my jests at the expense of the queer people passing by , malicious to the point of frenzy . 
I continued to entertain the public till sunset . 
Princess Mary passed by me a few times , arm-in-arm with her mother , and accompanied by a certain lame old man . 
A few times her glance as it fell upon me expressed vexation , while endeavouring to express indifference ... `` What has he been telling you ? '' 
she inquired of one of the young men , who had gone back to her out of politeness . 
`` No doubt a most interesting story -- his own exploits in battle ? '' 
... This was said rather loudly , and probably with the intention of stinging me . 
`` Aha ! '' 
I thought to myself . 
`` You are downright angry , my dear Princess . 
Wait awhile , there is more to follow . '' 
Grushnitski kept following her like a beast of prey , and would not let her out of his sight . 
I wager that to-morrow he will ask somebody to present him to Princess Ligovski . 
She will be glad , because she is bored . 
IN the course of two days my affairs have gained ground tremendously . 
Princess Mary positively hates me . 
Already I have had repeated to me two or three epigrams on the subject of myself -- rather caustic , but at the same time very flattering . 
She finds it exceedingly strange that I , who am accustomed to good society , and am so intimate with her Petersburg cousins and aunts , do not try to make her acquaintance . 
Every day we meet at the well and on the boulevard . 
I exert all my powers to entice away her adorers , glittering aides-de-camp , pale-faced visitors from Moscow , and others -- and I almost always succeed . 
I have always hated entertaining guests : now my house is full every day ; they dine , sup , gamble , and alas ! 
my champagne triumphs over the might of Princess Mary 's magnetic eyes ! 
I met her yesterday in Chelakhov 's shop . 
She was bargaining for a marvellous Persian rug , and implored her mother not to be niggardly : the rug would be such an ornament to her boudoir ... I outbid her by forty rubles , and bought it over her head . 
I was rewarded with a glance in which the most delightful fury sparkled . 
About dinnertime , I ordered my Circassian horse , covered with that very rug , purposely to be led past her windows . 
Werner was with the princesses at the time , and told me that the effect of the scene was most dramatic . 
Princess Mary wishes to preach a crusade against me , and I have even noticed that , already , two of the aides-de-camp salute me very coldly , when they are in her presence -- they dine with me every day , however . 
Grushnitski has assumed an air of mystery ; he walks with his arms folded behind his back and does not recognise anyone . 
His foot has got well all at once , and there is hardly a sign of a limp . 
He has found an opportunity of entering into conversation with Princess Ligovski and of paying Princess Mary some kind of a compliment . 
The latter is evidently not very fastidious , for , ever since , she answers his bow with a most charming smile . 
`` Are you sure you do not wish to make the Ligovskis ' acquaintance ? '' 
he said to me yesterday . 
`` Positive . '' 
`` Good gracious ! 
The pleasantest house at the waters ! 
All the best society of Pyatigorsk is to be found there '' ... `` My friend , I am terribly tired of even other society than that of Pyatigorsk . 
So you visit the Ligovskis ? '' 
`` Not yet . 
I have spoken to Princess Mary once or twice , but that is all . 
You know it is rather awkward to go and visit them without being invited , although that is the custom here ... It would be a different matter if I was wearing epaulettes '' ... `` Good heavens ! 
Why , you are much more interesting as it is ! 
You simply do not know how to avail yourself of your advantageous position ... Why , that soldier 's cloak makes a hero and a martyr of you in the eyes of any lady of sentiment ! '' 
Grushnitski smiled complacently . 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
he said . 
`` I am convinced , '' I continued , `` that Princess Mary is in love with you already . '' 
He blushed up to the ears and looked big . 
Oh , vanity ! 
Thou art the lever with which Archimedes was to lift the earthly sphere ! 
... `` You are always jesting ! '' 
he said , pretending to be angry . 
`` In the first place , she knows so little of me as yet '' ... `` Women love only those whom they do not know ! '' 
`` But I have no pretensions whatsoever to pleasing her . 
I simply wish to make the acquaintance of an agreeable household ; and it would be extremely ridiculous if I were to cherish the slightest hope ... With you , now , for instance , it is a different matter ! 
You Petersburg conquerors ! 
You have but to look -- and women melt ... But do you know , Pechorin , what Princess Mary said of you ? '' 
... `` What ? 
She has spoken to you already about me ? '' 
... `` Do not rejoice too soon , though . 
The other day , by chance , I entered into conversation with her at the well ; her third word was , ` Who is that gentleman with such an unpleasant , heavy glance ? 
He was with you when ' ... she blushed , and did not like to mention the day , remembering her own delightful little exploit . 
` You need not tell me what day it was , ' I answered ; ` it will ever be present to my memory ! ' 
... Pechorin , my friend , I can not congratulate you , you are in her black books ... And , indeed , it is a pity , because Mary is a charming girl ! '' 
... It must be observed that Grushnitski is one of those men who , in speaking of a woman with whom they are barely acquainted , call her my Mary , my Sophie , if she has had the good fortune to please them . 
I assumed a serious air and answered : `` Yes , she is good-looking ... Only be careful , Grushnitski ! 
Russian ladies , for the most part , cherish only Platonic love , without mingling any thought of matrimony with it ; and Platonic love is exceedingly embarrassing . 
Princess Mary seems to be one of those women who want to be amused . 
If she is bored in your company for two minutes on end -- you are lost irrevocably . 
Your silence ought to excite her curiosity , your conversation ought never to satisfy it completely ; you should alarm her every minute ; ten times , in public , she will slight people 's opinion for you and will call that a sacrifice , and , in order to requite herself for it , she will torment you . 
Afterwards she will simply say that she can not endure you . 
If you do not acquire authority over her , even her first kiss will not give you the right to a second . 
She will flirt with you to her heart 's content , and , in two years ' time , she will marry a monster , in obedience to her mother , and will assure herself that she is unhappy , that she has loved only one man -- that is to say , you -- but that Heaven was not willing to unite her to him because he wore a soldier 's cloak , although beneath that thick , grey cloak beat a heart , passionate and noble '' ... Grushnitski smote the table with his fist and fell to walking to and fro across the room . 
I laughed inwardly and even smiled once or twice , but fortunately he did not notice . 
It is evident that he is in love , because he has grown even more confiding than heretofore . 
Moreover , a ring has made its appearance on his finger , a silver ring with black enamel of local workmanship . 
It struck me as suspicious ... I began to examine it , and what do you think I saw ? 
The name Mary was engraved on the inside in small letters , and in a line with the name was the date on which she had picked up the famous tumbler . 
I kept my discovery a secret . 
I do not want to force confessions from him , I want him , of his own accord , to choose me as his confidant -- and then I will enjoy myself ! 
... ***** To-day I rose late . 
I went to the well . 
I found nobody there . 
The day grew hot . 
White , shaggy cloudlets were flitting rapidly from the snow-clad mountains , giving promise of a thunderstorm ; the summit of Mount Mashuk was smoking like a just extinguished torch ; grey wisps of cloud were coiling and creeping like snakes around it , arrested in their rapid sweep and , as it were , hooked to its prickly brushwood . 
The atmosphere was charged with electricity . 
I plunged into the avenue of the vines leading to the grotto . 
I felt low-spirited . 
I was thinking of the lady with the little mole on her cheek , of whom the doctor had spoken to me ... `` Why is she here ? '' 
I thought . 
`` And is it she ? 
And what reason have I for thinking it is ? 
And why am I so certain of it ? 
Is there not many a woman with a mole on her cheek ? '' 
Reflecting in such wise I came right up to the grotto . 
I looked in and I saw that a woman , wearing a straw hat and wrapped in a black shawl , was sitting on a stone seat in the cold shade of the arch . 
Her head was sunk upon her breast , and the hat covered her face . 
I was just about to turn back , in order not to disturb her meditations , when she glanced at me . 
`` Vera ! '' 
I exclaimed involuntarily . 
She started and turned pale . 
`` I knew that you were here , '' she said . 
I sat down beside her and took her hand . 
A long-forgotten tremor ran through my veins at the sound of that dear voice . 
She gazed into my face with her deep , calm eyes . 
Mistrust and something in the nature of reproach were expressed in her glance . 
`` We have not seen each other for a long time , '' I said . 
`` A long time , and we have both changed in many ways . '' 
`` Consequently you love me no longer ? '' 
... `` I am married ! '' 
... she said . 
`` Again ? 
A few years ago , however , that reason also existed , but , nevertheless '' ... She plucked her hand away from mine and her cheeks flamed . 
`` Perhaps you love your second husband ? '' 
... She made no answer and turned her head away . 
`` Or is he very jealous ? '' 
She remained silent . 
`` What then ? 
He is young , handsome and , I suppose , rich -- which is the chief thing -- and you are afraid ? '' 
... I glanced at her and was alarmed . 
Profound despair was depicted upon her countenance ; tears were glistening in her eyes . 
`` Tell me , '' she whispered at length , `` do you find it very amusing to torture me ? 
I ought to hate you . 
Since we have known each other , you have given me naught but suffering '' ... Her voice shook ; she leaned over to me , and let her head sink upon my breast . 
`` Perhaps , '' I reflected , `` it is for that very reason that you have loved me ; joys are forgotten , but sorrows never '' ... I clasped her closely to my breast , and so we remained for a long time . 
At length our lips drew closer and became blent in a fervent , intoxicating kiss . 
Her hands were cold as ice ; her head was burning . 
And hereupon we embarked upon one of those conversations which , on paper , have no sense , which it is impossible to repeat , and impossible even to retain in memory . 
The meaning of the sounds replaces and completes the meaning of the words , as in Italian opera . 
She is decidedly averse to my making the acquaintance of her husband , the lame old man of whom I had caught a glimpse on the boulevard . 
She married him for the sake of her son . 
He is rich , and suffers from attacks of rheumatism . 
I did not allow myself even a single scoff at his expense . 
She respects him as a father , and will deceive him as a husband ... A strange thing , the human heart in general , and woman 's heart in particular . 
Vera 's husband , Semyon Vasilevich G -- v , is a distant relation of Princess Ligovski . 
He lives next door to her . 
Vera frequently visits the Princess . 
I have given her my promise to make the Ligovskis ' acquaintance , and to pay court to Princess Mary in order to distract attention from Vera . 
In such way , my plans have been not a little deranged , but it will be amusing for me ... Amusing !
