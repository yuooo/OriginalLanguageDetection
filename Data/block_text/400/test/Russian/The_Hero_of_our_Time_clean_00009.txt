`` I will tell you the whole truth , '' I answered . 
`` I will not justify myself , nor explain my actions : I do not love you . '' 
Her lips grew slightly pale . 
`` Leave me , '' she said , in a scarcely audible voice . 
I shrugged my shoulders , turned round , and walked away . 
I SOMETIMES despise myself ... Is not that the reason why I despise others also ? 
... I have grown incapable of noble impulses ; I am afraid of appearing ridiculous to myself . 
In my place , another would have offered Princess Mary son coeur et sa fortune ; but over me the word `` marry '' has a kind of magical power . 
However passionately I love a woman , if she only gives me to feel that I have to marry her -- then farewell , love ! 
My heart is turned to stone , and nothing will warm it anew . 
I am prepared for any other sacrifice but that ; my life twenty times over , nay , my honour I would stake on the fortune of a card ... but my freedom I will never sell . 
Why do I prize it so highly ? 
What is there in it to me ? 
For what am I preparing myself ? 
What do I hope for from the future ? 
... In truth , absolutely nothing . 
It is a kind of innate dread , an inexplicable prejudice ... There are people , you know , who have an unaccountable dread of spiders , beetles , mice ... Shall I confess it ? 
When I was but a child , a certain old woman told my fortune to my mother . 
She predicted for me death from a wicked wife . 
I was profoundly struck by her words at the time : an irresistible repugnance to marriage was born within my soul ... Meanwhile , something tells me that her prediction will be realized ; I will try , at all events , to arrange that it shall be realized as late in life as possible . 
YESTERDAY , the conjurer Apfelbaum arrived here . 
A long placard made its appearance on the door of the restaurant , informing the most respected public that the above-mentioned marvellous conjurer , acrobat , chemist , and optician would have the honour to give a magnificent performance on the present day at eight o'clock in the evening , in the saloon of the Nobles ' Club -LRB- in other words , the restaurant -RRB- ; tickets -- two rubles and a half each . 
Everyone intends to go and see the marvellous conjurer ; even Princess Ligovski has taken a ticket for herself , in spite of her daughter being ill . 
After dinner to-day , I walked past Vera 's windows ; she was sitting by herself on the balcony . 
A note fell at my feet : `` Come to me at ten o'clock this evening by the large staircase . 
My husband has gone to Pyatigorsk and will not return before to-morrow morning . 
My servants and maids will not be at home ; I have distributed tickets to all of them , and to the princess 's servants as well . 
I await you ; come without fail . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
I said to myself , `` so then it has turned out at last as I thought it would . '' 
At eight o'clock I went to see the conjurer . 
The public assembled before the stroke of nine . 
The performance began . 
On the back rows of chairs I recognized Vera 's and Princess Ligovski 's menservants and maids . 
They were all there , every single one . 
Grushnitski , with his lorgnette , was sitting in the front row , and the conjurer had recourse to him every time he needed a handkerchief , a watch , a ring and so forth . 
For some time past , Grushnitski has ceased to bow to me , and to-day he has looked at me rather insolently once or twice . 
It will all be remembered to him when we come to settle our scores . 
Before ten o'clock had struck , I stood up and went out . 
It was dark outside , pitch dark . 
Cold , heavy clouds were lying on the summit of the surrounding mountains , and only at rare intervals did the dying breeze rustle the tops of the poplars which surrounded the restaurant . 
People were crowding at the windows . 
I went down the mountain and , turning in under the gate , I hastened my pace . 
Suddenly it seemed to me that somebody was following my steps . 
I stopped and looked round . 
It was impossible to make out anything in the darkness . 
However , out of caution , I walked round the house , as if taking a stroll . 
Passing Princess Mary 's windows , I again heard steps behind me ; a man wrapped in a cloak ran by me . 
That rendered me uneasy , but I crept up to the flight of steps , and hastily mounted the dark staircase . 
A door opened , and a little hand seized mine ... `` Nobody has seen you ? '' 
said Vera in a whisper , clinging to me . 
`` Nobody . '' 
`` Now do you believe that I love you ? 
Oh ! 
I have long hesitated , long tortured myself ... But you can do anything you like with me . '' 
Her heart was beating violently , her hands were cold as ice . 
She broke out into complaints and jealous reproaches . 
She demanded that I should confess everything to her , saying that she would bear my faithlessness with submission , because her sole desire was that I should be happy . 
I did not quite believe that , but I calmed her with oaths , promises and so on . 
`` So you will not marry Mary ? 
You do not love her ? 
... But she thinks ... Do you know , she is madly in love with you , poor girl ! '' 
... ***** About two o'clock in the morning I opened the window and , tying two shawls together , I let myself down from the upper balcony to the lower , holding on by the pillar . 
A light was still burning in Princess Mary 's room . 
Something drew me towards that window . 
The curtain was not quite drawn , and I was able to cast a curious glance into the interior of the room . 
Mary was sitting on her bed , her hands crossed upon her knees ; her thick hair was gathered up under a lace-frilled nightcap ; her white shoulders were covered by a large crimson kerchief , and her little feet were hidden in a pair of many-coloured Persian slippers . 
She was sitting quite still , her head sunk upon her breast ; on a little table in front of her was an open book ; but her eyes , fixed and full of inexpressible grief , seemed for the hundredth time to be skimming the same page whilst her thoughts were far away . 
At that moment somebody stirred behind a shrub . 
I leaped from the balcony on to the sward . 
An invisible hand seized me by the shoulder . 
`` Aha ! '' 
said a rough voice : `` caught ! 
... I 'll teach you to be entering princesses ' rooms at night ! '' 
`` Hold him fast ! '' 
exclaimed another , springing out from a corner . 
It was Grushnitski and the captain of dragoons . 
I struck the latter on the head with my fist , knocked him off his feet , and darted into the bushes . 
All the paths of the garden which covered the slope opposite our houses were known to me . 
`` Thieves , guard ! '' 
... they cried . 
A gunshot rang out ; a smoking wad fell almost at my feet . 
Within a minute I was in my own room , undressed and in bed . 
My manservant had only just locked the door when Grushnitski and the captain began knocking for admission . 
`` Pechorin ! 
Are you asleep ? 
Are you there ? '' 
... cried the captain . 
`` I am in bed , '' I answered angrily . 
`` Get up ! 
Thieves ! 
... Circassians ! '' 
... `` I have a cold , '' I answered . 
`` I am afraid of catching a chill . '' 
They went away . 
I had gained no useful purpose by answering them : they would have been looking for me in the garden for another hour or so . 
Meanwhile the alarm became terrific . 
A Cossack galloped up from the fortress . 
The commotion was general ; Circassians were looked for in every shrub -- and of course none were found . 
Probably , however , a good many people were left with the firm conviction that , if only more courage and despatch had been shown by the garrison , at least a score of brigands would have failed to get away with their lives . 
THIS morning , at the well , the sole topic of conversation was the nocturnal attack by the Circassians . 
I drank the appointed number of glasses of Narzan water , and , after sauntering a few times about the long linden avenue , I met Vera 's husband , who had just arrived from Pyatigorsk . 
He took my arm and we went to the restaurant for breakfast . 
He was dreadfully uneasy about his wife . 
`` What a terrible fright she had last night , '' he said . 
`` Of course , it was bound to happen just at the very time when I was absent . '' 
We sat down to breakfast near the door leading into a corner-room in which about a dozen young men were sitting . 
Grushnitski was amongst them . 
For the second time destiny provided me with the opportunity of overhearing a conversation which was to decide his fate . 
He did not see me , and , consequently , it was impossible for me to suspect him of design ; but that only magnified his fault in my eyes . 
`` Is it possible , though , that they were really Circassians ? '' 
somebody said . 
`` Did anyone see them ? '' 
`` I will tell you the whole truth , '' answered Grushnitski : `` only please do not betray me . 
This is how it was : yesterday , a certain man , whose name I will not tell you , came up to me and told me that , at ten o'clock in the evening , he had seen somebody creeping into the Ligovskis ' house . 
I must observe that Princess Ligovski was here , and Princess Mary at home . 
So he and I set off to wait beneath the windows and waylay the lucky man . '' 
I confess I was frightened , although my companion was very busily engaged with his breakfast : he might have heard things which he would have found rather displeasing , if Grushnitski had happened to guess the truth ; but , blinded by jealousy , the latter did not even suspect it . 
`` So , do you see ? '' 
Grushnitski continued . 
`` We set off , taking with us a gun , loaded with blank cartridge , so as just to give him a fright . 
We waited in the garden till two o'clock . 
At length -- goodness knows , indeed , where he appeared from , but he must have come out by the glass door which is behind the pillar ; it was not out of the window that he came , because the window had remained unopened -- at length , I say , we saw someone getting down from the balcony ... What do you think of Princess Mary -- eh ? 
Well , I admit , it is hardly what you might expect from Moscow ladies ! 
After that what can you believe ? 
We were going to seize him , but he broke away and darted like a hare into the shrubs . 
Thereupon I fired at him . '' 
There was a general murmur of incredulity . 
`` You do not believe it ? '' 
he continued . 
`` I give you my word of honour as a gentleman that it is all perfectly true , and , in proof , I will tell you the man 's name if you like . '' 
`` Tell us , tell us , who was he ? '' 
came from all sides . 
`` Pechorin , '' answered Grushnitski . 
At that moment he raised his eyes -- I was standing in the doorway opposite to him . 
He grew terribly red . 
I went up to him and said , slowly and distinctly : `` I am very sorry that I did not come in before you had given your word of honour in confirmation of a most abominable calumny : my presence would have saved you from that further act of baseness . '' 
Grushnitski jumped up from his seat and seemed about to fly into a passion . 
`` I beg you , '' I continued in the same tone : `` I beg you at once to retract what you have said ; you know very well that it is all an invention . 
I do not think that a woman 's indifference to your brilliant merits should deserve so terrible a revenge . 
Bethink you well : if you maintain your present attitude , you will lose the right to the name of gentleman and will risk your life . '' 
Grushnitski stood before me in violent agitation , his eyes cast down . 
But the struggle between his conscience and his vanity was of short duration . 
The captain of dragoons , who was sitting beside him , nudged him with his elbow . 
Grushnitski started , and answered rapidly , without raising his eyes : `` My dear sir , what I say , I mean , and I am prepared to repeat ... I am not afraid of your menaces and am ready for anything . '' 
`` The latter you have already proved , '' I answered coldly ; and , taking the captain of dragoons by the arm , I left the room . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` You are Grushnitski 's friend and will no doubt be his second ? '' 
The captain bowed very gravely . 
`` You have guessed rightly , '' he answered . 
`` Moreover , I am bound to be his second , because the insult offered to him touches myself also . 
I was with him last night , '' he added , straightening up his stooping figure . 
`` Ah ! 
So it was you whose head I struck so clumsily ? '' 
... He turned yellow in the face , then blue ; suppressed rage was portrayed upon his countenance . 
`` I shall have the honour to send my second to you to-day , '' I added , bowing adieu to him very politely , without appearing to have noticed his fury . 
On the restaurant-steps I met Vera 's husband . 
Apparently he had been waiting for me . 
He seized my hand with a feeling akin to rapture . 
`` Noble young man ! '' 
he said , with tears in his eyes . 
`` I have heard everything . 
What a scoundrel ! 
Ingrate ! 
... Just fancy such people being admitted into a decent household after this ! 
Thank God I have no daughters ! 
But she for whom you are risking your life will reward you . 
Be assured of my constant discretion , '' he continued . 
`` I have been young myself and have served in the army : I know that these affairs must take their course . 
Good-bye . '' 
Poor fellow ! 
He is glad that he has no daughters ! 
... I went straight to Werner , found him at home , and told him the whole story -- my relations with Vera and Princess Mary , and the conversation which I had overheard and from which I had learned the intention of these gentlemen to make a fool of me by causing me to fight a duel with blank cartridges . 
But , now , the affair had gone beyond the bounds of jest ; they probably had not expected that it would turn out like this . 
The doctor consented to be my second ; I gave him a few directions with regard to the conditions of the duel . 
He was to insist upon the affair being managed with all possible secrecy , because , although I am prepared , at any moment , to face death , I am not in the least disposed to spoil for all time my future in this world . 
After that I went home . 
In an hour 's time the doctor returned from his expedition . 
`` There is indeed a conspiracy against you , '' he said . 
`` I found the captain of dragoons at Grushnitski 's , together with another gentleman whose surname I do not remember . 
I stopped a moment in the ante-room , in order to take off my goloshes . 
They were squabbling and making a terrible uproar . 
` On no account will I agree , ' Grushnitski was saying : ` he has insulted me publicly ; it was quite a different thing before ' ... '' ` What does it matter to you ? ' 
answered the captain . ' 
I will take it all upon myself . 
I have been second in five duels , and I should think I know how to arrange the affair . 
I have thought it all out . 
Just let me alone , please . 
It is not a bad thing to give people a bit of a fright . 
And why expose yourself to danger if it is possible to avoid it ? ' 
... `` At that moment I entered the room . 
They suddenly fell silent . 
Our negotiations were somewhat protracted . 
At length we decided the matter as follows : about five versts from here there is a hollow gorge ; they will ride thither tomorrow at four o'clock in the morning , and we shall leave half an hour later . 
You will fire at six paces -- Grushnitski himself demanded that condition . 
Whichever of you is killed -- his death will be put down to the account of the Circassians . 
And now I must tell you what I suspect : they , that is to say the seconds , may have made some change in their former plan and may want to load only Grushnitski 's pistol . 
That is something like murder , but in time of war , and especially in Asiatic warfare , such tricks are allowed . 
Grushnitski , however , seems to be a little more magnanimous than his companions . 
What do you think ? 
Ought we not to let them see that we have guessed their plan ? '' 
`` Not on any account , doctor ! 
Make your mind easy ; I will not give in to them . '' 
`` But what are you going to do , then ? '' 
`` That is my secret . '' 
`` Mind you are not caught ... six paces , you know ! '' 
`` Doctor , I shall expect you to-morrow at four o'clock . 
The horses will be ready ... Goodbye . '' 
I remained in the house until the evening , with my door locked . 
A manservant came to invite me to Princess Ligovski 's -- I bade him say that I was ill . 
***** Two o'clock in the morning ... I can not sleep ... Yet sleep is what I need , if I am to have a steady hand to-morrow . 
However , at six paces it is difficult to miss . 
Aha ! 
Mr. Grushnitski , your wiles will not succeed ! 
... We shall exchange roles : now it is I who shall have to seek the signs of latent terror upon your pallid countenance . 
Why have you yourself appointed these fatal six paces ? 
Think you that I will tamely expose my forehead to your aim ? 
... No , we shall cast lots ... And then -- then -- what if his luck should prevail ? 
If my star at length should betray me ? 
... And little wonder if it did : it has so long and faithfully served my caprices . 
Well ? 
If I must die , I must ! 
The loss to the world will not be great ; and I myself am already downright weary of everything . 
I am like a guest at a ball , who yawns but does not go home to bed , simply because his carriage has not come for him . 
But now the carriage is here ... Good-bye ! 
... My whole past life I live again in memory , and , involuntarily , I ask myself : ` why have I lived -- for what purpose was I born ? ' 
... A purpose there must have been , and , surely , mine was an exalted destiny , because I feel that within my soul are powers immeasurable ... But I was not able to discover that destiny , I allowed myself to be carried away by the allurements of passions , inane and ignoble . 
From their crucible I issued hard and cold as iron , but gone for ever was the glow of noble aspirations -- the fairest flower of life . 
And , from that time forth , how often have I not played the part of an axe in the hands of fate ! 
Like an implement of punishment , I have fallen upon the head of doomed victims , often without malice , always without pity ... To none has my love brought happiness , because I have never sacrificed anything for the sake of those I have loved : for myself alone I have loved -- for my own pleasure . 
I have only satisfied the strange craving of my heart , greedily draining their feelings , their tenderness , their joys , their sufferings -- and I have never been able to sate myself . 
I am like one who , spent with hunger , falls asleep in exhaustion and sees before him sumptuous viands and sparkling wines ; he devours with rapture the aerial gifts of the imagination , and his pains seem somewhat assuaged . 
Let him but awake : the vision vanishes -- twofold hunger and despair remain ! 
And to-morrow , it may be , I shall die ! 
... And there will not be left on earth one being who has understood me completely . 
Some will consider me worse , others , better , than I have been in reality ... Some will say : ` he was a good fellow ' ; others : ' a villain . ' 
And both epithets will be false . 
After all this , is life worth the trouble ? 
And yet we live -- out of curiosity ! 
We expect something new ... How absurd , and yet how vexatious ! 
IT is now a month and a half since I have been in the N -- Fortress . 
Maksim Maksimych is out hunting ... I am alone . 
I am sitting by the window . 
Grey clouds have covered the mountains to the foot ; the sun appears through the mist as a yellow spot . 
It is cold ; the wind is whistling and rocking the shutters ... I am bored ! 
... I will continue my diary which has been interrupted by so many strange events . 
I read the last page over : how ridiculous it seems ! 
... I thought to die ; it was not to be . 
I have not yet drained the cup of suffering , and now I feel that I still have long to live . 
How clearly and how sharply have all these bygone events been stamped upon my memory ! 
Time has not effaced a single line , a single shade . 
I remember that during the night preceding the duel I did not sleep a single moment . 
I was not able to write for long : a secret uneasiness took possession of me . 
For about an hour I paced the room , then I sat down and opened a novel by Walter Scott which was lying on my table . 
It was `` The Scottish Puritans . '' 
-LSB- 301 -RSB- At first I read with an effort ; then , carried away by the magical fiction , I became oblivious of everything else . 
At last day broke . 
My nerves became composed . 
I looked in the glass : a dull pallor covered my face , which preserved the traces of harassing sleeplessness ; but my eyes , although encircled by a brownish shadow , glittered proudly and inexorably . 
I was satisfied with myself . 
I ordered the horses to be saddled , dressed myself , and ran down to the baths . 
Plunging into the cold , sparkling water of the Narzan Spring , I felt my bodily and mental powers returning . 
I left the baths as fresh and hearty as if I was off to a ball . 
After that , who shall say that the soul is not dependent upon the body ! 
... On my return , I found the doctor at my rooms . 
He was wearing grey riding-breeches , a jacket and a Circassian cap . 
I burst out laughing when I saw that little figure under the enormous shaggy cap . 
Werner has a by no means warlike countenance , and on that occasion it was even longer than usual . 
`` Why so sad , doctor ? '' 
I said to him . 
`` Have you not a hundred times , with the greatest indifference , escorted people to the other world ? 
Imagine that I have a bilious fever : I may get well ; also , I may die ; both are in the usual course of things . 
Try to look on me as a patient , afflicted with an illness with which you are still unfamiliar -- and then your curiosity will be aroused in the highest degree . 
You can now make a few important physiological observations upon me ... Is not the expectation of a violent death itself a real illness ? '' 
The doctor was struck by that idea , and he brightened up . 
We mounted our horses . 
Werner clung on to his bridle with both hands , and we set off . 
In a trice we had galloped past the fortress , through the village , and had ridden into the gorge . 
Our winding road was half-overgrown with tall grass and was intersected every moment by a noisy brook , which we had to ford , to the great despair of the doctor , because each time his horse would stop in the water . 
A morning more fresh and blue I can not remember ! 
The sun had scarce shown his face from behind the green summits , and the blending of the first warmth of his rays with the dying coolness of the night produced on all my feelings a sort of sweet languor . 
The joyous beam of the young day had not yet penetrated the gorge ; it gilded only the tops of the cliffs which overhung us on both sides . 
The tufted shrubs , growing in the deep crevices of the cliffs , besprinkled us with a silver shower at the least breath of wind . 
I remember that on that occasion I loved Nature more than ever before . 
With what curiosity did I examine every dewdrop trembling upon the broad vine leaf and reflecting millions of rainbowhued rays ! 
How eagerly did my glance endeavour to penetrate the smoky distance ! 
There the road grew narrower and narrower , the cliffs bluer and more dreadful , and at last they met , it seemed , in an impenetrable wall . 
We rode in silence . 
`` Have you made your will ? '' 
Werner suddenly inquired . 
`` No . '' 
`` And if you are killed ? '' 
`` My heirs will be found of themselves . '' 
`` Is it possible that you have no friends , to whom you would like to send a last farewell ? '' 
... I shook my head . 
`` Is there , really , not one woman in the world to whom you would like to leave some token in remembrance ? '' 
... `` Do you want me to reveal my soul to you , doctor ? '' 
I answered ... `` You see , I have outlived the years when people die with the name of the beloved on their lips and bequeathing to a friend a lock of pomaded -- or unpomaded -- hair . 
When I think that death may be near , I think of myself alone ; others do not even do as much . 
The friends who to-morrow will forget me or , worse , will utter goodness knows what falsehoods about me ; the women who , while embracing another , will laugh at me in order not to arouse his jealousy of the deceased -- let them go ! 
Out of the storm of life I have borne away only a few ideas -- and not one feeling . 
For a long time now I have been living , not with my heart , but with my head . 
I weigh , analyse my own passions and actions with severe curiosity , but without sympathy . 
There are two personalities within me : one lives -- in the complete sense of the word -- the other reflects and judges him ; the first , it may be , in an hour 's time , will take farewell of you and the world for ever , and the second -- the second ? 
... Look , doctor , do you see those three black figures on the cliff , to the right ? 
They are our antagonists , I suppose ? '' 
... We pushed on . 
In the bushes at the foot of the cliff three horses were tethered ; we tethered ours there too , and then we clambered up the narrow path to the ledge on which Grushnitski was awaiting us in company with the captain of dragoons and his other second , whom they called Ivan Ignatevich . 
His surname I never heard . 
`` We have been expecting you for quite a long time , '' said the captain of dragoons , with an ironical smile . 
I drew out my watch and showed him the time . 
He apologized , saying that his watch was fast . 
There was an embarrassing silence for a few moments . 
At length the doctor interrupted it . 
`` It seems to me , '' he said , turning to Grushnitski , `` that as you have both shown your readiness to fight , and thereby paid the debt due to the conditions of honour , you might be able to come to an explanation and finish the affair amicably . '' 
`` I am ready , '' I said . 
The captain winked to Grushnitski , and the latter , thinking that I was losing courage , assumed a haughty air , although , until that moment , his cheeks had been covered with a dull pallor . 
For the first time since our arrival he lifted his eyes on me ; but in his glance there was a certain disquietude which evinced an inward struggle . 
`` Declare your conditions , '' he said , `` and anything I can do for you , be assured '' ... `` These are my conditions : you will this very day publicly recant your slander and beg my pardon '' ... `` My dear sir , I wonder how you dare make such a proposal to me ? '' 
`` What else could I propose ? '' 
... `` We will fight . '' 
I shrugged my shoulders . 
`` Be it so ; only , bethink you that one of us will infallibly be killed . '' 
`` I hope it will be you '' ... `` And I am so convinced of the contrary '' ... He became confused , turned red , and then burst out into a forced laugh . 
The captain took his arm and led him aside ; they whispered together for a long time . 
I had arrived in a fairly pacific frame of mind , but all this was beginning to drive me furious . 
The doctor came up to me . 
`` Listen , '' he said , with manifest uneasiness , `` you have surely forgotten their conspiracy ! 
... I do not know how to load a pistol , but in this case ... You are a strange man ! 
Tell them that you know their intention -- and they will not dare ... What sport ! 
To shoot you like a bird '' ... `` Please do not be uneasy , doctor , and wait awhile ... I shall arrange everything in such a way that there will be no advantage on their side . 
Let them whisper '' ... `` Gentlemen , this is becoming tedious , '' I said to them loudly : `` if we are to fight , let us fight ; you had time yesterday to talk as much as you wanted to . '' 
`` We are ready , '' answered the captain . 
`` Take your places , gentlemen ! 
Doctor , be good enough to measure six paces '' ... `` Take your places ! '' 
repeated Ivan Ignatevich , in a squeaky voice . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
I said . 
`` One further condition . 
As we are going to fight to the death , we are bound to do everything possible in order that the affair may remain a secret , and that our seconds may incur no responsibility . 
Do you agree ? '' 
... `` Quite . '' 
`` Well , then , this is my idea . 
Do you see that narrow ledge on the top of the perpendicular cliff on the right ? 
It must be thirty fathoms , if not more , from there to the bottom ; and , down below , there are sharp rocks . 
Each of us will stand right at the extremity of the ledge -- in such manner even a slight wound will be mortal : that ought to be in accordance with your desire , as you yourselves have fixed upon six paces . 
Whichever of us is wounded will be certain to fall down and be dashed to pieces ; the doctor will extract the bullet , and , then , it will be possible very easily to account for that sudden death by saying it was the result of a fall . 
Let us cast lots to decide who shall fire first . 
In conclusion , I declare that I will not fight on any other terms . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
said the captain after an expressive glance at Grushnitski , who nodded his head in token of assent . 
Every moment he was changing countenance . 
I had placed him in an embarrassing position . 
Had the duel been fought upon the usual conditions , he could have aimed at my leg , wounded me slightly , and in such wise gratified his vengeance without overburdening his conscience . 
But now he was obliged to fire in the air , or to make himself an assassin , or , finally , to abandon his base plan and to expose himself to equal danger with me . 
I should not have liked to be in his place at that moment . 
He took the captain aside and said something to him with great warmth . 
His lips were blue , and I saw them trembling ; but the captain turned away from him with a contemptuous smile . 
`` You are a fool , '' he said to Grushnitski rather loudly . 
`` You ca n't understand a thing ! 
... Let us be off , then , gentlemen ! '' 
The precipice was approached by a narrow path between bushes , and fragments of rock formed the precarious steps of that natural staircase . 
Clinging to the bushes we proceeded to clamber up . 
Grushnitski went in front , his seconds behind him , and then the doctor and I. `` I am surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pressing my hand vigorously . 
`` Let me feel your pulse ! 
... Oho ! 
Feverish ! 
... But nothing noticeable on your countenance ... only your eyes are gleaming more brightly than usual . '' 
Suddenly small stones rolled noisily right under our feet . 
What was it ? 
Grushnitski had stumbled ; the branch to which he was clinging had broken off , and he would have rolled down on his back if his seconds had not held him up . 
`` Take care ! '' 
I cried . 
`` Do not fall prematurely : that is a bad sign . 
Remember Julius Caesar ! '' 
AND now we had climbed to the summit of the projecting cliff . 
The ledge was covered with fine sand , as if on purpose for a duel . 
All around , like an innumerable herd , crowded the mountains , their summits lost to view in the golden mist of the morning ; and towards the south rose the white mass of Elbruz , closing the chain of icy peaks , among which fibrous clouds , which had rushed in from the east , were already roaming . 
I walked to the extremity of the ledge and gazed down . 
My head nearly swam . 
At the foot of the precipice all seemed dark and cold as in a tomb ; the moss-grown jags of the rocks , hurled down by storm and time , were awaiting their prey . 
The ledge on which we were to fight formed an almost regular triangle . 
Six paces were measured from the projecting corner , and it was decided that whichever had first to meet the fire of his opponent should stand in the very corner with his back to the precipice ; if he was not killed the adversaries would change places . 
I determined to relinquish every advantage to Grushnitski ; I wanted to test him . 
A spark of magnanimity might awake in his soul -- and then all would have been settled for the best . 
But his vanity and weakness of character had perforce to triumph ! 
... I wished to give myself the full right to refrain from sparing him if destiny were to favour me . 
Who would not have concluded such an agreement with his conscience ? 
`` Cast the lot , doctor ! '' 
said the captain . 
The doctor drew a silver coin from his pocket and held it up . 
`` Tail ! '' 
cried Grushnitski hurriedly , like a man suddenly aroused by a friendly nudge . 
`` Head , '' I said . 
The coin spun in the air and fell , jingling . 
We all rushed towards it . 
`` You are lucky , '' I said to Grushnitski . 
`` You are to fire first ! 
But remember that if you do not kill me I shall not miss -- I give you my word of honour . ''
