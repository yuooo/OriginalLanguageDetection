He was scarcely able to breathe ; perspiration was rolling in large drops from his face ; wet tufts of grey hair , escaping from under his cap , were glued to his forehead ; his knees were shaking ... He was about to throw himself on Pechorin 's neck , but the latter , rather coldly , though with a smile of welcome , stretched out his hand to him . 
For a moment the staff-captain was petrified , but then eagerly seized Pechorin 's hand in both his own . 
He was still unable to speak . 
`` How glad I am to see you , my dear Maksim Maksimych ! 
Well , how are you ? '' 
said Pechorin . 
`` And ... thou ... you ? '' 
-LSB- 20 -RSB- murmured the old man , with tears in his eyes . 
`` What an age it is since I have seen you ! 
... But where are you off to ? '' 
... `` I am going to Persia -- and farther . '' 
... `` But surely not immediately ? 
... Wait a little , my dear fellow ! 
... Surely we are not going to part at once ? 
... What a long time it is since we have seen each other ! '' 
... `` It is time for me to go , Maksim Maksimych , '' was the reply . 
`` Good heavens , good heavens ! 
But where are you going to in such a hurry ? 
There was so much I should have liked to tell you ! 
So much to question you about ! 
... Well , what of yourself ? 
Have you retired ? 
... What ? 
... How have you been getting along ? '' 
`` Getting bored ! '' 
answered Pechorin , smiling . 
`` You remember the life we led in the fortress ? 
A splendid country for hunting ! 
You were awfully fond of shooting , you know ! 
... And Bela ? '' 
... Pechorin turned just the slightest bit pale and averted his head . 
`` Yes , I remember ! '' 
he said , almost immediately forcing a yawn . 
Maksim Maksimych began to beg him to stay with him for a couple of hours or so longer . 
`` We will have a splendid dinner , '' he said . 
`` I have two pheasants ; and the Kakhetian wine is excellent here ... not what it is in Georgia , of course , but still of the best sort ... We will have a talk ... You will tell me about your life in Petersburg ... Eh ? '' 
... `` In truth , there 's nothing for me to tell , dear Maksim Maksimych ... However , good-bye , it is time for me to be off ... I am in a hurry ... I thank you for not having forgotten me , '' he added , taking him by the hand . 
The old man knit his brows . 
He was grieved and angry , although he tried to hide his feelings . 
`` Forget ! '' 
he growled . 
`` I have not forgotten anything ... Well , God be with you ! 
... It is not like this that I thought we should meet . '' 
`` Come ! 
That will do , that will do ! '' 
said Pechorin , giving him a friendly embrace . 
`` Is it possible that I am not the same as I used to be ? 
... What can we do ? 
Everyone must go his own way ... Are we ever going to meet again ? 
-- God only knows ! '' 
While saying this he had taken his seat in the carriage , and the coachman was already gathering up the reins . 
`` Wait , wait ! '' 
cried Maksim Maksimych suddenly , holding on to the carriage door . 
`` I was nearly forgetting altogether . 
Your papers were left with me , Grigori Aleksandrovich ... I drag them about everywhere I go ... I thought I should find you in Georgia , but this is where it has pleased Heaven that we should meet . 
What 's to be done with them ? '' 
... `` Whatever you like ! '' 
answered Pechorin . 
`` Good-bye . '' 
... `` So you are off to Persia ? 
... But when will you return ? '' 
Maksim Maksimych cried after him . 
By this time the carriage was a long way off , but Pechorin made a sign with his hand which might be interpreted as meaning : `` It is doubtful whether I shall return , and there is no reason , either , why I should ! '' 
The jingle of the bell and the clatter of the wheels along the flinty road had long ceased to be audible , but the poor old man still remained standing in the same place , deep in thought . 
`` Yes , '' he said at length , endeavouring to assume an air of indifference , although from time to time a tear of vexation glistened on his eyelashes . 
`` Of course we were friends -- well , but what are friends nowadays ? 
... What could I be to him ? 
I 'm not rich ; I 've no rank ; and , moreover , I 'm not at all his match in years ! 
-- See what a dandy he has become since he has been staying in Petersburg again ! 
... What a carriage ! 
... What a quantity of luggage ! 
... And such a haughty manservant too ! '' 
... These words were pronounced with an ironical smile . 
`` Tell me , '' he continued , turning to me , `` what do you think of it ? 
Come , what the devil is he off to Persia for now ? 
... Good Lord , it is ridiculous -- ridiculous ! 
... But I always knew that he was a fickle man , and one you could never rely on ! 
... But , indeed , it is a pity that he should come to a bad end ... yet it ca n't be otherwise ! 
... I always did say that there is no good to be got out of a man who forgets his old friends ! '' 
... Hereupon he turned away in order to hide his agitation and proceeded to walk about the courtyard , around his cart , pretending to be examining the wheels , whilst his eyes kept filling with tears every moment . 
`` Maksim Maksimych , '' I said , going up to him , `` what papers are these that Pechorin left you ? '' 
`` Goodness knows ! 
Notes of some sort '' ... `` What will you do with them ? '' 
`` What ? 
I 'll have cartridges made of them . '' 
`` Hand them over to me instead . '' 
He looked at me in surprise , growled something through his teeth , and began to rummage in his portmanteau . 
Out he drew a writing-book and threw it contemptuously on the ground ; then a second -- a third -- a tenth shared the same fate . 
There was something childish in his vexation , and it struck me as ridiculous and pitiable ... `` Here they are , '' he said . 
`` I congratulate you on your find ! '' 
... `` And I may do anything I like with them ? '' 
`` Yes , print them in the newspapers , if you like . 
What is it to me ? 
Am I a friend or relation of his ? 
It is true that for a long time we lived under one roof ... but are n't there plenty of people with whom I have lived ? '' 
... I seized the papers and lost no time in carrying them away , fearing that the staff-captain might repent his action . 
Soon somebody came to tell us that the `` Adventure '' would set off in an hour 's time . 
I ordered the horses to be put to . 
I had already put my cap on when the staff-captain entered the room . 
Apparently he had not got ready for departure . 
His manner was somewhat cold and constrained . 
`` You are not going , then , Maksim Maksimych ? '' 
`` No , sir ! '' 
`` But why not ? '' 
`` Well , I have not seen the Commandant yet , and I have to deliver some Government things . '' 
`` But you did go , you know . '' 
`` I did , of course , '' he stammered , `` but he was not at home ... and I did not wait . '' 
I understood . 
For the first time in his life , probably , the poor old man had , to speak by the book , thrown aside official business ` for the sake of his personal requirements ' ... and how he had been rewarded ! 
`` I am very sorry , Maksim Maksimych , very sorry indeed , '' I said , `` that we must part sooner than necessary . '' 
`` What should we rough old men be thinking of to run after you ? 
You young men are fashionable and proud : under the Circassian bullets you are friendly enough with us ... but when you meet us afterwards you are ashamed even to give us your hand ! '' 
`` I have not deserved these reproaches , Maksim Maksimych . '' 
`` Well , but you know I 'm quite right . 
However , I wish you all good luck and a pleasant journey . '' 
We took a rather cold farewell of each other . 
The kind-hearted Maksim Maksimych had become the obstinate , cantankerous staff-captain ! 
And why ? 
Because Pechorin , through absent-mindedness or from some other cause , had extended his hand to him when Maksim Maksimych was going to throw himself on his neck ! 
Sad it is to see when a young man loses his best hopes and dreams , when from before his eyes is withdrawn the rose-hued veil through which he has looked upon the deeds and feelings of mankind ; although there is the hope that the old illusions will be replaced by new ones , none the less evanescent , but , on the other hand , none the less sweet . 
But wherewith can they be replaced when one is at the age of Maksim Maksimych ? 
Do what you will , the heart hardens and the soul shrinks in upon itself . 
I departed -- alone . 
I LEARNED not long ago that Pechorin had died on his way back from Persia . 
The news afforded me great delight ; it gave me the right to print these notes ; and I have taken advantage of the opportunity of putting my name at the head of another person 's productions . 
Heaven grant that my readers may not punish me for such an innocent deception ! 
I must now give some explanation of the reasons which have induced me to betray to the public the inmost secrets of a man whom I never knew . 
If I had even been his friend , well and good : the artful indiscretion of the true friend is intelligible to everybody ; but I only saw Pechorin once in my life -- on the high-road -- and , consequently , I can not cherish towards him that inexplicable hatred , which , hiding its face under the mask of friendship , awaits but the death or misfortune of the beloved object to burst over its head in a storm of reproaches , admonitions , scoffs and regrets . 
On reading over these notes , I have become convinced of the sincerity of the man who has so unsparingly exposed to view his own weaknesses and vices . 
The history of a man 's soul , even the pettiest soul , is hardly less interesting and useful than the history of a whole people ; especially when the former is the result of the observations of a mature mind upon itself , and has been written without any egoistical desire of arousing sympathy or astonishment . 
Rousseau 's Confessions has precisely this defect -- he read it to his friends . 
And , so , it is nothing but the desire to be useful that has constrained me to print fragments of this diary which fell into my hands by chance . 
Although I have altered all the proper names , those who are mentioned in it will probably recognise themselves , and , it may be , will find some justification for actions for which they have hitherto blamed a man who has ceased henceforth to have anything in common with this world . 
We almost always excuse that which we understand . 
I have inserted in this book only those portions of the diary which refer to Pechorin 's sojourn in the Caucasus . 
There still remains in my hands a thick writing-book in which he tells the story of his whole life . 
Some time or other that , too , will present itself before the tribunal of the world , but , for many and weighty reasons , I do not venture to take such a responsibility upon myself now . 
Possibly some readers would like to know my own opinion of Pechorin 's character . 
My answer is : the title of this book . 
`` But that is malicious irony ! '' 
they will say ... I know not . 
TAMAN is the nastiest little hole of all the seaports of Russia . 
I was all but starved there , to say nothing of having a narrow escape of being drowned . 
I arrived late at night by the post-car . 
The driver stopped the tired troika -LSB- 21 -RSB- at the gate of the only stone-built house that stood at the entrance to the town . 
The sentry , a Cossack from the Black Sea , hearing the jingle of the bell , cried out , sleepily , in his barbarous voice , `` Who goes there ? '' 
An under-officer of Cossacks and a headborough -LSB- 22 -RSB- came out . 
I explained that I was an officer bound for the active-service detachment on Government business , and I proceeded to demand official quarters . 
The headborough conducted us round the town . 
Whatever hut we drove up to we found to be occupied . 
The weather was cold ; I had not slept for three nights ; I was tired out , and I began to lose my temper . 
`` Take me somewhere or other , you scoundrel ! '' 
I cried ; `` to the devil himself , so long as there 's a place to put up at ! '' 
`` There is one other lodging , '' answered the headborough , scratching his head . 
`` Only you wo n't like it , sir . 
It is uncanny ! '' 
Failing to grasp the exact signification of the last phrase , I ordered him to go on , and , after a lengthy peregrination through muddy byways , at the sides of which I could see nothing but old fences , we drove up to a small cabin , right on the shore of the sea . 
The full moon was shining on the little reed-thatched roof and the white walls of my new dwelling . 
In the courtyard , which was surrounded by a wall of rubble-stone , there stood another miserable hovel , smaller and older than the first and all askew . 
The shore descended precipitously to the sea , almost from its very walls , and down below , with incessant murmur , plashed the dark-blue waves . 
The moon gazed softly upon the watery element , restless but obedient to it , and I was able by its light to distinguish two ships lying at some distance from the shore , their black rigging motionless and standing out , like cobwebs , against the pale line of the horizon . 
`` There are vessels in the harbour , '' I said to myself . 
`` To-morrow I will set out for Gelenjik . '' 
I had with me , in the capacity of soldier-servant , a Cossack of the frontier army . 
Ordering him to take down the portmanteau and dismiss the driver , I began to call the master of the house . 
No answer ! 
I knocked -- all was silent within ! 
... What could it mean ? 
At length a boy of about fourteen crept out from the hall . 
`` Where is the master ? '' 
`` There is n't one . '' 
`` What ! 
No master ? '' 
`` None ! '' 
`` And the mistress ? '' 
`` She has gone off to the village . '' 
`` Who will open the door for me , then ? '' 
I said , giving it a kick . 
The door opened of its own accord , and a breath of moisture-laden air was wafted from the hut . 
I struck a lucifer match and held it to the boy 's face . 
It lit up two white eyes . 
He was totally blind , obviously so from birth . 
He stood stock-still before me , and I began to examine his features . 
I confess that I have a violent prejudice against all blind , one-eyed , deaf , dumb , legless , armless , hunchbacked , and such-like people . 
I have observed that there is always a certain strange connection between a man 's exterior and his soul ; as , if when the body loses a limb , the soul also loses some power of feeling . 
And so I began to examine the blind boy 's face . 
But what could be read upon a face from which the eyes are missing ? 
... For a long time I gazed at him with involuntary compassion , when suddenly a scarcely perceptible smile flitted over his thin lips , producing , I know not why , a most unpleasant impression upon me . 
I began to feel a suspicion that the blind boy was not so blind as he appeared to be . 
In vain I endeavoured to convince myself that it was impossible to counterfeit cataracts ; and besides , what reason could there be for doing such a thing ? 
But I could not help my suspicions . 
I am easily swayed by prejudice ... `` You are the master 's son ? '' 
I asked at length . 
`` No . '' 
`` Who are you , then ? '' 
`` An orphan -- a poor boy . '' 
`` Has the mistress any children ? '' 
`` No , her daughter ran away and crossed the sea with a Tartar . '' 
`` What sort of a Tartar ? '' 
`` The devil only knows ! 
A Crimean Tartar , a boatman from Kerch . '' 
I entered the hut . 
Its whole furniture consisted of two benches and a table , together with an enormous chest beside the stove . 
There was not a single ikon to be seen on the wall -- a bad sign ! 
The sea-wind burst in through the broken window-pane . 
I drew a wax candle-end from my portmanteau , lit it , and began to put my things out . 
My sabre and gun I placed in a corner , my pistols I laid on the table . 
I spread my felt cloak out on one bench , and the Cossack his on the other . 
In ten minutes the latter was snoring , but I could not go to sleep -- the image of the boy with the white eyes kept hovering before me in the dark . 
About an hour passed thus . 
The moon shone in at the window and its rays played along the earthen floor of the hut . 
Suddenly a shadow flitted across the bright strip of moonshine which intersected the floor . 
I raised myself up a little and glanced out of the window . 
Again somebody ran by it and disappeared -- goodness knows where ! 
It seemed impossible for anyone to descend the steep cliff overhanging the shore , but that was the only thing that could have happened . 
I rose , threw on my tunic , girded on a dagger , and with the utmost quietness went out of the hut . 
The blind boy was coming towards me . 
I hid by the fence , and he passed by me with a sure but cautious step . 
He was carrying a parcel under his arm . 
He turned towards the harbour and began to descend a steep and narrow path . 
`` On that day the dumb will cry out and the blind will see , '' I said to myself , following him just close enough to keep him in sight . 
Meanwhile the moon was becoming overcast by clouds and a mist had risen upon the sea . 
The lantern alight in the stern of a ship close at hand was scarcely visible through the mist , and by the shore there glimmered the foam of the waves , which every moment threatened to submerge it . 
Descending with difficulty , I stole along the steep declivity , and all at once I saw the blind boy come to a standstill and then turn down to the right . 
He walked so close to the water 's edge that it seemed as if the waves would straightway seize him and carry him off . 
But , judging by the confidence with which he stepped from rock to rock and avoided the water-channels , this was evidently not the first time that he had made that journey . 
Finally he stopped , as though listening for something , squatted down upon the ground , and laid the parcel beside him . 
Concealing myself behind a projecting rock on the shore , I kept watch on his movements . 
After a few minutes a white figure made its appearance from the opposite direction . 
It came up to the blind boy and sat down beside him . 
At times the wind wafted their conversation to me . 
`` Well ? '' 
said a woman 's voice . 
`` The storm is violent ; Yanko will not be here . '' 
`` Yanko is not afraid of the storm ! '' 
the other replied . 
`` The mist is thickening , '' rejoined the woman 's voice , sadness in its tone . 
`` In the mist it is all the easier to slip past the guardships , '' was the answer . 
`` And if he is drowned ? '' 
`` Well , what then ? 
On Sunday you wo n't have a new ribbon to go to church in . '' 
An interval of silence followed . 
One thing , however , struck me -- in talking to me the blind boy spoke in the Little Russian dialect , but now he was expressing himself in pure Russian . 
`` You see , I am right ! '' 
the blind boy went on , clapping his hands . 
`` Yanko is not afraid of sea , nor winds , nor mist , nor coastguards ! 
Just listen ! 
That is not the water plashing , you ca n't deceive me -- it is his long oars . '' 
The woman sprang up and began anxiously to gaze into the distance . 
`` You are raving ! '' 
she said . 
`` I can not see anything . '' 
I confess that , much as I tried to make out in the distance something resembling a boat , my efforts were unsuccessful . 
About ten minutes passed thus , when a black speck appeared between the mountains of the waves ! 
At one time it grew larger , at another smaller . 
Slowly rising upon the crests of the waves and swiftly descending from them , the boat drew near to the shore . 
`` He must be a brave sailor , '' I thought , `` to have determined to cross the twenty versts of strait on a night like this , and he must have had a weighty reason for doing so . '' 
Reflecting thus , I gazed with an involuntary beating of the heart at the poor boat . 
It dived like a duck , and then , with rapidly swinging oars -- like wings -- it sprang forth from the abyss amid the splashes of the foam . 
`` Ah ! '' 
I thought , `` it will be dashed against the shore with all its force and broken to pieces ! '' 
But it turned aside adroitly and leaped unharmed into a little creek . 
Out of it stepped a man of medium height , wearing a Tartar sheepskin cap . 
He waved his hand , and all three set to work to drag something out of the boat . 
The cargo was so large that , to this day , I can not understand how it was that the boat did not sink . 
Each of them shouldered a bundle , and they set off along the shore , and I soon lost sight of them . 
I had to return home ; but I confess I was rendered uneasy by all these strange happenings , and I found it hard to await the morning . 
My Cossack was very much astonished when , on waking up , he saw me fully dressed . 
I did not , however , tell him the reason . 
For some time I stood at the window , gazing admiringly at the blue sky all studded with wisps of cloud , and at the distant shore of the Crimea , stretching out in a lilac-coloured streak and ending in a cliff , on the summit of which the white tower of the lighthouse was gleaming . 
Then I betook myself to the fortress , Phanagoriya , in order to ascertain from the Commandant at what hour I should depart for Gelenjik . 
But the Commandant , alas ! 
could not give me any definite information . 
The vessels lying in the harbour were all either guard-ships or merchant-vessels which had not yet even begun to take in lading . 
`` Maybe in about three or four days ' time a mail-boat will come in , '' said the Commandant , `` and then we shall see . '' 
I returned home sulky and wrathful . 
My Cossack met me at the door with a frightened countenance . 
`` Things are looking bad , sir ! '' 
he said . 
`` Yes , my friend ; goodness only knows when we shall get away ! '' 
Hereupon he became still more uneasy , and , bending towards me , he said in a whisper : `` It is uncanny here ! 
I met an under-officer from the Black Sea to-day -- he 's an acquaintance of mine -- he was in my detachment last year . 
When I told him where we were staying , he said , ` That place is uncanny , old fellow ; they 're wicked people there ! ' 
... And , indeed , what sort of a blind boy is that ? 
He goes everywhere alone , to fetch water and to buy bread at the bazaar . 
It is evident they have become accustomed to that sort of thing here . '' 
`` Well , what then ? 
Tell me , though , has the mistress of the place put in an appearance ? '' 
`` During your absence to-day , an old woman and her daughter arrived . '' 
`` What daughter ? 
She has no daughter ! '' 
`` Goodness knows who it can be if it is n't her daughter ; but the old woman is sitting over there in the hut now . '' 
I entered the hovel . 
A blazing fire was burning in the stove , and they were cooking a dinner which struck me as being a rather luxurious one for poor people . 
To all my questions the old woman replied that she was deaf and could not hear me . 
There was nothing to be got out of her . 
I turned to the blind boy who was sitting in front of the stove , putting twigs into the fire . 
`` Now , then , you little blind devil , '' I said , taking him by the ear . 
`` Tell me , where were you roaming with the bundle last night , eh ? '' 
The blind boy suddenly burst out weeping , shrieking and wailing . 
`` Where did I go ? 
I did not go anywhere ... With the bundle ? 
... What bundle ? '' 
This time the old woman heard , and she began to mutter : `` Hark at them plotting , and against a poor boy too ! 
What are you touching him for ? 
What has he done to you ? '' 
I had enough of it , and went out , firmly resolved to find the key to the riddle . 
I wrapped myself up in my felt cloak and , sitting down on a rock by the fence , gazed into the distance . 
Before me stretched the sea , agitated by the storm of the previous night , and its monotonous roar , like the murmur of a town over which slumber is beginning to creep , recalled bygone years to my mind , and transported my thoughts northward to our cold Capital . 
Agitated by my recollections , I became oblivious of my surroundings . 
About an hour passed thus , perhaps even longer . 
Suddenly something resembling a song struck upon my ear . 
It was a song , and the voice was a woman 's , young and fresh -- but , where was it coming from ? 
... I listened ; it was a harmonious melody -- now long-drawnout and plaintive , now swift and lively . 
I looked around me -- there was nobody to be seen . 
I listened again -- the sounds seemed to be falling from the sky . 
I raised my eyes . 
On the roof of my cabin was standing a young girl in a striped dress and with her hair hanging loose -- a regular water-nymph . 
Shading her eyes from the sun 's rays with the palm of her hand , she was gazing intently into the distance . 
At one time , she would laugh and talk to herself , at another , she would strike up her song anew . 
I have retained that song in my memory , word for word : At their own free will They seem to wander O'er the green sea yonder , Those ships , as still They are onward going , With white sails flowing . 
And among those ships My eye can mark My own dear barque : By two oars guided -LRB- All unprovided With sails -RRB- it slips . 
The storm-wind raves : And the old ships -- see ! 
With wings spread free , Over the waves They scatter and flee ! 
The sea I will hail With obeisance deep : `` Thou base one , hark ! 
Thou must not fail My little barque From harm to keep ! '' 
For lo ! 
't is bearing Most precious gear , And brave and daring The arms that steer Within the dark My little barque . 
Involuntarily the thought occurred to me that I had heard the same voice the night before . 
I reflected for a moment , and when I looked up at the roof again there was no girl to be seen . 
Suddenly she darted past me , with another song on her lips , and , snapping her fingers , she ran up to the old woman . 
Thereupon a quarrel arose between them . 
The old woman grew angry , and the girl laughed loudly . 
And then I saw my Undine running and gambolling again . 
She came up to where I was , stopped , and gazed fixedly into my face as if surprised at my presence . 
Then she turned carelessly away and went quietly towards the harbour . 
But this was not all . 
The whole day she kept hovering around my lodging , singing and gambolling without a moment 's interruption . 
Strange creature ! 
There was not the slightest sign of insanity in her face ; on the contrary , her eyes , which were continually resting upon me , were bright and piercing . 
Moreover , they seemed to be endowed with a certain magnetic power , and each time they looked at me they appeared to be expecting a question . 
But I had only to open my lips to speak , and away she would run , with a sly smile . 
Certainly never before had I seen a woman like her . 
She was by no means beautiful ; but , as in other matters , I have my own prepossessions on the subject of beauty . 
There was a good deal of breeding in her ... Breeding in women , as in horses , is a great thing : a discovery , the credit of which belongs to young France . 
It -- that is to say , breeding , not young France -- is chiefly to be detected in the gait , in the hands and feet ; the nose , in particular , is of the greatest significance . 
In Russia a straight nose is rarer than a small foot . 
My songstress appeared to be not more than eighteen years of age . 
The unusual suppleness of her figure , the characteristic and original way she had of inclining her head , her long , light-brown hair , the golden sheen of her slightly sunburnt neck and shoulders , and especially her straight nose -- all these held me fascinated . 
Although in her sidelong glances I could read a certain wildness and disdain , although in her smile there was a certain vagueness , yet -- such is the force of predilections -- that straight nose of hers drove me crazy . 
I fancied that I had found Goethe 's Mignon -- that queer creature of his German imagination . 
And , indeed , there was a good deal of similarity between them ; the same rapid transitions from the utmost restlessness to complete immobility , the same enigmatical speeches , the same gambols , the same strange songs . 
Towards evening I stopped her at the door and entered into the following conversation with her . 
`` Tell me , my beauty , '' I asked , `` what were you doing on the roof to-day ? '' 
`` I was looking to see from what direction the wind was blowing . '' 
`` What did you want to know for ? '' 
`` Whence the wind blows comes happiness . '' 
`` Well ? 
Were you invoking happiness with your song ? '' 
`` Where there is singing there is also happiness . '' 
`` But what if your song were to bring you sorrow ? '' 
`` Well , what then ? 
Where things wo n't be better , they will be worse ; and from bad to good again is not far . '' 
`` And who taught you that song ? '' 
`` Nobody taught me ; it comes into my head and I sing ; whoever is to hear it , he will hear it , and whoever ought not to hear it , he will not understand it . '' 
`` What is your name , my songstress ? '' 
`` He who baptized me knows . '' 
`` And who baptized you ? '' 
`` How should I know ? '' 
`` What a secretive girl you are ! 
But look here , I have learned something about you '' -- she neither changed countenance nor moved her lips , as though my discovery was of no concern to her -- `` I have learned that you went to the shore last night . '' 
And , thereupon , I very gravely retailed to her all that I had seen , thinking that I should embarrass her . 
Not a bit of it ! 
She burst out laughing heartily . 
`` You have seen much , but know little ; and what you do know , see that you keep it under lock and key . '' 
`` But supposing , now , I was to take it into my head to inform the Commandant ? '' 
and here I assumed a very serious , not to say stern , demeanour . 
She gave a sudden spring , began to sing , and hid herself like a bird frightened out of a thicket . 
My last words were altogether out of place . 
I had no suspicion then how momentous they were , but afterwards I had occasion to rue them . 
As soon as the dusk of evening fell , I ordered the Cossack to heat the teapot , campaign fashion . 
I lighted a candle and sat down by the table , smoking my travelling-pipe . 
I was just about to finish my second tumbler of tea when suddenly the door creaked and I heard behind me the sound of footsteps and the light rustle of a dress . 
I started and turned round . 
It was she -- my Undine . 
Softly and without saying a word she sat down opposite to me and fixed her eyes upon me . 
Her glance seemed wondrously tender , I know not why ; it reminded me of one of those glances which , in years gone by , so despotically played with my life . 
She seemed to be waiting for a question , but I kept silence , filled with an inexplicable sense of embarrassment . 
Mental agitation was evinced by the dull pallor which overspread her countenance ; her hand , which I noticed was trembling slightly , moved aimlessly about the table . 
At one time her breast heaved , and at another she seemed to be holding her breath . 
This little comedy was beginning to pall upon me , and I was about to break the silence in a most prosaic manner , that is , by offering her a glass of tea ; when suddenly , springing up , she threw her arms around my neck , and I felt her moist , fiery lips pressed upon mine . 
Darkness came before my eyes , my head began to swim . 
I embraced her with the whole strength of youthful passion . 
But , like a snake , she glided from between my arms , whispering in my ear as she did so : `` To-night , when everyone is asleep , go out to the shore . ''

`` Little devil ! '' 
cried the Cossack , who had taken up his position on the straw and had contemplated warming himself with the remains of the tea . 
It was only then that I recovered my senses . 
In about two hours ' time , when all had grown silent in the harbour , I awakened my Cossack .
