` Yes , that 's obvious . ' 
Pavel Petrovitch began deliberately spreading butter on his bread . 
` Is he going to stay long with us ? ' 
` Perhaps . 
He came here on the way to his father 's . ' 
` And where does his father live ? ' 
` In our province , sixty-four miles from here . 
He has a small property there . 
He was formerly an army doctor . ' 
` Tut , tut , tut ! 
To be sure , I kept asking myself , `` Where have I heard that name , Bazarov ? '' 
Nikolai , do you remember , in our father 's division there was a surgeon Bazarov ? ' ' 
I believe there was . ' 
` Yes , yes , to be sure . 
So that surgeon was his father . 
Hm ! ' 
Pavel Petrovitch pulled his moustaches . 
` Well , and what is Mr. Bazarov himself ? ' 
he asked , deliberately . 
` What is Bazarov ? ' 
Arkady smiled . 
` Would you like me , uncle , to tell you what he really is ? ' 
` If you will be so good , nephew . ' 
` He 's a nihilist . ' 
` Eh ? ' 
inquired Nikolai Petrovitch , while Pavel Petrovitch lilted a knife in the air with a small piece of butter on its tip , and remained motionless . 
` He 's a nihilist , ' repeated Arkady . ' 
A nihilist , ' said Nikolai Petrovitch . 
` That 's from the Latin , nihil , nothing , as far as I can judge ; the word must mean a man who ... who accepts nothing ? ' 
` Say , `` who respects nothing , '' ' put in Pavel Petrovitch , and he set to work on the butter again . 
` Who regards everything from the critical point of view , ' observed Arkady . 
` Is n't that just the same thing ? ' 
inquired Pavel Petrovitch . 
` No , it 's not the same thing . 
A nihilist is a man who does not bow down before any authority , who does not take any principle on faith , whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in . ' 
` Well , and is that good ? ' 
interrupted Pavel Petrovitch . 
` That depends , uncle . 
Some people it will do good to , but some people will suffer for it . ' 
` Indeed . 
Well , I see it 's not in our line . 
We are old-fashioned people ; we imagine that without principles , taken as you say on faith , there 's no taking a step , no breathing . 
Vous avez changé tout cela . 
God give you good health and the rank of a general , while we will be content to look on and admire , worthy ... what was it ? ' 
` Nihilists , ' Arkady said , speaking very distinctly . 
` Yes . 
There used to be Hegelists , and now there are nihilists . 
We shall see how you will exist in void , in vacuum ; and now ring , please , brother Nikolai Petrovitch ; it 's time I had my cocoa . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch rang the bell and called , ` Dunyasha ! ' 
But instead of Dunyasha , Fenitchka herself came on to the terrace . 
She was a young woman about three-and-twenty , with a white soft skin , dark hair and eyes , red , childishly-pouting lips , and little delicate hands . 
She wore a neat print dress ; a new blue kerchief lay lightly on her plump shoulders . 
She carried a large cup of cocoa , and setting it down before Pavel Petrovitch , she was overwhelmed with confusion : the hot blood rushed in a wave of crimson over the delicate skin of her pretty face . 
She dropped her eyes , and stood at the table , leaning a little on the very tips of her fingers . 
It seemed as though she were ashamed of having come in , and at the same time felt that she had a right to come . 
Pavel Petrovitch knitted his brows severely , while Nikolai Petrovitch looked embarrassed . 
` Good morning , Fenitchka , ' he muttered through his teeth . 
` Good morning , ' she replied in a voice not loud but resonant , and with a sidelong glance at Arkady , who gave her a friendly smile , she went gently away . 
She walked with a slightly rolling gait , but even that suited her . 
For some minutes silence reigned on the terrace . 
Pavel Petrovitch sipped his cocoa ; suddenly he raised his head . 
` Here is Sir Nihilist coming towards us , ' he said in an undertone . 
Bazarov was in fact approaching through the garden , stepping over the flower-beds . 
His linen coat and trousers were besmeared with mud ; clinging marsh weed was twined round the crown of his old round hat ; in his right hand he held a small bag ; in the bag something alive was moving . 
He quickly drew near the terrace , and said with a nod , ` Good morning , gentlemen ; sorry I was late for tea ; I 'll be back directly ; I must just put these captives away . ' 
` What have you there -- leeches ? ' 
asked Pavel Petrovitch . 
` No , frogs . ' 
` Do you eat them -- or keep them ? ' 
` For experiment , ' said Bazarov indifferently , and he went off into the house . 
` So he 's going to cut them up , ' observed Pavel Petrovitch . 
` He has no faith in principles , but he has faith in frogs . ' 
Arkady looked compassionately at his uncle ; Nikolai Petrovitch shrugged his shoulders stealthily . 
Pavel Petrovitch himself felt that his epigram was unsuccessful , and began to talk about husbandry and the new bailiff , who had come to him the evening before to complain that a labourer , Foma , ` was deboshed , ' and quite unmanageable . 
` He 's such an Æsop , ' he said among other things ; ` in all places he has protested himself a worthless fellow ; he 's not a man to keep his place ; he 'll walk off in a huff like a fool . ' 
Bazarov came back , sat down to the table , and began hastily drinking tea . 
The two brothers looked at him in silence , while Arkady stealthily watched first his father and then his uncle . 
` Did you walk far from here ? ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch asked at last . 
` Where you 've a little swamp near the aspen wood . 
I started some half-dozen snipe ; you might slaughter them ; Arkady . ' 
` Are n't you a sportsman then ? ' 
` No . ' 
` Is your special study physics ? ' 
Pavel Petrovitch in his turn inquired . 
` Physics , yes ; and natural science in general . ' 
` They say the Teutons of late have had great success in that line . ' 
` Yes ; the Germans are our teachers in it , ' Bazarov answered carelessly . 
The word Teutons instead of Germans , Pavel Petrovitch had used with ironical intention ; none noticed it however . 
` Have you such a high opinion of the Germans ? ' 
said Pavel Petrovitch , with exaggerated courtesy . 
He was beginning to feel a secret irritation . 
His aristocratic nature was revolted by Bazarov 's absolute nonchalance . 
This surgeon 's son was not only not overawed , he even gave abrupt and indifferent answers , and in the tone of his voice there was something churlish , almost insolent . 
` The scientific men there are a clever lot . ' 
` Ah , ah . 
To be sure , of Russian scientific men you have not such a flattering opinion , I dare say ? ' 
` That is very likely . ' 
` That 's very praiseworthy self-abnegation , ' Pavel Petrovitch declared , drawing himself up , and throwing his head back . 
` But how is this ? 
Arkady Nikolaitch was telling us just now that you accept no authorities ? 
Do n't you believe in them ? ' 
` And how am I accepting them ? 
And what am I to believe in ? 
They tell me the truth , I agree , that 's all . ' 
` And do all Germans tell the truth ? ' 
said Pavel Petrovitch , and his face assumed an expression as unsympathetic , as remote , as if he had withdrawn to some cloudy height . 
` Not all , ' replied Bazarov , with a short yawn . 
He obviously did not care to continue the discussion . 
Pavel Petrovitch glanced at Arkady , as though he would say to him , ` Your friend 's polite , I must say . ' 
` For my own part , ' he began again , not without some effort , ' I am so unregenerate as not to like Germans . 
Russian Germans I am not speaking of now ; we all know what sort of creatures they are . 
But even German Germans are not to my liking . 
In former days there were some here and there ; they had -- well , Schiller , to be sure , Goethe ... my brother -- he takes a particularly favourable view of them ... . 
But now they have all turned chemists and materialists ... ' ' A good chemist is twenty times as useful as any poet , ' broke in Bazarov . 
` Oh , indeed , ' commented Pavel Petrovitch , and , as though falling asleep , he faintly raised his eyebrows . 
` You do n't acknowledge art then , I suppose ? ' 
` The art of making money or of advertising pills ! ' 
cried Bazarov , with a contemptuous laugh . 
` Ah , ah . 
You are pleased to jest , I see . 
You reject all that , no doubt ? 
Granted . 
Then you believe in science only ? ' ' 
I have already explained to you that I do n't believe in anything ; and what is science -- science in the abstract ? 
There are sciences , as there are trades and crafts ; but abstract science does n't exist at all . ' 
` Very good . 
Well , and in regard to the other traditions accepted in human conduct , do you maintain the same negative attitude ? ' 
` What 's this , an examination ? ' 
asked Bazarov . 
Pavel Petrovitch turned slightly pale ... . 
Nikolai Petrovitch thought it his duty to interpose in the conversation . 
` We will converse on this subject with you more in detail some day , dear Yevgeny Vassilyitch ; we will hear your views , and express our own . 
For my part , I am heartily glad you are studying the natural sciences . 
I have heard that Liebig has made some wonderful discoveries in the amelioration of soils . 
You can be of assistance to me in my agricultural labours ; you can give me some useful advice . ' ' 
I am at your service , Nikolai Petrovitch ; but Liebig 's miles over our heads ! 
One has first to learn the a b c , and then begin to read , and we have n't set eyes on the alphabet yet . ' 
` You are certainly a nihilist , I see that , ' thought Nikolai Petrovitch . 
` Still , you will allow me to apply to you on occasion , ' he added aloud . 
` And now I fancy , brother , it 's time for us to be going to have a talk with the bailiff . ' 
Pavel Petrovitch got up from his seat . 
` Yes , ' he said , without looking at any one ; ` it 's a misfortune to live five years in the country like this , far from mighty intellects ! 
You turn into a fool directly . 
You may try not to forget what you 've been taught , but -- in a snap ! 
-- they 'll prove all that 's rubbish , and tell you that sensible men have nothing more to do with such foolishness , and that you , if you please , are an antiquated old fogey . 
What 's to be done ? 
Young people , of course , are cleverer than we are ! ' 
Pavel Petrovitch turned slowly on his heels , and slowly walked away ; Nikolai Petrovitch went after him . 
` Is he always like that ? ' 
Bazarov coolly inquired of Arkady directly the door had closed behind the two brothers . ' 
I must say , Yevgeny , you were n't nice to him , ' remarked Arkady . 
` You have hurt his feelings . ' 
` Well , am I going to consider them , these provincial aristocrats ! 
Why , it 's all vanity , dandy habits , fatuity . 
He should have continued his career in Petersburg , if that 's his bent . 
But there , enough of him ! 
I 've found a rather rare species of a water-beetle , Dytiscus marginatus ; do you know it ? 
I will show you . ' ' 
I promised to tell you his story , ' began Arkady . 
` The story of the beetle ? ' 
` Come , do n't , Yevgeny . 
The story of my uncle . 
You will see he 's not the sort of man you fancy . 
He deserves pity rather than ridicule . ' ' 
I do n't dispute it ; but why are you worrying over him ? ' 
` One ought to be just , Yevgeny . ' 
` How does that follow ? ' 
` No ; listen ... ' And Arkady told him his uncle 's story . 
The reader will find it in the following chapter . 
Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov was educated first at home , like his younger brother , and afterwards in the Corps of Pages . 
From childhood he was distinguished by remarkable beauty ; moreover he was self-confident , somewhat ironical , and had a rather biting humour ; he could not fail to please . 
He began to be seen everywhere , directly he had received his commission as an officer . 
He was much admired in society , and he indulged every whim , even every caprice and every folly , and gave himself airs , but that too was attractive in him . 
Women went out of their senses over him ; men called him a coxcomb , and were secretly jealous of him . 
He lived , as has been related already , in the same apartments as his brother , whom he loved sincerely , though he was not at all like him . 
Nikolai Petrovitch was a little lame , he had small , pleasing features of a rather melancholy cast , small , black eyes , and thin , soft hair ; he liked being lazy , but he also liked reading , and was timid in society . 
Pavel Petrovitch did not spend a single evening at home , prided himself on his ease and audacity -LRB- he was just bringing gymnastics into fashion among young men in society -RRB- , and had read in all some five or six French books . 
At twenty-eight he was already a captain ; a brilliant career awaited him . 
Suddenly everything was changed . 
At that time , there was sometimes seen in Petersburg society a woman who has even yet not been forgotten . 
Princess R -- . 
She had a well-educated , well-bred , but rather stupid husband , and no children . 
She used suddenly to go abroad , and suddenly return to Russia , and led an eccentric life in general . 
She had the reputation of being a frivolous coquette , abandoned herself eagerly to every sort of pleasure , danced to exhaustion , laughed and jested with young men , whom she received in the dim light of her drawing-room before dinner ; while at night she wept and prayed , found no peace in anything , and often paced her room till morning , wringing her hands in anguish , or sat , pale and chill , over a psalter . 
Day came , and she was transformed again into a grand lady ; again she went out , laughed , chattered , and simply flung herself headlong into anything which could afford her the slightest distraction . 
She was marvellously well-proportioned , her hair coloured like gold and heavy as gold hung below her knees , but no one would have called her a beauty ; in her whole face the only good point was her eyes , and even her eyes were not good -- they were grey , and not large -- but their glance was swift and deep , unconcerned to the point of audacity , and thoughtful to the point of melancholy -- an enigmatic glance . 
There was a light of something extraordinary in them , even while her tongue was lisping the emptiest of inanities . 
She dressed with elaborate care . 
Pavel Petrovitch met her at a ball , danced a mazurka with her , in the course of which she did not utter a single rational word , and fell passionately in love with her . 
Being accustomed to make conquests , in this instance , too , he soon attained his object , but his easy success did not damp his ardour . 
On the contrary , he was in still more torturing , still closer bondage to this woman , in whom , even at the very moment when she surrendered herself utterly , there seemed always something still mysterious and unattainable , to which none could penetrate . 
What was hidden in that soul -- God knows ! 
It seemed as though she were in the power of mysterious forces , incomprehensible even to herself ; they seemed to play on her at will ; her intellect was not powerful enough to master their caprices . 
Her whole behaviour presented a series of inconsistencies ; the only letters which could have awakened her husband 's just suspicions , she wrote to a man who was almost a stranger to her , whilst her love had always an element of melancholy ; with a man she had chosen as a lover , she ceased to laugh and to jest , she listened to him , and gazed at him with a look of bewilderment . 
Sometimes , for the most part suddenly , this bewilderment passed into chill horror ; her face took a wild , death-like expression ; she locked herself up in her bedroom , and her maid , putting her ear to the keyhole , could hear her smothered sobs . 
More than once , as he went home after a tender interview , Kirsanov felt within him that heartrending , bitter vexation which follows on a total failure . 
` What more do I want ? ' 
he asked himself , while his heart was heavy . 
He once gave her a ring with a sphinx engraved on the stone . 
` What 's that ? ' 
she asked ; ' a sphinx ? ' 
` Yes , ' he answered , ` and that sphinx is you . ' 
` I ? ' 
she queried , and slowly raising her enigmatical glance upon him . 
` Do you know that 's awfully flattering ? ' 
she added with a meaningless smile , while her eyes still kept the same strange look . 
Pavel Petrovitch suffered even while Princess R -- loved him ; but when she grew cold to him , and that happened rather quickly , he almost went out of his mind . 
He was on the rack , and he was jealous ; he gave her no peace , followed her about everywhere ; she grew sick of his pursuit of her , and she went abroad . 
He resigned his commission in spite of the entreaties of his friends and the exhortations of his superiors , and followed the princess ; four years he spent in foreign countries , at one time pursuing her , at another time intentionally losing sight of her . 
He was ashamed of himself , he was disgusted with his own lack of spirit ... but nothing availed . 
Her image , that incomprehensible , almost meaningless , but bewitching image , was deeply rooted in his heart . 
At Baden he once more regained his old footing with her ; it seemed as though she had never loved him so passionately ... but in a month it was all at an end : the flame flickered up for the last time and went out for ever . 
Foreseeing inevitable separation , he wanted at least to remain her friend , as though friendship with such a woman was possible ... . 
She secretly left Baden , and from that time steadily avoided Kirsanov . 
He returned to Russia , and tried to live his former life again ; but he could not get back into the old groove . 
He wandered from place to place like a man possessed ; he still went into society ; he still retained the habits of a man of the world ; he could boast of two or three fresh conquests ; but he no longer expected anything much of himself or of others , and he undertook nothing . 
He grew old and grey ; spending all his evenings at the club , jaundiced and bored , and arguing in bachelor society became a necessity for him -- a bad sign , as we all know . 
Marriage , of course , he did not even think of . 
Ten years passed in this way ; they passed by colourless and fruitless -- and quickly , fearfully quickly . 
Nowhere does time fly past as in Russia ; in prison they say it flies even faster . 
One day at dinner at the club , Pavel Petrovitch heard of the death of the Princess R -- . 
She had died at Paris in a state bordering on insanity . 
He got up from the table , and a long time he paced about the rooms of the club , or stood stockstill near the card-players , but he did not go home earlier than usual . 
Some time later he received a packet addressed to him ; in it was the ring he had given the princess . 
She had drawn lines in the shape of a cross over the sphinx and sent him word that the solution of the enigma -- was the cross . 
This happened at the beginning of the year 1848 , at the very time when Nikolai Petrovitch came to Petersburg , after the loss of his wife . 
Pavel Petrovitch had scarcely seen his brother since the latter had settled in the country ; the marriage of Nikolai Petrovitch had coincided with the very first days of Pavel Petrovitch 's acquaintance with the princess . 
When he came back from abroad , he had gone to him with the intention of staying a couple of months with him , in sympathetic enjoyment of his happiness , but he had only succeeded in standing a week of it . 
The difference in the positions of the two brothers was too great . 
In 1848 , this difference had grown less ; Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife , Pavel Petrovitch had lost his memories ; after the death of the princess he tried not to think of her . 
But to Nikolai , there remained the sense of a well-spent life , his son was growing up under his eyes ; Pavel , on the contrary , a solitary bachelor , was entering upon that indefinite twilight period of regrets that are akin to hopes , and hopes that are akin to regrets , when youth is over , while old age has not yet come . 
This time was harder for Pavel Petrovitch than for another man ; in losing his past , he lost everything . ' 
I will not invite you to Maryino now , ' Nikolai Petrovitch said to him one day , -LRB- he had called his property by that name in honour of his wife -RRB- ; ` you were dull there in my dear wife 's time , and now I think you would be bored to death . ' ' 
I was stupid and fidgety then , ' answered Pavel Petrovitch ; ` since then I have grown quieter , if not wiser . 
On the contrary , now , if you will let me , I am ready to settle with you for good . ' 
For all answer Nikolai Petrovitch embraced him ; but a year and a half passed after this conversation , before Pavel Petrovitch made up his mind to carry out his intention . 
When he was once settled in the country , however , he did not leave it , even during the three winters which Nikolai Petrovitch spent in Petersburg with his son . 
He began to read , chiefly English ; he arranged his whole life , roughly speaking , in the English style , rarely saw the neighbours , and only went out to the election of marshals , where he was generally silent , only occasionally annoying and alarming land-owners of the old school by his liberal sallies , and not associating with the representatives of the younger generation . 
Both the latter and the former considered him ` stuck up ' ; and both parties respected him for his fine aristocratic manners ; for his reputation for successes in love ; for the fact that he was very well dressed and always stayed in the best room in the best hotel ; for the fact that he generally dined well , and had once even dined with Wellington at Louis Philippe 's table ; for the fact that he always took everywhere with him a real silver dressing-case and a portable bath ; for the fact that he always smelt of some exceptionally ` good form ' scent ; for the fact that he played whist in masterly fashion , and always lost ; and lastly , they respected him also for his incorruptible honesty . 
Ladies considered him enchantingly romantic , but he did not cultivate ladies ' acquaintance ... ` So you see , Yevgeny , ' observed Arkady , as he finished his story , ` how unjustly you judge of my uncle ! 
To say nothing of his having more than once helped my father out of difficulties , given him all his money -- the property , perhaps you do n't know , was n't divided -- he 's glad to help any one , among other things he always sticks up for the peasants ; it 's true , when he talks to them he frowns and sniffs eau de cologne . ' 
... ` His nerves , no doubt , ' put in Bazarov . 
` Perhaps ; but his heart is very good . 
And he 's far from being stupid . 
What useful advice he has given me especially ... especially in regard to relations with women . ' 
` Aha ! 
a scalded dog fears cold water , we know that ! ' 
` In short , ' continued Arkady , ` he 's profoundly unhappy , believe me ; it 's a sin to despise him . ' 
` And who does despise him ? ' 
retorted Bazarov . 
` Still , I must say that a fellow who stakes his whole life on one card -- a woman 's love -- and when that card fails , turns sour , and lets himself go till he 's fit for nothing , is not a man , but a male . 
You say he 's unhappy ; you ought to know best ; to be sure , he 's not got rid of all his fads . 
I 'm convinced that he solemnly imagines himself a superior creature because he reads that wretched Galignani , and once a month saves a peasant from a flogging . ' 
` But remember his education , the age in which he grew up , ' observed Arkady . 
` Education ? ' 
broke in Bazarov . 
` Every man must educate himself , just as I 've done , for instance ... . 
And as for the age , why should I depend on it ? 
Let it rather depend on me . 
No , my dear fellow , that 's all shallowness , want of backbone ! 
And what stuff it all is , about these mysterious relations between a man and woman ? 
We physiologists know what these relations are . 
You study the anatomy of the eye ; where does the enigmatical glance you talk about come in there ? 
That 's all romantic , nonsensical , æsthetic rot . 
We had much better go and look at the beetle . ' 
And the two friends went off to Bazarov 's room , which was already pervaded by a sort of medico-surgical odour , mingled with the smell of cheap tobacco . 
Pavel Petrovitch did not long remain present at his brother 's interview with his bailiff , a tall , thin man with a sweet consumptive voice and knavish eyes , who to all Nikolai Petrovitch 's remarks answered , ` Certainly , sir , ' and tried to make the peasants out to be thieves and drunkards . 
The estate had only recently been put on to the new reformed system , and the new mechanism worked , creaking like an ungreased wheel , warping and cracking like homemade furniture of unseasoned wood . 
Nikolai Petrovitch did not lose heart , but often he sighed , and was gloomy ; he felt that the thing could not go on without money , and his money was almost all spent . 
Arkady had spoken the truth ; Pavel Petrovitch had more than once helped his brother ; more than once , seeing him struggling and cudgelling his brains , at a loss which way to turn , Pavel Petrovitch moved deliberately to the window , and with his hands thrust into his pockets , muttered between his teeth , ' mais je puis vous de l'argent , ' and gave him money ; but to-day he had none himself , and he preferred to go away . 
The petty details of agricultural management worried him ; besides , it constantly struck him that Nikolai Petrovitch , for all his zeal and industry , did not set about things in the right way , though he would not have been able to point out precisely where Nikolai Petrovitch 's mistake lay . 
` My brother 's not practical enough , ' he reasoned to himself ; ` they impose upon him . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch , on the other hand , had the highest opinion of Pavel Petrovitch 's practical ability , and always asked his advice . 
` I 'm a soft , weak fellow , I 've spent my life in the wilds , ' he used to say ; ` while you have n't seen so much of the world for nothing , you see through people ; you have an eagle eye . ' 
In answer to which Pavel Petrovitch only turned away , but did not contradict his brother . 
Leaving Nikolai Petrovitch in his study , he walked along the corridor , which separated the front part of the house from the back ; when he had reached a low door , he stopped in hesitation , then pulling his moustaches , he knocked at it . 
` Who 's there ? 
Come in , ' sounded Fenitchka 's voice . 
` It 's I , ' said Pavel Petrovitch , and he opened the door . 
Fenitchka jumped up from the chair on which she was sitting with her baby , and giving him into the arms of a girl , who at once carried him out of the room , she put straight her kerchief hastily . 
` Pardon me , if I disturb you , ' began Pavel Petrovitch , not looking at her ; ' I only wanted to ask you ... they are sending into the town to-day , I think ... please let them buy me some green tea . ' 
` Certainly , ' answered Fenitchka ; ` how much do you desire them to buy ? ' 
` Oh , half a pound will be enough , I imagine . 
You have made a change here , I see , ' he added , with a rapid glance round him , which glided over Fenitchka 's face too . 
` The curtains here , ' he explained , seeing she did not understand him . 
` Oh , yes , the curtains ; Nikolai Petrovitch was so good as to make me a present of them ; but they have been put up a long while now . ' 
` Yes , and it 's a long while since I have been to see you . 
Now it is very nice here . ' 
` Thanks to Nikolai Petrovitch 's kindness , ' murmured Fenitchka . 
` You are more comfortable here than in the little lodge you used to have ? ' 
inquired Pavel Petrovitch urbanely , but without the slightest smile . 
` Certainly , it 's more comfortable . ' 
` Who has been put in your place now ? ' 
` The laundry-maids are there now . ' 
` Ah ! ' 
Pavel Petrovitch was silent . 
` Now he is going , ' thought Fenitchka ; but he did not go , and she stood before him motionless . 
` What did you send your little one away for ? ' 
said Pavel Petrovitch at last . ' 
I love children ; let me see him . ' 
Fenitchka blushed all over with confusion and delight . 
She was afraid of Pavel Petrovitch ; he had scarcely ever spoken to her . 
` Dunyasha , ' she called ; ` will you bring Mitya , please . ' 
-LRB- Fenitchka did not treat any one in the house familiarly . -RRB- 
` But wait a minute , he must have a frock on , ' Fenitchka was going towards the door . 
` That does n't matter , ' remarked Pavel Petrovitch . ' 
I will be back directly , ' answered Fenitchka , and she went out quickly . 
Pavel Petrovitch was left alone , and he looked round this time with special attention . 
The small low-pitched room in which he found himself was very clean and snug . 
It smelt of the freshly painted floor and of camomile . 
Along the walls stood chairs with lyre-shaped backs , bought by the late general on his campaign in Poland ; in one corner was a little bedstead under a muslin canopy beside an iron-clamped chest with a convex lid . 
In the opposite corner a little lamp was burning before a big dark picture of St. Nikolai the wonder-worker ; a tiny porcelain egg hung by a red ribbon from the protruding gold halo down to the saint 's breast ; by the windows greenish glass jars of last year 's jam carefully tied down could be seen ; on their paper covers Fenitchka herself had written in big letters ` Gooseberry ' ; Nikolai Petrovitch was particularly fond of that preserve . 
On a long cord from the ceiling a cage hung with a short-tailed siskin in it ; he was constantly chirping and hopping about , the cage was constantly shaking and swinging , while hempseeds fell with a light tap on to the floor . 
On the wall just above a small chest of drawers hung some rather bad photographs of Nikolai Petrovitch in various attitudes , taken by an itinerant photographer ; there too hung a photograph of Fenitchka herself , which was an absolute failure ; it was an eyeless face wearing a forced smile , in a dingy frame , nothing more could be made out ; while above Fenitchka , General Yermolov , in a Circassian cloak , scowled menacingly upon the Caucasian mountains in the distance , from beneath a little silk shoe for pins which fell right on to his brows . 
Five minutes passed ; bustling and whispering could be heard in the next room . 
Pavel Petrovitch took up from the chest of drawers a greasy book , an odd volume of Masalsky 's Musketeer , and turned over a few pages ... . 
The door opened , and Fenitchka came in with Mitya in her arms . 
She had put on him a little red smock with embroidery on the collar , had combed his hair and washed his face ; he was breathing heavily , his whole body working , and his little hands waving in the air , as is the way with all healthy babies ; but his smart smock obviously impressed him , an expression of delight was reflected in every part of his little fat person . 
Fenitchka had put her own hair too in order , and had arranged her kerchief ; but she might well have remained as she was . 
And really is there anything in the world more captivating than a beautiful young mother with a healthy baby in her arms ? 
` What a chubby fellow ! ' 
said Pavel Petrovitch graciously , and he tickled Mitya 's little double chin with the tapering nail of his forefinger . 
The baby stared at the siskin , and chuckled . 
` That 's uncle , ' said Fenitchka , bending her face down to him and slightly rocking him , while Dunyasha quietly set in the window a smouldering perfumed stick , putting a halfpenny under it . 
` How many months old is he ? ' 
asked Pavel Petrovitch . 
` Six months ; it will soon be seven , on the eleventh . ' 
` Is n't it eight , Fedosya Nikolaevna ? ' 
put in Dunyasha , with some timidity . 
` No , seven ; what an idea ! ' 
The baby chuckled again , stared at the chest , and suddenly caught hold of his mother 's nose and mouth with all his five little fingers . 
` Saucy mite , ' said Fenitchka , not drawing her face away . 
` He 's like my brother , ' observed Pavel Petrovitch . 
` Who else should he be like ? ' 
thought Fenitchka . 
` Yes , ' continued Pavel Petrovitch , as though speaking to himself ; ` there 's an unmistakable likeness . ' 
He looked attentively , almost mournfully , at Fenitchka . 
` That 's uncle , ' she repeated , in a whisper this time . 
` Ah ! 
Pavel ! 
so you 're here ! ' 
was heard suddenly the voice of Nikolai Petrovitch . 
Pavel Petrovitch turned hurriedly round , frowning ; but his brother looked at him with such delight , such gratitude , that he could not help responding to his smile . 
` You 've a splendid little cherub , ' he said , and looking at his watch , ' I came in here to speak about some tea . ' 
And , assuming an expression of indifference , Pavel Petrovitch at once went out of the room . 
` Did he come of himself ? ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch asked Fenitchka . 
` Yes ; he knocked and came in . ' 
` Well , and has Arkasha been in to see you again ? ' 
` No . 
Had n't I better move into the lodge , Nikolai Petrovitch ? ' 
` Why so ? ' ' 
I wonder whether it would n't be best just for the first . ' 
'N ... no , ' Nikolai Petrovitch brought out hesitatingly , rubbing his forehead . 
` We ought to have done it before ... . 
How are you , fatty ? ' 
he said , suddenly brightening , and going up to the baby , he kissed him on the cheek ; then he bent a little and pressed his lips to Fenitchka 's hand , which lay white as milk upon Mitya 's little red smock . 
` Nikolai Petrovitch ! 
what are you doing ? ' 
she whispered , dropping her eyes , then slowly raising them . 
Very charming was the expression of her eyes when she peeped , as it were , from under her lids , and smiled tenderly and a little foolishly . 
Nikolai Petrovitch had made Fenitchka 's acquaintance in the following manner . 
He had once happened three years before to stay a night at an inn in a remote district town . 
He was agreeably struck by the cleanness of the room assigned to him , the freshness of the bed-linen . 
Surely the woman of the house must be a German ? 
was the idea that occurred to him ; but she proved to be a Russian , a woman of about fifty , neatly dressed , of a good-looking , sensible countenance and discreet speech . 
He entered into conversation with her at tea ; he liked her very much . 
Nikolai Petrovitch had at that time only just moved into his new home , and not wishing to keep serfs in the house , he was on the look-out for wage-servants ; the woman of the inn on her side complained of the small number of visitors to the town , and the hard times ; he proposed to her to come into his house in the capacity of housekeeper ; she consented . 
Her husband had long been dead , leaving her an only daughter , Fenitchka . 
Within a fortnight Arina Savishna -LRB- that was the new housekeeper 's name -RRB- arrived with her daughter at Maryino and installed herself in the little lodge . 
Nikolai Petrovitch 's choice proved a successful one . 
Arina brought order into the household . 
As for Fenitchka , who was at that time seventeen , no one spoke of her , and scarcely any one saw her ; she lived quietly and sedately , and only on Sundays Nikolai Petrovitch noticed in the church somewhere in a side place the delicate profile of her white face . 
More than a year passed thus . 
One morning , Arina came into his study , and bowing low as usual , she asked him if he could do anything for her daughter , who had got a spark from the stove in her eye . 
Nikolai Petrovitch , like all stay-at-home people , had studied doctoring and even compiled a homoeopathic guide . 
He at once told Arina to bring the patient to him . 
Fenitchka was much frightened when she heard the master had sent for her ; however , she followed her mother . 
Nikolai Petrovitch led her to the window and took her head in his two hands . 
After thoroughly examining her red and swollen eye , he prescribed a fomentation , which he made up himself at once , and tearing his handkerchief in pieces , he showed her how it ought to be applied . 
Fenitchka listened to all he had to say , and then was going . 
` Kiss the master 's hand , silly girl , ' said Arina . 
Nikolai Petrovitch did not give her his hand , and in confusion himself kissed her bent head on the parting of her hair . 
Fenitchka 's eye was soon well again , but the impression she had made on Nikolai Petrovitch did not pass away so quickly . 
He was for ever haunted by that pure , delicate , timidly raised face ; he felt on the palms of his hands that soft hair , and saw those innocent , slightly parted lips , through which pearly teeth gleamed with moist brilliance in the sunshine . 
He began to watch her with great attention in church , and tried to get into conversation with her . 
At first she was shy of him , and one day meeting him at the approach of evening in a narrow footpath through a field of rye , she ran into the tall thick rye , overgrown with cornflowers and wormwood , so as not to meet him face to face . 
He caught sight of her little head through a golden network of ears of rye , from which she was peeping out like a little animal , and called affectionately to her -- ` Good-evening , Fenitchka ! 
I do n't bite . ' 
` Good-evening , ' she whispered , not coming out of her ambush . 
By degrees she began to be more at home with him , but was still shy in his presence , when suddenly her mother , Arina , died of cholera . 
What was to become of Fenitchka ? 
She inherited from her mother a love for order , regularity , and respectability ; but she was so young , so alone . 
Nikolai Petrovitch was himself so good and considerate ... . 
It 's needless to relate the rest ... ` So my brother came in to see you ? ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch questioned her . 
` He knocked and came in ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
` Well , that 's a good thing .
