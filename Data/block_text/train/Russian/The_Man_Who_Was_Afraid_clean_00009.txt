He has provided himself with machines and thinks it is good ! 
While the machine is the devil 's trap for you . 
He thus catches you in it . 
While toiling , you find no time for sin , but having a machine -- you have freedom . 
Freedom kills a man , even as the sunbeams kill the worm , the dweller of the depth of earth . 
Freedom kills man ! '' 
And pronouncing his words distinctly and positively , the old Anany struck the table four times with his finger . 
His face beamed triumphantly , his chest rose high , and over it the silver hair of his beard shook noiselessly . 
Dread fell on Foma as he looked at him and listened to his words , for there was a ring of firm faith in them , and it was the power of this faith that confused Foma . 
He had already forgotten all he knew about the old man , all of which he had but a while ago believed to be true . 
`` Whoever gives freedom to his body , kills his soul ! '' 
said Anany , looking at Foma so strangely as if he saw behind him somebody , who was grieved and frightened by his words ; and whose fear and pain delighted him . 
`` All you people of today will perish through freedom . 
The devil has captured you -- he has taken toil away from you , and slipped machines and telegrams into your hands . 
How freedom eats into the souls of men ! 
Just tell me , why are the children worse than their fathers ? 
Because of their freedom , yes . 
That 's why they drink and lead depraved lives with women . 
They have less strength because they have less work , and they have not the spirit of cheerfulness because they have no worries . 
Cheerfulness comes in time of rest , while nowadays no one is getting tired . '' 
`` Well , '' said Foma , softly , `` they were leading depraved lives and drinking just as much in former days as now , I suppose . '' 
`` Do you know it ? 
You should keep silence ! '' 
cried Anany , flashing his eyes sternly . 
`` In former days man had more strength , and the sins were according to his strength . 
While you , of today , have less strength , and more sins , and your sins are more disgusting . 
Then men were like oak-trees . 
And God 's judgment will also be in accordance with their strength . 
Their bodies will be weighed , and angels will measure their blood , and the angels of God will see that the weight of the sins does not exceed the weight of the body and the blood . 
Do you understand ? 
God will not condemn the wolf for devouring a sheep , but if a miserable rat should be guilty of the sheep 's death , God will condemn the rat ! '' 
`` How can a man tell how God will judge man ? '' 
asked Foma , thoughtfully . 
`` A visible trial is necessary . '' 
`` Why a visible trial ? '' 
`` That people might understand . '' 
`` Who , but the Lord , is my judge ? '' 
Foma glanced at the old man and lowering his head , became silent . 
He again recalled the fugitive convict , who was killed and burnt by Shchurov , and again he believed that it really was so . 
And the women -- his wives and his mistresses -- had surely been hastened toward their graves by this old man 's caresses ; he had crushed them with his bony chest , drunk the sap of their life with these thick lips of his which were scarlet yet from the clotted blood of the women , who died in the embraces of his long sinewy arms . 
And now , awaiting death , which was already somewhere beside him , he counts his sins , judges others , and perhaps judges himself , and says : `` Who , but the Lord , is my judge ? '' 
`` Is he afraid or not ? '' 
Foma asked himself and became pensive , stealthily scrutinising the old man . 
`` Yes , my lad ! 
Think , '' spoke Shchurov , shaking his head , `` think , how you are to live . 
The capital in your heart is small , and your habits are great , see that you are not reduced to bankruptcy before your own self ! 
Ho-ho-ho ! '' 
`` How can you tell what and how much I have within my heart ? '' 
said Foma , gloomily , offended by his laughter . 
`` I can see it ! 
I know everything , because I have lived long ! 
Oh-ho-ho ! 
How long I have lived ! 
Trees have grown up and been cut down , and houses built out of them , and even the houses have grown old . 
While I have seen all this and am still alive , and when , at times , I recall my life , I think , ` Is it possible that one man could accomplish so much ? 
Is it possible that I have witnessed all this ? ' '' 
The old man glanced at Foma sternly , shook his head and became silent . 
It became quiet . 
Outside the window something was softly rustling on the roof of the house ; the rattle of wheels and the muffled sounds of conversation were heard from below , from the street . 
The samovar on the table sang a sad tune . 
Shchurov was fixedly staring into his glass of tea , stroking his beard , and one could hear that something rattled in his breast , as if some burden was turning about in it . 
`` It 's hard for you to live without your father , is n't it ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am getting used to it , '' replied Foma . 
`` You are rich , and when Yakov dies , you will be richer still . 
He 'll leave everything to you . '' 
`` I do n't need it . '' 
`` To whom else should he leave it ? 
He has but one daughter , and you ought to marry that daughter , and that she is your godsister and foster-sister -- no matter ! 
That can be arranged -- and then you would be married . 
What good is there in the life you are now leading ? 
I suppose you are forever running about with the girls ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` You do n't say ! 
Eh , eh , eh ! 
the merchant is passing away . 
A certain forester told me -- I do n't know whether he lied or not -- that in former days the dogs were wolves , and then degenerated into dogs . 
It is the same with our calling ; we will soon also be dogs . 
We will take up science , put stylish hats on our heads , we 'll do everything that is necessary in order to lose our features , and there will be nothing by which to distinguish us from other people . 
It has become a custom to make Gymnasium students of all children . 
The merchants , the nobles , the commoners -- all are adjusted to match the same colour . 
They dress them in gray and teach them all the same subjects . 
They grow man even as they grow a tree . 
Why do they do it ? 
No one knows . 
Even a log could be told from another by its knot at least , while here they want to plane the people over so that all of them should look alike . 
The coffin is already waiting for us old people . 
Ye-es ! 
It may be that about fifty years hence , no one will believe that I lived in this world . 
I , Anany , the son of Savva , by the surname of Shchurov . 
So ! 
And that I , Anany , feared no one , save God . 
And that in my youth I was a peasant , that all the land I possessed then was two desyatins and a quarter ; while toward my old age I have hoarded up eleven thousand desyatins , all forests , and perhaps two millions in cash . '' 
`` There , they always speak of money ! '' 
said Foma , with dissatisfaction . 
`` What joy does man derive from money ? '' 
`` Mm , '' bellowed Shchurov . 
`` You will make a poor merchant , if you do not understand the power of money . '' 
`` Who does understand it ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` I ! '' 
said Shchurov , with confidence . 
`` And every clever man . 
Yashka understands it . 
Money ? 
That is a great deal , my lad ! 
Just spread it out before you and think , ` What does it contain ? ' 
Then will you know that all this is human strength , human mind . 
Thousands of people have put their life into your money and thousands more will do it . 
And you can throw it all into the fire and see how the money is burning , and at that moment you will consider yourself master . '' 
`` But nobody does this . '' 
`` Because fools have no money . 
Money is invested in business . 
Business gives bread to the masses . 
And you are master over all those masses . 
Wherefore did God create man ? 
That man should pray to Him . 
He was alone and He felt lonesome , so He began to desire power , and as man was created in the image of the Lord , man also desires power . 
And what , save money , can give power ? 
That 's the way . 
Well , and you -- have you brought me money ? '' 
`` No , '' answered Foma . 
From the words of the old man Foma 's head was heavy and troubled , and he was glad that the conversation had , at last , turned to business matters . 
`` That is n't right , '' said Shchurov , sternly knitting his brow . 
`` It is overdue -- you must pay . 
`` You 'll get a half of it tomorrow . '' 
`` Why a half ? 
Why not all ? '' 
`` We are badly in need of money now . '' 
`` And have n't you any ? 
But I also need it . '' 
`` Wait a little . '' 
`` Eh , my lad , I will not wait ! 
You are not your father . 
Youngsters like you , milksops , are an unreliable lot . 
In a month you may break up the whole business . 
And I would be the loser for it . 
You give me all the money tomorrow , or I 'll protest the notes . 
It would n't take me long to do it ! '' 
Foma looked at Shchurov , with astonishment . 
It was not at all that same old man , who but a moment ago spoke so sagaciously about the devil . 
Then his face and his eyes seemed different , and now he looked fierce , his lips smiled pitilessly , and the veins on his cheeks , near his nostrils , were eagerly trembling . 
Foma saw that if he did not pay him at once , Shchurov would indeed not spare him and would dishonour the firm by protesting the notes . 
`` Evidently business is poor ? '' 
grinned Shchurov . 
`` Well , tell the truth -- where have you squandered your father 's money ? '' 
Foma wanted to test the old man : `` Business is none too brisk , '' said he , with a frown . 
`` We have no contracts . 
We have received no earnest money , and so it is rather hard . '' 
`` So-o ! 
Shall I help you out ? '' 
`` Be so kind . 
Postpone the day of payment , '' begged Foma , modestly lowering his eyes . 
`` Mm . 
Shall I assist you out of my friendship for your father ? 
Well , be it so , I 'll do it . '' 
`` And for how long will you postpone it ? '' 
inquired Foma . 
`` For six months . '' 
`` I thank you humbly . '' 
`` Do n't mention it . 
You owe me eleven thousand six hundred roubles . 
Now listen : rewrite the notes for the amount of fifteen thousand , pay me the interest on this sum in advance . 
And as security I 'll take a mortgage on your two barges . '' 
Foma rose from the chair and said , with a smile : `` Send me the notes tomorrow . 
I 'll pay you in full . '' 
Shchurov also rose from his chair and , without lowering his eyes at Foma 's sarcastic look , said , calmly scratching his chest : `` That 's all right . '' 
`` Thank you for your kindness . '' 
`` That 's nothing ! 
You do n't give me a chance , or I would have shown you my kindness ! '' 
said the old man lazily , showing his teeth . 
`` Yes ! 
If one should fall into your hands -- '' `` He 'd find it warm -- '' `` I am sure you 'd make it warm for him . '' 
`` Well , my lad , that will do ! '' 
said Shchurov , sternly . 
`` Though you consider yourself quite clever , it is rather too soon . 
You 've gained nothing , and already you began to boast ! 
But you just win from me -- then you may shout for joy . 
Goodbye . 
Have all the money for tomorrow . '' 
`` Do n't let that trouble you . 
Goodbye ! '' 
`` God be with you ! '' 
When Foma came out of the room he heard that the old man gave a slow , loud yawn , and then began to hum in a rather hoarse bass : `` Open for us the doors of mercy . 
Oh blessed Virgin Mary ! '' 
Foma carried away with him from the old man a double feeling . 
Shchurov pleased him and at the same time was repulsive to him . 
He recalled the old man 's words about sin , thought of the power of his faith in the mercy of the Lord , and the old man aroused in Foma a feeling akin to respect . 
`` He , too , speaks of life ; he knows his sins ; but does not weep over them , does not complain of them . 
He has sinned -- and he is willing to stand the consequences . 
Yes . 
And she ? '' 
He recalled Medinskaya , and his heart contracted with pain . 
`` And she is repenting . 
It is hard to tell whether she does it purposely , in order to hide from justice , or whether her heart is really aching . 
` Who , but the Lord , ' says he , ` is to judge me ? ' 
That 's how it is . '' 
It seemed to Foma that he envied Anany , and the youth hastened to recall Shchurov 's attempts to swindle him . 
This called forth in him an aversion for the old man He could not reconcile his feelings and , perplexed , he smiled . 
`` Well , I have just been at Shchurov 's , '' he said , coming to Mayakin and seating himself by the table . 
Mayakin , in a greasy morning-gown , a counting-board in his hand , began to move about in his leather-covered arm-chair impatiently , and said with animation : `` Pour out some tea for him , Lubava ! 
Tell me , Foma , I must be in the City Council at nine o'clock ; tell me all about it , make haste ! '' 
Smiling , Foma related to him how Shchurov suggested to rewrite the notes . 
`` Eh ! '' 
exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich regretfully , with a shake of the head . 
`` You 've spoilt the whole mass for me , dear ! 
How could you be so straightforward in your dealings with the man ? 
Psha ! 
The devil drove me to send you there ! 
I should have gone myself . 
I would have turned him around my finger ! '' 
`` Hardly ! 
He says , ' I am an oak . ' '' 
`` An oak ? 
And I am a saw . 
An oak ! 
An oak is a good tree , but its fruits are good for swine only . 
So it comes out that an oak is simply a blockhead . '' 
`` But it 's all the same , we have to pay , anyway . '' 
`` Clever people are in no hurry about this ; while you are ready to run as fast as you can to pay the money . 
What a merchant you are ! '' 
Yakov Tarasovich was positively dissatisfied with his godson . 
He frowned and in an angry manner ordered his daughter , who was silently pouring out tea : `` Push the sugar nearer to me . 
Do n't you see that I ca n't reach it ? '' 
Lubov 's face was pale , her eyes seemed troubled , and her hands moved lazily and awkwardly . 
Foma looked at her and thought : `` How meek she is in the presence of her father . '' 
`` What did he speak to you about ? '' 
asked Mayakin . 
`` About sins . '' 
`` Well , of course ! 
His own affair is dearest to each and every man . 
And he is a manufacturer of sins . 
Both in the galleys and in hell they have long been weeping and longing for him , waiting for him impatiently . '' 
`` He speaks with weight , '' said Foma , thoughtfully , stirring his tea . 
`` Did he abuse me ? '' 
inquired Mayakin , with a malicious grimace . 
`` Somewhat . '' 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
`` I listened . '' 
`` Mm ! 
And what did you hear ? '' '' 
` The strong , ' he says , ` will be forgiven ; but there is no forgiveness for the weak . ' '' 
`` Just think of it ! 
What wisdom ! 
Even the fleas know that . '' 
For some reason or another , the contempt with which Mayakin regarded Shchurov , irritated Foma , and , looking into the old man 's face , he said with a grin : `` But he does n't like you . '' 
`` Nobody likes me , my dear , '' said Mayakin , proudly . 
`` There is no reason why they should like me . 
I am no girl . 
But they respect me . 
And they respect only those they fear . '' 
And the old man winked at his godson boastfully . 
`` He speaks with weight , '' repeated Foma . 
`` He is complaining . 
` The real merchant , ' says he , ` is passing away . 
All people are taught the same thing , ' he says : ` so that all may be equal , looking alike . '' ' 
`` Does he consider it wrong ? '' 
`` Evidently so . '' 
`` Fo-o-o-l ! '' 
Mayakin drawled out , with contempt . 
`` Why ? 
Is it good ? '' 
asked Foma , looking at his godfather suspiciously . 
`` We do not know what is good ; but we can see what is wise . 
When we see that all sorts of people are driven together in one place and are all inspired there with one and the same idea -- then must we acknowledge that it is wise . 
Because -- what is a man in the empire ? 
Nothing more than a simple brick , and all bricks must be of the same size . 
Do you understand ? 
And those people that are of equal height and weight -- I can place in any position I like . '' 
`` And whom does it please to be a brick ? '' 
said Foma , morosely . 
`` It is not a question of pleasing , it is a matter of fact . 
If you are made of hard material , they can not plane you . 
It is not everybody 's phiz that you can rub off . 
But some people , when beaten with a hammer , turn into gold . 
And if the head happens to crack -- what can you do ? 
It merely shows it was weak . '' 
`` He also spoke about toil . 
` Everything , ' he says , ` is done by machinery , and thus are men spoiled . '' ' 
`` He is out of his wits ! '' 
Mayakin waved his hand disdainfully . 
`` I am surprised , what an appetite you have for all sorts of nonsense ! 
What does it come from ? '' 
`` Is n't that true , either ? '' 
asked Foma , breaking into stern laughter . 
`` What true thing can he know ? 
A machine ! 
The old blockhead should have thought -- ` what is the machine made of ? ' 
Of iron ! 
Consequently , it need not be pitied ; it is wound up -- and it forges roubles for you . 
Without any words , without trouble , you set it into motion and it revolves . 
While a man , he is uneasy and wretched ; he is often very wretched . 
He wails , grieves , weeps , begs . 
Sometimes he gets drunk . 
Ah , how much there is in him that is superfluous to me ! 
While a machine is like an arshin -LRB- yardstick -RRB- , it contains exactly so much as the work required . 
Well , I am going to dress . 
It is time . '' 
He rose and went away , loudly scraping with his slippers along the floor . 
Foma glanced after him and said softly , with a frown : `` The devil himself could not see through all this . 
One says this , the other , that . '' 
`` It is precisely the same with books , '' said Lubov in a low voice . 
Foma looked at her , smiling good-naturedly . 
And she answered him with a vague smile . 
Her eyes looked fatigued and sad . 
`` You still keep on reading ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Yes , '' the girl answered sadly . 
`` And are you still lonesome ? '' 
`` I feel disgusted , because I am alone . 
There 's no one here to say a word to . '' 
`` That 's bad . '' 
She said nothing to this , but , lowering her head , she slowly began to finger the fringes of the towel . 
`` You ought to get married , '' said Foma , feeling that he pitied her . 
`` Leave me alone , please , '' answered Lubov , wrinkling her forehead . 
`` Why leave you alone ? 
You will get married , I am sure . '' 
`` There ! '' 
exclaimed the girl softly , with a sigh . 
`` That 's just what I am thinking of -- it is necessary . 
That is , I 'll have to get married . 
But how ? 
Do you know , I feel now as though a mist stood between other people and myself -- a thick , thick mist ! '' 
`` That 's from your books , '' Foma interposed confidently . 
`` Wait ! 
And I cease to understand what is going on about me . 
Nothing pleases me . 
Everything has become strange to me . 
Nothing is as it should be . 
Everything is wrong . 
I see it . 
I understand it , yet I can not say that it is wrong , and why it is so . '' 
`` It is not so , not so , '' muttered Foma . 
`` That 's from your books . 
Yes . 
Although I also feel that it 's wrong . 
Perhaps that is because we are so young and foolish . '' 
`` At first it seemed to me , '' said Lubov , not listening to him , `` that everything in the books was clear to me . 
But now -- '' `` Drop your books , '' suggested Foma , with contempt . 
`` Ah , do n't say that ! 
How can I drop them ? 
You know how many different ideas there are in the world ! 
O Lord ! 
They 're such ideas that set your head afire . 
According to a certain book everything that exists on earth is rational . '' 
`` Everything ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Everything ! 
While another book says the contrary is true . '' 
`` Wait ! 
Now is n't this nonsense ? '' 
`` What were you discussing ? '' 
asked Mayakin , appearing at the door , in a long frock-coat and with several medals on his collar and his breast . 
`` Just so , '' said Lubov , morosely . 
`` We spoke about books , '' added Foma . 
`` What kind of books ? '' 
`` The books she is reading . 
She read that everything on earth is rational . '' 
`` Really ! '' 
`` Well , and I say it is a lie ! '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Yakov Tarasovich became thoughtful , he pinched his beard and winked his eyes a little . 
`` What kind of a book is it ? '' 
he asked his daughter , after a pause . 
`` A little yellow-covered book , '' said Lubov , unwillingly . 
`` Just put that book on my table . 
That is said not without reflection -- everything on earth is rational ! 
See someone thought of it . 
Yes . 
It is even very cleverly expressed . 
And were it not for the fools , it might have been perfectly correct . 
But as fools are always in the wrong place , it can not be said that everything on earth is rational . 
And yet , I 'll look at the book . 
Maybe there is common sense in it . 
Goodbye , Foma ! 
Will you stay here , or do you want to drive with me ? '' 
`` I 'll stay here a little longer . '' 
`` Very well . '' 
Lubov and Foma again remained alone . 
`` What a man your father is , '' said Foma , nodding his head toward the direction of his godfather . 
`` Well , what kind of a man do you think he is ? '' 
`` He retorts every call , and wants to cover everything with his words . '' 
`` Yes , he is clever . 
And yet he does not understand how painful my life is , '' said Lubov , sadly . 
`` Neither do I understand it . 
You imagine too much . '' 
`` What do I imagine ? '' 
cried the girl , irritated . 
`` Why , all these are not your own ideas . 
They are someone else 's . '' 
`` Someone else 's . 
Someone else 's . '' 
She felt like saying something harsh ; but broke down and became silent . 
Foma looked at her and , setting Medinskaya by her side , thought sadly : `` How different everything is -- both men and women -- and you never feel alike . '' 
They sat opposite each other ; both were lost in thought , and neither one looked at the other . 
It was getting dark outside , and in the room it was quite dark already . 
The wind was shaking the linden-trees , and their branches seemed to clutch at the walls of the house , as though they felt cold and implored for shelter in the rooms . 
`` Luba ! '' 
said Foma , softly . 
She raised her head and looked at him . 
`` Do you know , I have quarrelled with Medinskaya . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
asked Luba , brightening up . 
`` So . 
It came about that she offended me . 
Yes , she offended me . '' 
`` Well , it 's good that you 've quarrelled with her , '' said the girl , approvingly , `` for she would have turned your head . 
She is a vile creature ; she is a coquette , even worse than that . 
Oh , what things I know about her ! '' 
`` She 's not at all a vile creature , '' said Foma , morosely . 
`` And you do n't know anything about her . 
You are all lying ! '' 
`` Oh , I beg your pardon ! '' 
`` No . 
See here , Luba , '' said Foma , softly , in a beseeching tone , `` do n't speak ill of her in my presence . 
It is n't necessary . 
I know everything . 
By God ! 
She told me everything herself . '' 
`` Herself ! '' 
exclaimed Luba , in astonishment . 
`` What a strange woman she is ! 
What did she tell you ? '' 
`` That she is guilty , '' Foma ejaculated with difficulty , with a wry smile . 
`` Is that all ? '' 
There was a ring of disappointment in the girl 's question ; Foma heard it and asked hopefully : `` Is n't that enough ? '' 
`` What will you do now ? '' 
`` That 's just what I am thinking about . '' 
`` Do you love her very much ? '' 
Foma was silent . 
He looked into the window and answered confusedly : `` I do n't know . 
But it seems to me that now I love her more than before . '' 
`` Than before the quarrel ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I wonder how one can love such a woman ! '' 
said the girl , shrugging her shoulders . 
`` Love such a woman ? 
Of course ! 
Why not ? '' 
exclaimed Foma . 
`` I ca n't understand it . 
I think , you have become attached to her just because you have not met a better woman . '' 
`` No , I have not met a better one ! '' 
Foma assented , and after a moment 's silence said shyly , `` Perhaps there is none better . '' 
`` Among our people , '' Lubov interposed . 
`` I need her very badly ! 
Because , you see , I feel ashamed before her . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Oh , in general , I fear her ; that is , I would not want her to think ill of me , as of others . 
Sometimes I feel disgusted . 
I think -- would n't it be a great idea to go out on such a spree that all my veins would start tingling . 
And then I recall her and I do not venture . 
And so everything else , I think of her , ` What if she finds it out ? ' 
and I am afraid to do it . '' 
`` Yes , '' the girl drawled out thoughtfully , `` that shows that you love her . 
I would also be like this . 
If I loved , I would think of him -- of what he might say ... '' `` And everything about her is so peculiar , '' Foma related softly . 
`` She speaks in a way all her own . 
And , God ! 
How beautiful she is ! 
And then she is so small , like a child . '' 
`` And what took place between you ? '' 
asked Lubov . 
Foma moved his chair closer to her , and stooping , he lowered his voice for some reason or other , and began to relate to her all that had taken place between him and Medinskaya . 
He spoke , and as he recalled the words he said to Medinskaya , the sentiments that called forth the words were also awakened in him . 
`` I told her , ` Oh , you ! 
why did you make sport of me ? ' '' 
he said angrily and with reproach . 
And Luba , her cheeks aflame with animation , spurred him on , nodding her head approvingly : `` That 's it ! 
That 's good ! 
Well , and she ? '' 
`` She was silent ! '' 
said Foma , sadly , with a shrug of the shoulders . 
`` That is , she said different things ; but what 's the use ? '' 
He waved his hand and became silent . 
Luba , playing with her braid , was also silent . 
The samovar had already become cold . 
And the dimness in the room was growing thicker and thicker , outside the window it was heavy with darkness , and the black branches of the linden-trees were shaking pensively . 
`` You might light the lamp , '' Foma went on . 
`` How unhappy we both are , '' said Luba , with a sigh . 
Foma did not like this . 
`` I am not unhappy , '' he objected in a firm voice . 
`` I am simply -- not yet accustomed to life . '' 
`` He who knows not what he is going to do tomorrow , is unhappy , '' said Luba , sadly . 
`` I do not know it , neither do you . 
Whither go ? 
Yet go we must , Why is it that my heart is never at ease ? 
Some kind of a longing is always quivering within it . '' 
`` It is the same with me , '' said Foma . 
`` I start to reflect , but on what ? 
I can not make it clear to myself . 
There is also a painful gnawing in my heart . 
Eh ! 
But I must go up to the club . '' 
`` Do n't go away , '' Luba entreated . 
`` I must . 
Somebody is waiting there for me . 
I am going . 
Goodbye ! '' 
`` Till we meet again ! ''
