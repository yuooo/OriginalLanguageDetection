Crabs eat them . 
They like them . '' 
Foma 's fright was melting , from the heat of his father 's body , but before his eyes the terrible sneering face was still rocking in the black water . 
`` And who is he ? '' 
`` God knows ! 
Say to God about him : ` Oh Lord , rest his soul ! ' '' 
`` Lord , rest his soul ! '' 
repeated Foma , in a whisper . 
`` That 's right . 
Sleep now , do n't fear . 
He is far away now ! 
Floating on . 
See here , be careful as you go up to the side of the ship . 
You may fall overboard . 
God forbid ! 
And -- '' `` Did he fall overboard ? '' 
`` Of course . 
Perhaps he was drunk , and that 's his end ! 
And maybe he threw himself into the water . 
There are people who do that . 
They go and throw themselves into the water and are drowned . 
Life , my dear , is so arranged that death is sometimes a holiday for one , sometimes it is a blessing for all . '' 
`` Papa . '' 
`` Sleep , sleep , dear . '' 
DURING the very first day of his school life , stupefied by the lively and hearty noise of provoking mischiefs and of wild , childish games , Foma picked out two boys from the crowd who at once seemed more interesting to him than the others . 
One had a seat in front of him . 
Foma , looking askance , saw a broad back ; a full neck , covered with freckles ; big ears ; and the back of the head closely cropped , covered with light-red hair which stood out like bristles . 
When the teacher , a bald-headed man , whose lower lip hung down , called out : `` Smolin , African ! '' 
the red-headed boy arose slowly , walked up to the teacher , calmly stared into his face , and , having listened to the problem , carefully began to make big round figures on the blackboard with chalk . 
`` Good enough ! '' 
said the teacher . 
`` Yozhov , Nicolai . 
Proceed ! '' 
One of Foma 's neighbours , a fidgety little boy with black little mouse-eyes , jumped up from his seat and passed through the aisle , striking against everything and turning his head on all sides . 
At the blackboard he seized the chalk , and , standing up on the toes of his boots , noisily began to mark the board with the chalk , creaking and filling with chalk dust , dashing off small , illegible marks . 
`` Not so loud ! '' 
said the teacher , wrinkling his yellow face and contracting his fatigued eyes . 
Yozhov spoke quickly and in a ringing voice : `` Now we know that the first peddler made 17k . 
profit . '' 
`` Enough ! 
Gordyeeff ! 
Tell me what must we do in order to find out how much the second peddler gained ? '' 
Watching the conduct of the boys , so unlike each other , Foma was thus taken unawares by the question and he kept quiet . 
`` Do n't you know ? 
How ? 
Explain it to him , Smolin . '' 
Having carefully wiped his fingers , which had been soiled with chalk , Smolin put the rag away , and , without looking at Foma , finished the problem and again began to wipe his hands , while Yozhov , smiling and skipping along as he walked , returned to his seat . 
`` Eh , you ! '' 
he whispered , seating himself beside Foma , incidentally striking his side with his fist . 
`` Why do n't you know it ? 
What was the profit altogether ? 
Thirty kopecks . 
And there were two peddlers . 
One of them got 17 . 
Well , how much did the other one get ? '' 
`` I know , '' replied Foma , in a whisper , feeling confused and examining the face of Smolin , who was sedately returning to his seat . 
He did n't like that round , freckled face , with the blue eyes , which were loaded with fat . 
And Yozhov pinched his leg and asked : `` Whose son are you ? 
The Frantic 's ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` So . 
Do you wish me to prompt you always ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And what will you give me for it ? '' 
Foma thought awhile and asked : `` And do you know it all yourself ? '' 
`` I ? 
I am the best pupil . 
You 'll see for yourself . '' 
`` Hey , there ! 
Yozhov , you are talking again ? '' 
cried the teacher , faintly . 
Yozhov jumped to his feet and said boldly : `` It 's not I , Ivan Andreyich -- it 's Gordyeeff . '' 
`` Both of them were whispering , '' announced Smolin , serenely . 
Wrinkling his face mournfully and moving his big lip comically , the teacher reprimanded them all , but his words did not prevent Yozhov from whispering immediately : `` Very well , Smolin ! 
I 'll remember you for telling . '' 
`` Well , why do you blame it all on the new boy ? '' 
asked Smolin , in a low voice , without even turning his head to them . 
`` All right , all right , '' hissed Yozhov . 
Foma was silent , looking askance at his brisk neighbour , who at once pleased him and roused in him a desire to get as far as possible away from him . 
During recess he learned from Yozhov that Smolin , too , was rich , being the son of a tan-yard proprietor , and that Yozhov himself was the son of a guard at the Court of Exchequer , and very poor . 
The last was clearly evident by the adroit boy 's costume , made of gray fustian and adorned with patches on the knees and elbows ; by his pale , hungry-looking face ; and , by his small , angular and bony figure . 
This boy spoke in a metallic alto , elucidating his words with grimaces and gesticulations , and he often used words whose meaning was known but to himself . 
`` We 'll be friends , '' he announced to Foma . 
`` Why did you complain to the teacher about me ? '' 
Gordyeeff reminded Yozhov , looking at him suspiciously . 
`` There ! 
What 's the difference to you ? 
You are a new scholar and rich . 
The teacher is not exacting with the rich . 
And I am a poor hanger-on ; he does n't like me , because I am impudent and because I never bring him any presents . 
If I had been a bad pupil he would have expelled me long ago . 
You know I 'll go to the Gymnasium from here . 
I 'll pass the second class and then I 'll leave . 
Already a student is preparing me for the second class . 
There I 'll study so that they ca n't hold me back ! 
How many horses do you have ? '' 
`` Three . 
What do you need to study so much for ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Because I am poor . 
The poor must study hard so that they may become rich . 
They become doctors , functionaries , officers . 
I shall be a ` tinkler . ' 
A sword at my side , spur on my boots . 
Cling , cling ! 
And what are you going to be ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' said Foma , pensively , examining his companion . 
`` You need not be anything . 
And are you fond of pigeons ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What a good-for-nothing you are ! 
Oh ! 
Eh ! '' 
Yozhov imitated Foma 's slow way of speaking . 
`` How many pigeons do you have ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` Eh , you ! 
Rich , and yet you have no pigeons . 
Even I have three . 
If my father had been rich I would have had a hundred pigeons and chased them all day long . 
Smolin has pigeons , too , fine ones ! 
Fourteen . 
He made me a present of one . 
Only , he is greedy . 
All the rich are greedy . 
And you , are you greedy , too ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' said Foma , irresolutely . 
`` Come up to Smolin 's and the three of us together will chase the pigeons . '' 
`` Very well . 
If they let me . '' 
`` Why , does not your father like you ? '' 
`` He does like me . '' 
`` Well , then , he 'll let you go . 
Only do n't tell him that I am coming . 
Perhaps he would not let you go with me . 
Tell him you want to go to Smolin 's . 
Smolin ! '' 
A plump boy came up to them , and Yozhov accosted him , shaking his head reproachfully : `` Eh , you red-headed slanderer ! 
It is n't worth while to be friends with you , blockhead ! '' 
`` Why do you abuse me ? '' 
asked Smolin , calmly , examining Foma fixedly . 
`` I am not abusing you ; I am telling the truth , '' Yozhov explained , straightening himself with animation . 
`` Listen ! 
Although you are a kissel , but -- let it go ! 
We 'll come up to see you on Sunday after mass . '' 
`` Come , '' Smolin nodded his head . 
`` We 'll come up . 
They 'll ring the bell soon . 
I must run to sell the siskin , '' declared Yozhov , pulling out of his pocket a paper package , wherein some live thing was struggling . 
And he disappeared from the school-yard as mercury from the palm of a hand . 
`` What a queer fellow he is ! '' 
said Foma , dumfounded by Yozhov 's adroitness and looking at Smolin interrogatively . 
`` He is always like this . 
He 's very clever , '' the red-headed boy explained . 
`` And cheerful , too , '' added Foma . 
`` Cheerful , too , '' Smolin assented . 
Then they became silent , looking at each other . 
`` Will you come up with him to my house ? '' 
asked the red-headed boy . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Come up . 
It 's nice there . '' 
Foma said nothing to this . 
Then Smolin asked him : `` Have you many friends ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` Neither did I have any friends before I went to school . 
Only cousins . 
Now you 'll have two friends at once . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Foma . 
`` Are you glad ? '' 
`` I 'm glad . '' 
`` When you have lots of friends , it is lively . 
And it is easier to study , too -- they prompt you . '' 
`` And are you a good pupil ? '' 
`` Of course ! 
I do everything well , '' said Smolin , calmly . 
The bell began to bang as though it had been frightened and was hastily running somewhere . 
Sitting in school , Foma began to feel somewhat freer , and compared his friends with the rest of the boys . 
He soon learned that they both were the very best boys in school and that they were the first to attract everybody 's attention , even as the two figures 5 and 7 , which had not yet been wiped off the blackboard . 
And Foma felt very much pleased that his friends were better than any of the other boys . 
They all went home from school together , but Yozhov soon turned into some narrow side street , while Smolin walked with Foma up to his very house , and , departing , said : `` You see , we both go home the same way , too . '' 
At home Foma was met with pomp : his father made him a present of a heavy silver spoon , with an ingenious monogram on it , and his aunt gave him a scarf knitted by herself . 
They were awaiting him for dinner , having prepared his favourite dishes for him , and as soon as he took off his coat , seated him at the table and began to ply him with questions . 
`` Well , how was it ? 
How did you like the school ? '' 
asked Ignat , looking lovingly at his son 's rosy , animated face . 
`` Pretty good . 
It 's nice ! '' 
replied Foma . 
`` My darling ! '' 
sighed his aunt , with feeling , `` look out , hold your own with your friends . 
As soon as they offend you tell your teachers about it . '' 
`` Go on . 
What else will you tell him ? '' 
Ignat smiled . 
`` Never do that ! 
Try to get square with every offender yourself , punish him with your own hand , not with somebody else 's . 
Are there any good fellows there ? '' 
`` There are two , '' Foma smiled , recalling Yozhov . 
`` One of them is so bold -- terrible ! '' 
`` Whose is he ? '' 
`` A guard 's son . '' 
`` Mm ! 
Bold did you say ? '' 
`` Dreadfully bold ! '' 
`` Well , let him be ! 
And the other ? '' 
`` The other one is red-headed . 
Smolin . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Evidently Mitry Ivanovitch 's son . 
Stick to him , he 's good company . 
Mitry is a clever peasant . 
If the son takes after his father it is all right . 
But that other one -- you know , Foma , you had better invite them to our house on Sunday . 
I 'll buy some presents and you can treat them . 
We 'll see what sort of boys they are . '' 
`` Smolin asked me to come to him this Sunday , '' said Foma , looking up at his father questioningly . 
`` So . 
Well , you may go ! 
That 's all right , go . 
Observe what kind of people there are in the world . 
You can not pass your life alone , without friendship . 
Your godfather and I , for instance , have been friends for more than twenty years , and I have profited a great deal by his common sense . 
So you , too , try to be friendly with those that are better and wiser than you . 
Rub against a good man , like a copper coin against silver , and you may then pass for a silver coin yourself . '' 
And , bursting into laughter at his comparison , Ignat added seriously : `` I was only jesting . 
Try to be , not artificial , but genuine . 
And have some common sense , no matter how little , but your own . 
Have you many lessons to do ? '' 
`` Many ! '' 
sighed the boy , and to his sigh , like an echo , his aunt answered with a heavy sigh . 
`` Well , study . 
Do n't be worse than others at school . 
Although , I 'll tell you , even if there were twenty-five classes in your school , they could never teach you there anything save reading , writing and arithmetic . 
You may also learn some naughty things , but God protect you ! 
I shall give you a terrible spanking if you do . 
If you smoke tobacco I 'll cut your lips off . '' 
`` Remember God , Fomushka , '' said the aunt . 
`` See that you do n't forget our Lord . '' 
`` That 's true ! 
Honour God and your father . 
But I wish to tell you that school books are but a trivial matter . 
You need these as a carpenter needs an adze and a pointer . 
They are tools , but the tools can not teach you how to make use of them . 
Understand ? 
Let us see : Suppose an adze were handed to a carpenter for him to square a beam with it . 
It 's not enough to have hands and an adze ; it is also necessary for him to know how to strike the wood so as not to hit his foot instead . 
To you the knowledge of reading and writing is given , and you must regulate your life with it . 
Thus it follows that books alone are but a trifle in this matter ; it is necessary to be able to take advantage of them . 
And it is this ability that is more cunning than any books , and yet nothing about it is written in the books . 
This , Foma , you must learn from Life itself . 
A book is a dead thing , you may take it as you please , you may tear it , break it -- it will not cry out . 
While should you but make a single wrong step in life , or wrongly occupy a place in it , Life will start to bawl at you in a thousand voices ; it will deal you a blow , felling you to the ground . '' 
Foma , his elbows leaning on the table , attentively listened to his father , and under the sound of his powerful voice he pictured to himself now the carpenter squaring a beam , now himself , his hands outstretched , carefully and stealthily approaching some colossal and living thing , and desiring to grasp that terrible something . 
`` A man must preserve himself for his work and must be thoroughly acquainted with the road to it . 
A man , dear , is like the pilot on a ship . 
In youth , as at high tide , go straight ! 
A way is open to you everywhere . 
But you must know when it is time to steer . 
The waters recede -- here you see a sandbank , there , a rock ; it is necessary to know all this and to slip off in time , in order to reach the harbour safe and sound . '' 
`` I will reach it ! '' 
said the boy , looking at his father proudly and with confidence . 
`` Eh ? 
You speak courageously ! '' 
Ignat burst into laughter . 
And the aunt also began to laugh kindly . 
Since his trip with his father on the Volga , Foma became more lively and talkative at home , with his father , with his aunt and with Mayakin . 
But on the street , in a new place , or in the presence of strangers , he was always gloomy , always looking about him with suspicion , as though he felt something hostile to him everywhere , something hidden from him spying on him . 
At nights he sometimes awoke of a sudden and listened for a long time to the silence about him , fixedly staring into the dark with wide-open eyes . 
And then his father 's stories were transformed before him into images and pictures . 
Without being aware of it , he mixed up those stories with his aunt 's fairy-tales , thus creating for himself a chaos of adventures wherein the bright colours of fantasy were whimsically intertwined with the stern shades of reality . 
This resulted in something colossal , incomprehensible ; the boy closed his eyes and drove it all away from him and tried to check the play of his imagination , which frightened him . 
In vain he attempted to fall asleep , and the chamber became more and more crowded with dark images . 
Then he quietly roused his aunt . 
`` Auntie ! 
Auntie ! '' 
`` What ? 
Christ be with you . '' 
`` I 'll come to you , '' whispered Foma . 
`` Why ? 
Sleep , darling , sleep . '' 
`` I am afraid , '' confessed the boy . 
`` You better say to yourself , ` And the Lord will rise again , ' then you wo n't be afraid . '' 
Foma lies with his eyes open and says the prayer . 
The silence of the night pictures itself before him in the form of an endless expanse of perfectly calm , dark water , which has overflowed everything and congealed ; there is not a ripple on it , not a shadow of a motion , and neither is there anything within it , although it is bottomlessly deep . 
It is very terrible for one to look down from the dark at this dead water . 
But now the sound of the night watchman 's mallet is heard , and the boy sees that the surface of the water is beginning to tremble , and , covering the surface with ripples , light little balls are dancing upon it . 
The sound of the bell on the steeple , with one mighty swing , brings all the water in agitation and it is slightly trembling from that sound ; a big spot of light is also trembling , spreading light upon the water , radiating from its centre into the dark distance , there growing paler and dying out . 
Again there is weary and deathlike repose in this dark desert . 
`` Auntie , '' whispers Foma , beseechingly . 
`` Dearest ? '' 
`` I am coming to you . '' 
`` Come , then , come , my darling . '' 
Going over into auntie 's bed , he presses close to her , begging : `` Tell me something . '' 
`` At night ? '' 
protests auntie , sleepily . 
`` Please . '' 
He does not have to ask her long . 
Yawning , her eyes closed , the old woman begins slowly in a voice grown heavy with sleep : `` Well , my dear sir , in a certain kingdom , in a certain empire , there lived a man and his wife , and they were very poor . 
They were so unfortunate that they had nothing to eat . 
They would go around begging , somebody would give them a crust of stale bread and that would keep them for awhile . 
And it came to pass that the wife begot a child -- a child was born -- it was necessary to christen it , but , being poor , they could not entertain the godparents and the guests , so nobody came to christen the child . 
They tried this and they tried that -- yet nobody came . 
And they began to pray to the Lord , ` Oh Lord ! 
Oh Lord ! ' '' 
Foma knew this awful story about God 's godchild . 
He had heard it more than once and was already picturing to himself this godchild riding on a white horse to his godfather and godmother ; he was riding in the darkness , over the desert , and he saw there all the unbearable miseries to which sinners are condemned . 
And he heard their faint moans and requests : `` Oh ! 
Man ! 
Ask the Lord yet how long are we to suffer here ! '' 
Then it appeared to Foma that it was he who was riding at night on the white horse , and that the moans and the implorings were addressed to him . 
His heart contracts with some incomprehensible desire ; sorrow compressed his breast and tears gathered in his eyes , which he had firmly closed and now feared to open . 
He is tossing about in his bed restlessly . 
`` Sleep , my child . 
Christ be with you ! '' 
says the old woman , interrupting her tale of men suffering for their sins . 
But in the morning after such a night Foma rose sound and cheerful , washed himself hastily , drank his tea in haste and ran off to school , provided with sweet cakes , which were awaited by the always hungry little Yozhov , who greedily subsisted on his rich friend 's generosity . 
`` Got anything to eat ? '' 
he accosted Foma , turning up his sharp-pointed nose . 
`` Let me have it , for I left the house without eating anything . 
I slept too long , devil take it ! 
I studied up to two o'clock last night . 
Have you solved your problems ? '' 
`` No , I have n't . '' 
`` Eh , you lazy bones ! 
Well , I 'll dash them off for you directly ! '' 
Driving his small , thin teeth into the cakes , he purred something like a kitten , stamped his left foot , beating time , and at the same time solved the problem , rattling off short phrases to Foma : `` See ? 
Eight bucketfuls leaked out in one hour . 
And how many hours did it leak -- six ? 
Eh , what good things they eat in your house ! 
Consequently , we must multiply six by eight . 
Do you like cake with green onions ? 
Oh , how I like it ! 
So that in six hours forty-eight bucketfuls leaked out of the first gauge-cock . 
And altogether the tub contained ninety . 
Do you understand the rest ? '' 
Foma liked Yozhov better than Smolin , but he was more friendly with Smolin . 
He wondered at the ability and the sprightliness of the little fellow . 
He saw that Yozhov was more clever and better than himself ; he envied him , and felt offended on that account , and at the same time he pitied him with the condescending compassion of a satisfied man for a hungry one . 
Perhaps it was this very compassion that prevented him from preferring this bright boy to the boring red-headed Smolin . 
Yozhov , fond of having a laugh at the expense of his well-fed friends , told them quite often : `` Eh , you are little trunks full of cakes ! '' 
Foma was angry with him for his sneers , and one day , touched to the quick , said wickedly and with contempt : `` And you are a beggar -- a pauper ! '' 
Yozhov 's yellow face became overcast , and he replied slowly : `` Very well , so be it ! 
I shall never prompt you again -- and you 'll be like a log of wood ! '' 
And they did not speak to each other for about three days , very much to the regret of the teacher , who during these days had to give the lowest markings to the son of the esteemed Ignat Matveyich . 
Yozhov knew everything : he related at school how the procurator 's chambermaid gave birth to a child , and that for this the procurator 's wife poured hot coffee over her husband ; he could tell where and when it was best to catch perch ; he knew how to make traps and cages for birds ; he could give a detailed account of how the soldier had hanged himself in the garret of the armoury , and knew from which of the pupils ' parents the teacher had received a present that day and precisely what sort of a present it was . 
The sphere of Smolin 's knowledge and interests was confined to the merchant 's mode of life , and , above all , the red-headed boy was fond of judging whether this man was richer than that , valuing and pricing their houses , their vessels and their horses . 
All this he knew to perfection , and spoke of it with enthusiasm . 
Like Foma , he regarded Yozhov with the same condescending pity , but more as a friend and equal . 
Whenever Gordyeeff quarrelled with Yozhov , Smolin hastened to reconcile them , and he said to Foma one day , on their way home : `` Why do you always quarrel with Yozhov ? '' 
`` Well , why is he so self-conceited ? '' 
said Foma , angrily . 
`` He is proud because you never know your lessons , and he always helps you out . 
He is clever . 
And because he is poor -- is he to blame for that ? 
He can learn anything he wants to , and he will be rich , too . '' 
`` He is like a mosquito , '' said Foma , disdainfully ; `` he will buzz and buzz , and then of a sudden will bite . '' 
But there was something in the life of these boys that united them all ; there were hours when the consciousness of difference in their natures and positions was entirely lost . 
On Sundays they all gathered at Smolin 's , and , getting up on the roof of the wing , where they had an enormous pigeon-house , they let the pigeons loose . 
The beautiful , well-fed birds , ruffling their snow-white wings , darted out of the pigeon-house one by one , and , seating themselves in a row on the ridge of the roof , and , illumined by the sun , cooing , flaunted before the boys . 
`` Scare them ! '' 
implored Yozhov , trembling for impatience . 
Smolin swung a pole with a bast-wisp fastened to its end , and whistled . 
The frightened pigeons rushed into the air , filling it with the hurried flapping of their wings . 
And now , outlining big circles , they easily soar upwards , into the blue depths of the sky ; they float higher and higher , their silver and snow-white feathers flashing . 
Some of them are striving to reach the dome of the skies with the light soaring of the falcon , their wings outstretched wide and almost motionless ; others play , turn over in the air , now dropping downward in a snowy lump , now darting up like an arrow . 
Now the entire flock seems as though hanging motionless in the desert of the sky , and , growing smaller and smaller , seems to sink in it . 
With heads thrown back , the boys admire the birds in silence , without taking their eyes from them -- their tired eyes , so radiant with calm joy , not altogether free from envying these winged creatures , which so freely took flight from earth up into the pure and calm atmosphere full of the glitter of the sun . 
The small group of scarcely visible dots , now mere specks in the azure of the sky , leads on the imagination of the children , and Yozhov expresses their common feeling when , in a low voice , he says thoughtfully : `` That 's the way we ought to fly , friends . '' 
While Foma , knowing that human souls , soaring heavenward , oftentimes assume the form of pigeons , felt in his breast the rising of a burning , powerful desire . 
Unified by their joy , attentively and mutely awaiting the return of their birds from the depths of the sky , the boys , pressing close to one another , drifted far away from the breath of life , even as their pigeons were far from earth ; at this moment they are merely children , knowing neither envy nor anger ; free from everything , they are near to one another , they are mute , judging their feelings by the light in their eyes -- and they feel as happy as the birds in the sky . 
But now the pigeons come down on the roof again , and , tired out by their flight , are easily driven into the pigeon-house . 
`` Friends , let 's go for apples ? '' 
suggests Yozhov , the instigator of all games and adventures . 
His call drives out of the children 's souls the peacefulness brought into them by the pigeons , and then , like plunderers , carefully listening for each and every sound , they steal quietly across the back yards toward the neighbouring garden . 
The fear of being caught is balanced by the hope of stealing with impunity . 
But stealing is work and dangerous work at that , and everything that is earned by your own labour is so sweet ! 
And the more effort required to gain it , the sweeter it is . 
Carefully the boys climb over the fence of the garden , and , bending down , crawl toward the apple trees and , full of fright , look around vigilantly . 
Their hearts tremble and their throbbing slackens at the faintest rustle . 
They are alike afraid of being caught , and , if noticed , of being recognised , but in case they should only see them and yell at them , they would be satisfied . 
They would separate , each going in a different direction , and then , meeting again , their eyes aglow with joy and boldness , would laughingly tell one another how they felt when they heard some one giving chase to them , and what happened to them when they ran so quickly through the garden , as though the ground were burning under their feet . 
Such invasions were more to Foma 's liking than all other adventures and games , and his behaviour during these invasions was marked with a boldness that at once astounded and angered his companions . 
He was intentionally careless in other people 's gardens : he spoke loud , noisily broke the branches of apple trees , and , tearing off a worm-eaten apple , threw it in the direction of the proprietor 's house . 
The danger of being caught in the act did not frighten him ; it rather encouraged him -- his eyes would turn darker , his teeth would clench , and his face would assume an expression of anger and pride . 
Smolin , distorting his big mouth contemptibly , would say to him : `` You are making entirely too much fuss about yourself . '' 
`` I am not a coward anyway ! '' 
replied Foma . 
`` I know that you are not a coward , but why do you boast of it ? 
One may do a thing as well without boasting . '' 
Yozhov blamed him from a different point of view : `` If you thrust yourself into their hands willingly you can go to the devil ! 
I am not your friend . 
They 'll catch you and bring you to your father -- he would n't do anything to you , while I would get such a spanking that all my bones would be skinned . '' 
`` Coward ! '' 
Foma persisted , stubbornly . 
And it came to pass one day that Foma was caught by the second captain , Chumakov , a thin little old man . 
Noiselessly approaching the boy , who was hiding away in his bosom the stolen apples , the old man seized him by the shoulders and cried in a threatening voice : `` Now I have you , little rogue ! 
Aha ! '' 
Foma was then about fifteen years old , and he cleverly slipped out of the old man 's hands . 
Yet he did not run from him , but , knitting his brow and clenching his fist , he said threateningly : `` You dare to touch me ! '' 
`` I would n't touch you . 
I 'll just turn you over to the police ! 
Whose son are you ? '' 
Foma did not expect this , and all his boldness and spitefulness suddenly left him . 
The trip to the police station seemed to him something which his father would never forgive him . 
He shuddered and said confusedly : `` Gordyeeff . '' 
`` Ignat Gordyeeff 's ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Now the second captain was taken aback . 
He straightened himself , expanded his chest and for some reason or other cleared his throat impressively . 
Then his shoulders sank and he said to the boy in a fatherly tone : `` It 's a shame ! 
The son of such a well-known and respected man ! 
It is unbecoming your position . 
You may go . 
But should this happen again ! 
Hm ! 
I should be compelled to notify your father , to whom , by the way , I have the honour of presenting my respects . '' 
Foma watched the play of the old man 's physiognomy and understood that he was afraid of his father . 
Like a young wolf , he looked askance at Chumakov ; while the old man , with comical seriousness , twisted his gray moustache , hesitating before the boy , who did not go away , notwithstanding the given permission . 
`` You may go , '' repeated the old man , pointing at the road leading to his house . 
`` And how about the police ? '' 
asked Foma , sternly , and was immediately frightened at the possible answer . 
`` I was but jesting , '' smiled the old man . 
`` I just wanted to frighten you . '' 
`` You are afraid of my father yourself , '' said Foma , and , turning his back to the old man , walked off into the depth of the garden . 
`` I am afraid ? 
Ah ! 
Very well ! '' 
exclaimed Chumakov after him , and Foma knew by the sound of his voice that he had offended the old man . 
He felt sad and ashamed ; he passed the afternoon in walking , and , coming home , he was met by his father 's stern question : `` Foma ! 
Did you go to Chumakov 's garden ? '' 
`` Yes , I did , '' said the boy , calmly , looking into his father 's eyes . 
Evidently Ignat did not expect such an answer and he was silent for awhile , stroking his beard . 
`` Fool ! 
Why did you do it ? 
Have you not enough of your own apples ? '' 
Foma cast down his eyes and was silent , standing before his father . 
`` See , you are shamed ! 
Yozhishka must have incited you to this ! 
I 'll give it to him when he comes , or I 'll make an end of your friendship altogether . '' 
`` I did it myself , '' said Foma , firmly . 
`` From bad to worse ! '' 
exclaimed Ignat . 
`` But why did you do it ? '' 
`` Because . '' 
`` Because ! '' 
mocked the father . 
`` Well , if you did it you ought to be able to explain to yourself and to others the reason for so doing . 
Come here ! '' 
Foma walked up to his father , who was sitting on a chair , and placed himself between his knees . 
Ignat put his hand on the boy 's shoulders , and , smiling , looked into his eyes . 
`` Are you ashamed ? '' 
`` I am ashamed , '' sighed Foma . 
`` There you have it , fool ! 
You have disgraced me and yourself . '' 
Pressing his son 's head to his breast , he stroked his hair and asked again : `` Why should you do such a thing -- stealing other people 's apples ? '' 
`` I -- I do n't know , '' said Foma , confusedly . 
`` Perhaps because it is so lonesome . 
I play and play the same thing day after day . 
I am growing tired of it ! 
While this is dangerous . '' 
`` Exciting ? '' 
asked the father , smiling . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Mm , perhaps it is so . 
But , nevertheless , Foma , look out -- drop this , or I shall deal with you severely . '' 
`` I 'll never climb anywhere again , '' said the boy with confidence . 
`` And that you take all the blame on yourself -- that is good . 
What will become of you in the future , only God knows , but meanwhile -- it is pretty good . 
It is not a trifle if a man is willing to pay for his deeds with his own skin . 
Someone else in your place would have blamed his friends , while you say : ' I did it myself . ' 
That 's the proper way , Foma . 
You commit the sin , but you also account for it . 
Did n't Chumakov strike you ? '' 
asked Ignat , pausing as he spoke . 
`` I would have struck him back , '' declared Foma , calmly . 
`` Mm , '' roared his father , significantly . 
`` I told him that he was afraid of you . 
That is why he complained . 
Otherwise he was not going to say anything to you about it . '' 
`` Is that so ? '' '' 
` By God ! 
Present my respects to your father , ' he said . '' 
`` Did he ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the dog ! 
See what kind of people there are ; he is robbed and yet he makes a bow and presents his respects ! 
Ha , ha ! 
It is true it might have been worth no more than a kopeck , but a kopeck is to him what a rouble is to me . 
And it is n't the kopeck , but since it is mine , no one dares touch it unless I throw it away myself . 
Eh ! 
The devil take them ! 
Well , tell me -- where have you been , what have you seen ? '' 
The boy sat down beside his father and told him in detail all the impressions of that day . 
Ignat listened , fixedly watching the animated face of his son , and the eyebrows of the big man contracted pensively . 
`` You are still but floating on the surface , dear . 
You are still but a child . 
Eh !
