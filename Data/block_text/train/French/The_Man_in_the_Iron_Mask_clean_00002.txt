`` Monseigneur , -- how did you get the note which announced my arrival to you ? '' 
`` You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note . '' 
`` If we can corrupt one turnkey , we can corrupt ten . '' 
`` Well ; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile ; possible so to conceal him that the king 's people shall not again ensnare him ; possible , in some unknown retreat , to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
said Aramis , smiling . 
`` I admit that , whoever would do this much for me , would seem more than mortal in my eyes ; but as you tell me I am a prince , brother of the king , how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of ? 
And as , to effect this , I must pass a life of war and hatred , how can you cause me to prevail in those combats -- render me invulnerable by my enemies ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , reflect on all this ; place me , to-morrow , in some dark cavern at a mountain 's base ; yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river , plain and valley , of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens , or the stormy sky , and it is enough . 
Promise me no more than this , for , indeed , more you can not give , and it would be a crime to deceive me , since you call yourself my friend . '' 
Aramis waited in silence . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , after a moment 's reflection , `` I admire the firm , sound sense which dictates your words ; I am happy to have discovered my monarch 's mind . '' 
`` Again , again ! 
oh , God ! 
for mercy 's sake , '' cried the prince , pressing his icy hands upon his clammy brow , `` do not play with me ! 
I have no need to be a king to be the happiest of men . '' 
`` But I , monseigneur , wish you to be a king for the good of humanity . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the prince , with fresh distrust inspired by the word ; `` ah ! 
with what , then , has humanity to reproach my brother ? '' 
`` I forgot to say , monseigneur , that if you would allow me to guide you , and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom , you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause , and these friends are numerous . '' 
`` Numerous ? '' 
`` Less numerous than powerful , monseigneur . '' 
`` Explain yourself . '' 
`` It is impossible ; I will explain , I swear before Heaven , on that day that I see you sitting on the throne of France . '' 
`` But my brother ? '' 
`` You shall decree his fate . 
Do you pity him ? '' 
`` Him , who leaves me to perish in a dungeon ? 
No , no . 
For him I have no pity ! '' 
`` So much the better . '' 
`` He might have himself come to this prison , have taken me by the hand , and have said , ` My brother , Heaven created us to love , not to contend with one another . 
I come to you . 
A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity , far from mankind , deprived of every joy . 
I will make you sit down beside me ; I will buckle round your waist our father 's sword . 
Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me ? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood ? ' 
` Oh ! 
never , ' I would have replied to him , ' I look on you as my preserver , I will respect you as my master . 
You give me far more than Heaven bestowed ; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world . ' '' 
`` And you would have kept your word , monseigneur ? '' 
`` On my life ! 
While now -- now that I have guilty ones to punish -- '' `` In what manner , monseigneur ? '' 
`` What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother ? '' 
`` I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded ; I say that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike , of her own flesh , and I conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium . '' 
`` By which you mean -- '' `` That if I restore you to your place on your brother 's throne , he shall take yours in prison . '' 
`` Alas ! 
there 's such infinity of suffering in prison , especially it would be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment . '' 
`` Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire ; and if it seems good to you , after punishment , you will have it in your power to pardon . '' 
`` Good . 
And now , are you aware of one thing , monsieur ? '' 
`` Tell me , my prince . '' 
`` It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the Bastile . '' 
`` I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the pleasure of seeing you once again . '' 
`` And when ? '' 
`` The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how will you give me notice of it ? '' 
`` By myself coming to fetch you . '' 
`` Yourself ? '' 
`` My prince , do not leave this chamber save with me , or if in my absence you are compelled to do so , remember that I am not concerned in it . '' 
`` And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever , save to you ? '' 
`` Save only to me . '' 
Aramis bowed very low . 
The prince offered his hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , in a tone that issued from his heart , `` one word more , my last . 
If you have sought me for my destruction ; if you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies ; if from our conference , in which you have sounded the depths of my mind , anything worse than captivity result , that is to say , if death befall me , still receive my blessing , for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long , weary years . '' 
`` Monseigneur , wait the results ere you judge me , '' said Aramis . 
`` I say that , in such a case , I bless and forgive you . 
If , on the other hand , you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven ; if by your means I am enabled to live in the memory of man , and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor , or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people ; if , from my present depths of sorrow , aided by your generous hand , I raise myself to the very height of honor , then to you , whom I thank with blessings , to you will I offer half my power and my glory : though you would still be but partly recompensed , and your share must always remain incomplete , since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Aramis , moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man , `` the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration . 
It is not you who will have to thank me , but rather the nation whom you will render happy , the posterity whose name you will make glorious . 
Yes ; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than life , I shall have given you immortality . '' 
The prince offered his hand to Aramis , who sank upon his knee and kissed it . 
`` It is the first act of homage paid to our future king , '' said he . 
`` When I see you again , I shall say , ` Good day , sire . ' '' 
`` Till then , '' said the young man , pressing his wan and wasted fingers over his heart , -- `` till then , no more dreams , no more strain on my life -- my heart would break ! 
Oh , monsieur , how small is my prison -- how low the window -- how narrow are the doors ! 
To think that so much pride , splendor , and happiness , should be able to enter in and to remain here ! '' 
`` Your royal highness makes me proud , '' said Aramis , `` since you infer it is I who brought all this . '' 
And he rapped immediately on the door . 
The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux , who , devoured by fear and uneasiness , was beginning , in spite of himself , to listen at the door . 
Happily , neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice , even in the most passionate outbreaks . 
`` What a confessor ! '' 
said the governor , forcing a laugh ; `` who would believe that a compulsory recluse , a man as though in the very jaws of death , could have committed crimes so numerous , and so long to tell of ? '' 
Aramis made no reply . 
He was eager to leave the Bastile , where the secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls . 
As soon as they reached Baisemeaux 's quarters , `` Let us proceed to business , my dear governor , '' said Aramis . 
`` Alas ! '' 
replied Baisemeaux . 
`` You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres , '' said the bishop . 
`` And to pay over the first third of the sum , '' added the poor governor , with a sigh , taking three steps towards his iron strong-box . 
`` Here is the receipt , '' said Aramis . 
`` And here is the money , '' returned Baisemeaux , with a threefold sigh . 
`` The order instructed me only to give a receipt ; it said nothing about receiving the money , '' rejoined Aramis . 
`` Adieu , monsieur le governeur ! '' 
And he departed , leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile . 
Thereof , and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy Gentleman . 
Since the departure of Athos for Blois , Porthos and D'Artagnan were seldom together . 
One was occupied with harassing duties for the king , the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended to forward to his estate , and by aid of which he hoped to establish in his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty 's society . 
D'Artagnan , ever faithful , one morning during an interval of service thought about Porthos , and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a fortnight , directed his steps towards his hotel , and pounced upon him just as he was getting up . 
The worthy baron had a pensive -- nay , more than pensive -- melancholy air . 
He was sitting on his bed , only half-dressed , and with legs dangling over the edge , contemplating a host of garments , which with their fringes , lace , embroidery , and slashes of ill-assorted hues , were strewed all over the floor . 
Porthos , sad and reflective as La Fontaine 's hare , did not observe D'Artagnan 's entrance , which was , moreover , screened at this moment by M. Mouston , whose personal corpulency , quite enough at any time to hide one man from another , was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant was holding up for his master 's inspection , by the sleeves , that he might the better see it all over . 
D'Artagnan stopped at the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then , as the sight of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman , D'Artagnan thought it time to put an end to these dismal reflections , and coughed by way of announcing himself . 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos , whose countenance brightened with joy ; `` ah ! 
ah ! 
Here is D'Artagnan . 
I shall then get hold of an idea ! '' 
At these words Mouston , doubting what was going on behind him , got out of the way , smiling kindly at the friend of his master , who thus found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching D'Artagnan . 
Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in rising , and crossing the room in two strides , found himself face to face with his friend , whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed to increase with every day . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he repeated , `` you are always welcome , dear friend ; but just now you are more welcome than ever . '' 
`` But you seem to have the megrims here ! '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection . 
`` Well , then , tell me all about it , Porthos , my friend , unless it is a secret . '' 
`` In the first place , '' returned Porthos , `` you know I have no secrets from you . 
This , then , is what saddens me . '' 
`` Wait a minute , Porthos ; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin and velvet ! '' 
`` Oh , never mind , '' said Porthos , contemptuously ; `` it is all trash . '' 
`` Trash , Porthos ! 
Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell ! 
gorgeous satin ! 
regal velvet ! '' 
`` Then you think these clothes are -- '' `` Splendid , Porthos , splendid ! 
I 'll wager that you alone in France have so many ; and suppose you never had any more made , and were to live to be a hundred years of age , which would n't astonish me in the very least , you could still wear a new dress the day of your death , without being obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then . '' 
Porthos shook his head . 
`` Come , my friend , '' said D'Artagnan , `` this unnatural melancholy in you frightens me . 
My dear Porthos , pray get it out , then . 
And the sooner the better . '' 
`` Yes , my friend , so I will : if , indeed , it is possible . '' 
`` Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux ? '' 
`` No : they have felled the wood , and it has yielded a third more than the estimate . '' 
`` Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds ? '' 
`` No , my friend : they have been fished , and there is enough left to stock all the pools in the neighborhood . '' 
`` Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake ? '' 
`` No , my friend ; on the contrary , the ground was struck with lightning a hundred paces from the chateau , and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute of water . '' 
`` What in the world is the matter , then ? '' 
`` The fact is , I have received an invitation for the fete at Vaux , '' said Porthos , with a lugubrious expression . 
`` Well ! 
do you complain of that ? 
The king has caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations . 
And so , my dear friend , you are really going to Vaux ? '' 
`` Indeed I am ! '' 
`` You will see a magnificent sight . '' 
`` Alas ! 
I doubt it , though . '' 
`` Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Porthos , tearing out a lock of hair in his despair . 
`` Eh ! 
good heavens , are you ill ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf ! 
It is n't that . '' 
`` But what is it , then ? '' '' 
'T is that I have no clothes ! '' 
D'Artagnan stood petrified . 
`` No clothes ! 
Porthos , no clothes ! '' 
he cried , `` when I see at least fifty suits on the floor . '' 
`` Fifty , truly ; but not one which fits me ! '' 
`` What ? 
not one that fits you ? 
But are you not measured , then , when you give an order ? '' 
`` To be sure he is , '' answered Mouston ; `` but unfortunately I have gotten stouter ! '' 
`` What ! 
you stouter ! '' 
`` So much so that I am now bigger than the baron . 
Would you believe it , monsieur ? '' '' 
Parbleu ! 
it seems to me that is quite evident . '' 
`` Do you see , stupid ? '' 
said Porthos , `` that is quite evident ! '' 
`` Be still , my dear Porthos , '' resumed D'Artagnan , becoming slightly impatient , `` I do n't understand why your clothes should not fit you , because Mouston has grown stouter . '' 
`` I am going to explain it , '' said Porthos . 
`` You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony , who had always seven wild boars kept roasting , each cooked up to a different point ; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it . 
Well , then , I resolved , as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week , I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion . '' 
`` Capitally reasoned , Porthos -- only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims . 
Without counting the time lost in being measured , the fashions are always changing . '' 
`` That is exactly the point , '' said Porthos , `` in regard to which I flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device . '' 
`` Tell me what it is ; for I do n't doubt your genius . '' 
`` You remember what Mouston once was , then ? '' 
`` Yes ; when he used to call himself Mousqueton . '' 
`` And you remember , too , the period when he began to grow fatter ? '' 
`` No , not exactly . 
I beg your pardon , my good Mouston . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not in fault , monsieur , '' said Mouston , graciously . 
`` You were in Paris , and as for us , we were at Pierrefonds . '' 
`` Well , well , my dear Porthos ; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat . 
Is that what you wished to say ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend ; and I greatly rejoice over the period . '' 
`` Indeed , I believe you do , '' exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` You understand , '' continued Porthos , `` what a world of trouble it spared for me . '' 
`` No , I do n't -- by any means . '' 
`` Look here , my friend . 
In the first place , as you have said , to be measured is a loss of time , even though it occur only once a fortnight . 
And then , one may be travelling ; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you . 
In short , I have a horror of letting any one take my measure . 
Confound it ! 
either one is a nobleman or not . 
To be scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you , by inch and line -- 't is degrading ! 
Here , they find you too hollow ; there , too prominent . 
They recognize your strong and weak points . 
See , now , when we leave the measurer 's hands , we are like those strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy . '' 
`` In truth , my dear Porthos , you possess ideas entirely original . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you see when a man is an engineer -- '' `` And has fortified Belle-Isle -- 't is natural , my friend . '' 
`` Well , I had an idea , which would doubtless have proved a good one , but for Mouston 's carelessness . '' 
D'Artagnan glanced at Mouston , who replied by a slight movement of his body , as if to say , `` You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this . '' 
`` I congratulated myself , then , '' resumed Porthos , `` at seeing Mouston get fat ; and I did all I could , by means of substantial feeding , to make him stout -- always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth , and could then be measured in my stead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I see -- that spared you both time and humiliation . '' 
`` Consider my joy when , after a year and a half 's judicious feeding -- for I used to feed him up myself -- the fellow -- '' `` Oh ! 
I lent a good hand myself , monsieur , '' said Mouston , humbly . 
`` That 's true . 
Consider my joy when , one morning , I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in , as I once did myself , to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon , in the chateau of Pierrefonds . 
And , by the way , about that door , my friend , I should like to ask you , who know everything , why these wretches of architects , who ought to have the compasses run into them , just to remind them , came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass ? '' 
`` Oh , those doors , '' answered D'Artagnan , `` were meant for gallants , and they have generally slight and slender figures . '' 
`` Madame du Vallon had no gallant ! '' 
answered Porthos , majestically . 
`` Perfectly true , my friend , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` but the architects were probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of your marrying again . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is possible , '' said Porthos . 
`` And now I have received an explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow , let us return to the subject of Mouston 's fatness . 
But see how the two things apply to each other . 
I have always noticed that people 's ideas run parallel . 
And so , observe this phenomenon , D'Artagnan . 
I was talking to you of Mouston , who is fat , and it led us on to Madame du Vallon -- '' `` Who was thin ? '' 
`` Hum ! 
Is it not marvelous ? '' 
`` My dear friend , a savant of my acquaintance , M. Costar , has made the same observation as you have , and he calls the process by some Greek name which I forget . '' 
`` What ! 
my remark is not then original ? '' 
cried Porthos , astounded . 
`` I thought I was the discoverer . '' 
`` My friend , the fact was known before Aristotle 's days -- that is to say , nearly two thousand years ago . '' 
`` Well , well , 't is no less true , '' said Porthos , delighted at the idea of having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest sages of antiquity . 
`` Wonderfully -- but suppose we return to Mouston . 
It seems to me , we have left him fattening under our very eyes . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` Well , '' said Porthos , `` Mouston fattened so well , that he gratified all my hopes , by reaching my standard ; a fact of which I was well able to convince myself , by seeing the rascal , one day , in a waistcoat of mine , which he had turned into a coat -- a waistcoat , the mere embroidery of which was worth a hundred pistoles . '' '' 
'T was only to try it on , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors , and to have him measured instead of myself . '' 
`` A capital idea , Porthos ; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you . '' 
`` Exactly ! 
They measured him down to the ground , and the end of the skirt came just below my knee . '' 
`` What a marvelous man you are , Porthos ! 
Such a thing could happen only to you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; pay your compliments ; you have ample grounds to go upon . 
It was exactly at that time -- that is to say , nearly two years and a half ago -- that I set out for Belle-Isle , instructing Mouston -LRB- so as always to have , in every event , a pattern of every fashion -RRB- to have a coat made for himself every month . '' 
`` And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions ? 
Ah ! 
that was anything but right , Mouston . '' 
`` No , monsieur , quite the contrary ; quite the contrary ! '' 
`` No , he never forgot to have his coats made ; but he forgot to inform me that he had got stouter ! '' 
`` But it was not my fault , monsieur ! 
your tailor never told me . '' 
`` And this to such an extent , monsieur , '' continued Porthos , `` that the fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth , and so my last dozen coats are all too large , from a foot to a foot and a half . '' 
`` But the rest ; those which were made when you were of the same size ? '' 
`` They are no longer the fashion , my dear friend . 
Were I to put them on , I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam ; and as though I had been two years away from court . '' 
`` I understand your difficulty . 
You have how many new suits ? 
nine ? 
thirty-six ? 
and yet not one to wear . 
Well , you must have a thirty-seventh made , and give the thirty-six to Mouston . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
said Mouston , with a gratified air . 
`` The truth is , that monsieur has always been very generous to me . '' 
`` Do you mean to insinuate that I had n't that idea , or that I was deterred by the expense ? 
But it wants only two days to the fete ; I received the invitation yesterday ; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe , and only this morning discovered my misfortune ; and from now till the day after to-morrow , there is n't a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit . '' 
`` That is to say , one covered all over with gold , is n't it ? '' 
`` I wish it so ! 
undoubtedly , all over . '' 
`` Oh , we shall manage it . 
You wo n't leave for three days . 
The invitations are for Wednesday , and this is only Sunday morning . '' '' 
'T is true ; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours beforehand . '' 
`` How , Aramis ? '' 
`` Yes , it was Aramis who brought me the invitation . '' 
`` Ah ! 
to be sure , I see . 
You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` By no means ! 
by the king , dear friend . 
The letter bears the following as large as life : 'M . 
le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list -- ' '' `` Very good ; but you leave with M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` And when I think , '' cried Porthos , stamping on the floor , `` when I think I shall have no clothes , I am ready to burst with rage ! 
I should like to strangle somebody or smash something ! '' 
`` Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything , Porthos ; I will manage it all ; put on one of your thirty-six suits , and come with me to a tailor . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
my agent has seen them all this morning . '' 
`` Even M. Percerin ? '' 
`` Who is M. Percerin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
only the king 's tailor ! '' 
`` Oh , ah , yes , '' said Porthos , who wished to appear to know the king 's tailor , but now heard his name mentioned for the first time ; `` to M. Percerin 's , by Jove ! 
I was afraid he would be too busy . '' 
`` Doubtless he will be ; but be at ease , Porthos ; he will do for me what he would n't do for another . 
Only you must allow yourself to be measured ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Porthos , with a sigh , '' 't is vexatious , but what would you have me do ? '' 
`` Do ? 
As others do ; as the king does . '' 
`` What ! 
do they measure the king , too ? 
does he put up with it ? '' 
`` The king is a beau , my good friend , and so are you , too , whatever you may say about it . '' 
Porthos smiled triumphantly . 
`` Let us go to the king 's tailor , '' he said ; `` and since he measures the king , I think , by my faith , I may do worse than allow him to measure me ! '' 
The king 's tailor , Messire Jean Percerin , occupied a rather large house in the Rue St. Honore , near the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . 
He was a man of great taste in elegant stuffs , embroideries , and velvets , being hereditary tailor to the king . 
The preferment of his house reached as far back as the time of Charles IX. ; from whose reign dated , as we know , fancy in bravery difficult enough to gratify . 
The Percerin of that period was a Huguenot , like Ambrose Pare , and had been spared by the Queen of Navarre , the beautiful Margot , as they used to write and say , too , in those days ; because , in sooth , he was the only one who could make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear , seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical defects , which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal . 
Percerin being saved , made , out of gratitude , some beautiful black bodices , very inexpensively indeed , for Queen Catherine , who ended by being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people , on whom she had long looked with detestation . 
But Percerin was a very prudent man ; and having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a Protestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine , and having observed that her smiles were more frequent than usual , he speedily turned Catholic with all his family ; and having thus become irreproachable , attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France . 
Under Henry III. , gay king as he was , this position was as grand as the height of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras . 
Now Percerin had been a clever man all his life , and by way of keeping up his reputation beyond the grave , took very good care not to make a bad death of it , and so contrived to die very skillfully ; and that at the very moment he felt his powers of invention declining . 
He left a son and a daughter , both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear ; the son , a cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule ; the daughter , apt at embroidery , and at designing ornaments . 
The marriage of Henry IV . 
and Marie de Medici , and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen , together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere , king of the beaux of the period , made the fortune of the second generation of Percerins . 
M. Concino Concini , and his wife Galligai , who subsequently shone at the French court , sought to Italianize the fashion , and introduced some Florentine tailors ; but Percerin , touched to the quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem , entirely defeated these foreigners , and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his compatriots , and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would never employ any other , and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre . 
And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin 's workshop , which the Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human body it contained . 
Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown Percerin , the king , Louis XIII. , had the generosity to bear no malice to his tailor , and to retain him in his service . 
At the time that Louis the Just afforded this great example of equity , Percerin had brought up two sons , one of whom made his debut at the marriage of Anne of Austria , invented that admirable Spanish costume , in which Richelieu danced a saraband , made the costumes for the tragedy of `` Mirame , '' and stitched on to Buckingham 's mantle those famous pearls which were destined to be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre . 
A man becomes easily notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham , a M. de Cinq-Mars , a Mademoiselle Ninon , a M. de Beaufort , and a Marion de Lorme . 
And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory when his father died . 
This same Percerin III. , old , famous and wealthy , yet further dressed Louis XIV. ; and having no son , which was a great cause of sorrow to him , seeing that with himself his dynasty would end , he had brought up several hopeful pupils . 
He possessed a carriage , a country house , men-servants the tallest in Paris ; and by special authority from Louis XIV. , a pack of hounds . 
He worked for MM . 
de Lyonne and Letellier , under a sort of patronage ; but politic man as he was , and versed in state secrets , he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert . 
This is beyond explanation ; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition . 
Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen , intangible ideas ; they act without themselves knowing why . 
The great Percerin -LRB- for , contrary to the rule of dynasties , it was , above all , the last of the Percerins who deserved the name of Great -RRB- , the great Percerin was inspired when he cut a robe for the queen , or a coat for the king ; he could mount a mantle for Monsieur , the clock of a stocking for Madame ; but , in spite of his supreme talent , he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable fit for M. Colbert . 
`` That man , '' he used often to say , `` is beyond my art ; my needle can never dot him down . '' 
We need scarcely say that Percerin was M. Fouquet 's tailor , and that the superintendent highly esteemed him . 
M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old , nevertheless still fresh , and at the same time so dry , the courtiers used to say , that he was positively brittle . 
His renown and his fortune were great enough for M. le Prince , that king of fops , to take his arm when talking over the fashions ; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their accounts in arrear with him ; for Master Percerin would for the first time make clothes upon credit , but the second never , unless paid for the former order . 
It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown , instead of running after customers , made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones . 
And so Percerin declined to fit bourgeois , or those who had but recently obtained patents of nobility . 
A story used to circulate that even M. de Mazarin , in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal , one fine day slipped letters of nobility into his pocket . 
It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D'Artagnan took the despairing Porthos ; who , as they were going along , said to his friend , `` Take care , my good D'Artagnan , not to compromise the dignity of a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin , who will , I expect , be very impertinent ; for I give you notice , my friend , that if he is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him . '' 
`` Presented by me , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` you have nothing to fear , even though you were what you are not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
't is because -- '' `` What ? 
Have you anything against Percerin , Porthos ? '' 
`` I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` The fellow refused to supply me . '' 
`` Oh , a misunderstanding , no doubt , which it will be now exceedingly easy to set right . 
Mouston must have made a mistake . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
`` He has confused the names . '' 
`` Possibly . 
That rascal Mouston never can remember names . '' 
`` I will take it all upon myself . '' 
`` Very good . '' 
`` Stop the carriage , Porthos ; here we are . '' 
`` Here ! 
how here ? 
We are at the Halles ; and you told me the house was at the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . '' '' 
'T is true , but look . '' 
`` Well , I do look , and I see -- '' `` What ? '' '' 
Pardieu ! 
that we are at the Halles ! '' 
`` You do not , I suppose , want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of it . 
Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or forty others which have arrived before us . '' 
`` No , you are right , indeed . 
What a number of people ! 
And what are they all about ? '' '' 
'T is very simple . 
They are waiting their turn . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their quarters ? '' 
`` No ; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin 's house . '' 
`` And we are going to wait too ? '' 
`` Oh , we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud . '' 
`` What are we to do , then ? '' 
`` Get down , pass through the footmen and lackeys , and enter the tailor 's house , which I will answer for our doing , if you go first . '' 
`` Come along , then , '' said Porthos . 
They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the establishment . 
The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin 's doors were closed , while a servant , standing before them , was explaining to the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M. Percerin could not receive anybody . 
It was bruited about outside still , on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom he favored , in confidence , that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes for the king , and that , owing to the urgency of the case , he was meditating in his office on the ornaments , colors , and cut of these five suits . 
Some , contented with this reason , went away again , contented to repeat the tale to others , but others , more tenacious , insisted on having the doors opened , and among these last three Blue Ribbons , intended to take parts in a ballet , which would inevitably fail unless the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great Percerin himself . 
D'Artagnan , pushing on Porthos , who scattered the groups of people right and left , succeeded in gaining the counter , behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer queries . 
-LRB- We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos like the rest , but D'Artagnan , showing himself , pronounced merely these words , `` The king 's order , '' and was let in with his friend . -RRB- 
The poor fellows had enough to do , and did their best , to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their master , leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence ; and when wounded pride , or disappointed expectation , brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke , he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter . 
The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture . 
Our captain of musketeers , a man of sure and rapid observation , took it all in at a glance ; and having run over the groups , his eye rested on a man in front of him . 
This man , seated upon a stool , scarcely showed his head above the counter that sheltered him . 
He was about forty years of age , with a melancholy aspect , pale face , and soft luminous eyes . 
He was looking at D'Artagnan and the rest , with his chin resting upon his hand , like a calm and inquiring amateur . 
Only on perceiving , and doubtless recognizing , our captain , he pulled his hat down over his eyes . 
It was this action , perhaps , that attracted D'Artagnan 's attention . 
If so , the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely different from what he had desired . 
In other respects his costume was plain , and his hair evenly cut enough for customers , who were not close observers , to take him for a mere tailor 's apprentice , perched behind the board , and carefully stitching cloth or velvet . 
Nevertheless , this man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his fingers . 
D'Artagnan was not deceived , -- not he ; and he saw at once that if this man was working at anything , it certainly was not at velvet . 
`` Eh ! '' 
said he , addressing this man , `` and so you have become a tailor 's boy , Monsieur Moliere ! '' 
`` Hush , M. d'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the man , softly , `` you will make them recognize me . '' 
`` Well , and what harm ? '' 
`` The fact is , there is no harm , but -- '' `` You were going to say there is no good in doing it either , is it not so ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
no ; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures . '' 
`` Go on -- go on , Monsieur Moliere . 
I quite understand the interest you take in the plates -- I will not disturb your studies . '' 
`` Thank you . '' 
`` But on one condition ; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is . '' 
`` Oh ! 
willingly ; in his own room . 
Only -- '' `` Only that one ca n't enter it ? '' 
`` Unapproachable . '' 
`` For everybody ? '' 
`` Everybody . 
He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my observations , and then he went away . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur Moliere , but you will go and tell him I am here . '' 
`` I ! '' 
exclaimed Moliere , in the tone of a courageous dog , from which you snatch the bone it has legitimately gained ; `` I disturb myself ! 
Ah ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , how hard you are upon me ! '' 
`` If you do n't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here , my dear Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan , in a low tone , `` I warn you of one thing : that I wo n't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me . '' 
Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture , `` This gentleman , is it not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds and hearts of men . 
The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one , for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber . 
During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away , leaving at every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace , as the waves leave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands , when they retire with the ebbing tide . 
In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared , making another sign to D'Artagnan from under the hangings . 
The latter hurried after him , with Porthos in the rear , and after threading a labyrinth of corridors , introduced him to M. Percerin 's room . 
The old man , with his sleeves turned up , was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered brocade , so as the better to exhibit its luster . 
Perceiving D'Artagnan , he put the silk aside , and came to meet him , by no means radiant with joy , and by no means courteous , but , take it altogether , in a tolerably civil manner . 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers will excuse me , I am sure , for I am engaged . '' 
`` Eh ! 
yes , on the king 's costumes ; I know that , my dear Monsieur Percerin . 
You are making three , they tell me . '' 
`` Five , my dear sir , five . '' 
`` Three or five , 't is all the same to me , my dear monsieur ; and I know that you will make them most exquisitely . '' 
`` Yes , I know . 
Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world , I do not deny it ; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word , they must first be made ; and to do this , captain , I am pressed for time . '' 
`` Oh , bah ! 
there are two days yet ; 't is much more than you require , Monsieur Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , in the coolest possible manner . 
Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be contradicted , even in his whims ; but D'Artagnan did not pay the least attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume . 
`` My dear M. Percerin , '' he continued , `` I bring you a customer . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed Percerin , crossly . 
`` M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
Percerin attempted a bow , which found no favor in the eyes of the terrible Porthos , who , from his first entry into the room , had been regarding the tailor askance . 
`` A very good friend of mine , '' concluded D'Artagnan . 
`` I will attend to monsieur , '' said Percerin , `` but later . '' 
`` Later ? 
but when ? '' 
`` When I have time . '' 
`` You have already told my valet as much , '' broke in Porthos , discontentedly . 
`` Very likely , '' said Percerin ; `` I am nearly always pushed for time . '' 
`` My friend , '' returned Porthos , sententiously , `` there is always time to be found when one chooses to seek it . '' 
Percerin turned crimson ; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by age . 
`` Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere . '' 
`` Come , come , Percerin , '' interposed D'Artagnan , `` you are not in a good temper to-day . 
Well , I will say one more word to you , which will bring you on your knees ; monsieur is not only a friend of mine , but more , a friend of M. Fouquet 's . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , `` that is another thing . '' 
Then turning to Porthos , `` Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` I am attached to myself , '' shouted Porthos , at the very moment that the tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue . 
Moliere was all observation , D'Artagnan laughed , Porthos swore . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you will make a dress for the baron . 
'T is I who ask you . '' 
`` To you I will not say nay , captain . '' 
`` But that is not all ; you will make it for him at once . '' '' 
'T is impossible within eight days . '' 
`` That , then , is as much as to refuse , because the dress is wanted for the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` I repeat that it is impossible , '' returned the obstinate old man . 
`` By no means , dear Monsieur Percerin , above all if I ask you , '' said a mild voice at the door , a silvery voice which made D'Artagnan prick up his ears . 
It was the voice of Aramis . 
`` Monsieur d'Herblay ! '' 
cried the tailor . 
`` Aramis , '' murmured D'Artagnan . 
`` Ah ! 
our bishop ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Good morning , D'Artagnan ; good morning , Porthos ; good-morning , my dear friends , '' said Aramis . 
`` Come , come , M. Percerin , make the baron 's dress ; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet . '' 
And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner .
