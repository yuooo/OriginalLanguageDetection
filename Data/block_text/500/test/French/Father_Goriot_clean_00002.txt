`` Well , and for my part , '' said Sylvie , `` a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt . 
Such bosh ! 
There , '' she cried , interrupting herself , `` that 's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace , and not a soul stirring ! '' 
`` Pooh ! 
they are all gone out . 
Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne . 
Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel , and the student wo n't be back from his lecture till ten o'clock . 
I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs ; Father Goriot knocked up against me , and his parcel was as hard as iron . 
What is the old fellow up to , I wonder ? 
He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them ; they can never let him alone ; but he is a good man , all the same , and worth more than all of them put together . 
He does n't give you much himself , but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips ; they are dressed grandly , too . '' 
`` His daughters , as he calls them , eh ? 
There are a dozen of them . '' 
`` I have never been to more than two -- the two who came here . '' 
`` There is madame moving overhead ; I shall have to go , or she will raise a fine racket . 
Just keep an eye on the milk , Christophe ; do n't let the cat get at it . '' 
Sylvie went up to her mistress ' room . 
`` Sylvie ! 
How is this ? 
It 's nearly ten o'clock , and you let me sleep like a dormouse ! 
Such a thing has never happened before . '' 
`` It 's the fog ; it is that thick , you could cut it with a knife . '' 
`` But how about breakfast ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
the boarders are possessed , I 'm sure . 
They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight . '' 
`` Do speak properly , Sylvie , '' Mme. Vauquer retorted ; `` say a blink of daylight . '' 
`` Ah , well , madame , whichever you please . 
Anyhow , you can have breakfast at ten o'clock . 
La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred . 
There are only those two upstairs , and they are sleeping like the logs they are . '' 
`` But , Sylvie , you put their names together as if -- '' `` As if what ? '' 
said Sylvie , bursting into a guffaw . 
`` The two of them make a pair . '' 
`` It is a strange thing , is n't it , Sylvie , how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door ? '' 
`` Not at all , madame . 
Christophe heard M. Vautrin , and went down and undid the door . 
And here are you imagining that -- ? '' 
`` Give me my bodice , and be quick and get breakfast ready . 
Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes , and you can put the stewed pears on the table , those at five a penny . '' 
A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down , just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk , and begin to lap in all haste . 
`` Mistigris ! '' 
she cried . 
The cat fled , but promptly returned to rub against her ankles . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , you can wheedle , you old hypocrite ! '' 
she said . 
`` Sylvie ! 
Sylvie ! '' 
`` Yes , madame ; what is it ? '' 
`` Just see what the cat has done ! '' 
`` It is all that stupid Christophe 's fault . 
I told him to stop and lay the table . 
What has become of him ? 
Do n't you worry , madame ; Father Goriot shall have it . 
I will fill it up with water , and he wo n't know the difference ; he never notices anything , not even what he eats . '' 
`` I wonder where the old heathen can have gone ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , setting the plates round the table . 
`` Who knows ? 
He is up to all sorts of tricks . '' 
`` I have overslept myself , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` But madame looks as fresh as a rose , all the same . '' 
The door bell rang at that moment , and Vautrin came through the sitting-room , singing loudly : '' 'T is the same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . . 
`` Oh ! 
Mamma Vauquer ! 
good-morning ! '' 
he cried at the sight of his hostess , and he put his arm gaily round her waist . 
`` There ! 
have done -- '' '' ` Impertinence ! ' 
Say it ! '' 
he answered . 
`` Come , say it ! 
Now , is n't that what you really mean ? 
Stop a bit , I will help you to set the table . 
Ah ! 
I am a nice man , am I not ? 
`` For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover ... `` Oh ! 
I have just seen something so funny -- ... . 
led by chance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
asked the widow . 
`` Father Goriot in the goldsmith 's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning . 
They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there , and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum . 
It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that 's not used to the trade . '' 
`` Really ? 
You do n't say so ? '' 
`` Yes . 
One of my friends is expatriating himself ; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer , and was coming back here . 
I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do ; it is a comical affair . 
He came back to this quarter of the world , to the Rue des Gres , and went into a money-lender 's house ; everybody knows him , Gobseck , a stuck-up rascal , that would make dominoes out of his father 's bones , a Turk , a heathen , an old Jew , a Greek ; it would be a difficult matter to rob him , for he puts all his coin into the Bank . '' 
`` Then what was Father Goriot doing there ? '' 
`` Doing ? '' 
said Vautrin . 
`` Nothing ; he was bent on his own undoing . 
He is a simpleton , stupid enough to ruin himself by running after -- '' `` There he is ! '' 
cried Sylvie . 
`` Christophe , '' cried Father Goriot 's voice , `` come upstairs with me . '' 
Christophe went up , and shortly afterwards came down again . 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant . 
`` Out on an errand for M. Goriot . '' 
`` What may that be ? '' 
said Vautrin , pouncing on a letter in Christophe 's hand . '' 
Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud , '' he read . 
`` Where are you going with it ? '' 
he added , as he gave the letter back to Christophe . 
`` To the Rue du Helder . 
I have orders to give this into her hands myself . '' 
`` What is there inside it ? '' 
said Vautrin , holding the letter up to the light . 
`` A banknote ? 
No . '' 
He peered into the envelope . 
`` A receipted account ! '' 
he cried . 
`` My word ! 
't is a gallant old dotard . 
Off with you , old chap , '' he said , bringing down a hand on Christophe 's head , and spinning the man round like a thimble ; `` you will have a famous tip . '' 
By this time the table was set . 
Sylvie was boiling the milk , Mme. Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin , who kept humming to himself : `` The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . '' 
When everything was ready , Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in . 
`` Where have you been this morning , fair lady ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , turning to Mme. Couture . 
`` We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. . 
To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer . 
Poor little thing ! 
She is trembling like a leaf , '' Mme. Couture went on , as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze . 
`` Warm yourself , Victorine , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` It is quite right and proper , mademoiselle , to pray to Heaven to soften your father 's heart , '' said Vautrin , as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl ; `` but that is not enough . 
What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind ; a barbarian that has three millions -LRB- so they say -RRB- , and will not give you a dowry ; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays . '' 
`` Poor child ! '' 
said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` Never mind , my pet , your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself . '' 
Victorine 's eyes filled with tears at the words , and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme. Couture . 
`` If we could only see him ! '' 
said the Commissary-General 's widow ; `` if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife 's last letter ! 
I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post ; he knew my handwriting -- '' '' ` Oh woman , persecuted and injured innocent ! ' '' 
exclaimed Vautrin , breaking in upon her . 
`` So that is how you are , is it ? 
In a few days ' time I will look into your affairs , and it will be all right , you shall see . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sir , '' said Victorine , with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin , who showed no sign of being touched by it , `` if you know of any way of communicating with my father , please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother 's honor are more to me than all the money in the world . 
If you can induce him to relent a little towards me , I will pray to God for you . 
You may be sure of my gratitude -- '' '' The same old story everywhere , '' sang Vautrin , with a satirical intonation . 
At this juncture , Goriot , Mlle. Michonneau , and Poiret came downstairs together ; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast . 
The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning , and took their places at the table ; the clock struck ten , and the student 's footstep was heard outside . 
`` Ah ! 
here you are , M. Eugene , '' said Sylvie ; `` every one is breakfasting at home to-day . '' 
The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers , and sat down beside Goriot . 
`` I have just met with a queer adventure , '' he said , as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton , and cut a slice of bread , which Mme. Vauquer 's eyes gauged as usual . 
`` An adventure ? '' 
queried Poiret . 
`` Well , and what is there to astonish you in that , old boy ? '' 
Vautrin asked of Poiret . 
`` M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing . '' 
Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student . 
`` Tell us about your adventure ! '' 
demanded M. Vautrin . 
`` Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant . 
She has a magnificent house ; the rooms are hung with silk -- in short , it was a splendid affair , and I was as happy as a king -- '' `` Fisher , '' put in Vautrin , interrupting . 
`` What do you mean , sir ? '' 
said Eugene sharply . 
`` I said ` fisher , ' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings . '' 
`` Quite true ; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king , '' said Poiret the ditto-ist , `` because -- '' `` In fact '' -- the law-student cut him short -- `` I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room , a charming countess , the most exquisite creature I have ever seen . 
There was peach blossom in her hair , and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers -- real flowers , that scented the air -- but there ! 
it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance . 
You ought to have seen her ! 
Well , and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock , on foot in the Rue de Gres . 
Oh ! 
how my heart beat ! 
I began to think -- '' `` That she was coming here , '' said Vautrin , with a keen look at the student . 
`` I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck , a money-lender . 
If ever you explore a Parisian woman 's heart , you will find the money-lender first , and the lover afterwards . 
Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud , and she lives in the Rue du Helder . '' 
The student stared hard at Vautrin . 
Father Goriot raised his head at the words , and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment . 
`` Then Christophe was too late , and she must have gone to him ! '' 
cried Goriot , with anguish in his voice . 
`` It is just as I guessed , '' said Vautrin , leaning over to whisper in Mme. Vauquer 's ear . 
Goriot went on with his breakfast , but seemed unconscious of what he was doing . 
He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment . 
`` Who the devil could have told you her name , M. Vautrin ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` Aha ! 
there you are ! '' 
answered Vautrin . 
`` Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well ! 
and why should I not know it too ? '' 
`` M. Goriot ? '' 
the student cried . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the old man . 
`` So she was very beautiful , was she , yesterday night ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
`` Mme. de Restaud . '' 
`` Look at the old wretch , '' said Mme. Vauquer , speaking to Vautrin ; `` how his eyes light up ! '' 
`` Then does he really keep her ? '' 
said Mlle. Michonneau , in a whisper to the student . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , she was tremendously pretty , '' Eugene answered . 
Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes . 
`` If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there , my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball ; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else . 
I was the twelfth on her list , and she danced every quadrille . 
The other women were furious . 
She must have enjoyed herself , if ever creature did ! 
It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail , a galloping horse , or a woman dancing . '' 
`` So the wheel turns , '' said Vautrin ; `` yesterday night at a duchess ' ball , this morning in a money-lender 's office , on the lowest rung of the ladder -- just like a Parisienne ! 
If their husbands can not afford to pay for their frantic extravagance , they will sell themselves . 
Or if they can not do that , they will tear out their mothers ' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor . 
They will turn the world upside down . 
Just a Parisienne through and through ! '' 
Father Goriot 's face , which had shone at the student 's words like the sun on a bright day , clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin 's . 
`` Well , '' said Mme. Vauquer , `` but where is your adventure ? 
Did you speak to her ? 
Did you ask her if she wanted to study law ? '' 
`` She did not see me , '' said Eugene . 
`` But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock ! 
She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning . 
Was n't it queer ? 
There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures . '' 
`` Pshaw ! 
much funnier things than that happen here ! '' 
exclaimed Vautrin . 
Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk , she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make . 
Mme. Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress ; the two ladies went out , and Father Goriot followed their example . 
`` Well , did you see ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle . 
`` He is ruining himself for those women , that is plain . '' 
`` Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot , '' cried the student . 
`` Well , and if you do n't , '' broke in Vautrin , `` we are not set on convincing you . 
You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet ; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion -- '' Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words . 
They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper 's horse . 
`` Aha ! '' 
said Vautrin , stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance , `` so we have had our little experiences , have we ? '' 
The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue . 
`` Well , '' he went on , `` when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads , they can not drop it . 
They must drink the water from some particular spring -- it is stagnant as often as not ; but they will sell their wives and families , they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it . 
For some this spring is play , or the stock-exchange , or music , or a collection of pictures or insects ; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like . 
You might offer these last all the women on earth -- they would turn up their noses ; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion . 
It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all , and treats them cruelly ; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear ; but no matter , the fools are never tired of it ; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker 's to give their last five-franc piece to her . 
Father Goriot here is one of that sort . 
He is discreet , so the Countess exploits him -- just the way of the gay world . 
The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else . 
In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal ; but get him on that subject , and his eyes sparkle like diamonds . 
That secret is not difficult to guess . 
He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot , and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck 's in the Rue des Gres . 
And now , mark what follows -- he came back here , and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe , who showed us the address ; there was a receipted bill inside it . 
It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender . 
Father Goriot has financed her handsomely . 
There is no need to tack a tale together ; the thing is self-evident . 
So that shows you , sir student , that all the time your Countess was smiling , dancing , flirting , swaying her peach-flower crowned head , with her gown gathered into her hand , her slippers were pinching her , as they say ; she was thinking of her protested bills , or her lover 's protested bills . '' 
`` You have made me wild to know the truth , '' cried Eugene ; `` I will go to call on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow . '' 
`` Yes , '' echoed Poiret ; `` you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud . '' 
`` And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there , who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered . '' 
Eugene looked disgusted . 
`` Why , then , this Paris of yours is a slough . '' 
`` And an uncommonly queer slough , too , '' replied Vautrin . 
`` The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage -- you are a respectable person ; you go afoot and are splashed -- you are a scoundrel . 
You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else , and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice ; you steal a million , and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue . 
And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice , for the maintenance of law and order ! 
A pretty slate of things it is ! '' 
`` What , '' cried Mme. Vauquer , `` has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish ? '' 
`` There were two turtle-doves on the lid , were there not ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` Yes , that there were . '' 
`` Then , was he fond of it ? '' 
said Eugene . 
`` He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate . 
I happened to see him by accident . '' 
`` It was dear to him as his own life , '' answered the widow . 
`` There ! 
you see how infatuated the old fellow is ! '' 
cried Vautrin . 
`` The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him . '' 
The student went up to his room . 
Vautrin went out , and a few moments later Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them . 
Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau , and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes . 
`` Well , those two are as good as married , '' was the portly Sylvie 's comment . 
`` They are going out together to-day for the first time . 
They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel . '' 
`` Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau 's shawl , then , '' said Mme. Vauquer , laughing ; `` it would flare up like tinder . '' 
At four o'clock that evening , when Goriot came in , he saw , by the light of two smoky lamps , that Victorine 's eyes were red . 
Mme. Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer ; it had been made in vain . 
Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend ; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them . 
`` My dear lady , '' said Mme. Couture , addressing Mme. Vauquer , `` just imagine it ; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down , she was standing the whole time . 
He said to me quite coolly , without putting himself in a passion , that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there ; that the young lady -LRB- he would not call her his daughter -RRB- was injuring her cause by importuning him -LRB- importuning ! 
once a year , the wretch ! -RRB- 
; that as Victorine 's mother had nothing when he married her , Victorine ought not to expect anything from him ; in fact , he said the most cruel things , that made the poor child burst out crying . 
The little thing threw herself at her father 's feet and spoke up bravely ; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother 's sake ; that she would obey him without a murmur , but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother 's farewell letter . 
She took it up and gave it to him , saying the most beautiful things in the world , most beautifully expressed ; I do not know where she learned them ; God must have put them into her head , for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk . 
And what do you think the monster was doing all the time ? 
Cutting his nails ! 
He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears , and flung it on to the chimney-piece . 
` That is all right , ' he said . 
He held out his hands to raise his daughter , but she covered them with kisses , and he drew them away again . 
Scandalous , is n't it ? 
And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister . '' 
`` What inhuman wretches they must be ! '' 
said Father Goriot . 
`` And then they both went out of the room , '' Mme. Couture went on , without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker 's exclamation ; `` father and son bowed to me , and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business ! 
That is the history of our call . 
Well , he has seen his daughter at any rate . 
How he can refuse to acknowledge her I can not think , for they are as alike as two peas . '' 
The boarders dropped in one after another , interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty . 
Dulness is their prevailing ingredient , and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture . 
This kind of argot is always changing . 
The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event , an incident in the police courts , a street song , or a bit of burlesque at some theatre , and forgotten in a month . 
Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas . 
The diorama , a recent invention , which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas , had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama . 
The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders . 
`` Well , Monsieur-r-r Poiret , '' said the employe from the Museum , `` how is your health-orama ? '' 
Then , without waiting for an answer , he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a `` Ladies , you seem melancholy . '' 
`` Is dinner ready ? '' 
cried Horace Bianchon , a medical student , and a friend of Rastignac 's ; `` my stomach is sinking usque ad talones . '' 
`` There is an uncommon frozerama outside , '' said Vautrin . 
`` Make room there , Father Goriot ! 
Confound it , your foot covers the whole front of the stove . '' 
`` Illustrious M. Vautrin , '' put in Bianchon , `` why do you say frozerama ? 
It is incorrect ; it should be frozenrama . '' 
`` No , it should n't , '' said the official from the Museum ; '' frozerama is right by the same rule that you say ` My feet are froze . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
`` Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac , Doctor of the Law of Contraries , '' cried Bianchon , seizing Eugene by the throat , and almost throttling him . 
`` Hallo there ! 
hallo ! '' 
Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in , bowed to the rest of the party , and took her place beside the three women without saying a word . 
`` That old bat always makes me shudder , '' said Bianchon in a low voice , indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin . 
`` I have studied Gall 's system , and I am sure she has the bump of Judas . '' 
`` Then you have seen a case before ? '' 
said Vautrin . 
`` Who has not ? '' 
answered Bianchon . 
`` Upon my word , that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through , give them time enough . '' 
`` That is the way , young man , '' returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers : `` The rose has lived the life of a rose -- A morning 's space . '' 
`` Aha ! 
here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama , '' cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed . 
`` I beg your pardon , sir , '' said Mme. Vauquer ; `` it is soupe aux choux . '' 
All the young men roared with laughter . 
`` Had you there , Poiret ! '' 
`` Poir-r-r-rette ! 
she had you there ! '' 
`` Score two points to Mamma Vauquer , '' said Vautrin . 
`` Did any of you notice the fog this morning ? '' 
asked the official . 
`` It was a frantic fog , '' said Bianchon , `` a fog unparalleled , doleful , melancholy , sea-green , asthmatical -- a Goriot of a fog ! '' 
`` A Goriorama , '' said the art student , `` because you could n't see a thing in it . '' 
`` Hey ! 
Milord Gaoriotte , they air talking about yoo-o-ou ! '' 
Father Goriot , seated at the lower end of the table , close to the door through which the servant entered , raised his face ; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin , an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity , that still showed itself at times . 
`` Well , '' Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones , that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices , `` and is there anything the matter with the bread ? '' 
`` Nothing whatever , madame , '' he answered ; `` on the contrary , it is made of the best quality of corn ; flour from Etampes . '' 
`` How could you tell ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` By the color , by the flavor . '' 
`` You knew the flavor by the smell , I suppose , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` You have grown so economical , you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last . '' 
`` Take out a patent for it , then , '' cried the Museum official ; `` you would make a handsome fortune . '' 
`` Never mind him , '' said the artist ; `` he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker . '' 
`` Your nose is a corn-sampler , it appears ? '' 
inquired the official . 
`` Corn what ? '' 
asked Bianchon . 
`` Corn-el . '' 
`` Corn-et . '' 
`` Corn-elian . '' 
`` Corn-ice . '' 
`` Corn-ucopia . '' 
`` Corn-crake . '' 
`` Corn-cockle . '' 
`` Corn-orama . '' 
The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room , and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look , like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand . 
`` Corn ? 
... '' he said , turning to Vautrin , his next neighbor . 
`` Corn on your foot , old man ! '' 
said Vautrin , and he drove Father Goriot 's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown . 
The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything . 
Christophe carried off his plate , thinking that he had finished his soup , so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table . 
Every one burst out laughing . 
`` You are a disagreeable joker , sir , '' said the old man , `` and if you take any further liberties with me -- '' `` Well , what then , old boy ? '' 
Vautrin interrupted . 
`` Well , then , you shall pay dearly for it some day -- '' `` Down below , eh ? '' 
said the artist , `` in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys . '' 
`` Well , mademoiselle , '' Vautrin said , turning to Victorine , `` you are eating nothing . 
So papa was refractory , was he ? '' 
`` A monster ! '' 
said Mme. Couture . 
`` Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit ; she is not eating anything . 
Eh ! 
eh ! 
just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine . '' 
The old man had forgotten his dinner , he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl ; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable , -- the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her . 
`` We are mistaken about Father Goriot , my dear boy , '' said Eugene in a low voice . 
`` He is not an idiot , nor wanting in energy . 
Try your Gall system on him , and let me know what you think . 
I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax ; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now , to judge by his face . 
His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying . 
Oh ! 
you may laugh , Bianchon ; I am not joking . '' 
`` The man is a subject , is he ? '' 
said Bianchon ; `` all right ! 
I will dissect him , if he will give me the chance . '' 
`` No ; feel his bumps . '' 
`` Hm ! 
-- his stupidity might perhaps be contagious . '' 
The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly , and about three o'clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud . 
On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement . 
Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers ; they see success in every direction ; imagination has free play , and turns their lives into a romance ; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy . 
If youth were not ignorant and timid , civilization would be impossible . 
Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition , but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and what he should say to her . 
He equipped himself with wit , rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation , and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand , conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future ; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud , and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed . 
`` If I were rich , '' he said , as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen , `` I would take a cab , then I could think at my ease . '' 
At last he reached the Rue du Helder , and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud . 
He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants , who had seen him cross the court on foot , with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day . 
He understood the meaning of their glances at once , for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court , where a smart cab was waiting . 
All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance . 
A fine horse , in magnificent harness , was pawing the ground , and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself . 
Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast ; he grew positively stupid . 
He sent up his name to the Countess , and waited in the ante-chamber , standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court ; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash , and stared before him . 
The time seemed long ; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded . 
`` Madame is in her boudoir , and can not see any one at present , sir , '' said the servant . 
`` She gave me no answer ; but if you will go into the dining-room , there is some one already there . '' 
Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word ; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber , meaning , no doubt , to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house ; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers , where lamps were standing , and hot-water pipes , on which towels were being dried ; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it . 
Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion . 
`` This way to the drawing-room , sir , '' said the servant , with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense . 
Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath . 
By good luck , he managed to keep his hat on his head , and saved it from immersion in the water ; but just as he turned , a door opened at the further end of the dark passage , dimly lighted by a small lamp . 
Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss ; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud , the other was Father Goriot . 
Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room ; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard , and stood there for a while . 
He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew . 
His heart beat unwontedly fast ; he remembered Vautrin 's hideous insinuations . 
A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it , saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door : `` I am going , Maurice . 
Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her . '' 
Whereupon this insolent being , who , doubtless , had a right to be insolent , sang an Italian trill , and went towards the window where Eugene was standing , moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student 's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard . 
`` But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer ; madame is disengaged , '' said Maurice , as he returned to the ante-chamber . 
Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate ; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase . 
The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury , in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated . 
Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself . 
The horse took fright at the umbrella , swerved , and dashed forward towards the flight of steps . 
The young man looked round in annoyance , saw Father Goriot , and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy , such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services , or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon , so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance . 
Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile . 
All this happened with lightning speed . 
Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess ' voice . 
`` Oh ! 
Maxime , were you going away ? '' 
she said reproachfully , with a shade of pique in her manner . 
The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury . 
Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him , coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there ; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head , as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning ; there was a soft fragrance about her -- doubtless she was fresh from a bath ; -- her graceful form seemed more flexible , her beauty more luxuriant . 
Her eyes glistened . 
A young man can see everything at a glance ; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air ; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness . 
He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown ; it had fallen slightly open , giving glimpses of a bare throat , on which the student 's eyes rested . 
The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets ; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist ; her throat was a challenge to love ; her feet , thrust into slippers , were daintily small . 
As Maxime took her hand and kissed it , Eugene became aware of Maxime 's existence , and the Countess saw Eugene . 
`` Oh ! 
is that you M. de Rastignac ? 
I am very glad to see you , '' she said , but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart . 
Maxime , as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing , looked from Eugene to the lady , and from the lady to Eugene ; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter . 
An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words : `` Look here , my dear ; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business . '' 
The Countess consulted the young man 's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman 's heart , and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently . 
To begin with , the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other 's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous ; Maxime 's boots , moreover , were elegant and spotless , while his own , in spite of all his care , bore some traces of his recent walk ; and , finally , Maxime 's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully , he looked like a pretty woman , while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two . 
The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall , slender dandy , with the clear gaze and the pale face , one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple . 
Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak ; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight , so that she looked like a white butterfly , and Maxime hurried after her . 
Eugene , in a fury , followed Maxime and the Countess , and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room . 
The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way , and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud , he meant to annoy the dandy . 
It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant 's ball ; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud ; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success , he said to himself , `` This is my rival ; I mean to cut him out . '' 
Rash resolve ! 
He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted , so as to fire first and kill his man . 
Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot , but he had not yet hit the bulls 's eye twenty times out of twenty-two . 
The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth , took up the tongs , and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily , that Anastasie 's fair face suddenly clouded over . 
She turned to Eugene , with a cool , questioning glance that asked plainly , `` Why do you not go ? '' 
a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit . 
Eugene assumed an amiable expression . 
`` Madame , '' he began , `` I hastened to call upon you -- '' He stopped short . 
The door opened , and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared . 
He had left his hat outside , and did not greet the Countess ; he looked meditatively at Rastignac , and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial `` Good morning , '' that astonished Eugene not a little . 
The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance . 
`` M. de Restaud , '' said the Countess , introducing her husband to the law student . 
Eugene bowed profoundly . 
`` This gentleman , '' she continued , presenting Eugene to her husband , `` is M. de Rastignac ; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball . '' 
Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ! 
These words , on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis , by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house , produced a magical effect . 
The Count 's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student 's bow . 
`` Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance , '' he said . 
Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance , and suddenly dropped his insolent manner . 
The mighty name had all the power of a fairy 's wand ; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again ; Rastignac 's carefully drilled faculties returned . 
It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris , and he began to see , though everything was indistinct as yet . 
Mme. Vauquer 's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts . 
`` I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct , '' the Comte de Restaud said , addressing Eugene . 
`` Yes , they are extinct , '' answered the law student . 
`` My great-uncle , the Chevalier de Rastignac , married the heiress of the Marcillac family . 
They had only one daughter , who married the Marechal de Clarimbault , Mme. de Beauseant 's grandfather on the mother 's side . 
We are the younger branch of the family , and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle , the Vice-Admiral , lost all that he had in the King 's service . 
The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated . '' 
`` Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789 ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather , who commanded the Warwick . '' 
Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders , as who should say , `` If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow , it is all over with us . '' 
Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her . 
With a woman 's admirable tact , she began to smile and said : `` Come with me , Maxime ; I have something to say to you . 
We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur . '' 
She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her , mirth and mischief in her whole attitude , and the two went in the direction of the boudoir .
