Mr. Phileas Fogg lived , in 1872 , at No. 7 , Saville Row , Burlington Gardens , the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 . 
He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . 
People said that he resembled Byron -- at least that his head was Byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil Byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old . 
Certainly an Englishman , it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner . 
He was never seen on ` Change , nor at the Bank , nor in the counting-rooms of the `` City '' ; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner ; he had no public employment ; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court , either at the Temple , or Lincoln 's Inn , or Gray 's Inn ; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery , or in the Exchequer , or the Queen 's Bench , or the Ecclesiastical Courts . 
He certainly was not a manufacturer ; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer . 
His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies , and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution , the Artisan 's Association , or the Institution of Arts and Sciences . 
He belonged , in fact , to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital , from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists , founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects . 
Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform , and that was all . 
The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough . 
He was recommended by the Barings , with whom he had an open credit . 
His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current , which was always flush . 
Was Phileas Fogg rich ? 
Undoubtedly . 
But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . 
He was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . 
He was , in short , the least communicative of men . 
He talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . 
His daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled . 
Had he travelled ? 
It was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . 
He often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . 
He must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit . 
It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years . 
Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest , declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else . 
His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist . 
He often won at this game , which , as a silent one , harmonised with his nature ; but his winnings never went into his purse , being reserved as a fund for his charities . 
Mr. Fogg played , not to win , but for the sake of playing . 
The game was in his eyes a contest , a struggle with a difficulty , yet a motionless , unwearying struggle , congenial to his tastes . 
Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children , which may happen to the most honest people ; either relatives or near friends , which is certainly more unusual . 
He lived alone in his house in Saville Row , whither none penetrated . 
A single domestic sufficed to serve him . 
He breakfasted and dined at the club , at hours mathematically fixed , in the same room , at the same table , never taking his meals with other members , much less bringing a guest with him ; and went home at exactly midnight , only to retire at once to bed . 
He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members . 
He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row , either in sleeping or making his toilet . 
When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring , or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns , and illumined by blue painted windows . 
When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club -- its kitchens and pantries , its buttery and dairy -- aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores ; he was served by the gravest waiters , in dress coats , and shoes with swan-skin soles , who proffered the viands in special porcelain , and on the finest linen ; club decanters , of a lost mould , contained his sherry , his port , and his cinnamon-spiced claret ; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice , brought at great cost from the American lakes . 
If to live in this style is to be eccentric , it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity . 
The mansion in Saville Row , though not sumptuous , was exceedingly comfortable . 
The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic , but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular . 
On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster , because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six ; and he was awaiting his successor , who was due at the house between eleven and half-past . 
Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years . 
At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit Saville Row , and repair to the Reform . 
A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated , and James Forster , the dismissed servant , appeared . 
`` The new servant , '' said he . 
A young man of thirty advanced and bowed . 
`` You are a Frenchman , I believe , '' asked Phileas Fogg , `` and your name is John ? '' 
`` Jean , if monsieur pleases , '' replied the newcomer , `` Jean Passepartout , a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another . 
I believe I 'm honest , monsieur , but , to be outspoken , I 've had several trades . 
I 've been an itinerant singer , a circus-rider , when I used to vault like Leotard , and dance on a rope like Blondin . 
Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics , so as to make better use of my talents ; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris , and assisted at many a big fire . 
But I quitted France five years ago , and , wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life , took service as a valet here in England . 
Finding myself out of place , and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom , I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life , and forgetting even the name of Passepartout . '' 
`` Passepartout suits me , '' responded Mr. Fogg . 
`` You are well recommended to me ; I hear a good report of you . 
You know my conditions ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Good ! 
What time is it ? '' 
`` Twenty-two minutes after eleven , '' returned Passepartout , drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket . 
`` You are too slow , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Pardon me , monsieur , it is impossible -- '' `` You are four minutes too slow . 
No matter ; it 's enough to mention the error . 
Now from this moment , twenty-nine minutes after eleven , a.m. , this Wednesday , 2nd October , you are in my service . '' 
Phileas Fogg got up , took his hat in his left hand , put it on his head with an automatic motion , and went off without a word . 
Passepartout heard the street door shut once ; it was his new master going out . 
He heard it shut again ; it was his predecessor , James Forster , departing in his turn . 
Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row . 
`` Faith , '' muttered Passepartout , somewhat flurried , `` I 've seen people at Madame Tussaud 's as lively as my new master ! '' 
Madame Tussaud 's `` people , '' let it be said , are of wax , and are much visited in London ; speech is all that is wanting to make them human . 
During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg , Passepartout had been carefully observing him . 
He appeared to be a man about forty years of age , with fine , handsome features , and a tall , well-shaped figure ; his hair and whiskers were light , his forehead compact and unwrinkled , his face rather pale , his teeth magnificent . 
His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call `` repose in action , '' a quality of those who act rather than talk . 
Calm and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas . 
Seen in the various phases of his daily life , he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced , as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer . 
Phileas Fogg was , indeed , exactitude personified , and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet ; for in men , as well as in animals , the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions . 
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions . 
He never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated . 
He was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment . 
He lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody . 
As for Passepartout , he was a true Parisian of Paris . 
Since he had abandoned his own country for England , taking service as a valet , he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart . 
Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air ; he was an honest fellow , with a pleasant face , lips a trifle protruding , soft-mannered and serviceable , with a good round head , such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend . 
His eyes were blue , his complexion rubicund , his figure almost portly and well-built , his body muscular , and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days . 
His brown hair was somewhat tumbled ; for , while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva 's tresses , Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own : three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet . 
It would be rash to predict how Passepartout 's lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg . 
It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required ; experience alone could solve the question . 
Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years , and now yearned for repose ; but so far he had failed to find it , though he had already served in ten English houses . 
But he could not take root in any of these ; with chagrin , he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular , constantly running about the country , or on the look-out for adventure . 
His last master , young Lord Longferry , Member of Parliament , after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns , was too often brought home in the morning on policemen 's shoulders . 
Passepartout , desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served , ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct ; which , being ill-received , he took his leave . 
Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after . 
He presented himself , and was accepted , as has been seen . 
At half-past eleven , then , Passepartout found himself alone in the house in Saville Row . 
He began its inspection without delay , scouring it from cellar to garret . 
So clean , well-arranged , solemn a mansion pleased him ; it seemed to him like a snail 's shell , lighted and warmed by gas , which sufficed for both these purposes . 
When Passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit , and he was well satisfied with it . 
Electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories ; while on the mantel stood an electric clock , precisely like that in Mr. Fogg 's bedchamber , both beating the same second at the same instant . 
`` That 's good , that 'll do , '' said Passepartout to himself . 
He suddenly observed , hung over the clock , a card which , upon inspection , proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house . 
It comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the Reform Club -- all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten . 
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired . 
Mr. Fogg 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste . 
Each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes . 
In short , the house in Saville Row , which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan , was cosiness , comfort , and method idealised . 
There was no study , nor were there books , which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg ; for at the Reform two libraries , one of general literature and the other of law and politics , were at his service . 
A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom , constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars ; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere ; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits . 
Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom , he rubbed his hands , a broad smile overspread his features , and he said joyfully , `` This is just what I wanted ! 
Ah , we shall get on together , Mr. Fogg and I ! 
What a domestic and regular gentleman ! 
A real machine ; well , I do n't mind serving a machine . '' 
Phileas Fogg , having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven , and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times , and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times , reached the Reform Club , an imposing edifice in Pall Mall , which could not have cost less than three millions . 
He repaired at once to the dining-room , the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden , where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring ; and took his place at the habitual table , the cover of which had already been laid for him . 
His breakfast consisted of a side-dish , a broiled fish with Reading sauce , a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms , a rhubarb and gooseberry tart , and a morsel of Cheshire cheese , the whole being washed down with several cups of tea , for which the Reform is famous . 
He rose at thirteen minutes to one , and directed his steps towards the large hall , a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings . 
A flunkey handed him an uncut Times , which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation . 
The perusal of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four , whilst the Standard , his next task , occupied him till the dinner hour . 
Dinner passed as breakfast had done , and Mr. Fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six . 
Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the fireplace , where a coal fire was steadily burning . 
They were Mr. Fogg 's usual partners at whist : Andrew Stuart , an engineer ; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , bankers ; Thomas Flanagan , a brewer ; and Gauthier Ralph , one of the Directors of the Bank of England -- all rich and highly respectable personages , even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance . 
`` Well , Ralph , '' said Thomas Flanagan , `` what about that robbery ? '' 
`` Oh , '' replied Stuart , `` the Bank will lose the money . '' 
`` On the contrary , '' broke in Ralph , `` I hope we may put our hands on the robber . 
Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent , and he 'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers . '' 
`` But have you got the robber 's description ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` In the first place , he is no robber at all , '' returned Ralph , positively . 
`` What ! 
a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds , no robber ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Perhaps he 's a manufacturer , then . '' 
`` The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman . '' 
It was Phileas Fogg , whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers , who made this remark . 
He bowed to his friends , and entered into the conversation . 
The affair which formed its subject , and which was town talk , had occurred three days before at the Bank of England . 
A package of banknotes , to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds , had been taken from the principal cashier 's table , that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence . 
Of course , he could not have his eyes everywhere . 
Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public . 
There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures ; gold , silver , banknotes are freely exposed , at the mercy of the first comer . 
A keen observer of English customs relates that , being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day , he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds . 
He took it up , scrutinised it , passed it to his neighbour , he to the next man , and so on until the ingot , going from hand to hand , was transferred to the end of a dark entry ; nor did it return to its place for half an hour . 
Meanwhile , the cashier had not so much as raised his head . 
But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly . 
The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the `` drawing office , '' the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss . 
As soon as the robbery was discovered , picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool , Glasgow , Havre , Suez , Brindisi , New York , and other ports , inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds , and five per cent . 
on the sum that might be recovered . 
Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail , and a judicial examination was at once entered upon . 
There were real grounds for supposing , as the Daily Telegraph said , that the thief did not belong to a professional band . 
On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners , and with a well-to-do air , had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed . 
A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives ; and some hopeful spirits , of whom Ralph was one , did not despair of his apprehension . 
The papers and clubs were full of the affair , and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit ; and the Reform Club was especially agitated , several of its members being Bank officials . 
Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain , for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity . 
But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence ; and , as they placed themselves at the whist-table , they continued to argue the matter . 
Stuart and Flanagan played together , while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner . 
As the game proceeded the conversation ceased , excepting between the rubbers , when it revived again . 
`` I maintain , '' said Stuart , `` that the chances are in favour of the thief , who must be a shrewd fellow . '' 
`` Well , but where can he fly to ? '' 
asked Ralph . 
`` No country is safe for him . '' 
`` Pshaw ! '' 
`` Where could he go , then ? '' 
`` Oh , I do n't know that . 
The world is big enough . '' 
`` It was once , '' said Phileas Fogg , in a low tone . 
`` Cut , sir , '' he added , handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan . 
The discussion fell during the rubber , after which Stuart took up its thread . 
`` What do you mean by ` once ' ? 
Has the world grown smaller ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' returned Ralph . 
`` I agree with Mr. Fogg . 
The world has grown smaller , since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago . 
And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed . '' 
`` And also why the thief can get away more easily . '' 
`` Be so good as to play , Mr. Stuart , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced , and when the hand was finished , said eagerly : `` You have a strange way , Ralph , of proving that the world has grown smaller . 
So , because you can go round it in three months -- '' `` In eighty days , '' interrupted Phileas Fogg . 
`` That is true , gentlemen , '' added John Sullivan . 
`` Only eighty days , now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad , on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway , has been opened . 
Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph : From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi , by rail and steamboats ... 7 days From Suez to Bombay , by steamer ... 13 '' From Bombay to Calcutta , by rail ... 3 '' From Calcutta to Hong Kong , by steamer ... 13 '' From Hong Kong to Yokohama -LRB- Japan -RRB- , by steamer ... 6 '' From Yokohama to San Francisco , by steamer ... 22 '' From San Francisco to New York , by rail ... 7 '' From New York to London , by steamer and rail ... 9 '' ------ Total ... 80 days . '' 
`` Yes , in eighty days ! '' 
exclaimed Stuart , who in his excitement made a false deal . 
`` But that does n't take into account bad weather , contrary winds , shipwrecks , railway accidents , and so on . '' 
`` All included , '' returned Phileas Fogg , continuing to play despite the discussion . 
`` But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails , '' replied Stuart ; `` suppose they stop the trains , pillage the luggage-vans , and scalp the passengers ! '' 
`` All included , '' calmly retorted Fogg ; adding , as he threw down the cards , `` Two trumps . '' 
Stuart , whose turn it was to deal , gathered them up , and went on : `` You are right , theoretically , Mr. Fogg , but practically -- '' `` Practically also , Mr. Stuart . '' 
`` I 'd like to see you do it in eighty days . '' 
`` It depends on you . 
Shall we go ? '' 
`` Heaven preserve me ! 
But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey , made under these conditions , is impossible . '' 
`` Quite possible , on the contrary , '' returned Mr. Fogg . 
`` Well , make it , then ! '' 
`` The journey round the world in eighty days ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I should like nothing better . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` At once . 
Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense . '' 
`` It 's absurd ! '' 
cried Stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend . 
`` Come , let 's go on with the game . '' 
`` Deal over again , then , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
`` There 's a false deal . '' 
Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand ; then suddenly put them down again . 
`` Well , Mr. Fogg , '' said he , `` it shall be so : I will wager the four thousand on it . '' 
`` Calm yourself , my dear Stuart , '' said Fallentin . 
`` It 's only a joke . '' 
`` When I say I 'll wager , '' returned Stuart , `` I mean it . '' 
`` All right , '' said Mr. Fogg ; and , turning to the others , he continued : `` I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring 's which I will willingly risk upon it . '' 
`` Twenty thousand pounds ! '' 
cried Sullivan . 
`` Twenty thousand pounds , which you would lose by a single accidental delay ! '' 
`` The unforeseen does not exist , '' quietly replied Phileas Fogg . 
`` But , Mr. Fogg , eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made . '' 
`` A well-used minimum suffices for everything . '' 
`` But , in order not to exceed it , you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers , and from the steamers upon the trains again . '' 
`` I will jump -- mathematically . '' 
`` You are joking . '' 
`` A true Englishman does n't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager , '' replied Phileas Fogg , solemnly . 
`` I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less ; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours , or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes . 
Do you accept ? '' 
`` We accept , '' replied Messrs. Stuart , Fallentin , Sullivan , Flanagan , and Ralph , after consulting each other . 
`` Good , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine . 
I will take it . '' 
`` This very evening ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` This very evening , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
He took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added , `` As today is Wednesday , the 2nd of October , I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club , on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine p.m. ; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at Baring 's , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen . 
Here is a cheque for the amount . '' 
A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties , during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure . 
He certainly did not bet to win , and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds , half of his fortune , because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult , not to say unattainable , project . 
As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated ; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend . 
The clock struck seven , and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure . 
`` I am quite ready now , '' was his tranquil response . 
`` Diamonds are trumps : be so good as to play , gentlemen . '' 
Having won twenty guineas at whist , and taken leave of his friends , Phileas Fogg , at twenty-five minutes past seven , left the Reform Club . 
Passepartout , who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties , was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour ; for , according to rule , he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight . 
Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom , and called out , `` Passepartout ! '' 
Passepartout did not reply . 
It could not be he who was called ; it was not the right hour . 
`` Passepartout ! '' 
repeated Mr. Fogg , without raising his voice . 
Passepartout made his appearance . 
`` I 've called you twice , '' observed his master . 
`` But it is not midnight , '' responded the other , showing his watch . 
`` I know it ; I do n't blame you . 
We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes . '' 
A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout 's round face ; clearly he had not comprehended his master . 
`` Monsieur is going to leave home ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Phileas Fogg . 
`` We are going round the world . '' 
Passepartout opened wide his eyes , raised his eyebrows , held up his hands , and seemed about to collapse , so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment . 
`` Round the world ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` In eighty days , '' responded Mr. Fogg . 
`` So we have n't a moment to lose . '' 
`` But the trunks ? '' 
gasped Passepartout , unconsciously swaying his head from right to left . 
`` We 'll have no trunks ; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you . 
We 'll buy our clothes on the way . 
Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak , and some stout shoes , though we shall do little walking . 
Make haste ! '' 
Passepartout tried to reply , but could not . 
He went out , mounted to his own room , fell into a chair , and muttered : `` That 's good , that is ! 
And I , who wanted to remain quiet ! '' 
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure . 
Around the world in eighty days ! 
Was his master a fool ? 
No . 
Was this a joke , then ? 
They were going to Dover ; good ! 
To Calais ; good again ! 
After all , Passepartout , who had been away from France five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again . 
Perhaps they would go as far as Paris , and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more . 
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there ; no doubt -- but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto ! 
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself ; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to Mr. Fogg . 
Mr. Fogg was quite ready . 
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw 's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . 
He took the carpet-bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes , which would pass wherever he might go . 
`` You have forgotten nothing ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing , monsieur . '' 
`` My mackintosh and cloak ? '' 
`` Here they are . '' 
`` Good ! 
Take this carpet-bag , '' handing it to Passepartout . 
`` Take good care of it , for there are twenty thousand pounds in it . '' 
Passepartout nearly dropped the bag , as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold , and weighed him down . 
Master and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross . 
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight . 
Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms . 
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , `` Here , my good woman . 
I 'm glad that I met you ; '' and passed on . 
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart . 
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased , Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the Reform . 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said he , `` I 'm off , you see ; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon . '' 
`` Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , Mr. Fogg , '' said Ralph politely . 
`` We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour . '' 
`` You do not forget when you are due in London again ? '' 
asked Stuart . 
`` In eighty days ; on Saturday , the 21st of December , 1872 , at a quarter before nine p.m. Good-bye , gentlemen . '' 
Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station . 
The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling . 
Phileas Fogg , snugly ensconced in his corner , did not open his lips . 
Passepartout , not yet recovered from his stupefaction , clung mechanically to the carpet-bag , with its enormous treasure . 
Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham , Passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` Alas ! 
In my hurry -- I -- I forgot -- '' `` What ? '' 
`` To turn off the gas in my room ! '' 
`` Very well , young man , '' returned Mr. Fogg , coolly ; `` it will burn -- at your expense . '' 
Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End . 
The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club , and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members . 
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England . 
The boasted `` tour of the world '' was talked about , disputed , argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim . 
Some took sides with Phileas Fogg , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him ; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling . 
The Times , Standard , Morning Post , and Daily News , and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg 's project as madness ; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him . 
People in general thought him a lunatic , and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer . 
Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question , for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English ; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg 's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers . 
At first some rash individuals , principally of the gentler sex , espoused his cause , which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait , copied from a photograph in the Reform Club . 
A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say , `` Why not , after all ? 
Stranger things have come to pass . '' 
At last a long article appeared , on the 7th of October , in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society , which treated the question from every point of view , and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise . 
Everything , it said , was against the travellers , every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature . 
A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival , which was impossible , was absolutely necessary to his success . 
He might , perhaps , reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours , in Europe , where the distances were relatively moderate ; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days , and the United States in seven , could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task ? 
There were accidents to machinery , the liability of trains to run off the line , collisions , bad weather , the blocking up by snow -- were not all these against Phileas Fogg ? 
Would he not find himself , when travelling by steamer in winter , at the mercy of the winds and fogs ? 
Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time ? 
But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication ; should Phileas Fogg once miss , even by an hour ; a steamer , he would have to wait for the next , and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain . 
This article made a great deal of noise , and , being copied into all the papers , seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist . 
Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men , who are of a higher class than mere gamblers ; to bet is in the English temperament . 
Not only the members of the Reform , but the general public , made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg , who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse . 
Bonds were issued , and made their appearance on ` Change ; `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' were offered at par or at a premium , and a great business was done in them . 
But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared , the demand began to subside : `` Phileas Fogg '' declined . 
They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred ! 
Lord Albemarle , an elderly paralytic gentleman , was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left . 
This noble lord , who was fastened to his chair , would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world , if it took ten years ; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg . 
When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , `` If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman . '' 
The Fogg party dwindled more and more , everybody was going against him , and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one ; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price . 
The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening , when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands : Suez to London . 
Rowan , Commissioner of Police , Scotland Yard : I 've found the bank robber , Phileas Fogg . 
Send with out delay warrant of arrest to Bombay . 
Fix , Detective . 
The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous . 
The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber . 
His photograph , which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club , was minutely examined , and it betrayed , feature by feature , the description of the robber which had been provided to the police . 
The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled ; his solitary ways , his sudden departure ; and it seemed clear that , in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager , he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives , and throw them off his track . 
The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows : The steamer Mongolia , belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company , built of iron , of two thousand eight hundred tons burden , and five hundred horse-power , was due at eleven o'clock a.m. on Wednesday , the 9th of October , at Suez . 
The Mongolia plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal , and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company , always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez , and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay . 
Two men were promenading up and down the wharves , among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village -- now , thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps , a fast-growing town . 
One was the British consul at Suez , who , despite the prophecies of the English Government , and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson , was in the habit of seeing , from his office window , English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal , by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half . 
The other was a small , slight-built personage , with a nervous , intelligent face , and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching . 
He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience , nervously pacing up and down , and unable to stand still for a moment . 
This was Fix , one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber ; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez , and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters , or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal , which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London . 
The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success , and awaited with a feverish impatience , easy to understand , the arrival of the steamer Mongolia . 
`` So you say , consul , '' asked he for the twentieth time , `` that this steamer is never behind time ? '' 
`` No , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul . 
`` She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said , and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft . 
I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company 's regulations , and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed . '' 
`` Does she come directly from Brindisi ? '' 
`` Directly from Brindisi ; she takes on the Indian mails there , and she left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience , Mr. Fix ; she will not be late . 
But really , I do n't see how , from the description you have , you will be able to recognise your man , even if he is on board the Mongolia . '' 
`` A man rather feels the presence of these fellows , consul , than recognises them . 
You must have a scent for them , and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing , seeing , and smelling . 
I 've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , I 'll answer for it ; he 'll not slip through my fingers . '' 
`` I hope so , Mr. Fix , for it was a heavy robbery . '' 
`` A magnificent robbery , consul ; fifty-five thousand pounds ! 
We do n't often have such windfalls . 
Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays ! 
A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said the consul , `` I like your way of talking , and hope you 'll succeed ; but I fear you will find it far from easy . 
Do n't you see , the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man ? '' 
`` Consul , '' remarked the detective , dogmatically , `` great robbers always resemble honest folks . 
Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take , and that is to remain honest ; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand . 
The artistic thing is , to unmask honest countenances ; it 's no light task , I admit , but a real art . '' 
Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit . 
Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated ; sailors of various nations , merchants , ship-brokers , porters , fellahs , bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected . 
The weather was clear , and slightly chilly . 
The minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun . 
A jetty pier , some two thousand yards along , extended into the roadstead . 
A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats , some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys , were discernible on the Red Sea . 
As he passed among the busy crowd , Fix , according to habit , scrutinised the passers-by with a keen , rapid glance . 
It was now half-past ten . 
`` The steamer does n't come ! '' 
he exclaimed , as the port clock struck . 
`` She ca n't be far off now , '' returned his companion . 
`` How long will she stop at Suez ? '' 
`` Four hours ; long enough to get in her coal . 
It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden , at the other end of the Red Sea , and she has to take in a fresh coal supply . '' 
`` And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay ? '' 
`` Without putting in anywhere . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said Fix . 
`` If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at Suez , so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route . 
He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in India , which is English soil . '' 
`` Unless , '' objected the consul , `` he is exceptionally shrewd . 
An English criminal , you know , is always better concealed in London than anywhere else . '' 
This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office . 
Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia . 
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . 
But Fix 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia . 
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer . 
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road . 
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay . 
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . 
Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . 
Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . 
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard . 
`` Is this your passport ? '' 
asked he . 
`` No , it 's my master 's . '' 
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . '' 
`` But he must go to the consul 's in person , so as to establish his identity . '' 
`` Oh , is that necessary ? '' 
`` Quite indispensable . '' 
`` And where is the consulate ? '' 
`` There , on the corner of the square , '' said Fix , pointing to a house two hundred steps off . 
`` I 'll go and fetch my master , who wo n't be much pleased , however , to be disturbed . '' 
The passenger bowed to Fix , and returned to the steamer . 
The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consul 's office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official . 
`` Consul , '' said he , without preamble , `` I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia . '' 
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport . 
`` Well , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul , `` I shall not be sorry to see the rascal 's face ; but perhaps he wo n't come here -- that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be . 
A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . '' 
`` If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come . '' 
`` To have his passport visaed ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues . 
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do ; but I hope you will not visa the passport . '' 
`` Why not ? 
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse . '' 
`` Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London . '' 
`` Ah , that 's your look-out . 
But I can not -- '' The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay . 
The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it . 
The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst Fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room . 
`` You are Mr. Phileas Fogg ? '' 
said the consul , after reading the passport . 
`` I am . '' 
`` And this man is your servant ? '' 
`` He is : a Frenchman , named Passepartout . '' 
`` You are from London ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And you are going -- '' `` To Bombay . '' 
`` Very good , sir . 
You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? '' 
`` I know it , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg ; `` but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by Suez . '' 
`` Very well , sir . '' 
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal . 
Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant . 
`` Well ? '' 
queried the detective . 
`` Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , '' replied the consul . 
`` Possibly ; but that is not the question . 
Do you think , consul , that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ? '' 
`` I concede that ; but then , you know , all descriptions -- '' `` I 'll make certain of it , '' interrupted Fix . 
`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a Frenchman , and ca n't help talking . 
Excuse me for a little while , consul . '' 
Fix started off in search of Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin . 
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` Left Paris , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` Left Turin , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158 + ; or , in days , six days and a half . '' 
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . 
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . 
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . 
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics . 
Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything . 
`` Well , my friend , '' said the detective , coming up with him , `` is your passport visaed ? '' 
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? '' 
responded Passepartout . 
`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . '' 
`` And you are looking about you ? '' 
`` Yes ; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream . 
So this is Suez ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` In Egypt ? '' 
`` Certainly , in Egypt . '' 
`` And in Africa ? '' 
`` In Africa . '' 
`` In Africa ! '' 
repeated Passepartout . 
`` Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris ; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the Northern and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain ! 
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees ! '' 
`` You are in a great hurry , then ? '' 
`` I am not , but my master is . 
By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts . 
We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag . '' 
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . '' 
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . '' 
And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along . 
`` Above all , '' said he ; `` do n't let me lose the steamer . '' 
`` You have plenty of time ; it 's only twelve o'clock . '' 
Passepartout pulled out his big watch . 
`` Twelve ! '' 
he exclaimed ; `` why , it 's only eight minutes before ten . '' 
`` Your watch is slow . '' 
`` My watch ?
