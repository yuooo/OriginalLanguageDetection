It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered ; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected . 
Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air , Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort Kearney , the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions . 
But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg , and Passepartout was delighted with her decision ; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him . 
It would be difficult to guess the detective 's thoughts . 
Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg 's return , or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal , who , his journey round the world completed , would think himself absolutely safe in England ? 
Perhaps Fix 's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified ; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty , and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible . 
At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start . 
The passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks . 
The two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour . 
The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha , as the birds fly , is at most two hundred miles . 
If the wind held good , the distance might be traversed in five hours ; if no accident happened the sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock . 
What a journey ! 
The travellers , huddled close together , could not speak for the cold , intensified by the rapidity at which they were going . 
The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves . 
When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails . 
Mudge , who was at the rudder , kept in a straight line , and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make . 
All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine . 
A top-mast was hoisted , and another jib , held out to the wind , added its force to the other sails . 
Although the speed could not be exactly estimated , the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour . 
`` If nothing breaks , '' said Mudge , `` we shall get there ! '' 
Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge 's interest to reach Omaha within the time agreed on , by the offer of a handsome reward . 
The prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . 
It seemed like a vast frozen lake . 
The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island , Columbus , an important Nebraska town , Schuyler , and Fremont , to Omaha . 
It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River . 
The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . 
Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River , because it was frozen . 
The road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind . 
But the breeze , far from lessening its force , blew as if to bend the mast , which , however , the metallic lashings held firmly . 
These lashings , like the chords of a stringed instrument , resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow . 
The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody . 
`` Those chords give the fifth and the octave , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
These were the only words he uttered during the journey . 
Aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . 
As for Passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . 
With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . 
They would reach New York on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool . 
Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally , Fix , by the hand . 
He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge , the only means of reaching Omaha in time ; but , checked by some presentiment , he kept his usual reserve . 
One thing , however , Passepartout would never forget , and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made , without hesitation , to rescue him from the Sioux . 
Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life . 
No ! 
His servant would never forget that ! 
While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different , the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow . 
The creeks it passed over were not perceived . 
Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness . 
The plain was absolutely deserted . 
Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island . 
Neither village , station , nor fort appeared . 
From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree , whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind . 
Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose , or bands of gaunt , famished , ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge . 
Passepartout , revolver in hand , held himself ready to fire on those which came too near . 
Had an accident then happened to the sledge , the travellers , attacked by these beasts , would have been in the most terrible danger ; but it held on its even course , soon gained on the wolves , and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind . 
About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the Platte River . 
He said nothing , but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha . 
In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails , whilst the sledge , carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it , went on half a mile further with its sails unspread . 
It stopped at last , and Mudge , pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow , said : `` We have got there ! '' 
Arrived ! 
Arrived at the station which is in daily communication , by numerous trains , with the Atlantic seaboard ! 
Passepartout and Fix jumped off , stretched their stiffened limbs , and aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge . 
Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge , whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped , and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station . 
The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town . 
Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad , which runs directly east , and passes fifty stations . 
A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the station , and they only had time to get into the cars . 
They had seen nothing of Omaha ; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted , as they were not travelling to see the sights . 
The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa , by Council Bluffs , Des Moines , and Iowa City . 
During the night it crossed the Mississippi at Davenport , and by Rock Island entered Illinois . 
The next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached Chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan . 
Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York ; but trains are not wanting at Chicago . 
Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other , and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne , and Chicago Railway left at full speed , as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose . 
It traversed Indiana , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey like a flash , rushing through towns with antique names , some of which had streets and car-tracks , but as yet no houses . 
At last the Hudson came into view ; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the Cunard line . 
The China , for Liverpool , had started three-quarters of an hour before ! 
The China , in leaving , seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg 's last hope . 
None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects . 
The Pereire , of the French Transatlantic Company , whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort , did not leave until the 14th ; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London , but to Havre ; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg 's last efforts of no avail . 
The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day , and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager . 
Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw , which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers . 
Passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour . 
It was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! 
And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin Mr. Fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations . 
Mr. Fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the Cunard pier , only said : `` We will consult about what is best to-morrow . 
Come . '' 
The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat , and drove in a carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel , on Broadway . 
Rooms were engaged , and the night passed , briefly to Phileas Fogg , who slept profoundly , but very long to Aouda and the others , whose agitation did not permit them to rest . 
The next day was the 12th of December . 
From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes . 
If Phileas Fogg had left in the China , one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic , he would have reached Liverpool , and then London , within the period agreed upon . 
Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone , after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . 
He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . 
Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . 
But they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , Phileas Fogg could make no use . 
He seemed about to give up all hope , when he espied , anchored at the Battery , a cable 's length off at most , a trading vessel , with a screw , well-shaped , whose funnel , puffing a cloud of smoke , indicated that she was getting ready for departure . 
Phileas Fogg hailed a boat , got into it , and soon found himself on board the Henrietta , iron-hulled , wood-built above . 
He ascended to the deck , and asked for the captain , who forthwith presented himself . 
He was a man of fifty , a sort of sea-wolf , with big eyes , a complexion of oxidised copper , red hair and thick neck , and a growling voice . 
`` The captain ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` I am the captain . '' 
`` I am Phileas Fogg , of London . '' 
`` And I am Andrew Speedy , of Cardiff . '' 
`` You are going to put to sea ? '' 
`` In an hour . '' 
`` You are bound for -- '' `` Bordeaux . '' 
`` And your cargo ? '' 
`` No freight . 
Going in ballast . '' 
`` Have you any passengers ? '' 
`` No passengers . 
Never have passengers . 
Too much in the way . '' 
`` Is your vessel a swift one ? '' 
`` Between eleven and twelve knots . 
The Henrietta , well known . '' 
`` Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool ? '' 
`` To Liverpool ? 
Why not to China ? '' 
`` I said Liverpool . '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` No ? '' 
`` No . 
I am setting out for Bordeaux , and shall go to Bordeaux . '' 
`` Money is no object ? '' 
`` None . '' 
The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply . 
`` But the owners of the Henrietta -- '' resumed Phileas Fogg . 
`` The owners are myself , '' replied the captain . 
`` The vessel belongs to me . '' 
`` I will freight it for you . '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I will buy it of you . '' 
`` No . '' 
Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment ; but the situation was a grave one . 
It was not at New York as at Hong Kong , nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere . 
Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle . 
Now money failed . 
Still , some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat , unless by balloon -- which would have been venturesome , besides not being capable of being put in practice . 
It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea , for he said to the captain , `` Well , will you carry me to Bordeaux ? '' 
`` No , not if you paid me two hundred dollars . '' 
`` I offer you two thousand . '' 
`` Apiece ? '' 
`` Apiece . '' 
`` And there are four of you ? '' 
`` Four . '' 
Captain Speedy began to scratch his head . 
There were eight thousand dollars to gain , without changing his route ; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers . 
Besides , passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers , but valuable merchandise . 
`` I start at nine o'clock , '' said Captain Speedy , simply . 
`` Are you and your party ready ? '' 
`` We will be on board at nine o'clock , '' replied , no less simply , Mr. Fogg . 
It was half-past eight . 
To disembark from the Henrietta , jump into a hack , hurry to the St. Nicholas , and return with Aouda , Passepartout , and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time , and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him . 
They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor . 
When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost , he uttered a prolonged `` Oh ! '' 
which extended throughout his vocal gamut . 
As for Fix , he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified . 
When they reached England , even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea , more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent ! 
An hour after , the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson , turned the point of Sandy Hook , and put to sea . 
During the day she skirted Long Island , passed Fire Island , and directed her course rapidly eastward . 
At noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel 's position . 
It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy . 
Not the least in the world . 
It was Phileas Fogg , Esquire . 
As for Captain Speedy , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive . 
What had happened was very simple . 
Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool , but the captain would not carry him there . 
Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux , and , during the thirty hours he had been on board , had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers , who were only an occasional crew , and were not on the best terms with the captain , went over to him in a body . 
This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy ; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin ; and why , in short , the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool . 
It was very clear , to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft , that he had been a sailor . 
How the adventure ended will be seen anon . 
Aouda was anxious , though she said nothing . 
As for Passepartout , he thought Mr. Fogg 's manoeuvre simply glorious . 
The captain had said `` between eleven and twelve knots , '' and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction . 
If , then -- for there were `` ifs '' still -- the sea did not become too boisterous , if the wind did not veer round to the east , if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery , the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days , between the 12th and the 21st of December . 
It is true that , once arrived , the affair on board the Henrietta , added to that of the Bank of England , might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire . 
During the first days , they went along smoothly enough . 
The sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north-east , the sails were hoisted , and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer . 
Passepartout was delighted . 
His master 's last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him . 
Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow . 
He formed warm friendships with the sailors , and amazed them with his acrobatic feats . 
He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen , and that the stokers fired up like heroes . 
His loquacious good-humour infected everyone . 
He had forgotten the past , its vexations and delays . 
He only thought of the end , so nearly accomplished ; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience , as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta . 
Often , also , the worthy fellow revolved around Fix , looking at him with a keen , distrustful eye ; but he did not speak to him , for their old intimacy no longer existed . 
Fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . 
The conquest of the Henrietta , the bribery of the crew , Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him . 
He did not know what to think . 
For , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg 's command , was not going to Liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety . 
The conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair . 
As for Captain Speedy , he continued to howl and growl in his cabin ; and Passepartout , whose duty it was to carry him his meals , courageous as he was , took the greatest precautions . 
Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board . 
On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . 
Ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south-east . 
This was a misfortune . 
Mr. Fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . 
She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . 
The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves . 
Passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . 
But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . 
The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . 
Sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead . 
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour . 
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless . 
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg 's departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed . 
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed . 
In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain . 
In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season . 
Passepartout said nothing ; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam . 
On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to Mr. Fogg , and began to speak earnestly with him . 
Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy . 
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying . 
He finally managed to catch a few words , and was sure he heard his master say , `` You are certain of what you tell me ? '' 
`` Certain , sir , '' replied the engineer . 
`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux , we have n't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool . '' 
`` I will consider , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
Passepartout understood it all ; he was seized with mortal anxiety . 
The coal was giving out ! 
`` Ah , if my master can get over that , '' muttered he , `` he 'll be a famous man ! '' 
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard . 
`` Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` Ass ! '' 
replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel . 
Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend ; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained . 
And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt ? 
It was difficult to imagine . 
Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . '' 
A few moments after , the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke . 
The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on ; but on the 18th , the engineer , as he had predicted , announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day . 
`` Do not let the fires go down , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` Keep them up to the last . 
Let the valves be filled . '' 
Towards noon Phileas Fogg , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy . 
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger . 
He went to the poop , saying to himself , `` He will be like a madman ! '' 
In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck . 
The bomb was Captain Speedy . 
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
were the first words his anger permitted him to utter . 
Had the poor man been an apoplectic , he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
he repeated , with purple face . 
`` Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool , '' replied Mr. Fogg , with imperturbable calmness . 
`` Pirate ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy . 
`` I have sent for you , sir -- '' `` Pickaroon ! '' '' 
-- sir , '' continued Mr. Fogg , `` to ask you to sell me your vessel . '' 
`` No ! 
By all the devils , no ! '' 
`` But I shall be obliged to burn her . '' 
`` Burn the Henrietta ! '' 
`` Yes ; at least the upper part of her . 
The coal has given out . '' 
`` Burn my vessel ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy , who could scarcely pronounce the words . 
`` A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars ! '' 
`` Here are sixty thousand , '' replied Phileas Fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills . 
This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy . 
An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars . 
The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger . 
The Henrietta was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain . 
The bomb would not go off after all . 
Mr. Fogg had taken away the match . 
`` And I shall still have the iron hull , '' said the captain in a softer tone . 
`` The iron hull and the engine . 
Is it agreed ? '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
And Andrew Speedy , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket . 
During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit . 
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft ! 
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank . 
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr. Fogg said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir . 
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December . 
I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool -- '' `` And I did well ! '' 
cried Andrew Speedy ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! '' 
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , Captain -- '' `` Fogg . '' 
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the Yankee about you . '' 
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr. Fogg said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? '' 
`` Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts -- all the wood , that is . '' 
`` Very well . 
Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . '' 
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed . 
On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires . 
Passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . 
There was a perfect rage for demolition . 
The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk . 
But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light . 
By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown . 
Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London ; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool , with all steam on . 
And the steam was about to give out altogether ! 
`` Sir , '' said Captain Speedy , who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg 's project , `` I really commiserate you . 
Everything is against you . 
We are only opposite Queenstown . '' 
`` Ah , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` is that place where we see the lights Queenstown ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Can we enter the harbour ? '' 
`` Not under three hours . 
Only at high tide . '' 
`` Stay , '' replied Mr. Fogg calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune . 
Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails . 
These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start ; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats , and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers . 
Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way . 
Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening . 
The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning , it then being high tide ; and Phileas Fogg , after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for . 
The party went on shore at once . 
Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot ; but he did not . 
Why ? 
What struggle was going on within him ? 
Had he changed his mind about `` his man '' ? 
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ? 
He did not , however , abandon Mr. Fogg . 
They all got upon the train , which was just ready to start , at half-past one ; at dawn of day they were in Dublin ; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which , disdaining to rise upon the waves , invariably cut through them . 
Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay , at twenty minutes before twelve , 21st December . 
He was only six hours distant from London . 
But at this moment Fix came up , put his hand upon Mr. Fogg 's shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , `` You are really Phileas Fogg ? '' 
`` I am . '' 
`` I arrest you in the Queen 's name ! '' 
Phileas Fogg was in prison . 
He had been shut up in the Custom House , and he was to be transferred to London the next day . 
Passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen . 
Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand . 
Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber . 
The young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly . 
As for Fix , he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty , whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not . 
The thought then struck Passepartout , that he was the cause of this new misfortune ! 
Had he not concealed Fix 's errand from his master ? 
When Fix revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told Mr. Fogg ? 
If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake ; at least , Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil . 
Passepartout wept till he was blind , and felt like blowing his brains out . 
Aouda and he had remained , despite the cold , under the portico of the Custom House . 
Neither wished to leave the place ; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again . 
That gentleman was really ruined , and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end . 
This arrest was fatal . 
Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December , he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club , that is , nine hours and a quarter ; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours . 
If anyone , at this moment , had entered the Custom House , he would have found Mr. Fogg seated , motionless , calm , and without apparent anger , upon a wooden bench . 
He was not , it is true , resigned ; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion . 
Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages , all the more terrible because contained , and which only burst forth , with an irresistible force , at the last moment ? 
No one could tell . 
There he sat , calmly waiting -- for what ? 
Did he still cherish hope ? 
Did he still believe , now that the door of this prison was closed upon him , that he would succeed ? 
However that may have been , Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table , and observed its advancing hands . 
Not a word escaped his lips , but his look was singularly set and stern . 
The situation , in any event , was a terrible one , and might be thus stated : if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined ; if he was a knave , he was caught . 
Did escape occur to him ? 
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ? 
Did he think of escaping from it ? 
Possibly ; for once he walked slowly around the room . 
But the door was locked , and the window heavily barred with iron rods . 
He sat down again , and drew his journal from his pocket . 
On the line where these words were written , `` 21st December , Saturday , Liverpool , '' he added , `` 80th day , 11.40 a.m. , '' and waited . 
The Custom House clock struck one . 
Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast . 
Two hours ! 
Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train , he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before nine , p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled . 
At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside , then a hasty opening of doors . 
Passepartout 's voice was audible , and immediately after that of Fix . 
Phileas Fogg 's eyes brightened for an instant . 
The door swung open , and he saw Passepartout , Aouda , and Fix , who hurried towards him . 
Fix was out of breath , and his hair was in disorder . 
He could not speak . 
`` Sir , '' he stammered , `` sir -- forgive me -- most -- unfortunate resemblance -- robber arrested three days ago -- you are free ! '' 
Phileas Fogg was free ! 
He walked to the detective , looked him steadily in the face , and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life , or which he ever would make , drew back his arms , and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down . 
`` Well hit ! '' 
cried Passepartout , `` Parbleu ! 
that 's what you might call a good application of English fists ! '' 
Fix , who found himself on the floor , did not utter a word . 
He had only received his deserts . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout left the Custom House without delay , got into a cab , and in a few moments descended at the station . 
Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for London . 
It was forty minutes past two . 
The express train had left thirty-five minutes before . 
Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train . 
There were several rapid locomotives on hand ; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock . 
At that hour Phileas Fogg , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards London with Aouda and his faithful servant . 
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout . 
But there were forced delays , and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine . 
Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes . 
He had lost the wager ! 
The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day , if they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home . 
His doors and windows were still closed , no appearance of change was visible . 
After leaving the station , Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions , and quietly went to his domicile . 
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity . 
Ruined ! 
And by the blundering of the detective ! 
After having steadily traversed that long journey , overcome a hundred obstacles , braved many dangers , and still found time to do some good on his way , to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen , and against which he was unarmed ; it was terrible ! 
But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him . 
There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings , and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club . 
So great had been the expense of his tour that , even had he won , it would not have enriched him ; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself , being a man who rather laid wagers for honour 's sake than for the stake proposed . 
But this wager totally ruined him . 
Mr. Fogg 's course , however , was fully decided upon ; he knew what remained for him to do . 
A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda , who was overwhelmed with grief at her protector 's misfortune . 
From the words which Mr. Fogg dropped , she saw that he was meditating some serious project . 
Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing . 
First of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days . 
He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear . 
The night passed . 
Mr. Fogg went to bed , but did he sleep ? 
Aouda did not once close her eyes . 
Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his master 's door . 
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get Aouda 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself . 
He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights . 
In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment 's conversation with the young lady . 
Passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them . 
He looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him . 
His heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster . 
Yes ! 
if he had warned Mr. Fogg , and had betrayed Fix 's projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to Liverpool , and then -- Passepartout could hold in no longer . 
`` My master ! 
Mr. Fogg ! '' 
he cried , `` why do you not curse me ? 
It was my fault that -- '' `` I blame no one , '' returned Phileas Fogg , with perfect calmness . 
`` Go ! '' 
Passepartout left the room , and went to find Aouda , to whom he delivered his master 's message . 
`` Madam , '' he added , `` I can do nothing myself -- nothing ! 
I have no influence over my master ; but you , perhaps -- '' `` What influence could I have ? '' 
replied Aouda . 
`` Mr. Fogg is influenced by no one . 
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ? 
Has he ever read my heart ? 
My friend , he must not be left alone an instant ! 
You say he is going to speak with me this evening ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in England . '' 
`` We shall see , '' replied Aouda , becoming suddenly pensive . 
Throughout this day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- the house in Saville Row was as if uninhabited , and Phileas Fogg , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven . 
Why should he present himself at the Reform ? 
His friends no longer expected him there . 
As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before -LRB- Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine -RRB- , he had lost his wager . 
It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds ; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands , and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit . 
Mr. Fogg , therefore , had no reason for going out , and so he remained at home . 
He shut himself up in his room , and busied himself putting his affairs in order . 
Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs . 
The hours were long for him . 
He listened at his master 's door , and looked through the keyhole , as if he had a perfect right so to do , and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment . 
Sometimes he thought of Fix , but no longer in anger . 
Fix , like all the world , had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg , and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him ; while he , Passepartout ... . 
This thought haunted him , and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly . 
Finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at Aouda 's door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman . 
Aouda was still pensive . 
About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda would receive him , and in a few moments he found himself alone with her . 
Phileas Fogg took a chair , and sat down near the fireplace , opposite Aouda . 
No emotion was visible on his face . 
Fogg returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away ; there was the same calm , the same impassibility . 
He sat several minutes without speaking ; then , bending his eyes on Aouda , `` Madam , '' said he , `` will you pardon me for bringing you to England ? '' 
`` I , Mr. Fogg ! '' 
replied Aouda , checking the pulsations of her heart . 
`` Please let me finish , '' returned Mr. Fogg . 
`` When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal ; then your existence would have been free and happy . 
But now I am ruined . '' 
`` I know it , Mr. Fogg , '' replied Aouda ; `` and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows ? 
-- for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? '' 
`` Madam , you could not remain in India , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . '' 
`` So , Mr. Fogg , '' resumed Aouda , `` not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me . 
Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service . '' 
`` But what will become of you , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` As for me , madam , '' replied the gentleman , coldly , `` I have need of nothing . '' 
`` But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ? '' 
`` As I am in the habit of doing . '' 
`` At least , '' said Aouda , `` want should not overtake a man like you . 
Your friends -- '' `` I have no friends , madam . '' 
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . '' 
`` I pity you , then , Mr. Fogg , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs . 
They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience . '' 
`` They say so , madam . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' said Aouda , rising and seizing his hand , `` do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ? 
Will you have me for your wife ? '' 
Mr. Fogg , at this , rose in his turn . 
There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips . 
Aouda looked into his face . 
The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him . 
He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look . 
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! '' 
he said , simply . 
`` Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Aouda , pressing his hand to her heart . 
Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately . 
Mr. Fogg still held Aouda 's hand in his own ; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith . 
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson , of Marylebone parish , that evening . 
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile , and said , `` Never too late . '' 
It was five minutes past eight . 
`` Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ? '' 
`` For to-morrow , Monday , '' said Mr. Fogg , turning to Aouda . 
`` Yes ; for to-morrow , Monday , '' she replied . 
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him . 
It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber , a certain James Strand , had been arrested , on the 17th day of December , at Edinburgh . 
Three days before , Phileas Fogg had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police ; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world . 
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made . 
Phileas Fogg 's name was once more at a premium on ` Change . 
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense . 
Would Phileas Fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes ! 
Where was he at this moment ? 
The 17th of December , the day of James Strand 's arrest , was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg 's departure , and no news of him had been received . 
Was he dead ? 
Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ?
