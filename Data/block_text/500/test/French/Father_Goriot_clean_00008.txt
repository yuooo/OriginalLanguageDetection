... No , no , it is all as good as done ! 
We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples , but they will be digested along with the bread . 
While we are having our forty winks , Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer 's inheritance with the point of his sword . 
Victorine will come in for her brother 's money , a snug fifteen thousand francs a year . 
I have made inquiries already , and I know that her late mother 's property amounts to more than three hundred thousand -- '' Eugene heard all this , and could not answer a word ; his tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of his mouth , an irresistible drowsiness was creeping over him . 
He still saw the table and the faces round it , but it was through a bright mist . 
Soon the noise began to subside , one by one the boarders went . 
At last , when their numbers had so dwindled that the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer , Mme. Couture , Mlle. Victorine , Vautrin , and Father Goriot , Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Mme. Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles , and drained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others . 
`` Oh ! 
how uproarious they are ! 
what a thing it is to be young ! '' 
said the widow . 
These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood . 
`` There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this , '' said Sylvie . 
`` There , just hark at Christophe , he is snoring like a top . '' 
`` Good-bye , mamma , '' said Vautrin ; `` I am going to a theatre on the boulevard to see M. Marty in Le Mont Sauvage , a fine play taken from Le Solitaire ... . 
If you like , I will take you and these two ladies -- '' `` Thank you ; I must decline , '' said Mme. Couture . 
`` What ! 
my good lady ! '' 
cried Mme. Vauquer , `` decline to see a play founded on the Le Solitaire , a work by Atala de Chateaubriand ? 
We were so fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the line-trees last summer , and then it is an improving work that might edify your young lady . '' 
`` We are forbidden to go to the play , '' answered Victorine . 
`` Just look , those two yonder have dropped off where they sit , '' said Vautrin , shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way . 
He altered the sleeping student 's position , settled his head more comfortably on the back of his chair , kissed him warmly on the forehead , and began to sing : `` Sleep , little darlings ; I watch while you slumber . '' 
`` I am afraid he may be ill , '' said Victorine . 
`` Then stop and take care of him , '' returned Vautrin . '' 
'T is your duty as a meek and obedient wife , '' he whispered in her ear . 
`` The young fellow worships you , and you will be his little wife -- there 's your fortune for you . 
In short , '' he added aloud , `` they lived happily ever afterwards , were much looked up to in all the countryside , and had a numerous family . 
That is how all the romances end . 
-- Now , mamma , '' he went on , as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist , `` put on your bonnet , your best flowered silk , and the countess ' scarf , while I go out and call a cab -- all my own self . '' 
And he started out , singing as he went : `` Oh ! 
sun ! 
divine sun ! 
Ripening the pumpkins every one . '' 
`` My goodness ! 
Well , I 'm sure ! 
Mme. Couture , I could live happily in a garret with a man like that . 
-- There , now ! '' 
she added , looking round for the old vermicelli maker , `` there is that Father Goriot half seas over . 
He never thought of taking me anywhere , the old skinflint . 
But he will measure his length somewhere . 
My word ! 
it is disgraceful to lose his senses like that , at his age ! 
You will be telling me that he could n't lose what he had n't got -- Sylvie , just take him up to his room ! '' 
Sylvie took him by the arm , supported him upstairs , and flung him just as he was , like a package , across the bed . 
`` Poor young fellow ! '' 
said Mme. Couture , putting back Eugene 's hair that had fallen over his eyes ; `` he is like a young girl , he does not know what dissipation is . '' 
`` Well , I can tell you this , I know , '' said Mme. Vauquer , `` I have taken lodgers these thirty years , and a good many have passed through my hands , as the saying is , but I have never seen a nicer nor a more aristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene . 
How handsome he looks sleeping ! 
Just let his head rest on your shoulder , Mme. Couture . 
Pshaw ! 
he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine . 
There 's a special providence for young things . 
A little more , and he would have broken his head against the knob of the chair . 
They 'd make a pretty pair those two would ! '' 
`` Hush , my good neighbor , '' cried Mme. Couture , `` you are saying such things -- '' `` Pooh ! '' 
put in Mme. Vauquer , `` he does not hear . 
-- Here , Sylvie ! 
come and help me to dress . 
I shall put on my best stays . '' 
`` What ! 
your best stays just after dinner , madame ? '' 
said Sylvie . 
`` No , you can get some one else to lace you . 
I am not going to be your murderer . 
It 's a rash thing to do , and might cost you your life . '' 
`` I do n't care , I must do honor to M. Vautrin . '' 
`` Are you so fond of your heirs as all that ? '' 
`` Come , Sylvie , do n't argue , '' said the widow , as she left the room . 
`` At her age , too ! '' 
said the cook to Victorine , pointing to her mistress as she spoke . 
Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room , and Eugene slept on Victorine 's shoulder . 
The sound of Christophe 's snoring echoed through the silent house ; Eugene 's quiet breathing seemed all the quieter by force of contrast , he was sleeping as peacefully as a child . 
Victorine was very happy ; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments of a woman 's nature ; he was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of his heart ; there was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in Victorine 's face . 
Among the countless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart , there was a wild flutter of joy at this close contact . 
`` Poor , dear child ! '' 
said Mme. Couture , squeezing her hand . 
The old lady looked at the girl . 
Victorine 's innocent , pathetic face , so radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her , called to mind some naive work of mediaeval art , when the painter neglected the accessories , reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet , austere outlines and ivory tints of the face , which seems to have caught something of the golden glory of heaven . 
`` After all , he only took two glasses , mamma , '' said Victorine , passing her fingers through Eugene 's hair . 
`` Indeed , if he had been a dissipated young man , child , he would have carried his wine like the rest of them . 
His drowsiness does him credit . '' 
There was a sound of wheels outside in the street . 
`` There is M. Vautrin , mamma , '' said the girl . 
`` Just take M. Eugene . 
I would rather not have that man see me like this ; there are some ways of looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though you had nothing on . '' 
`` Oh , no , you are wrong ! '' 
said Mme. Couture . 
`` M. Vautrin is a worthy man ; he reminds me a little of my late husband , poor dear M. Couture , rough but kind-hearted ; his bark is worse than his bite . '' 
Vautrin came in while she was speaking ; he did not make a sound , but looked for a while at the picture of the two young faces -- the lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them . 
`` Well , '' he remarked , folding his arms , `` here is a picture ! 
It would have suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre -LRB- good soul -RRB- , who wrote Paul et Virginie . 
Youth is very charming , Mme. Couture ! 
-- Sleep on , poor boy , '' he added , looking at Eugene , `` luck sometimes comes while you are sleeping . 
-- There is something touching and attractive to me about this young man , madame , '' he continued ; `` I know that his nature is in harmony with his face . 
Just look , the head of a cherub on an angel 's shoulder ! 
He deserves to be loved . 
If I were a woman , I would die -LRB- no -- not such a fool -RRB- , I would live for him . '' 
He bent lower and spoke in the widow 's ear . 
`` When I see those two together , madame , I can not help thinking that Providence meant them for each other ; He works by secret ways , and tries the reins and the heart , '' he said in a loud voice . 
`` And when I see you , my children , thus united by a like purity and by all human affections , I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate you . 
God is just . '' 
-- He turned to Victorine . 
`` It seems to me , '' he said , `` that I have seen the line of success in your hand . 
Let me look at it , Mlle. Victorine ; I am well up in palmistry , and I have told fortunes many a time . 
Come , now , do n't be frightened . 
Ah ! 
what do I see ? 
Upon my word , you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very long . 
You will heap riches on the man who loves you . 
Your father will want you to go and live with him . 
You will marry a young and handsome man with a title , and he will idolize you . '' 
The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow , who was coming down the stairs , interrupted Vautrin 's fortune-telling . 
`` Here is Mamma Vauquerre , fair as a starr-r-r , dressed within an inch of her life . 
-- Are n't we a trifle pinched for room ? '' 
he inquired , with his arm round the lady ; `` we are screwed up very tightly about the bust , mamma ! 
If we are much agitated , there may be an explosion ; but I will pick up the fragments with all the care of an antiquary . '' 
`` There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry ! '' 
said the widow , bending to speak in Mme. Couture 's ear . 
`` Good-bye , little ones ! '' 
said Vautrin , turning to Eugene and Victorine . 
`` Bless you both ! '' 
and he laid a hand on either head . 
`` Take my word for it , young lady , an honest man 's prayers are worth something ; they should bring you happiness , for God hears them . '' 
`` Good-bye , dear , '' said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger . 
`` Do you think that M. Vautrin means to run away with me ? '' 
she added , lowering her voice . 
`` Lack-a-day ! '' 
said the widow . 
`` Oh ! 
mamma dear , suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin said ! '' 
said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands . 
The two women were alone together . 
`` Why , it would n't take much to bring it to pass , '' said the elderly lady ; `` just a fall from his horse , and your monster of a brother -- '' `` Oh ! 
mamma . '' 
`` Good Lord ! 
Well , perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy , '' the widow remarked . 
`` I will do penance for it . 
Still , I would strew flowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure , and that is the truth . 
Black-hearted , that he is ! 
The coward could n't speak up for his own mother , and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery . 
My cousin had a pretty fortune of her own , but unluckily for you , nothing was said in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in for . '' 
`` It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life , '' said Victorine . 
`` If I can not be happy unless my brother is to be taken out of the world , I would rather stay here all my life . '' '' 
Mon Dieu ! 
it is just as that good M. Vautrin says , and he is full of piety , you see , '' Mme. Couture remarked . 
`` I am very glad to find that he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty with less respect than they do of the Devil . 
Well , as he was saying , who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us ? '' 
With Sylvie 's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene up to his room ; they laid him on the bed , and the cook unfastened his clothes to make him more comfortable . 
Before they left the room , Victorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian 's back was turned , and pressed a kiss on Eugene 's forehead , feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could give her . 
Then she looked round the room , and gathering up , as it were , into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day , she made a picture of her memories , and dwelt upon it until she slept , the happiest creature in Paris . 
That evening 's merry-making , in the course of which Vautrin had given the drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot , was his own ruin . 
Bianchon , flustered with wine , forgot to open the subject of Trompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau . 
The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on his guard ; for Vautrin , or , to give him his real name , Jacques Collin , was in fact the notorious escaped convict . 
But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally decided his fate . 
Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity , with the idea of making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night ; but as it was , she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne , still thinking that it was the district superintendent -- one Gondureau -- with whom she had to do . 
The head of the department received his visitors courteously . 
There was a little talk , and the details were definitely arranged . 
Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to set about her investigation . 
But the great man 's evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking ; and she began to see that this business involved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict . 
She racked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial , and it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money . 
But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne , that officer began to smile , and tried to put her off the scent . 
`` A delusion , '' he said . 
`` Collin 's sorbonne is the most dangerous that has yet been found among the dangerous classes . 
That is all , and the rascals are quite aware of it . 
They rally round him ; he is the backbone of the federation , its Bonaparte , in short ; he is very popular with them all . 
The rogue will never leave his chump in the Place de Greve . '' 
As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified , Gondureau explained the two slang words for her benefit . 
Sorbonne and chump are two forcible expressions borrowed from thieves ' Latin , thieves , of all people , being compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects . 
A sorbonne is the head of a living man , his faculty of thinking -- his council ; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth after the axe has done its work . 
`` Collin is playing us off , '' he continued . 
`` When we come across a man like a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion , there is always one resource left -- we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make the least resistance . 
We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin to-morrow morning . 
It saves a trial , and society is rid of him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him . 
What with getting up the case , summoning witnesses , paying their expenses , and carrying out the sentence , it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings , over and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have . 
There is a saving in time as well . 
One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort 's paunch will prevent scores of crimes , and save fifty scoundrels from following his example ; they will be very careful to keep themselves out of the police courts . 
That is doing the work of the police thoroughly , and true philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to punish it . '' 
`` And you do a service to our country , '' said Poiret . 
`` Really , you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight , that you are , '' said the head of the department . 
`` Yes , of course , we are serving our country , and we are very hardly used too . 
We do society very great services that are not recognized . 
In fact , a superior man must rise above vulgar prejudices , and a Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that doing right entails , when right is done in an out-of-the-way style . 
Paris is Paris , you see ! 
That is the explanation of my life . 
-- I have the honor to wish you a good-evening , mademoiselle . 
I shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning . 
Send Christophe to the Rue du Buffon , tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me before . 
-- Your servant , sir . 
If you should ever have anything stolen from you , come to me , and I will do my best to get it back for you . '' 
`` Well , now , '' Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau , `` there are idiots who are scared out of their wits by the word police . 
That was a very pleasant-spoken gentleman , and what he wants you to do is as easy as saying ` Good-day . ' '' 
The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the annals of the Maison Vauquer . 
Hitherto the most startling occurrence in its tranquil existence had been the portentous , meteor-like apparition of the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil . 
But the catastrophes of this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade , and supply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her boarders so long as she lived . 
In the first place , Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close upon eleven o'clock . 
Mme. Vauquer , who came home about midnight from the Gaite , lay a-bed till half-past ten . 
Christophe , after a prolonged slumber -LRB- he had finished Vautrin 's first bottle of wine -RRB- , was behindhand with his work , but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered no complaint , though breakfast was delayed . 
As for Victorine and Mme. Couture , they also lay late . 
Vautrin went out before eight o'clock , and only came back just as breakfast was ready . 
Nobody protested , therefore , when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven , knocked at all the doors , and announced that breakfast was waiting . 
While Sylvie and the man were upstairs , Mlle. Michonneau , who came down first , poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin -- it was standing with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee . 
The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business . 
The seven lodgers were at last collected together , not without some difficulty . 
Just as Eugene came downstairs , stretching himself and yawning , a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de Nucingen . 
It ran thus : -- `` I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned , my friend . 
Till two o'clock this morning I waited for you . 
Oh , that waiting for one whom you love ! 
No one that had passed through that torture could inflict it on another . 
I know now that you have never loved before . 
What can have happened ? 
Anxiety has taken hold of me . 
I would have come myself to find out what had happened , if I had not feared to betray the secrets of my heart . 
How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day ? 
Would it not be ruin ? 
I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman . 
Send a word to reassure me , and explain how it is that you have not come after what my father told you . 
I shall be angry , but I will forgive you . 
One word , for pity 's sake . 
You will come to me soon , will you not ? 
If you are busy , a line will be enough . 
Say , ' I will hasten to you , ' or else , ' I am ill . ' 
But if you were ill my father would have come to tell me so . 
What can have happened ? 
... '' `` Yes , indeed , what has happened ? '' 
exclaimed Eugene , and , hurrying down to the dining-room , he crumpled up the letter without reading any more . 
`` What time is it ? '' 
`` Half-past eleven , '' said Vautrin , dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee . 
The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene , a cold and fascinating glance ; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics in a madhouse by such a glance , it is said . 
Eugene shook in every limb . 
There was the sound of wheels in the street , and in another moment a man with a scared face rushed into the room . 
It was one of M. Taillefer 's servants ; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he cried , `` your father is asking for you -- something terrible has happened ! 
M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the forehead in a duel , and the doctors have given him up . 
You will scarcely be in time to say good-bye to him ! 
he is unconscious . '' 
`` Poor young fellow ! '' 
exclaimed Vautrin . 
`` How can people brawl when they have a certain income of thirty thousand livres ? 
Young people have bad manners , and that is a fact . '' 
`` Sir ! '' 
cried Eugene . 
`` Well , what then , you big baby ! '' 
said Vautrin , swallowing down his coffee imperturbably , an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with such close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing news that had struck the others dumb with amazement . 
`` Are there not duels every morning in Paris ? '' 
added Vautrin . 
`` I will go with you , Victorine , '' said Mme. Couture , and the two women hurried away at once without either hats or shawls . 
But before she went , Victorine , with her eyes full of tears , gave Eugene a glance that said -- `` How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears ! '' 
`` Dear me , you are a prophet , M. Vautrin , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` I am all sorts of things , '' said Vautrin . 
`` Queer , is n't it ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , stringing together a succession of commonplaces suited to the occasion . 
`` Death takes us off without asking us about it . 
The young often go before the old . 
It is a lucky thing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels , but we have other complaints that men do n't suffer from . 
We bear children , and it takes a long time to get over it . 
What a windfall for Victorine ! 
Her father will have to acknowledge her now ! '' 
`` There ! '' 
said Vautrin , looking at Eugene , `` yesterday she had not a penny ; this morning she has several millions to her fortune . '' 
`` I say , M. Eugene ! '' 
cried Mme. Vauquer , `` you have landed on your feet ! '' 
At this exclamation , Father Goriot looked at the student , and saw the crumpled letter still in his hand . 
`` You have not read it through ! 
What does this mean ? 
Are you going to be like the rest of them ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Madame , I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine , '' said Eugene , turning to Mme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised the onlookers at this scene . 
Father Goriot caught the student 's hand and grasped it warmly . 
He could have kissed it . 
`` Oh , ho ! '' 
said Vautrin , `` the Italians have a good proverb -- Col tempo . '' 
`` Is there any answer ? '' 
said Mme. de Nucingen 's messenger , addressing Eugene . 
`` Say that I will come directly . '' 
The man went . 
Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he could not be prudent . 
`` What is to be done ? '' 
he exclaimed aloud . 
`` There are no proofs ! '' 
Vautrin began to smile . 
Though the drug he had taken was doing its work , the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet , gave Rastignac a look , and said in hollow tones , `` Luck comes to us while we sleep , young man , '' and fell stiff and stark , as if he were struck dead . 
`` So there is a Divine Justice ! '' 
said Eugene . 
`` Well , if ever ! 
What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin ? '' 
`` A stroke ! '' 
cried Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Here , Sylvie ! 
girl , run for the doctor , '' called the widow . 
`` Oh , M. Rastignac , just go for M. Bianchon , and be as quick as you can ; Sylvie might not be in time to catch our doctor , M. Grimprel . '' 
Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors , his hurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight . 
`` Here , Christophe , go round to the chemist 's and ask for something that 's good for the apoplexy . '' 
Christophe likewise went . 
`` Father Goriot , just help us to get him upstairs . '' 
Vautrin was taken up among them , carried carefully up the narrow staircase , and laid upon his bed . 
`` I can do no good here , so I shall go to see my daughter , '' said M. Goriot . 
`` Selfish old thing ! '' 
cried Mme. Vauquer . 
`` Yes , go ; I wish you may die like a dog . '' 
`` Just go and see if you can find some ether , '' said Mlle. Michonneau to Mme. Vauquer ; the former , with some help from Poiret , had unfastened the sick man 's clothes . 
Mme. Vauquer went down to her room , and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress of the situation . 
`` Now ! 
just pull down his shirt and turn him over , quick ! 
You might be of some use in sparing my modesty , '' she said to Poiret , `` instead of standing there like a stock . '' 
Vautrin was turned over ; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap , and the two portentous letters appeared , white against the red . 
`` There , you have earned your three thousand francs very easily , '' exclaimed Poiret , supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on the shirt again . 
-- `` Ouf ! 
How heavy he is , '' he added , as he laid the convict down . 
`` Hush ! 
Suppose there is a strong-box here ! '' 
said the old maid briskly ; her glances seemed to pierce the walls , she scrutinized every article of the furniture with greedy eyes . 
`` Could we find some excuse for opening that desk ? '' 
`` It might n't be quite right , '' responded Poiret to this . 
`` Where is the harm ? 
It is money stolen from all sorts of people , so it does n't belong to any one now . 
But we have n't time , there is the Vauquer . '' 
`` Here is the ether , '' said that lady . 
`` I must say that this is an eventful day . 
Lord ! 
that man ca n't have had a stroke ; he is as white as curds . '' 
`` White as curds ? '' 
echoed Poiret . 
`` And his pulse is steady , '' said the widow , laying her hand on his breast . 
`` Steady ? '' 
said the astonished Poiret . 
`` He is all right . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
asked Poiret . 
`` Lord ! 
Yes , he looks as if he were sleeping . 
Sylvie has gone for a doctor . 
I say , Mlle. Michonneau , he is sniffing the ether . 
Pooh ! 
it is only a spasm . 
His pulse is good . 
He is as strong as a Turk . 
Just look , mademoiselle , what a fur tippet he has on his chest ; that is the sort of man to live till he is a hundred . 
His wig holds on tightly , however . 
Dear me ! 
it is glued on , and his own hair is red ; that is why he wears a wig . 
They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best . 
Is he one of the good ones , I wonder ? '' 
`` Good to hang , '' said Poiret . 
`` Round a pretty woman 's neck , you mean , '' said Mlle Michonneau , hastily . 
`` Just go away , M. Poiret . 
It is a woman 's duty to nurse you men when you are ill . 
Besides , for all the good you are doing , you may as well take yourself off , '' she added . 
`` Mme. Vauquer and I will take great care of dear M. Vautrin . '' 
Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur , like a dog kicked out of the room by his master . 
Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion ; he wanted to breathe the air , he felt stifled . 
Yesterday evening he had meant to prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning . 
What had happened ? 
What ought he to do now ? 
He trembled to think that he himself might be implicated . 
Vautrin 's coolness still further dismayed him . 
`` Yet , how if Vautrin should die without saying a word ? '' 
Rastignac asked himself . 
He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of justice were after him , and he already heard the baying of the pack . 
`` Well ? '' 
shouted Bianchon , `` you have seen the Pilote ? '' 
The Pilote was a Radical sheet , edited by M. Tissot . 
It came out several hours later than the morning papers , and was meant for the benefit of country subscribers ; for it brought the morning news into provincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals . 
`` There is a wonderful history in it , '' said the house student of the Hopital Cochin . 
`` Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini , of the Old Guard , and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his forehead . 
And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris ! 
If we had known that , eh ? 
What a game of chance death is ! 
They say Victorine was sweet on you ; was there any truth in it ? '' 
`` Shut up , Bianchon ; I shall never marry her . 
I am in love with a charming woman , and she is in love with me , so -- '' `` You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her . 
I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer 's money ! '' 
`` Are all the devils of hell at my heels ? '' 
cried Rastignac . 
`` What is the matter with you ? 
Are you mad ? 
Give us your hand , '' said Bianchon , `` and let me feel your pulse . 
You are feverish . '' 
`` Just go to Mother Vauquer 's , '' said Rastignac ; `` that scoundrel Vautrin has dropped down like one dead . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
said Bianchon , leaving Rastignac to his reflections , `` you confirm my suspicions , and now I mean to make sure for myself . '' 
The law student 's long walk was a memorable one for him . 
He made in some sort a survey of his conscience . 
After a close scrutiny , after hesitation and self-examination , his honor at any rate came out scatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal , like a bar of iron tested in the English fashion . 
He remembered Father Goriot 's confidences of the evening before ; he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue d'Artois , so that he might be near Delphine ; and then he thought of his letter , and read it again and kissed it . 
`` Such a love is my anchor of safety , '' he said to himself . 
`` How the old man 's heart must have been wrung ! 
He says nothing about all that he has been through ; but who could not guess ? 
Well , then , I will be like a son to him ; his life shall be made happy . 
If she cares for me , she will often come to spend the day with him . 
That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a heartless thing ; she would make her father into her hall porter . 
Dear Delphine ! 
she is kinder to the old man ; she is worthy to be loved . 
Ah ! 
this evening I shall be very happy ! '' 
He took out his watch and admired it . 
`` I have had nothing but success ! 
If two people mean to love each other for ever , they may help each other , and I can take this . 
Besides , I shall succeed , and I will pay her a hundredfold . 
There is nothing criminal in this liaison ; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to frown . 
How many respectable people contract similar unions ! 
We deceive nobody ; it is deception that makes a position humiliating . 
If you lie , you lower yourself at once . 
She and her husband have lived apart for a long while . 
Besides , how if I called upon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he can not make happy ? '' 
Rastignac 's battle with himself went on for a long while ; and though the scruples of youth inevitably gained the day , an irresistible curiosity led him , about half-past four , to return to the Maison Vauquer through the gathering dusk . 
Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic , reserving the contents of the stomach for chemical analysis at the hospital . 
Mlle. Michonneau 's officious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of her . 
Vautrin , moreover , had recovered so quickly that it was impossible not to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics at the lodging-house . 
Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the dining-room when Rastignac came in . 
All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer 's duel . 
They were anxious to hear any detail about the affair , and to talk over the probable change in Victorine 's prospects . 
Father Goriot alone was absent , but the rest were chatting . 
No sooner did Eugene come into the room , than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin . 
It was the same look that had read his thoughts before -- the look that had such power to waken evil thoughts in his heart . 
He shuddered . 
`` Well , dear boy , '' said the escaped convict , `` I am likely to cheat death for a good while yet . 
According to these ladies , I have had a stroke that would have felled an ox , and come off with flying colors . '' 
`` A bull you might say , '' cried the widow . 
`` You really might be sorry to see me still alive , '' said Vautrin in Rastignac 's ear , thinking that he guessed the student 's thoughts . 
`` You must be mighty sure of yourself . '' 
`` Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman named Trompe-la-Mort , '' said Bianchon ; `` and , upon my word , that name would do very well for you . '' 
Vautrin seemed thunderstruck . 
He turned pale , and staggered back . 
He turned his magnetic glance , like a ray of vivid light , on Mlle. Michonneau ; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that strong will , and collapsed into a chair . 
The mask of good-nature had dropped from the convict 's face ; from the unmistakable ferocity of that sinister look , Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger , and hastily stepped between them . 
None of the lodgers understood this scene in the least , they looked on in mute amazement . 
There was a pause . 
Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside ; there were soldiers there , it seemed , for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of the street . 
Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of escape , when four men entered by way of the sitting-room . 
`` In the name of the King and the Law ! '' 
said an officer , but the words were almost lost in a murmur of astonishment . 
Silence fell on the room . 
The lodgers made way for three of the men , who had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket . 
Two policemen , who followed the detectives , kept the entrance to the sitting-room , and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase . 
A sound of footsteps came from the garden , and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window . 
All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort , to whom all eyes instinctively turned . 
The chief walked straight up to him , and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head , so that the wig fell off , and Collin 's face was revealed in all its ugliness . 
There was a terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short , brick-red crop of hair , the whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame , and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes . 
In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth , revealed at once before them all ; they understood his past , his present , and future , his pitiless doctrines , his actions , the religion of his own good pleasure , the majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him , the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials . 
The blood flew to his face , and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat . 
He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers . 
At that leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor . 
Collin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons , saw his danger , and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest order . 
There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face ; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying , a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water . 
The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning . 
He began to smile , and looked down at his wig . 
`` You are not in the politest of humors to-day , '' he remarked to the chief , and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head . 
`` Gentlemen , '' he said , `` put on the bracelets or the handcuffs . 
I call on those present to witness that I make no resistance . '' 
A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood from this human volcano , and its equally sudden cessation . 
`` There 's a sell for you , master crusher , '' the convict added , looking at the famous director of police . 
`` Come , strip ! '' 
said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne , contemptuously . 
`` Why ? '' 
asked Collin . 
`` There are ladies present ; I deny nothing , and surrender . '' 
He paused , and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience . 
`` Take this down , Daddy Lachapelle , '' he went on , addressing a little , white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table ; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio , was proceeding to draw up a document . 
`` I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin , otherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort , condemned to twenty years ' penal servitude , and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname . 
-- If I had as much as raised my hand , '' he went on , addressing the other lodgers , `` those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Vauquer 's domestic hearth . 
The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me . '' 
Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words . 
`` Good Lord ! '' 
she cried , `` this does give one a turn ; and me at the Gaite with him only last night ! '' 
she said to Sylvie . 
`` Summon your philosophy , mamma , '' Collin resumed . 
`` Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening ? 
After all , are you better than we are ? 
The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the brand set on your hearts , you flabby members of a society rotten to the core . 
Not the best man among you could stand up to me . '' 
His eyes rested upon Rastignac , to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes . 
-- `` Our little bargain still holds good , dear boy ; you can accept any time you like ! 
Do you understand ? '' 
And he sang : `` A charming girl is my Fanchette In her simplicity . '' 
`` Do n't you trouble yourself , '' he went on ; `` I can get in my money . 
They are too much afraid of me to swindle me . '' 
The convicts ' prison , its language and customs , its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to the horrible , its appalling grandeur , its triviality and its dark depths , were all revealed in turn by the speaker 's discourse ; he seemed to be no longer a man , but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race , a brutal , supple , clear-headed race of savages . 
In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno , wherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature -LRB- save repentance -RRB- find a place . 
He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end . 
Rastignac lowered his eyes , and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts . 
`` Who betrayed me ? '' 
said Collin , and his terrible eyes traveled round the room . 
Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` It was you , old cat ! '' 
he said . 
`` That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing , lynx eyes ! 
... Two words from me , and your throat would be cut in less than a week , but I forgive you , I am a Christian . 
You did not sell me either . 
But who did ? 
-- Aha ! 
you may rummage upstairs , '' he shouted , hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects . 
`` The nest is empty , the birds flew away yesterday , and you will be none the wiser . 
My ledgers are here , '' he said tapping his forehead . 
`` Now I know who sold me ! 
It could only be that blackguard Fil-de-Soie . 
That is who it was , old catchpoll , eh ? '' 
he said , turning to the chief . 
`` It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there .
