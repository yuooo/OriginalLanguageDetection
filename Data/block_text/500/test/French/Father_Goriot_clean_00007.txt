Eugene and Vautrin were left alone . 
`` I felt sure you would come round to it , '' said the elder man with the coolness that nothing seemed to shake . 
`` But stay a moment ! 
I have as much delicacy as anybody else . 
Do n't make up your mind on the spur of the moment ; you are a little thrown off your balance just now . 
You are in debt , and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober reflection , and not in a fit of passion or desperation . 
Perhaps you want a thousand crowns . 
There , you can have them if you like . '' 
The tempter took out a pocketbook , and drew thence three banknotes , which he fluttered before the student 's eyes . 
Eugene was in a most painful dilemma . 
He had debts , debts of honor . 
He owed a hundred louis to the Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles ; he had not the money , and for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud 's house , where he was expected that evening . 
It was one of those informal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round , but where it is possible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night . 
`` You must see , '' said Eugene , struggling to hide a convulsive tremor , `` that after what has passed between us , I can not possibly lay myself under any obligation to you . '' 
`` Quite right ; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise , '' answered the tempter . 
`` You are a fine young fellow , honorable , brave as a lion , and as gentle as a young girl . 
You would be a fine haul for the devil ! 
I like youngsters of your sort . 
Get rid of one or two more prejudices , and you will see the world as it is . 
Make a little scene now and then , and act a virtuous part in it , and a man with a head on his shoulders can do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery . 
Ah ! 
a few days yet , and you will be with us ; and if you would only be tutored by me , I would put you in the way of achieving all your ambitions . 
You should no sooner form a wish than it should be realized to the full ; you should have all your desires -- honors , wealth , or women . 
Civilization should flow with milk and honey for you . 
You should be our pet and favorite , our Benjamin . 
We would all work ourselves to death for you with pleasure ; every obstacle should be removed from your path . 
You have a few prejudices left ; so you think that I am a scoundrel , do you ? 
Well , M. de Turenne , quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to be , had some little private transactions with bandits , and did not feel that his honor was tarnished . 
You would rather not lie under any obligation to me , eh ? 
You need not draw back on that account , '' Vautrin went on , and a smile stole over his lips . 
`` Take these bits of paper and write across this , '' he added , producing a piece of stamped paper , '' Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth , and fill in the date . 
The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your part ; it gives you the right to call me a Jew . 
You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude . 
I am quite willing that you should despise me to-day , because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling towards me later on . 
You will find out fathomless depths in my nature , enormous and concentrated forces that weaklings call vices , but you will never find me base or ungrateful . 
In short , I am neither a pawn nor a bishop , but a castle , a tower of strength , my boy . '' 
`` What manner of man are you ? '' 
cried Eugene . 
`` Were you created to torment me ? '' 
`` Why no ; I am a good-natured fellow , who is willing to do a dirty piece of work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your days . 
Do you ask the reason of this devotion ? 
All right ; I will tell you that some of these days . 
A word or two in your ear will explain it . 
I have begun by shocking you , by showing you the way to ring the changes , and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social machine ; but your first fright will go off like a conscript 's terror on the battlefield . 
You will grow used to regarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for some self-constituted king . 
Times have altered strangely . 
Once you could say to a bravo , ` Here are a hundred crowns ; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me , ' and you could sup quietly after turning some one off into the dark for the least thing in the world . 
But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune ; you have only to nod your head , it wo n't compromise you in any way , and you hesitate . 
'T is an effeminate age . '' 
Eugene accepted the draft , and received the banknotes in exchange for it . 
`` Well , well . 
Come , now , let us talk rationally , '' Vautrin continued . 
`` I mean to leave this country in a few months ' time for America , and set about planting tobacco . 
I will send you the cigars of friendship . 
If I make money at it , I will help you in your career . 
If I have no children -- which will probably be the case , for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here -- you shall inherit my fortune . 
That is what you may call standing by a man ; but I myself have a liking for you . 
I have a mania , too , for devoting myself to some one else . 
I have done it before . 
You see , my boy , I live in a loftier sphere than other men do ; I look on all actions as means to an end , and the end is all that I look at . 
What is a man 's life to me ? 
Not that , '' he said , and he snapped his thumb-nail against his teeth . 
`` A man , in short , is everything to me , or just nothing at all . 
Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret ; you can crush him like a bug , he is flat and he is offensive . 
But a man is a god when he is like you ; he is not a machine covered with a skin , but a theatre in which the greatest sentiments are displayed -- great thoughts and feelings -- and for these , and these only , I live . 
A sentiment -- what is that but the whole world in a thought ? 
Look at Father Goriot . 
For him , his two girls are the whole universe ; they are the clue by which he finds his way through creation . 
Well , for my own part , I have fathomed the depths of life , there is only one real sentiment -- comradeship between man and man . 
Pierre and Jaffier , that is my passion . 
I knew Venice Preserved by heart . 
Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade says , ` Let us bury a dead body ! ' 
to go and do it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone ? 
I have done it myself . 
I should not talk like this to just everybody , but you are not like an ordinary man ; one can talk to you , you can understand things . 
You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps . 
Well , then , it is all settled . 
You will marry . 
Both of us carry our point . 
Mine is made of iron , and will never soften , he ! 
he ! '' 
Vautrin went out . 
He would not wait to hear the student 's repudiation , he wished to put Eugene at his ease . 
He seemed to understand the secret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man ; the struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying their blameworthy actions to themselves . 
`` He may do as he likes ; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer , that is certain , '' said Eugene to himself . 
He regarded this man with abhorrence , and yet the very cynicism of Vautrin 's ideas , and the audacious way in which he used other men for his own ends , raised him in the student 's eyes ; but the thought of a compact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension , and not until he had recovered somewhat did he dress , call for a cab , and go to Mme. de Restaud 's . 
For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world ; it seemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long . 
He paid Messieurs de Trailles and d'Ajuda , played at whist for part of the evening , and made good his losses . 
Most men who have their way to make are more or less of fatalists , and Eugene was superstitious ; he chose to consider that his luck was heaven 's reward for his perseverance in the right way . 
As soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in the other 's possession ; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative , he repaid the three thousand francs with a not unnatural relief . 
`` Everything is going on well , '' said Vautrin . 
`` But I am not your accomplice , '' said Eugene . 
`` I know , I know , '' Vautrin broke in . 
`` You are still acting like a child . 
You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset . '' 
Two days later , Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a bench in the sun . 
They had chosen a little frequented alley in the Jardin des Plantes , and a gentleman was chatting with them , the same person , as a matter of fact , about whom the medical student had , not without good reason , his own suspicions . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' this M. Gondureau was saying , `` I do not see any cause for your scruples . 
His Excellency , Monseigneur the Minister of Police -- '' `` Yes , his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter , '' said Gondureau . 
Who would think it probable that Poiret , a retired clerk , doubtless possessed of some notions of civic virtue , though there might be nothing else in his head -- who would think it likely that such a man would continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue de Buffon , when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that word `` police , '' and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective from the Rue de Jerusalem ? 
And yet nothing was more natural . 
Perhaps the following remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools . 
There is a race of quill-drivers , confined in the columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude -LRB- a kind of administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at twelve hundred francs -RRB- to the third degree , a more temperate zone , where incomes grow from three to six thousand francs , a climate where the bonus flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some difficulties of culture . 
A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of involuntary , mechanical , and instinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of every Ministry , known to the rank and file only by his signature -LRB- an illegible scrawl -RRB- and by his title -- `` His Excellency Monseigneur le Ministre , '' five words which produce as much effect as the il Bondo Cani of the Calife de Bagdad , five words which in the eyes of this low order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal . 
The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the employ of the Government , as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics . 
Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says , or that is said or done in his name ; the robe of office covers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders ; does not his very title -- His Excellency -- vouch for the purity of his intentions and the righteousness of his will , and serve as a sort of passport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a moment ? 
Pronounce the words `` His Excellency , '' and these poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests . 
Passive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in the army itself ; and the administrative system silences consciences , annihilates the individual , and ends -LRB- give it time enough -RRB- by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew , and he becomes part of the machinery of Government . 
Wherefore , M. Gondureau , who seemed to know something of human nature , recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom , and brought out for his benefit , at the proper moment , the deus ex machina , the magical words `` His Excellency , '' so as to dazzle Poiret just as he himself unmasked his batteries , for he took Poiret and the Michonneau for the male and female of the same species . 
`` If his Excellency himself , his Excellency the Minister ... Ah ! 
that is quite another thing , '' said Poiret . 
`` You seem to be guided by this gentleman 's opinion , and you hear what he says , '' said the man of independent means , addressing Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Very well , his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the so-called Vautrin , who lodges at the Maison Vauquer , is a convict who escaped from penal servitude at Toulon , where he is known by the nickname Trompe-la-Mort . '' 
`` Trompe-la-Mort ? '' 
said Pioret . 
`` Dear me , he is very lucky if he deserves that nickname . '' 
`` Well , yes , '' said the detective . 
`` They call him so because he has been so lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he has carried through . 
He is a dangerous man , you see ! 
He has qualities that are out of the common ; the thing he is wanted for , in fact , was a matter which gained him no end of credit with his own set -- '' `` Then is he a man of honor ? '' 
asked Poiret . 
`` Yes , according to his notions . 
He agreed to take another man 's crime upon himself -- a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that he had taken a great fancy to , a young Italian , a bit of a gambler , who has since gone into the army , where his conduct has been unexceptionable . '' 
`` But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort , why should he want me ? '' 
asked Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Oh yes , '' said Poiret , `` if the Minister , as you have been so obliging as to tell us , really knows for a certainty -- '' `` Certainty is not the word ; he only suspects . 
You will soon understand how things are . 
Jacques Collin , nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort , is in the confidence of every convict in the three prisons ; he is their man of business and their banker . 
He makes a very good thing out of managing their affairs , which want a man of mark to see about them . '' 
`` Ha ! 
ha ! 
do you see the pun , mademoiselle ? '' 
asked Poiret . 
`` This gentleman calls himself a man of mark because he is a marked man -- branded , you know . '' 
`` This so-called Vautrin , '' said the detective , `` receives the money belonging to my lords the convicts , invests it for them , and holds it at the disposal of those who escape , or hands it over to their families if they leave a will , or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for their benefit . '' 
`` Their mistresses ! 
You mean their wives , '' remarked Poiret . 
`` No , sir . 
A convict 's wife is usually an illegitimate connection . 
We call them concubines . '' 
`` Then they all live in a state of concubinage ? '' 
`` Naturally . '' 
`` Why , these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow . 
Since you have the honor of seeing his Excellency , you , who seem to have philanthropic ideas , ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral conduct -- they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society . '' 
`` But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues , my dear sir -- '' `` Of course not , sir ; but still -- '' `` Just let the gentleman say what he has to say , dearie , '' said Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` You see how it is , mademoiselle , '' Gondureau continued . 
`` The Government may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its hands ; it mounts up to something considerable , by all that we can make out . 
Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the convicts , but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the Society of the Ten Thousand -- '' `` Ten Thousand Thieves ! '' 
cried Pioret in alarm . 
`` No . 
The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty offenders , but of people who set about their work on a large scale -- they wo n't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it . 
It is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the Assize Courts when they come up for trial . 
They know the Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed . 
Collin is their confidential agent and legal adviser . 
By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system of his own ; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings . 
We have had spies all about him for a twelvemonth , and yet we could not manage to fathom his games . 
His capital and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime ; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a regular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society . 
If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort , and take possession of his funds , we should strike at the root of this evil . 
So this job is a kind of Government affair -- a State secret -- and likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion . 
You , sir , for instance , might very well be taken into a Government department again ; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police ; you could accept that post without prejudice to your retiring pension . '' 
Mlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with , `` What is there to hinder Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the detective , `` a man is told off to follow him everywhere he goes , with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts . 
Then it is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away with a young lady of family . 
Besides , Collin is not the sort of fellow to play such a trick ; he would be disgraced , according to his notions . '' 
`` You are quite right , sir , '' said Poiret , `` utterly disgraced he would be . '' 
`` But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without more ado , '' remarked Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Very well , mademoiselle , I will explain -- but , '' he added in her ear , `` keep your companion quiet , or I shall never have done . 
The old boy ought to pay people handsomely for listening to him . 
-- Trompe-la-Mort , when he came back here , '' he went on aloud `` slipped into the skin of an honest man ; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen , and took up his quarters in an unpretending lodging-house . 
He is cunning , that he is ! 
You do n't catch him napping . 
Then M. Vautrin is a man of consequence , who transacts a good deal of business . '' 
`` Naturally , '' said Poiret to himself . 
`` And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the real Vautrin , he would put every one 's back up among the business men in Paris , and public opinion would be against him . 
M. le Prefet de Police is on slippery ground ; he has enemies . 
They would take advantage of any mistake . 
There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition , and he would be sent packing . 
We must set about this just as we did about the Coignard affair , the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene ; if he had been the real Comte de Sainte-Helene , we should have been in the wrong box . 
We want to be quite sure what we are about . '' 
`` Yes , but what you want is a pretty woman , '' said Mlle. Michonneau briskly . 
`` Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him , '' said the detective . 
`` I will tell you a secret -- he does not like them . '' 
`` Still , I do not see what I can do , supposing that I did agree to identify him for two thousand francs . '' 
`` Nothing simpler , '' said the stranger . 
`` I will send you a little bottle containing a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head ; it will do him no harm whatever , but he will fall down as if he were in a fit . 
The drug can be put into wine or coffee ; either will do equally well . 
You carry your man to bed at once , and undress him to see that he is not dying . 
As soon as you are alone , you give him a slap on the shoulder , and presto ! 
the letters will appear . '' 
`` Why , that is just nothing at all , '' said Poiret . 
`` Well , do you agree ? '' 
said Gondureau , addressing the old maid . 
`` But , my dear sir , suppose there are no letters at all , '' said Mlle. Michonneau ; `` am I to have the two thousand francs all the same ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` What will you give me then ? '' 
`` Five hundred francs . '' 
`` It is such a thing to do for so little ! 
It lies on your conscience just the same , and I must quiet my conscience , sir . '' 
`` I assure you , '' said Poiret , `` that mademoiselle has a great deal of conscience , and not only so , she is a very amiable person , and very intelligent . '' 
`` Well , now , '' Mlle. Michonneau went on , `` make it three thousand francs if he is Trompe-la-Mort , and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man . '' 
`` Done ! '' 
said Gondureau , `` but on the condition that the thing is settled to-morrow . '' 
`` Not quite so soon , my dear sir ; I must consult my confessor first . '' 
`` You are a sly one , '' said the detective as he rose to his feet . 
`` Good-bye till to-morrow , then . 
And if you should want to see me in a hurry , go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la Sainte-Chapelle . 
There is one door under the archway . 
Ask there for M. Gondureau . '' 
Bianchon , on his way back from Cuvier 's lecture , overheard the sufficiently striking nickname of Trompe-la-Mort , and caught the celebrated chief detective 's '' Done ! '' 
`` Why did n't you close with him ? 
It would be three hundred francs a year , '' said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` Why did n't I ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Why , it wants thinking over . 
Suppose that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort , perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him . 
Still , on the other hand , if you ask him for money , it would put him on his guard , and he is just the man to clear out without paying , and that would be an abominable sell . '' 
`` And suppose you did warn him , '' Poiret went on , `` did n't that gentleman say that he was closely watched ? 
You would spoil everything . '' 
`` Anyhow , '' thought Mlle. Michonneau , `` I ca n't abide him . 
He says nothing but disagreeable things to me . '' 
`` But you can do better than that , '' Poiret resumed . 
`` As that gentleman said -LRB- and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man , besides being very well got up -RRB- , it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society of a criminal , however virtuous he may be . 
Once a thief , always a thief . 
Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all ? 
The deuce ! 
We should be guilty of manslaughter , and be the first to fall victims into the bargain ! '' 
Mlle. Michonneau 's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret 's lips like water dripping from a leaky tap . 
When once this elderly babbler began to talk , he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped him . 
He started on some subject or other , and wandered on through parenthesis after parenthesis , till he came to regions as remote as possible from his premises without coming to any conclusions by the way . 
By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject in hand , which led him to give a full account of his own deposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau versus Dame Morin , when he had been summoned as a witness for the defence . 
As they entered the dining-room , Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart with Mlle. Taillefer ; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they passed through the room . 
None of this was thrown away on Mlle. Michonneau . 
`` I knew how it would end , '' remarked that lady , addressing Poiret . 
`` They have been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a week past . '' 
`` Yes , '' he answered . 
`` So she was found guilty . '' 
`` Who ? '' 
`` Mme. Morin . '' 
`` I am talking about Mlle. Victorine , '' said Mlle , Michonneau , as she entered Poiret 's room with an absent air , `` and you answer , ` Mme. Morin . ' 
Who may Mme. Morin be ? '' 
`` What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of ? '' 
demanded Poiret . 
`` Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further and further without knowing exactly where she is going , poor innocent ! '' 
That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair . 
In his own mind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin , and deliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary man professed for him , nor would he look to the consequences of such an alliance . 
Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour ago , when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle. Taillefer . 
To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel 's voice , that heaven was opening above her ; the Maison Vauquer took strange and wonderful hues , like a stage fairy-palace . 
She loved and she was loved ; at any rate , she believed that she was loved ; and what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac 's face and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer ? 
He had trampled on his conscience ; he knew that he was doing wrong , and did it deliberately ; he had said to himself that a woman 's happiness should atone for this venial sin . 
The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face ; the lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes . 
Luckily for him , the miracle took place . 
Vautrin came in in high spirits , and at once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had brought together by the combinations of his infernal genius , but his deep voice broke in upon their bliss . 
`` A charming girl is my Fanchette In her simplicity , '' he sang mockingly . 
Victorine fled . 
Her heart was more full than it had ever been , but it was full of joy , and not of sorrow . 
Poor child ! 
A pressure of the hand , the light touch of Rastignac 's hair against her cheek , a word whispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student 's warm breath on her , the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist , a kiss upon her throat -- such had been her betrothal . 
The near neighborhood of the stout Sylvie , who might invade that glorified room at any moment , only made these first tokens of love more ardent , more eloquent , more entrancing than the noblest deeds done for love 's sake in the most famous romances . 
This plain-song of love , to use the pretty expression of our forefathers , seemed almost criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight . 
In that one hour she had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth and happiness , when her whole self followed the gift . 
`` The thing is arranged , '' Vautrin said to Eugene , who remained . 
`` Our two dandies have fallen out . 
Everything was done in proper form . 
It is a matter of opinion . 
Our pigeon has insulted my hawk . 
They will meet to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt . 
By half-past eight in the morning Mlle. Taillefer , calmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee cup , will be sole heiress of her father 's fortune and affections . 
A funny way of putting it , is n't it ? 
Taillefer 's youngster is an expert swordsman , and quite cocksure about it , but he will be bled ; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit , a way of raising your sword point and driving it at the forehead . 
I must show you that thrust ; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know . '' 
Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment ; he could not find a word in reply . 
Just then Goriot came in , and Bianchon and a few of the boarders likewise appeared . 
`` That is just as I intended . '' 
Vautrin said . 
`` You know quite well what you are about . 
Good , my little eaglet ! 
You are born to command , you are strong , you stand firm on your feet , you are game ! 
I respect you . '' 
He made as though he would take Eugene 's hand , but Rastignac hastily withdrew it , sank into a chair , and turned ghastly pale ; it seemed to him that there was a sea of blood before his eyes . 
`` Oh ! 
so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes of virtue about us ! '' 
murmured Vautrin . 
`` But Papa Doliban has three millions ; I know the amount of his fortune . 
Once have her dowry in your hands , and your character will be as white as the bride 's white dress , even in your own eyes . '' 
Rastignac hesitated no longer . 
He made up his mind that he would go that evening to warn the Taillefers , father and son . 
But just as Vautrin left him , Father Goriot came up and said in his ear , `` You look melancholy , my boy ; I will cheer you up . 
Come with me . '' 
The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke . 
Eugene went with him , his curiosity had been aroused . 
`` Let us go up to your room , '' the worthy soul remarked , when he had asked Sylvie for the law student 's key . 
`` This morning , '' he resumed , `` you thought that she did not care about you , did you not ? 
Eh ? 
She would have nothing to say to you , and you went away out of humor and out of heart . 
Stuff and rubbish ! 
She wanted you to go because she was expecting me ! 
Now do you understand ? 
We were to complete the arrangements for taking some chambers for you , a jewel of a place , you are to move into it in three days ' time . 
Do n't split upon me . 
She wants it to be a surprise ; but I could n't bear to keep the secret from you . 
You will be in the Rue d'Artois , only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare , and you are to be housed like a prince ! 
Any one might have thought we were furnishing the house for a bride . 
Oh ! 
we have done a lot of things in the last month , and you knew nothing about it . 
My attorney has appeared on the scene , and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year , the interest on her money , and I shall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound securities , landed property that wo n't run away . '' 
Eugene was dumb . 
He folded his arms and paced up and down in his cheerless , untidy room . 
Father Goriot waited till the student 's back was turned , and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and set upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac 's arms stamped in gold on the leather . 
`` My dear boy , '' said the kind soul , `` I have been up to the eyes in this business . 
You see , there was plenty of selfishness on my part ; I have an interested motive in helping you to change lodgings . 
You will not refuse me if I ask you something ; will you , eh ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` There is a room on the fifth floor , up above your rooms , that is to let along with them ; that is where I am going to live , is n't that so ? 
I am getting old : I am too far from my girls . 
I shall not be in the way , but I shall be there , that is all . 
You will come and talk to me about her every evening . 
It will not put you about , will it ? 
I shall have gone to bed before you come in , but I shall hear you come up , and I shall say to myself , ` He has just seen my little Delphine . 
He has been to a dance with her , and she is happy , thanks to him . ' 
If I were ill , it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below , to know when you leave the house and when you come in . 
It is only a step to the Champs-Elysees , where they go every day , so I shall be sure of seeing them , whereas now I am sometimes too late . 
And then -- perhaps she may come to see you ! 
I shall hear her , I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a kitten . 
In this one month she has become my little girl again , so light-hearted and gay . 
Her soul is recovering , and her happiness is owing to you ! 
Oh ! 
I would do impossibilities for you . 
Only just now she said to me , ' I am very happy , papa ! ' 
When they say ` father ' stiffly , it sends a chill through me ; but when they call me ` papa , ' it brings all the old memories back . 
I feel most their father then ; I even believe that they belong to me , and to no one else . '' 
The good man wiped his eyes , he was crying . 
`` It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that , a long , long time since she took my arm as she did to-day . 
Yes , indeed , it must be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls . 
How pleasant it was to keep step with her , to feel the touch of her gown , the warmth of her arm ! 
Well , I took Delphine everywhere this morning ; I went shopping with her , and I brought her home again . 
Oh ! 
you must let me live near you . 
You may want some one to do you a service some of these days , and I shall be on the spot to do it . 
Oh ! 
if only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die , if his gout would have the sense to attack his stomach , how happy my poor child would be ! 
You would be my son-in-law ; you would be her husband in the eyes of the world . 
Bah ! 
she has known no happiness , that excuses everything . 
Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children . 
How fond of you she is ! '' 
he said , raising his head after a pause . 
`` All the time we were going about together she chatted away about you . 
` He is so nice-looking , papa ; is n't he ? 
He is kind-hearted ! 
Does he talk to you about me ? ' 
Pshaw ! 
she said enough about you to fill whole volumes ; between the Rue d'Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine . 
I did not feel old once during that delightful morning ; I felt as light as a feather . 
I told her how you had given the banknote to me ; it moved my darling to tears . 
But what can this be on your chimney-piece ? '' 
said Father Goriot at last . 
Rastignac had showed no sign , and he was dying of impatience . 
Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment . 
He thought of Vautrin , of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning , and of this realization of his dearest hopes , and the violent contrast between the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare . 
He went to the chimney-piece , saw the little square case , opened it , and found a watch of Breguet 's make wrapped in paper , on which these words were written : `` I want you to think of me every hour , because ... `` DELPHINE . '' 
That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had taken place between them . 
Eugene felt touched . 
Inside the gold watch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel . 
The chain , the key , the workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined , for he had long coveted such a possession . 
Father Goriot was radiant . 
Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her present ; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people , and seemed to be not the least happy of the three . 
He loved Rastignac already for his own as well as for his daughter 's sake . 
`` You must go and see her ; she is expecting you this evening . 
That great lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera-dancer . 
Aha ! 
he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was . 
He says he idolizes my daughter , does he ? 
He had better let her alone , or I will kill him . 
To think that my Delphine is his '' -- he heaved a sigh -- `` it is enough to make me murder him , but it would not be manslaughter to kill that animal ; he is a pig with a calf 's brains . 
-- You will take me with you , will you not ? '' 
`` Yes , dear Father Goriot ; you know very well how fond I am of you -- '' `` Yes , I do know very well . 
You are not ashamed of me , are you ? 
Not you ! 
Let me embrace you , '' and he flung his arms around the student 's neck . 
`` You will make her very happy ; promise me that you will ! 
You will go to her this evening , will you not ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes . 
I must go out ; I have some urgent business on hand . '' 
`` Can I be of any use ? '' 
`` My word , yes ! 
Will you go to old Taillefer 's while I go to Mme. de Nucingen ? 
Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening ; it is a matter of life and death . '' 
`` Really , young man ! '' 
cried Father Goriot , with a change of countenance ; `` are you really paying court to his daughter , as those simpletons were saying down below ? 
... Tonnerre de dieu ! 
you have no notion what a tap a la Goriot is like , and if you are playing a double game , I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist ... Oh ! 
the thing is impossible ! '' 
`` I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world , '' said the student . 
`` I only knew it a moment ago . '' 
`` Oh ! 
what happiness ! '' 
cried Goriot . 
`` But young Taillefer has been called out ; the duel comes off to-morrow morning , and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it . '' 
`` But what business is it of yours ? '' 
said Goriot . 
`` Why , I ought to tell him so , that he may prevent his son from putting in an appearance -- '' Just at that moment Vautrin 's voice broke in upon them ; he was standing at the threshold of his door and singing : `` Oh ! 
Richard , oh my king ! 
All the world abandons thee ! 
Broum ! 
broum ! 
broum ! 
broum ! 
broum ! 
The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a. . . 
tra la la . '' 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
shouted Christophe , `` the soup is ready , and every one is waiting for you . '' 
`` Here , '' Vautrin called down to him , `` come and take a bottle of my Bordeaux . '' 
`` Do you think your watch is pretty ? '' 
asked Goriot . 
`` She has good taste , has n't she ? 
Eh ? '' 
Vautrin , Father Goriot , and Rastignac came downstairs in company , and , all three of them being late , were obliged to sit together . 
Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner ; but the other , so charming in Mme. Vauquer 's opinion , had never been so witty . 
His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole table in good humor . 
His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with consternation . 
`` Why , what has come to you to-day ? '' 
inquired Mme. Vauquer . 
`` You are as merry as a skylark . '' 
`` I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain . '' 
`` Bargain ? '' 
said Eugene . 
`` Well , yes , bargain . 
I have just delivered a lot of goods , and I shall be paid a handsome commission on them -- Mlle. Michonneau , '' he went on , seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently , `` have you any objection to some feature in my face , that you are making those lynx eyes at me ? 
Just let me know , and I will have it changed to oblige you ... We shall not fall out about it , Poiret , I dare say ? '' 
he added , winking at the superannuated clerk . 
`` Bless my soul , you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules , '' said the young painter . 
`` I will , upon my word ! 
if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the Venus of Pere-Lachaise , '' replied Vautrin . 
`` There 's Poiret , '' suggested Bianchon . 
`` Oh ! 
Poiret shall pose as Poiret . 
He can be a garden god ! '' 
cried Vautrin ; `` his name means a pear -- '' `` A sleepy pear ! '' 
Bianchon put in . 
`` You will come in between the pear and the cheese . '' 
`` What stuff are you all talking ! '' 
said Mme. Vauquer ; `` you would do better to treat us to your Bordeaux ; I see a glimpse of a bottle there . 
It would keep us all in a good humor , and it is good for the stomach besides . '' 
`` Gentlemen , '' said Vautrin , `` the Lady President calls us to order . 
Mme. Couture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part , but respect the innocence of the aged Goriot . 
I propose a glass or two of Bordeauxrama , rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite , no political allusions intended . 
-- Come , you Turk ! '' 
he added , looking at Christophe , who did not offer to stir . 
`` Christophe ! 
Here ! 
What , you do n't answer to your own name ? 
Bring us some liquor , Turk ! '' 
`` Here it is , sir , '' said Christophe , holding out the bottle . 
Vautrin filled Eugene 's glass and Goriot 's likewise , then he deliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass , and sipped it while his two neighbors drank their wine . 
All at once he made a grimace . 
`` Corked ! '' 
he cried . 
`` The devil ! 
You can drink the rest of this , Christophe , and go and find another bottle ; take from the right-hand side , you know . 
There are sixteen of us ; take down eight bottles . '' 
`` If you are going to stand treat , '' said the painter , `` I will pay for a hundred chestnuts . '' 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
`` Booououh ! '' 
`` Prrr ! '' 
These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set firework . 
`` Come , now , Mama Vauquer , a couple of bottles of champagne , '' called Vautrin . '' 
Quien ! 
just like you ! 
Why not ask for the whole house at once . 
A couple of bottles of champagne ; that means twelve francs ! 
I shall never see the money back again , I know ! 
But if M. Eugene has a mind to pay for it , I have some currant cordial . '' 
`` That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught , '' muttered the medical student . 
`` Shut up , Bianchon , '' exclaimed Rastignac ; `` the very mention of black draught makes me feel -- . 
Yes , champagne , by all means ; I will pay for it , '' he added . 
`` Sylvie , '' called Mme. Vauquer , `` bring in some biscuits , and the little cakes . '' 
`` Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards , '' said Vautrin . 
`` But trot out the biscuits . '' 
The Bordeaux wine circulated ; the dinner table became a livelier scene than ever , and the fun grew fast and furious . 
Imitations of the cries of various animals mingled with the loud laughter ; the Museum official having taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the caterwauling of the animal in question , eight voices simultaneously struck up with the following variations : `` Scissors to grind ! '' 
`` Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds ! '' 
`` Brandy-snaps , ladies ! '' 
`` China to mend ! '' 
`` Boat ahoy ! '' 
`` Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes ! '' 
`` Old clo ' ! '' 
`` Cherries all ripe ! '' 
But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he rendered the cry of `` Umbrellas to me-end ! '' 
A few seconds later , and there was a head-splitting racket in the room , a storm of tomfoolery , a sort of cats ' concert , with Vautrin as conductor of the orchestra , the latter keeping an eye the while on Eugene and Father Goriot . 
The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already . 
They leaned back in their chairs , looking at the general confusion with an air of gravity , and drank but little ; both of them were absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening , and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go . 
Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time , and watched the change that came over their faces , choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close , to bend over Rastignac and to say in his ear : -- `` My little lad , you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin yet , and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs . 
When I have made up my mind to do a thing , no one short of Providence can put me off . 
Aha ! 
we were for going round to warn old Taillefer , telling tales out of school ! 
The oven is hot , the dough is kneaded , the bread is ready for the oven ; to-morrow we will eat it up and whisk away the crumbs ; and we are not going to spoil the baking ?
