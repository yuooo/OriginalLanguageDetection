... Well , God forgive her ! 
... And , to tell the truth , what am I that she should have remembered me when she was dying ? 
... `` As soon as she had drunk the water , she grew easier -- but in about three minutes she breathed her last ! 
We put a looking-glass to her lips -- it was undimmed ! 
`` I led Pechorin from the room , and we went on to the fortress rampart . 
For a long time we walked side by side , to and fro , speaking not a word and with our hands clasped behind our backs . 
His face expressed nothing out of the common -- and that vexed me . 
Had I been in his place , I should have died of grief . 
At length he sat down on the ground in the shade and began to draw something in the sand with his stick . 
More for form 's sake than anything , you know , I tried to console him and began to talk . 
He raised his head and burst into a laugh ! 
At that laugh a cold shudder ran through me ... I went away to order a coffin . 
`` I confess it was partly to distract my thoughts that I busied myself in that way . 
I possessed a little piece of Circassian stuff , and I covered the coffin with it , and decked it with some Circassian silver lace which Grigori Aleksandrovich had bought for Bela herself . 
`` Early next morning we buried her behind the fortress , by the river , beside the spot where she had sat for the last time . 
Around her little grave white acacia shrubs and elder-trees have now grown up . 
I should have liked to erect a cross , but that would not have done , you know -- after all , she was not a Christian . '' 
`` And what of Pechorin ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Pechorin was ill for a long time , and grew thin , poor fellow ; but we never spoke of Bela from that time forth . 
I saw that it would be disagreeable to him , so what would have been the use ? 
About three months later he was appointed to the E -- Regiment , and departed for Georgia . 
We have never met since . 
Yet , when I come to think of it , somebody told me not long ago that he had returned to Russia -- but it was not in the general orders for the corps . 
Besides , to the like of us news is late in coming . '' 
Hereupon -- probably to drown sad memories -- he launched forth into a lengthy dissertation on the unpleasantness of learning news a year late . 
I did not interrupt him , nor did I listen . 
In an hour 's time a chance of proceeding on our journey presented itself . 
The snowstorm subsided , the sky became clear , and we set off . 
On the way I involuntarily let the conversation turn on Bela and Pechorin . 
`` You have not heard what became of Kazbich ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Kazbich ? 
In truth , I do n't know . 
I have heard that with the Shapsugs , on our right flank , there is a certain Kazbich , a dare-devil fellow who rides about at a walking pace , in a red tunic , under our bullets , and bows politely whenever one hums near him -- but it can scarcely be the same person ! '' 
... In Kobi , Maksim Maksimych and I parted company . 
I posted on , and he , on account of his heavy luggage , was unable to follow me . 
We had no expectation of ever meeting again , but meet we did , and , if you like , I will tell you how -- it is quite a history ... You must acknowledge , though , that Maksim Maksimych is a man worthy of all respect ... If you admit that , I shall be fully rewarded for my , perhaps , too lengthy story . 
AFTER parting with Maksim Maksimych , I galloped briskly through the gorges of the Terek and Darial , breakfasted in Kazbek , drank tea in Lars , and arrived at Vladikavkaz in time for supper . 
I spare you a description of the mountains , as well as exclamations which convey no meaning , and word-paintings which convey no image -- especially to those who have never been in the Caucasus . 
I also omit statistical observations , which I am quite sure nobody would read . 
I put up at the inn which is frequented by all who travel in those parts , and where , by the way , there is no one you can order to roast your pheasant and cook your cabbage-soup , because the three veterans who have charge of the inn are either so stupid , or so drunk , that it is impossible to knock any sense at all out of them . 
I was informed that I should have to stay there three days longer , because the `` Adventure '' had not yet arrived from Ekaterinograd and consequently could not start on the return journey . 
What a misadventure ! 
-LSB- 18 -RSB- ... But a bad pun is no consolation to a Russian , and , for the sake of something to occupy my thoughts , I took it into my head to write down the story about Bela , which I had heard from Maksim Maksimych -- never imagining that it would be the first link in a long chain of novels : you see how an insignificant event has sometimes dire results ! 
... Perhaps , however , you do not know what the `` Adventure '' is ? 
It is a convoy -- composed of half a company of infantry , with a cannon -- which escorts baggage-trains through Kabardia from Vladikavkaz to Ekaterinograd . 
The first day I found the time hang on my hands dreadfully . 
Early next morning a vehicle drove into the courtyard ... Aha ! 
Maksim Maksimych ! 
... We met like a couple of old friends . 
I offered to share my own room with him , and he accepted my hospitality without standing upon ceremony ; he even clapped me on the shoulder and puckered up his mouth by way of a smile -- a queer fellow , that ! 
... Maksim Maksimych was profoundly versed in the culinary art . 
He roasted the pheasant astonishingly well and basted it successfully with cucumber sauce . 
I was obliged to acknowledge that , but for him , I should have had to remain on a dry-food diet . 
A bottle of Kakhetian wine helped us to forget the modest number of dishes -- of which there was one , all told . 
Then we lit our pipes , took our chairs , and sat down -- I by the window , and he by the stove , in which a fire had been lighted because the day was damp and cold . 
We remained silent . 
What had we to talk about ? 
He had already told me all that was of interest about himself and I had nothing to relate . 
I looked out of the window . 
Here and there , behind the trees , I caught glimpses of a number of poor , low houses straggling along the bank of the Terek , which flowed seaward in an ever-widening stream ; farther off rose the dark-blue , jagged wall of the mountains , behind which Mount Kazbek gazed forth in his highpriest 's hat of white . 
I took a mental farewell of them ; I felt sorry to leave them ... Thus we sat for a considerable time . 
The sun was sinking behind the cold summits and a whitish mist was beginning to spread over the valleys , when the silence was broken by the jingling of the bell of a travelling-carriage and the shouting of drivers in the street . 
A few vehicles , accompanied by dirty Armenians , drove into the courtyard of the inn , and behind them came an empty travelling-carriage . 
Its light movement , comfortable arrangement , and elegant appearance gave it a kind of foreign stamp . 
Behind it walked a man with large moustaches . 
He was wearing a Hungarian jacket and was rather well dressed for a manservant . 
From the bold manner in which he shook the ashes out of his pipe and shouted at the coachman it was impossible to mistake his calling . 
He was obviously the spoiled servant of an indolent master -- something in the nature of a Russian Figaro . 
`` Tell me , my good man , '' I called to him out of the window . 
`` What is it ? 
-- Has the ` Adventure ' arrived , eh ? '' 
He gave me a rather insolent glance , straightened his cravat , and turned away . 
An Armenian , who was walking near him , smiled and answered for him that the `` Adventure '' had , in fact , arrived , and would start on the return journey the following morning . 
`` Thank heavens ! '' 
said Maksim Maksimych , who had come up to the window at that moment . 
`` What a wonderful carriage ! '' 
he added ; `` probably it belongs to some official who is going to Tiflis for a judicial inquiry . 
You can see that he is unacquainted with our little mountains ! 
No , my friend , you 're not serious ! 
They are not for the like of you ; why , they would shake even an English carriage to bits ! 
-- But who could it be ? 
Let us go and find out . '' 
We went out into the corridor , at the end of which there was an open door leading into a side room . 
The manservant and a driver were dragging portmanteaux into the room . 
`` I say , my man ! '' 
the staff-captain asked him : `` Whose is that marvellous carriage ? 
-- Eh ? 
-- A beautiful carriage ! '' 
Without turning round the manservant growled something to himself as he undid a portmanteau . 
Maksim Maksimych grew angry . 
`` I am speaking to you , my friend ! '' 
he said , touching the uncivil fellow on the shoulder . 
`` Whose carriage ? 
-- My master 's . '' 
`` And who is your master ? '' 
`` Pechorin -- '' `` What did you say ? 
What ? 
Pechorin ? 
-- Great Heavens ! 
... Did he not serve in the Caucasus ? '' 
exclaimed Maksim Maksimych , plucking me by the sleeve . 
His eyes were sparkling with joy . 
`` Yes , he served there , I think -- but I have not been with him long . '' 
`` Well ! 
Just so ! 
... Just so ! 
... Grigori Aleksandrovich ? 
... that is his name , of course ? 
Your master and I were friends , '' he added , giving the manservant a friendly clap on the shoulder with such force as to cause him to stagger . 
`` Excuse me , sir , you are hindering me , '' said the latter , frowning . 
`` What a fellow you are , my friend ! 
Why , do n't you know , your master and I were bosom friends , and lived together ? 
... But where has he put up ? '' 
The servant intimated that Pechorin had stayed to take supper and pass the night at Colonel N -- 's . 
`` But wo n't he be looking in here in the evening ? '' 
said Maksim Maksimych . 
`` Or , you , my man , wo n't you be going over to him for something ? 
... If you do , tell him that Maksim Maksimych is here ; just say that -- he 'll know ! 
-- I 'll give you half a ruble for a tip ! '' 
The manservant made a scornful face on hearing such a modest promise , but he assured Maksim Maksimych that he would execute his commission . 
`` He 'll be sure to come running up directly ! '' 
said Maksim Maksimych , with an air of triumph . 
`` I will go outside the gate and wait for him ! 
Ah , it 's a pity I am not acquainted with Colonel N -- ! '' 
Maksim Maksimych sat down on a little bench outside the gate , and I went to my room . 
I confess that I also was awaiting this Pechorin 's appearance with a certain amount of impatience -- although , from the staff-captain 's story , I had formed a by no means favourable idea of him . 
Still , certain traits in his character struck me as remarkable . 
In an hour 's time one of the old soldiers brought a steaming samovar and a teapot . 
`` Wo n't you have some tea , Maksim Maksimych ? '' 
I called out of the window . 
`` Thank you . 
I am not thirsty , somehow . '' 
`` Oh , do have some ! 
It is late , you know , and cold ! '' 
`` No , thank you '' ... `` Well , just as you like ! '' 
I began my tea alone . 
About ten minutes afterwards my old captain came in . 
`` You are right , you know ; it would be better to have a drop of tea -- but I was waiting for Pechorin . 
His man has been gone a long time now , but evidently something has detained him . '' 
The staff-captain hurriedly sipped a cup of tea , refused a second , and went off again outside the gate -- not without a certain amount of disquietude . 
It was obvious that the old man was mortified by Pechorin 's neglect , the more so because a short time previously he had been telling me of their friendship , and up to an hour ago had been convinced that Pechorin would come running up immediately on hearing his name . 
It was already late and dark when I opened the window again and began to call Maksim Maksimych , saying that it was time to go to bed . 
He muttered something through his teeth . 
I repeated my invitation -- he made no answer . 
I left a candle on the stove-seat , and , wrapping myself up in my cloak , I lay down on the couch and soon fell into slumber ; and I would have slept on quietly had not Maksim Maksimych awakened me as he came into the room . 
It was then very late . 
He threw his pipe on the table , began to walk up and down the room , and to rattle about at the stove . 
At last he lay down , but for a long time he kept coughing , spitting , and tossing about . 
`` The bugs are biting you , are they not ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Yes , that is it , '' he answered , with a heavy sigh . 
I woke early the next morning , but Maksim Maksimych had anticipated me . 
I found him sitting on the little bench at the gate . 
`` I have to go to the Commandant , '' he said , `` so , if Pechorin comes , please send for me . '' 
... I gave my promise . 
He ran off as if his limbs had regained their youthful strength and suppleness . 
The morning was fresh and lovely . 
Golden clouds had massed themselves on the mountaintops like a new range of aerial mountains . 
Before the gate a wide square spread out ; behind it the bazaar was seething with people , the day being Sunday . 
Barefooted Ossete boys , carrying wallets of honeycomb on their shoulders , were hovering around me . 
I cursed them ; I had other things to think of -- I was beginning to share the worthy staff-captain 's uneasiness . 
Before ten minutes had passed the man we were awaiting appeared at the end of the square . 
He was walking with Colonel N. , who accompanied him as far as the inn , said good-bye to him , and then turned back to the fortress . 
I immediately despatched one of the old soldiers for Maksim Maksimych . 
Pechorin 's manservant went out to meet him and informed him that they were going to put to at once ; he handed him a box of cigars , received a few orders , and went off about his business . 
His master lit a cigar , yawned once or twice , and sat down on the bench on the other side of the gate . 
I must now draw his portrait for you . 
He was of medium height . 
His shapely , slim figure and broad shoulders gave evidence of a strong constitution , capable of enduring all the hardships of a nomad life and changes of climates , and of resisting with success both the demoralising effects of life in the Capital and the tempests of the soul . 
His velvet overcoat , which was covered with dust , was fastened by the two lower buttons only , and exposed to view linen of dazzling whiteness , which proved that he had the habits of a gentleman . 
His gloves , soiled by travel , seemed as though made expressly for his small , aristocratic hand , and when he took one glove off I was astonished at the thinness of his pale fingers . 
His gait was careless and indolent , but I noticed that he did not swing his arms -- a sure sign of a certain secretiveness of character . 
These remarks , however , are the result of my own observations , and I have not the least desire to make you blindly believe in them . 
When he was in the act of seating himself on the bench his upright figure bent as if there was not a single bone in his back . 
The attitude of his whole body was expressive of a certain nervous weakness ; he looked , as he sat , like one of Balzac 's thirty-year-old coquettes resting in her downy arm-chair after a fatiguing ball . 
From my first glance at his face I should not have supposed his age to be more than twenty-three , though afterwards I should have put it down as thirty . 
His smile had something of a child-like quality . 
His skin possessed a kind of feminine delicacy . 
His fair hair , naturally curly , most picturesquely outlined his pale and noble brow , on which it was only after lengthy observation that traces could be noticed of wrinkles , intersecting each other : probably they showed up more distinctly in moments of anger or mental disturbance . 
Notwithstanding the light colour of his hair , his moustaches and eyebrows were black -- a sign of breeding in a man , just as a black mane and a black tail in a white horse . 
To complete the portrait , I will add that he had a slightly turned-up nose , teeth of dazzling whiteness , and brown eyes -- I must say a few words more about his eyes . 
In the first place , they never laughed when he laughed . 
Have you not happened , yourself , to notice the same peculiarity in certain people ? 
... It is a sign either of an evil disposition or of deep and constant grief . 
From behind his half-lowered eyelashes they shone with a kind of phosphorescent gleam -- if I may so express myself -- which was not the reflection of a fervid soul or of a playful fancy , but a glitter like to that of smooth steel , blinding but cold . 
His glance -- brief , but piercing and heavy -- left the unpleasant impression of an indiscreet question and might have seemed insolent had it not been so unconcernedly tranquil . 
It may be that all these remarks came into my mind only after I had known some details of his life , and it may be , too , that his appearance would have produced an entirely different impression upon another ; but , as you will not hear of him from anyone except myself , you will have to rest content , nolens volens , with the description I have given . 
In conclusion , I will say that , speaking generally , he was a very good-looking man , and had one of those original types of countenance which are particularly pleasing to women . 
The horses were already put to ; now and then the bell jingled on the shaft-bow ; -LSB- 19 -RSB- and the manservant had twice gone up to Pechorin with the announcement that everything was ready , but still there was no sign of Maksim Maksimych . 
Fortunately Pechorin was sunk in thought as he gazed at the jagged , blue peaks of the Caucasus , and was apparently by no means in a hurry for the road . 
I went up to him . 
`` If you care to wait a little longer , '' I said , `` you will have the pleasure of meeting an old friend . '' 
`` Oh , exactly ! '' 
he answered quickly . 
`` They told me so yesterday . 
Where is he , though ? '' 
I looked in the direction of the square and there I descried Maksim Maksimych running as hard as he could . 
In a few moments he was beside us . 
He was scarcely able to breathe ; perspiration was rolling in large drops from his face ; wet tufts of grey hair , escaping from under his cap , were glued to his forehead ; his knees were shaking ... He was about to throw himself on Pechorin 's neck , but the latter , rather coldly , though with a smile of welcome , stretched out his hand to him . 
For a moment the staff-captain was petrified , but then eagerly seized Pechorin 's hand in both his own . 
He was still unable to speak . 
`` How glad I am to see you , my dear Maksim Maksimych ! 
Well , how are you ? '' 
said Pechorin . 
`` And ... thou ... you ? '' 
-LSB- 20 -RSB- murmured the old man , with tears in his eyes . 
`` What an age it is since I have seen you ! 
... But where are you off to ? '' 
... `` I am going to Persia -- and farther . '' 
... `` But surely not immediately ? 
... Wait a little , my dear fellow ! 
... Surely we are not going to part at once ? 
... What a long time it is since we have seen each other ! '' 
... `` It is time for me to go , Maksim Maksimych , '' was the reply . 
`` Good heavens , good heavens ! 
But where are you going to in such a hurry ? 
There was so much I should have liked to tell you ! 
So much to question you about ! 
... Well , what of yourself ? 
Have you retired ? 
... What ? 
... How have you been getting along ? '' 
`` Getting bored ! '' 
answered Pechorin , smiling . 
`` You remember the life we led in the fortress ? 
A splendid country for hunting ! 
You were awfully fond of shooting , you know ! 
... And Bela ? '' 
... Pechorin turned just the slightest bit pale and averted his head . 
`` Yes , I remember ! '' 
he said , almost immediately forcing a yawn . 
Maksim Maksimych began to beg him to stay with him for a couple of hours or so longer . 
`` We will have a splendid dinner , '' he said . 
`` I have two pheasants ; and the Kakhetian wine is excellent here ... not what it is in Georgia , of course , but still of the best sort ... We will have a talk ... You will tell me about your life in Petersburg ... Eh ? '' 
... `` In truth , there 's nothing for me to tell , dear Maksim Maksimych ... However , good-bye , it is time for me to be off ... I am in a hurry ... I thank you for not having forgotten me , '' he added , taking him by the hand . 
The old man knit his brows . 
He was grieved and angry , although he tried to hide his feelings . 
`` Forget ! '' 
he growled . 
`` I have not forgotten anything ... Well , God be with you ! 
... It is not like this that I thought we should meet . '' 
`` Come ! 
That will do , that will do ! '' 
said Pechorin , giving him a friendly embrace . 
`` Is it possible that I am not the same as I used to be ? 
... What can we do ? 
Everyone must go his own way ... Are we ever going to meet again ? 
-- God only knows ! '' 
While saying this he had taken his seat in the carriage , and the coachman was already gathering up the reins . 
`` Wait , wait ! '' 
cried Maksim Maksimych suddenly , holding on to the carriage door . 
`` I was nearly forgetting altogether . 
Your papers were left with me , Grigori Aleksandrovich ... I drag them about everywhere I go ... I thought I should find you in Georgia , but this is where it has pleased Heaven that we should meet . 
What 's to be done with them ? '' 
... `` Whatever you like ! '' 
answered Pechorin . 
`` Good-bye . '' 
... `` So you are off to Persia ? 
... But when will you return ? '' 
Maksim Maksimych cried after him . 
By this time the carriage was a long way off , but Pechorin made a sign with his hand which might be interpreted as meaning : `` It is doubtful whether I shall return , and there is no reason , either , why I should ! '' 
The jingle of the bell and the clatter of the wheels along the flinty road had long ceased to be audible , but the poor old man still remained standing in the same place , deep in thought . 
`` Yes , '' he said at length , endeavouring to assume an air of indifference , although from time to time a tear of vexation glistened on his eyelashes . 
`` Of course we were friends -- well , but what are friends nowadays ? 
... What could I be to him ? 
I 'm not rich ; I 've no rank ; and , moreover , I 'm not at all his match in years ! 
-- See what a dandy he has become since he has been staying in Petersburg again ! 
... What a carriage ! 
... What a quantity of luggage ! 
... And such a haughty manservant too ! '' 
... These words were pronounced with an ironical smile . 
`` Tell me , '' he continued , turning to me , `` what do you think of it ? 
Come , what the devil is he off to Persia for now ? 
... Good Lord , it is ridiculous -- ridiculous ! 
... But I always knew that he was a fickle man , and one you could never rely on ! 
... But , indeed , it is a pity that he should come to a bad end ... yet it ca n't be otherwise ! 
... I always did say that there is no good to be got out of a man who forgets his old friends ! '' 
... Hereupon he turned away in order to hide his agitation and proceeded to walk about the courtyard , around his cart , pretending to be examining the wheels , whilst his eyes kept filling with tears every moment . 
`` Maksim Maksimych , '' I said , going up to him , `` what papers are these that Pechorin left you ? '' 
`` Goodness knows ! 
Notes of some sort '' ... `` What will you do with them ? '' 
`` What ? 
I 'll have cartridges made of them . '' 
`` Hand them over to me instead . '' 
He looked at me in surprise , growled something through his teeth , and began to rummage in his portmanteau . 
Out he drew a writing-book and threw it contemptuously on the ground ; then a second -- a third -- a tenth shared the same fate . 
There was something childish in his vexation , and it struck me as ridiculous and pitiable ... `` Here they are , '' he said . 
`` I congratulate you on your find ! '' 
... `` And I may do anything I like with them ? '' 
`` Yes , print them in the newspapers , if you like . 
What is it to me ? 
Am I a friend or relation of his ? 
It is true that for a long time we lived under one roof ... but are n't there plenty of people with whom I have lived ? '' 
... I seized the papers and lost no time in carrying them away , fearing that the staff-captain might repent his action . 
Soon somebody came to tell us that the `` Adventure '' would set off in an hour 's time . 
I ordered the horses to be put to . 
I had already put my cap on when the staff-captain entered the room . 
Apparently he had not got ready for departure . 
His manner was somewhat cold and constrained . 
`` You are not going , then , Maksim Maksimych ? '' 
`` No , sir ! '' 
`` But why not ? '' 
`` Well , I have not seen the Commandant yet , and I have to deliver some Government things . '' 
`` But you did go , you know . '' 
`` I did , of course , '' he stammered , `` but he was not at home ... and I did not wait . '' 
I understood . 
For the first time in his life , probably , the poor old man had , to speak by the book , thrown aside official business ` for the sake of his personal requirements ' ... and how he had been rewarded ! 
`` I am very sorry , Maksim Maksimych , very sorry indeed , '' I said , `` that we must part sooner than necessary . '' 
`` What should we rough old men be thinking of to run after you ? 
You young men are fashionable and proud : under the Circassian bullets you are friendly enough with us ... but when you meet us afterwards you are ashamed even to give us your hand ! '' 
`` I have not deserved these reproaches , Maksim Maksimych . '' 
`` Well , but you know I 'm quite right . 
However , I wish you all good luck and a pleasant journey . '' 
We took a rather cold farewell of each other . 
The kind-hearted Maksim Maksimych had become the obstinate , cantankerous staff-captain ! 
And why ? 
Because Pechorin , through absent-mindedness or from some other cause , had extended his hand to him when Maksim Maksimych was going to throw himself on his neck ! 
Sad it is to see when a young man loses his best hopes and dreams , when from before his eyes is withdrawn the rose-hued veil through which he has looked upon the deeds and feelings of mankind ; although there is the hope that the old illusions will be replaced by new ones , none the less evanescent , but , on the other hand , none the less sweet . 
But wherewith can they be replaced when one is at the age of Maksim Maksimych ? 
Do what you will , the heart hardens and the soul shrinks in upon itself . 
I departed -- alone . 
I LEARNED not long ago that Pechorin had died on his way back from Persia . 
The news afforded me great delight ; it gave me the right to print these notes ; and I have taken advantage of the opportunity of putting my name at the head of another person 's productions . 
Heaven grant that my readers may not punish me for such an innocent deception ! 
I must now give some explanation of the reasons which have induced me to betray to the public the inmost secrets of a man whom I never knew . 
If I had even been his friend , well and good : the artful indiscretion of the true friend is intelligible to everybody ; but I only saw Pechorin once in my life -- on the high-road -- and , consequently , I can not cherish towards him that inexplicable hatred , which , hiding its face under the mask of friendship , awaits but the death or misfortune of the beloved object to burst over its head in a storm of reproaches , admonitions , scoffs and regrets . 
On reading over these notes , I have become convinced of the sincerity of the man who has so unsparingly exposed to view his own weaknesses and vices . 
The history of a man 's soul , even the pettiest soul , is hardly less interesting and useful than the history of a whole people ; especially when the former is the result of the observations of a mature mind upon itself , and has been written without any egoistical desire of arousing sympathy or astonishment . 
Rousseau 's Confessions has precisely this defect -- he read it to his friends . 
And , so , it is nothing but the desire to be useful that has constrained me to print fragments of this diary which fell into my hands by chance . 
Although I have altered all the proper names , those who are mentioned in it will probably recognise themselves , and , it may be , will find some justification for actions for which they have hitherto blamed a man who has ceased henceforth to have anything in common with this world . 
We almost always excuse that which we understand . 
I have inserted in this book only those portions of the diary which refer to Pechorin 's sojourn in the Caucasus . 
There still remains in my hands a thick writing-book in which he tells the story of his whole life . 
Some time or other that , too , will present itself before the tribunal of the world , but , for many and weighty reasons , I do not venture to take such a responsibility upon myself now . 
Possibly some readers would like to know my own opinion of Pechorin 's character . 
My answer is : the title of this book . 
`` But that is malicious irony ! '' 
they will say ... I know not . 
TAMAN is the nastiest little hole of all the seaports of Russia . 
I was all but starved there , to say nothing of having a narrow escape of being drowned . 
I arrived late at night by the post-car . 
The driver stopped the tired troika -LSB- 21 -RSB- at the gate of the only stone-built house that stood at the entrance to the town . 
The sentry , a Cossack from the Black Sea , hearing the jingle of the bell , cried out , sleepily , in his barbarous voice , `` Who goes there ? '' 
An under-officer of Cossacks and a headborough -LSB- 22 -RSB- came out . 
I explained that I was an officer bound for the active-service detachment on Government business , and I proceeded to demand official quarters . 
The headborough conducted us round the town . 
Whatever hut we drove up to we found to be occupied . 
The weather was cold ; I had not slept for three nights ; I was tired out , and I began to lose my temper . 
`` Take me somewhere or other , you scoundrel ! '' 
I cried ; `` to the devil himself , so long as there 's a place to put up at ! '' 
`` There is one other lodging , '' answered the headborough , scratching his head . 
`` Only you wo n't like it , sir . 
It is uncanny ! '' 
Failing to grasp the exact signification of the last phrase , I ordered him to go on , and , after a lengthy peregrination through muddy byways , at the sides of which I could see nothing but old fences , we drove up to a small cabin , right on the shore of the sea . 
The full moon was shining on the little reed-thatched roof and the white walls of my new dwelling . 
In the courtyard , which was surrounded by a wall of rubble-stone , there stood another miserable hovel , smaller and older than the first and all askew . 
The shore descended precipitously to the sea , almost from its very walls , and down below , with incessant murmur , plashed the dark-blue waves . 
The moon gazed softly upon the watery element , restless but obedient to it , and I was able by its light to distinguish two ships lying at some distance from the shore , their black rigging motionless and standing out , like cobwebs , against the pale line of the horizon . 
`` There are vessels in the harbour , '' I said to myself . 
`` To-morrow I will set out for Gelenjik . '' 
I had with me , in the capacity of soldier-servant , a Cossack of the frontier army . 
Ordering him to take down the portmanteau and dismiss the driver , I began to call the master of the house . 
No answer ! 
I knocked -- all was silent within ! 
... What could it mean ? 
At length a boy of about fourteen crept out from the hall . 
`` Where is the master ? '' 
`` There is n't one . '' 
`` What ! 
No master ? '' 
`` None ! '' 
`` And the mistress ? '' 
`` She has gone off to the village . '' 
`` Who will open the door for me , then ? '' 
I said , giving it a kick . 
The door opened of its own accord , and a breath of moisture-laden air was wafted from the hut . 
I struck a lucifer match and held it to the boy 's face . 
It lit up two white eyes . 
He was totally blind , obviously so from birth . 
He stood stock-still before me , and I began to examine his features . 
I confess that I have a violent prejudice against all blind , one-eyed , deaf , dumb , legless , armless , hunchbacked , and such-like people . 
I have observed that there is always a certain strange connection between a man 's exterior and his soul ; as , if when the body loses a limb , the soul also loses some power of feeling . 
And so I began to examine the blind boy 's face . 
But what could be read upon a face from which the eyes are missing ? 
... For a long time I gazed at him with involuntary compassion , when suddenly a scarcely perceptible smile flitted over his thin lips , producing , I know not why , a most unpleasant impression upon me . 
I began to feel a suspicion that the blind boy was not so blind as he appeared to be . 
In vain I endeavoured to convince myself that it was impossible to counterfeit cataracts ; and besides , what reason could there be for doing such a thing ? 
But I could not help my suspicions . 
I am easily swayed by prejudice ... `` You are the master 's son ? '' 
I asked at length . 
`` No . '' 
`` Who are you , then ? '' 
`` An orphan -- a poor boy . '' 
`` Has the mistress any children ? '' 
`` No , her daughter ran away and crossed the sea with a Tartar . '' 
`` What sort of a Tartar ? '' 
`` The devil only knows ! 
A Crimean Tartar , a boatman from Kerch . '' 
I entered the hut . 
Its whole furniture consisted of two benches and a table , together with an enormous chest beside the stove . 
There was not a single ikon to be seen on the wall -- a bad sign ! 
The sea-wind burst in through the broken window-pane . 
I drew a wax candle-end from my portmanteau , lit it , and began to put my things out . 
My sabre and gun I placed in a corner , my pistols I laid on the table . 
I spread my felt cloak out on one bench , and the Cossack his on the other . 
In ten minutes the latter was snoring , but I could not go to sleep -- the image of the boy with the white eyes kept hovering before me in the dark . 
About an hour passed thus . 
The moon shone in at the window and its rays played along the earthen floor of the hut . 
Suddenly a shadow flitted across the bright strip of moonshine which intersected the floor . 
I raised myself up a little and glanced out of the window . 
Again somebody ran by it and disappeared -- goodness knows where ! 
It seemed impossible for anyone to descend the steep cliff overhanging the shore , but that was the only thing that could have happened . 
I rose , threw on my tunic , girded on a dagger , and with the utmost quietness went out of the hut . 
The blind boy was coming towards me . 
I hid by the fence , and he passed by me with a sure but cautious step . 
He was carrying a parcel under his arm . 
He turned towards the harbour and began to descend a steep and narrow path . 
`` On that day the dumb will cry out and the blind will see , '' I said to myself , following him just close enough to keep him in sight . 
Meanwhile the moon was becoming overcast by clouds and a mist had risen upon the sea . 
The lantern alight in the stern of a ship close at hand was scarcely visible through the mist , and by the shore there glimmered the foam of the waves , which every moment threatened to submerge it . 
Descending with difficulty , I stole along the steep declivity , and all at once I saw the blind boy come to a standstill and then turn down to the right . 
He walked so close to the water 's edge that it seemed as if the waves would straightway seize him and carry him off . 
But , judging by the confidence with which he stepped from rock to rock and avoided the water-channels , this was evidently not the first time that he had made that journey . 
Finally he stopped , as though listening for something , squatted down upon the ground , and laid the parcel beside him . 
Concealing myself behind a projecting rock on the shore , I kept watch on his movements . 
After a few minutes a white figure made its appearance from the opposite direction . 
It came up to the blind boy and sat down beside him . 
At times the wind wafted their conversation to me . 
`` Well ? '' 
said a woman 's voice . 
`` The storm is violent ; Yanko will not be here . '' 
`` Yanko is not afraid of the storm ! '' 
the other replied . 
`` The mist is thickening , '' rejoined the woman 's voice , sadness in its tone . 
`` In the mist it is all the easier to slip past the guardships , '' was the answer . 
`` And if he is drowned ? '' 
`` Well , what then ? 
On Sunday you wo n't have a new ribbon to go to church in . '' 
An interval of silence followed . 
One thing , however , struck me -- in talking to me the blind boy spoke in the Little Russian dialect , but now he was expressing himself in pure Russian . 
`` You see , I am right ! '' 
the blind boy went on , clapping his hands . 
`` Yanko is not afraid of sea , nor winds , nor mist , nor coastguards ! 
Just listen ! 
That is not the water plashing , you ca n't deceive me -- it is his long oars . '' 
The woman sprang up and began anxiously to gaze into the distance . 
`` You are raving ! '' 
she said . 
`` I can not see anything . '' 
I confess that , much as I tried to make out in the distance something resembling a boat , my efforts were unsuccessful . 
About ten minutes passed thus , when a black speck appeared between the mountains of the waves ! 
At one time it grew larger , at another smaller . 
Slowly rising upon the crests of the waves and swiftly descending from them , the boat drew near to the shore . 
`` He must be a brave sailor , '' I thought , `` to have determined to cross the twenty versts of strait on a night like this , and he must have had a weighty reason for doing so . '' 
Reflecting thus , I gazed with an involuntary beating of the heart at the poor boat . 
It dived like a duck , and then , with rapidly swinging oars -- like wings -- it sprang forth from the abyss amid the splashes of the foam . 
`` Ah ! '' 
I thought , `` it will be dashed against the shore with all its force and broken to pieces ! '' 
But it turned aside adroitly and leaped unharmed into a little creek . 
Out of it stepped a man of medium height , wearing a Tartar sheepskin cap . 
He waved his hand , and all three set to work to drag something out of the boat . 
The cargo was so large that , to this day , I can not understand how it was that the boat did not sink . 
Each of them shouldered a bundle , and they set off along the shore , and I soon lost sight of them . 
I had to return home ; but I confess I was rendered uneasy by all these strange happenings , and I found it hard to await the morning . 
My Cossack was very much astonished when , on waking up , he saw me fully dressed . 
I did not , however , tell him the reason . 
For some time I stood at the window , gazing admiringly at the blue sky all studded with wisps of cloud , and at the distant shore of the Crimea , stretching out in a lilac-coloured streak and ending in a cliff , on the summit of which the white tower of the lighthouse was gleaming . 
Then I betook myself to the fortress , Phanagoriya , in order to ascertain from the Commandant at what hour I should depart for Gelenjik . 
But the Commandant , alas ! 
could not give me any definite information . 
The vessels lying in the harbour were all either guard-ships or merchant-vessels which had not yet even begun to take in lading . 
`` Maybe in about three or four days ' time a mail-boat will come in , '' said the Commandant , `` and then we shall see . '' 
I returned home sulky and wrathful . 
My Cossack met me at the door with a frightened countenance . 
`` Things are looking bad , sir ! '' 
he said . 
`` Yes , my friend ; goodness only knows when we shall get away ! '' 
Hereupon he became still more uneasy , and , bending towards me , he said in a whisper : `` It is uncanny here ! 
I met an under-officer from the Black Sea to-day -- he 's an acquaintance of mine -- he was in my detachment last year . 
When I told him where we were staying , he said , ` That place is uncanny , old fellow ; they 're wicked people there ! ' 
... And , indeed , what sort of a blind boy is that ? 
He goes everywhere alone , to fetch water and to buy bread at the bazaar . 
It is evident they have become accustomed to that sort of thing here . '' 
`` Well , what then ? 
Tell me , though , has the mistress of the place put in an appearance ? '' 
`` During your absence to-day , an old woman and her daughter arrived . '' 
`` What daughter ? 
She has no daughter ! '' 
`` Goodness knows who it can be if it is n't her daughter ; but the old woman is sitting over there in the hut now . '' 
I entered the hovel . 
A blazing fire was burning in the stove , and they were cooking a dinner which struck me as being a rather luxurious one for poor people . 
To all my questions the old woman replied that she was deaf and could not hear me . 
There was nothing to be got out of her . 
I turned to the blind boy who was sitting in front of the stove , putting twigs into the fire . 
`` Now , then , you little blind devil , '' I said , taking him by the ear . 
`` Tell me , where were you roaming with the bundle last night , eh ? '' 
The blind boy suddenly burst out weeping , shrieking and wailing .
