I studied upon the matter then . 
Mas ' r is n't good to himself . '' 
Tom said this with his back to his master , and his hand on the door-knob . 
St. Clare felt his face flush crimson , but he laughed . 
`` O , that 's all , is it ? '' 
he said , gayly . 
`` All ! '' 
said Tom , turning suddenly round and falling on his knees . 
`` O , my dear young Mas ` r ; I 'm ` fraid it will be loss of all -- all -- body and soul . 
The good Book says , ` it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder ! ' 
my dear Mas ` r ! '' 
Tom 's voice choked , and the tears ran down his cheeks . 
`` You poor , silly fool ! '' 
said St. Clare , with tears in his own eyes . 
`` Get up , Tom . 
I 'm not worth crying over . '' 
But Tom would n't rise , and looked imploring . 
`` Well , I wo n't go to any more of their cursed nonsense , Tom , '' said St. Clare ; `` on my honor , I wo n't . 
I do n't know why I have n't stopped long ago . 
I 've always despised it , and myself for it , -- so now , Tom , wipe up your eyes , and go about your errands . 
Come , come , '' he added , `` no blessings . 
I 'm not so wonderfully good , now , '' he said , as he gently pushed Tom to the door . 
`` There , I 'll pledge my honor to you , Tom , you do n't see me so again , '' he said ; and Tom went off , wiping his eyes , with great satisfaction . 
`` I 'll keep my faith with him , too , '' said St. Clare , as he closed the door . 
And St. Clare did so , -- for gross sensualism , in any form , was not the peculiar temptation of his nature . 
But , all this time , who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our friend Miss Ophelia , who had begun the labors of a Southern housekeeper ? 
There is all the difference in the world in the servants of Southern establishments , according to the character and capacity of the mistresses who have brought them up . 
South as well as north , there are women who have an extraordinary talent for command , and tact in educating . 
Such are enabled , with apparent ease , and without severity , to subject to their will , and bring into harmonious and systematic order , the various members of their small estate , -- to regulate their peculiarities , and so balance and compensate the deficiencies of one by the excess of another , as to produce a harmonious and orderly system . 
Such a housekeeper was Mrs. Shelby , whom we have already described ; and such our readers may remember to have met with . 
If they are not common at the South , it is because they are not common in the world . 
They are to be found there as often as anywhere ; and , when existing , find in that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their domestic talent . 
Such a housekeeper Marie St. Clare was not , nor her mother before her . 
Indolent and childish , unsystematic and improvident , it was not to be expected that servants trained under her care should not be so likewise ; and she had very justly described to Miss Ophelia the state of confusion she would find in the family , though she had not ascribed it to the proper cause . 
The first morning of her regency , Miss Ophelia was up at four o'clock ; and having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber , as she had done ever since she came there , to the great amazement of the chambermaid , she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and closets of the establishment of which she had the keys . 
The store-room , the linen-presses , the china-closet , the kitchen and cellar , that day , all went under an awful review . 
Hidden things of darkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the principalities and powers of kitchen and chamber , and caused many wonderings and murmurings about `` dese yer northern ladies '' from the domestic cabinet . 
Old Dinah , the head cook , and principal of all rule and authority in the kitchen department , was filled with wrath at what she considered an invasion of privilege . 
No feudal baron in Magna Charta times could have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown . 
Dinah was a character in her own way , and it would be injustice to her memory not to give the reader a little idea of her . 
She was a native and essential cook , as much as Aunt Chloe , -- cooking being an indigenous talent of the African race ; but Chloe was a trained and methodical one , who moved in an orderly domestic harness , while Dinah was a self-taught genius , and , like geniuses in general , was positive , opinionated and erratic , to the last degree . 
Like a certain class of modern philosophers , Dinah perfectly scorned logic and reason in every shape , and always took refuge in intuitive certainty ; and here she was perfectly impregnable . 
No possible amount of talent , or authority , or explanation , could ever make her believe that any other way was better than her own , or that the course she had pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified . 
This had been a conceded point with her old mistress , Marie 's mother ; and `` Miss Marie , '' as Dinah always called her young mistress , even after her marriage , found it easier to submit than contend ; and so Dinah had ruled supreme . 
This was the easier , in that she was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure . 
Dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse-making , in all its branches . 
Indeed , it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no wrong ; and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty , so as to maintain her own immaculateness entire . 
If any part of the dinner was a failure , there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it ; and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people , whom Dinah berated with unsparing zeal . 
But it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinah 's last results . 
Though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous , and without any sort of calculation as to time and place , -- though her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it , and she had about as many places for each cooking utensil as there were days in the year , -- yet , if one would have patience to wait her own good time , up would come her dinner in perfect order , and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could find no fault . 
It was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner . 
Dinah , who required large intervals of reflection and repose , and was studious of ease in all her arrangements , was seated on the kitchen floor , smoking a short , stumpy pipe , to which she was much addicted , and which she always kindled up , as a sort of censer , whenever she felt the need of an inspiration in her arrangements . 
It was Dinah 's mode of invoking the domestic Muses . 
Seated around her were various members of that rising race with which a Southern household abounds , engaged in shelling peas , peeling potatoes , picking pin-feathers out of fowls , and other preparatory arrangements , -- Dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations to give a poke , or a rap on the head , to some of the young operators , with the pudding-stick that lay by her side . 
In fact , Dinah ruled over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron , and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to `` save her steps , '' as she phrased it . 
It was the spirit of the system under which she had grown up , and she carried it out to its full extent . 
Miss Ophelia , after passing on her reformatory tour through all the other parts of the establishment , now entered the kitchen . 
Dinah had heard , from various sources , what was going on , and resolved to stand on defensive and conservative ground , -- mentally determined to oppose and ignore every new measure , without any actual observable contest . 
The kitchen was a large brick-floored apartment , with a great old-fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it , -- an arrangement which St. Clare had vainly tried to persuade Dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cook-stove . 
Not she . 
No Puseyite , * or conservative of any school , was ever more inflexibly attached to time-honored inconveniences than Dinah . 
* Edward Bouverie Pusey -LRB- 1800-1882 -RRB- , champion of the orthodoxy of revealed religion , defender of the Oxford movement , and Regius professor of Hebrew and Canon of Christ Church , Oxford . 
When St. Clare had first returned from the north , impressed with the system and order of his uncle 's kitchen arrangements , he had largely provided his own with an array of cupboards , drawers , and various apparatus , to induce systematic regulation , under the sanguine illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her arrangements . 
He might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a magpie . 
The more drawers and closets there were , the more hiding-holes could Dinah make for the accommodation of old rags , hair-combs , old shoes , ribbons , cast-off artificial flowers , and other articles of vertu , wherein her soul delighted . 
When Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen Dinah did not rise , but smoked on in sublime tranquillity , regarding her movements obliquely out of the corner of her eye , but apparently intent only on the operations around her . 
Miss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers . 
`` What is this drawer for , Dinah ? '' 
she said . 
`` It 's handy for most anything , Missis , '' said Dinah . 
So it appeared to be . 
From the variety it contained , Miss Ophelia pulled out first a fine damask table-cloth stained with blood , having evidently been used to envelop some raw meat . 
`` What 's this , Dinah ? 
You do n't wrap up meat in your mistress ' best table-cloths ? '' 
`` O Lor , Missis , no ; the towels was all a missin ' -- so I jest did it . 
I laid out to wash that a , -- that 's why I put it thar . '' 
`` Shif ` less ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia to herself , proceeding to tumble over the drawer , where she found a nutmeg-grater and two or three nutmegs , a Methodist hymn-book , a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs , some yarn and knitting-work , a paper of tobacco and a pipe , a few crackers , one or two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them , one or two thin old shoes , a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions , several damask table-napkins , some coarse crash towels , some twine and darning-needles , and several broken papers , from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer . 
`` Where do you keep your nutmegs , Dinah ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , with the air of one who prayed for patience . 
`` Most anywhar , Missis ; there 's some in that cracked tea-cup , up there , and there 's some over in that ar cupboard . '' 
`` Here are some in the grater , '' said Miss Ophelia , holding them up . 
`` Laws , yes , I put 'em there this morning , -- I likes to keep my things handy , '' said Dinah . 
`` You , Jake ! 
what are you stopping for ! 
You 'll cotch it ! 
Be still , thar ! '' 
she added , with a dive of her stick at the criminal . 
`` What 's this ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , holding up the saucer of pomade . 
`` Laws , it 's my har grease ; -- I put it thar to have it handy . '' 
`` Do you use your mistress ' best saucers for that ? '' 
`` Law ! 
it was cause I was driv , and in sich a hurry ; -- I was gwine to change it this very day . '' 
`` Here are two damask table-napkins . '' 
`` Them table-napkins I put thar , to get 'em washed out , some day . '' 
`` Do n't you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed ? '' 
`` Well , Mas ' r St. Clare got dat ar chest , he said , for dat ; but I likes to mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days , and then it a n't handy a liftin ' up the lid . '' 
`` Why do n't you mix your biscuits on the pastry-table , there ? '' 
`` Law , Missis , it gets sot so full of dishes , and one thing and another , der a n't no room , noway -- '' `` But you should wash your dishes , and clear them away . '' 
`` Wash my dishes ! '' 
said Dinah , in a high key , as her wrath began to rise over her habitual respect of manner ; `` what does ladies know ` bout work , I want to know ? 
When 'd Mas ' r ever get his dinner , if I vas to spend all my time a washin ' and a puttin ' up dishes ? 
Miss Marie never telled me so , nohow . '' 
`` Well , here are these onions . '' 
`` Laws , yes ! '' 
said Dinah ; `` thar is whar I put 'em , now . 
I could n't ` member . 
Them 's particular onions I was a savin ' for dis yer very stew . 
I 'd forgot they was in dat ar old flannel . '' 
Miss Ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs . 
`` I wish Missis would n't touch dem ar . 
I likes to keep my things where I knows whar to go to 'em , '' said Dinah , rather decidedly . 
`` But you do n't want these holes in the papers . '' 
`` Them 's handy for siftin ' on ' t out , '' said Dinah . 
`` But you see it spills all over the drawer . '' 
`` Laws , yes ! 
if Missis will go a tumblin ' things all up so , it will . 
Missis has spilt lots dat ar way , '' said Dinah , coming uneasily to the drawers . 
`` If Missis only will go up stars till my clarin ' up time comes , I 'll have everything right ; but I ca n't do nothin ' when ladies is round , a henderin ' . 
You , Sam , do n't you gib the baby dat ar sugar-bowl ! 
I 'll crack ye over , if ye do n't mind ! '' 
`` I 'm going through the kitchen , and going to put everything in order , once , Dinah ; and then I 'll expect you to keep it so . '' 
`` Lor , now ! 
Miss Phelia ; dat ar a n't no way for ladies to do . 
I never did see ladies doin ' no sich ; my old Missis nor Miss Marie never did , and I do n't see no kinder need on ` t ; '' and Dinah stalked indignantly about , while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes , emptied dozens of scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle , sorted napkins , table-cloths , and towels , for washing ; washing , wiping , and arranging with her own hands , and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed Dinah . 
`` Lor now ! 
if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do , dey a n't ladies , nohow , '' she said to some of her satellites , when at a safe hearing distance . 
`` I has things as straight as anybody , when my clarin ' up times comes ; but I do n't want ladies round , a henderin ' , and getting my things all where I ca n't find 'em . '' 
To do Dinah justice , she had , at irregular periods , paroxyms of reformation and arrangement , which she called `` clarin ' up times , '' when she would begin with great zeal , and turn every drawer and closet wrong side outward , on to the floor or tables , and make the ordinary confusion seven-fold more confounded . 
Then she would light her pipe , and leisurely go over her arrangements , looking things over , and discoursing upon them ; making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin things , and keeping up for several hours a most energetic state of confusion , which she would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers , by the remark that she was a `` clarin ' up . '' 
`` She could n't hev things a gwine on so as they had been , and she was gwine to make these yer young ones keep better order ; '' for Dinah herself , somehow , indulged the illusion that she , herself , was the soul of order , and it was only the young uns , and the everybody else in the house , that were the cause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect . 
When all the tins were scoured , and the tables scrubbed snowy white , and everything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners , Dinah would dress herself up in a smart dress , clean apron , and high , brilliant Madras turban , and tell all marauding `` young uns '' to keep out of the kitchen , for she was gwine to have things kept nice . 
Indeed , these periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household ; for Dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin , as to insist upon it that it should n't be used again for any possible purpose , -- at least , till the ardor of the `` clarin ' up '' period abated . 
Miss Ophelia , in a few days , thoroughly reformed every department of the house to a systematic pattern ; but her labors in all departments that depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of Sisyphus or the Danaides . 
In despair , she one day appealed to St. Clare . 
`` There is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this family ! '' 
`` To be sure , there is n't , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Such shiftless management , such waste , such confusion , I never saw ! '' 
`` I dare say you did n't . '' 
`` You would not take it so coolly , if you were housekeeper . '' 
`` My dear cousin , you may as well understand , once for all , that we masters are divided into two classes , oppressors and oppressed . 
We who are good-natured and hate severity make up our minds to a good deal of inconvenience . 
If we will keep a shambling , loose , untaught set in the community , for our convenience , why , we must take the consequence . 
Some rare cases I have seen , of persons , who , by a peculiar tact , can produce order and system without severity ; but I 'm not one of them , -- and so I made up my mind , long ago , to let things go just as they do . 
I will not have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces , and they know it , -- and , of course , they know the staff is in their own hands . '' 
`` But to have no time , no place , no order , -- all going on in this shiftless way ! '' 
`` My dear Vermont , you natives up by the North Pole set an extravagant value on time ! 
What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with ? 
As to order and system , where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read , an hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner is n't of much account . 
Now , there 's Dinah gets you a capital dinner , -- soup , ragout , roast fowl , dessert , ice-creams and all , -- and she creates it all out of chaos and old night down there , in that kitchen . 
I think it really sublime , the way she manages . 
But , Heaven bless us ! 
if we are to go down there , and view all the smoking and squatting about , and hurryscurryation of the preparatory process , we should never eat more ! 
My good cousin , absolve yourself from that ! 
It 's more than a Catholic penance , and does no more good . 
You 'll only lose your own temper , and utterly confound Dinah . 
Let her go her own way . '' 
`` But , Augustine , you do n't know how I found things . '' 
`` Do n't I ? 
Do n't I know that the rolling-pin is under her bed , and the nutmeg-grater in her pocket with her tobacco , -- that there are sixty-five different sugar-bowls , one in every hole in the house , -- that she washes dishes with a dinner-napkin one day , and with a fragment of an old petticoat the next ? 
But the upshot is , she gets up glorious dinners , makes superb coffee ; and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen are judged , by her success . '' 
`` But the waste , -- the expense ! '' 
`` O , well ! 
Lock everything you can , and keep the key . 
Give out by driblets , and never inquire for odds and ends , -- it is n't best . '' 
`` That troubles me , Augustine . 
I ca n't help feeling as if these servants were not strictly honest . 
Are you sure they can be relied on ? '' 
Augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which Miss Ophelia propounded the question . 
`` O , cousin , that 's too good , -- honest ! 
-- as if that 's a thing to be expected ! 
Honest ! 
-- why , of course , they ar n't . 
Why should they be ? 
What upon earth is to make them so ? '' 
`` Why do n't you instruct ? '' 
`` Instruct ! 
O , fiddlestick ! 
What instructing do you think I should do ? 
I look like it ! 
As to Marie , she has spirit enough , to be sure , to kill off a whole plantation , if I 'd let her manage ; but she would n't get the cheatery out of them . '' 
`` Are there no honest ones ? '' 
`` Well , now and then one , whom Nature makes so impracticably simple , truthful and faithful , that the worst possible influence ca n't destroy it . 
But , you see , from the mother 's breast the colored child feels and sees that there are none but underhand ways open to it . 
It can get along no other way with its parents , its mistress , its young master and missie play-fellows . 
Cunning and deception become necessary , inevitable habits . 
It is n't fair to expect anything else of him . 
He ought not to be punished for it . 
As to honesty , the slave is kept in that dependent , semi-childish state , that there is no making him realize the rights of property , or feel that his master 's goods are not his own , if he can get them . 
For my part , I do n't see how they can be honest . 
Such a fellow as Tom , here , is , -- is a moral miracle ! '' 
`` And what becomes of their souls ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` That is n't my affair , as I know of , '' said St. Clare ; `` I am only dealing in facts of the present life . 
The fact is , that the whole race are pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil , for our benefit , in this world , however it may turn out in another ! '' 
`` This is perfectly horrible ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia ; `` you ought to be ashamed of yourselves ! '' 
`` I do n't know as I am . 
We are in pretty good company , for all that , '' said St. Clare , `` as people in the broad road generally are . 
Look at the high and the low , all the world over , and it 's the same story , -- the lower class used up , body , soul and spirit , for the good of the upper . 
It is so in England ; it is so everywhere ; and yet all Christendom stands aghast , with virtuous indignation , because we do the thing in a little different shape from what they do it . '' 
`` It is n't so in Vermont . '' 
`` Ah , well , in New England , and in the free States , you have the better of us , I grant . 
But there 's the bell ; so , Cousin , let us for a while lay aside our sectional prejudices , and come out to dinner . '' 
As Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon , some of the sable children called out , `` La , sakes ! 
thar 's Prue a coming , grunting along like she allers does . '' 
A tall , bony colored woman now entered the kitchen , bearing on her head a basket of rusks and hot rolls . 
`` Ho , Prue ! 
you 've come , '' said Dinah . 
Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance , and a sullen , grumbling voice . 
She set down her basket , squatted herself down , and resting her elbows on her knees said , `` O Lord ! 
I wish ' t I 's dead ! '' 
`` Why do you wish you were dead ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I 'd be out o ' my misery , '' said the woman , gruffly , without taking her eyes from the floor . 
`` What need you getting drunk , then , and cutting up , Prue ? '' 
said a spruce quadroon chambermaid , dangling , as she spoke , a pair of coral ear-drops . 
The woman looked at her with a sour surly glance . 
`` Maybe you 'll come to it , one of these yer days . 
I 'd be glad to see you , I would ; then you 'll be glad of a drop , like me , to forget your misery . '' 
`` Come , Prue , '' said Dinah , `` let 's look at your rusks . 
Here 's Missis will pay for them . '' 
Miss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen . 
`` Thar 's some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf , '' said Dinah . 
`` You , Jake , climb up and get it down . '' 
`` Tickets , -- what are they for ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` We buy tickets of her Mas ` r , and she gives us bread for 'em . '' 
`` And they counts my money and tickets , when I gets home , to see if I 's got the change ; and if I ha n't , they half kills me . '' 
`` And serves you right , '' said Jane , the pert chambermaid , `` if you will take their money to get drunk on . 
That 's what she does , Missis . '' 
`` And that 's what I will do , -- I ca n't live no other ways , -- drink and forget my misery . '' 
`` You are very wicked and very foolish , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` to steal your master 's money to make yourself a brute with . '' 
`` It 's mighty likely , Missis ; but I will do it , -- yes , I will . 
O Lord ! 
I wish I 's dead , I do , -- I wish I 's dead , and out of my misery ! '' 
and slowly and stiffly the old creature rose , and got her basket on her head again ; but before she went out , she looked at the quadroon girl , who still stood playing with her ear-drops . 
`` Ye think ye 're mighty fine with them ar , a frolickin ' and a tossin ' your head , and a lookin ' down on everybody . 
Well , never mind , -- you may live to be a poor , old , cut-up crittur , like me . 
Hope to the Lord ye will , I do ; then see if ye wo n't drink , -- drink , -- drink , -- yerself into torment ; and sarve ye right , too -- ugh ! '' 
and , with a malignant howl , the woman left the room . 
`` Disgusting old beast ! '' 
said Adolph , who was getting his master 's shaving-water . 
`` If I was her master , I 'd cut her up worse than she is . '' 
`` Ye could n't do that ar , no ways , '' said Dinah . 
`` Her back 's a far sight now , -- she ca n't never get a dress together over it . '' 
`` I think such low creatures ought not to be allowed to go round to genteel families , '' said Miss Jane . 
`` What do you think , Mr. St. Clare ? '' 
she said , coquettishly tossing her head at Adolph . 
It must be observed that , among other appropriations from his master 's stock , Adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address ; and that the style under which he moved , among the colored circles of New Orleans , was that of Mr. St. Clare . 
`` I 'm certainly of your opinion , Miss Benoir , '' said Adolph . 
Benoir was the name of Marie St. Clare 's family , and Jane was one of her servants . 
`` Pray , Miss Benoir , may I be allowed to ask if those drops are for the ball , tomorrow night ? 
They are certainly bewitching ! '' 
`` I wonder , now , Mr. St. Clare , what the impudence of you men will come to ! '' 
said Jane , tossing her pretty head 'til the ear-drops twinkled again . 
`` I sha n't dance with you for a whole evening , if you go to asking me any more questions . '' 
`` O , you could n't be so cruel , now ! 
I was just dying to know whether you would appear in your pink tarletane , '' said Adolph . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Rosa , a bright , piquant little quadroon who came skipping down stairs at this moment . 
`` Why , Mr. St. Clare 's so impudent ! '' 
`` On my honor , '' said Adolph , `` I 'll leave it to Miss Rosa now . '' 
`` I know he 's always a saucy creature , '' said Rosa , poising herself on one of her little feet , and looking maliciously at Adolph . 
`` He 's always getting me so angry with him . '' 
`` O ! 
ladies , ladies , you will certainly break my heart , between you , '' said Adolph . 
`` I shall be found dead in my bed , some morning , and you 'll have it to answer for . '' 
`` Do hear the horrid creature talk ! '' 
said both ladies , laughing immoderately . 
`` Come , -- clar out , you ! 
I ca n't have you cluttering up the kitchen , '' said Dinah ; `` in my way , foolin ' round here . '' 
`` Aunt Dinah 's glum , because she ca n't go to the ball , '' said Rosa . 
`` Do n't want none o ' your light-colored balls , '' said Dinah ; `` cuttin ' round , makin ' b ` lieve you 's white folks . 
Arter all , you 's niggers , much as I am . '' 
`` Aunt Dinah greases her wool stiff , every day , to make it lie straight , '' said Jane . 
`` And it will be wool , after all , '' said Rosa , maliciously shaking down her long , silky curls . 
`` Well , in the Lord 's sight , a n't wool as good as har , any time ? '' 
said Dinah . 
`` I 'd like to have Missis say which is worth the most , -- a couple such as you , or one like me . 
Get out wid ye , ye trumpery , -- I wo n't have ye round ! '' 
Here the conversation was interrupted in a two-fold manner . 
St. Clare 's voice was heard at the head of the stairs , asking Adolph if he meant to stay all night with his shaving-water ; and Miss Ophelia , coming out of the dining-room , said , `` Jane and Rosa , what are you wasting your time for , here ? 
Go in and attend to your muslins . '' 
Our friend Tom , who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with the old rusk-woman , had followed her out into the street . 
He saw her go on , giving every once in a while a suppressed groan . 
At last she set her basket down on a doorstep , and began arranging the old , faded shawl which covered her shoulders . 
`` I 'll carry your basket a piece , '' said Tom , compassionately . 
`` Why should ye ? '' 
said the woman . 
`` I do n't want no help . '' 
`` You seem to be sick , or in trouble , or somethin' , '' said Tom . 
`` I a n't sick , '' said the woman , shortly . 
`` I wish , '' said Tom , looking at her earnestly , -- `` I wish I could persuade you to leave off drinking . 
Do n't you know it will be the ruin of ye , body and soul ? '' 
`` I knows I 'm gwine to torment , '' said the woman , sullenly . 
`` Ye do n't need to tell me that ar . 
I 's ugly , I 's wicked , -- I 's gwine straight to torment . 
O , Lord ! 
I wish I 's thar ! '' 
Tom shuddered at these frightful words , spoken with a sullen , impassioned earnestness . 
`` O , Lord have mercy on ye ! 
poor crittur . 
Ha n't ye never heard of Jesus Christ ? '' 
`` Jesus Christ , -- who 's he ? '' 
`` Why , he 's the Lord , '' said Tom . 
`` I think I 've hearn tell o ' the Lord , and the judgment and torment . 
I 've heard o ' that . '' 
`` But did n't anybody ever tell you of the Lord Jesus , that loved us poor sinners , and died for us ? '' 
`` Do n't know nothin ' ` bout that , '' said the woman ; `` nobody ha n't never loved me , since my old man died . '' 
`` Where was you raised ? '' 
said Tom . 
`` Up in Kentuck . 
A man kept me to breed chil ` en for market , and sold 'em as fast as they got big enough ; last of all , he sold me to a speculator , and my Mas ' r got me o ' him . '' 
`` What set you into this bad way of drinkin ' ? '' 
`` To get shet o ' my misery . 
I had one child after I come here ; and I thought then I 'd have one to raise , cause Mas ' r was n't a speculator . 
It was de peartest little thing ! 
and Missis she seemed to think a heap on ` t , at first ; it never cried , -- it was likely and fat . 
But Missis tuck sick , and I tended her ; and I tuck the fever , and my milk all left me , and the child it pined to skin and bone , and Missis would n't buy milk for it . 
She would n't hear to me , when I telled her I had n't milk . 
She said she knowed I could feed it on what other folks eat ; and the child kinder pined , and cried , and cried , and cried , day and night , and got all gone to skin and bones , and Missis got sot agin it and she said ' t wa n't nothin ' but crossness . 
She wished it was dead , she said ; and she would n't let me have it o ' nights , cause , she said , it kept me awake , and made me good for nothing . 
She made me sleep in her room ; and I had to put it away off in a little kind o ' garret , and thar it cried itself to death , one night . 
It did ; and I tuck to drinkin ' , to keep its crying out of my ears ! 
I did , -- and I will drink ! 
I will , if I do go to torment for it ! 
Mas ' r says I shall go to torment , and I tell him I 've got thar now ! '' 
`` O , ye poor crittur ! '' 
said Tom , `` ha n't nobody never telled ye how the Lord Jesus loved ye , and died for ye ? 
Ha n't they telled ye that he 'll help ye , and ye can go to heaven , and have rest , at last ? '' 
`` I looks like gwine to heaven , '' said the woman ; `` a n't thar where white folks is gwine ? 
S'pose they 'd have me thar ? 
I 'd rather go to torment , and get away from Mas ' r and Missis . 
I had so , '' she said , as with her usual groan , she got her basket on her head , and walked sullenly away . 
Tom turned , and walked sorrowfully back to the house . 
In the court he met little Eva , -- a crown of tuberoses on her head , and her eyes radiant with delight . 
`` O , Tom ! 
here you are . 
I 'm glad I 've found you . 
Papa says you may get out the ponies , and take me in my little new carriage , '' she said , catching his hand . 
`` But what 's the matter Tom ? 
-- you look sober . '' 
`` I feel bad , Miss Eva , '' said Tom , sorrowfully . 
`` But I 'll get the horses for you . '' 
`` But do tell me , Tom , what is the matter . 
I saw you talking to cross old Prue . '' 
Tom , in simple , earnest phrase , told Eva the woman 's history . 
She did not exclaim or wonder , or weep , as other children do . 
Her cheeks grew pale , and a deep , earnest shadow passed over her eyes . 
She laid both hands on her bosom , and sighed heavily . 
VOLUME II `` Tom , you need n't get me the horses . 
I do n't want to go , '' she said . 
`` Why not , Miss Eva ? '' 
`` These things sink into my heart , Tom , '' said Eva , -- `` they sink into my heart , '' she repeated , earnestly . 
`` I do n't want to go ; '' and she turned from Tom , and went into the house . 
A few days after , another woman came , in old Prue 's place , to bring the rusks ; Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen . 
`` Lor ! '' 
said Dinah , `` what 's got Prue ? '' 
`` Prue is n't coming any more , '' said the woman , mysteriously . 
`` Why not ? '' 
said Dinah , `` she a n't dead , is she ? '' 
`` We does n't exactly know . 
She 's down cellar , '' said the woman , glancing at Miss Ophelia . 
After Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks , Dinah followed the woman to the door . 
`` What has got Prue , any how ? '' 
she said . 
The woman seemed desirous , yet reluctant , to speak , and answered , in low , mysterious tone . 
`` Well , you must n't tell nobody , Prue , she got drunk agin , -- and they had her down cellar , -- and thar they left her all day , -- and I hearn 'em saying that the flies had got to her , -- and she 's dead ! '' 
Dinah held up her hands , and , turning , saw close by her side the spirit-like form of Evangeline , her large , mystic eyes dilated with horror , and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks . 
`` Lor bless us ! 
Miss Eva 's gwine to faint away ! 
What go us all , to let her har such talk ? 
Her pa 'll be rail mad . '' 
`` I sha n't faint , Dinah , '' said the child , firmly ; `` and why should n't I hear it ? 
It a n't so much for me to hear it , as for poor Prue to suffer it . '' '' 
Lor sakes ! 
it is n't for sweet , delicate young ladies , like you , -- these yer stories is n't ; it 's enough to kill 'em ! '' 
Eva sighed again , and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step . 
Miss Ophelia anxiously inquired the woman 's story . 
Dinah gave a very garrulous version of it , to which Tom added the particulars which he had drawn from her that morning . 
`` An abominable business , -- perfectly horrible ! '' 
she exclaimed , as she entered the room where St. Clare lay reading his paper . 
`` Pray , what iniquity has turned up now ? '' 
said he . 
`` What now ? 
why , those folks have whipped Prue to death ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , going on , with great strength of detail , into the story , and enlarging on its most shocking particulars . 
`` I thought it would come to that , some time , '' said St. Clare , going on with his paper . 
`` Thought so ! 
-- a n't you going to do anything about it ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Have n't you got any selectmen , or anybody , to interfere and look after such matters ? '' 
`` It 's commonly supposed that the property interest is a sufficient guard in these cases . 
If people choose to ruin their own possessions , I do n't know what 's to be done . 
It seems the poor creature was a thief and a drunkard ; and so there wo n't be much hope to get up sympathy for her . '' 
`` It is perfectly outrageous , -- it is horrid , Augustine ! 
It will certainly bring down vengeance upon you . '' 
`` My dear cousin , I did n't do it , and I ca n't help it ; I would , if I could . 
If low-minded , brutal people will act like themselves , what am I to do ? 
they have absolute control ; they are irresponsible despots . 
There would be no use in interfering ; there is no law that amounts to anything practically , for such a case . 
The best we can do is to shut our eyes and ears , and let it alone . 
It 's the only resource left us . '' 
`` How can you shut your eyes and ears ? 
How can you let such things alone ? '' 
`` My dear child , what do you expect ? 
Here is a whole class , -- debased , uneducated , indolent , provoking , -- put , without any sort of terms or conditions , entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in our world are ; people who have neither consideration nor self-control , who have n't even an enlightened regard to their own interest , -- for that 's the case with the largest half of mankind . 
Of course , in a community so organized , what can a man of honorable and humane feelings do , but shut his eyes all he can , and harden his heart ? 
I ca n't buy every poor wretch I see . 
I ca n't turn knight-errant , and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this . 
The most I can do is to try and keep out of the way of it . '' 
St. Clare 's fine countenance was for a moment overcast ; he said , `` Come , cousin , do n't stand there looking like one of the Fates ; you 've only seen a peep through the curtain , -- a specimen of what is going on , the world over , in some shape or other . 
If we are to be prying and spying into all the dismals of life , we should have no heart to anything . ' 
T is like looking too close into the details of Dinah 's kitchen ; '' and St. Clare lay back on the sofa , and busied himself with his paper . 
Miss Ophelia sat down , and pulled out her knitting-work , and sat there grim with indignation . 
She knit and knit , but while she mused the fire burned ; at last she broke out -- `` I tell you , Augustine , I ca n't get over things so , if you can . 
It 's a perfect abomination for you to defend such a system , -- that 's my mind ! '' 
`` What now ? '' 
said St. Clare , looking up . 
`` At it again , hey ? '' 
`` I say it 's perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , with increasing warmth . '' 
I defend it , my dear lady ? 
Who ever said I did defend it ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` Of course , you defend it , -- you all do , -- all you Southerners . 
What do you have slaves for , if you do n't ? '' 
`` Are you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever does what they do n't think is right ? 
Do n't you , or did n't you ever , do anything that you did not think quite right ? '' 
`` If I do , I repent of it , I hope , '' said Miss Ophelia , rattling her needles with energy . 
`` So do I , '' said St. Clare , peeling his orange ; `` I 'm repenting of it all the time . '' 
`` What do you keep on doing it for ? '' 
`` Did n't you ever keep on doing wrong , after you 'd repented , my good cousin ? '' 
`` Well , only when I 've been very much tempted , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Well , I 'm very much tempted , '' said St. Clare ; `` that 's just my difficulty . '' 
`` But I always resolve I wo n't and I try to break off . '' 
`` Well , I have been resolving I wo n't , off and on , these ten years , '' said St. Clare ; `` but I have n't , some how , got clear . 
Have you got clear of all your sins , cousin ? '' 
`` Cousin Augustine , '' said Miss Ophelia , seriously , and laying down her knitting-work , `` I suppose I deserve that you should reprove my short-comings . 
I know all you say is true enough ; nobody else feels them more than I do ; but it does seem to me , after all , there is some difference between me and you . 
It seems to me I would cut off my right hand sooner than keep on , from day to day , doing what I thought was wrong . 
But , then , my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession , I do n't wonder you reprove me . '' 
`` O , now , cousin , '' said Augustine , sitting down on the floor , and laying his head back in her lap , `` do n't take on so awfully serious ! 
You know what a good-for-nothing , saucy boy I always was . 
I love to poke you up , -- that 's all , -- just to see you get earnest . 
I do think you are desperately , distressingly good ; it tires me to death to think of it . '' 
`` But this is a serious subject , my boy , Auguste , '' said Miss Ophelia , laying her hand on his forehead . 
`` Dismally so , '' said he ; `` and I -- well , I never want to talk seriously in hot weather . 
What with mosquitos and all , a fellow ca n't get himself up to any very sublime moral flights ; and I believe , '' said St. Clare , suddenly rousing himself up , `` there 's a theory , now ! 
I understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones , -- I see into that whole subject . '' 
`` O , Augustine , you are a sad rattle-brain ! '' 
`` Am I ? 
Well , so I am , I suppose ; but for once I will be serious , now ; but you must hand me that basket of oranges ; -- you see , you 'll have to ` stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples , ' if I 'm going to make this effort . 
Now , '' said Augustine , drawing the basket up , `` I 'll begin : When , in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for a fellow to hold two or three dozen of his fellow-worms in captivity , a decent regard to the opinions of society requires -- '' `` I do n't see that you are growing more serious , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Wait , -- I 'm coming on , -- you 'll hear . 
The short of the matter is , cousin , '' said he , his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression , `` on this abstract question of slavery there can , as I think , be but one opinion . 
Planters , who have money to make by it , -- clergymen , who have planters to please , -- politicians , who want to rule by it , -- may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that shall astonish the world at their ingenuity ; they can press nature and the Bible , and nobody knows what else , into the service ; but , after all , neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more . 
It comes from the devil , that 's the short of it ; -- and , to my mind , it 's a pretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line . '' 
Miss Ophelia stopped her knitting , and looked surprised , and St. Clare , apparently enjoying her astonishment , went on . 
`` You seem to wonder ; but if you will get me fairly at it , I 'll make a clean breast of it . 
This cursed business , accursed of God and man , what is it ? 
Strip it of all its ornament , run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole , and what is it ? 
Why , because my brother Quashy is ignorant and weak , and I am intelligent and strong , -- because I know how , and can do it , -- therefore , I may steal all he has , keep it , and give him only such and so much as suits my fancy . 
Whatever is too hard , too dirty , too disagreeable , for me , I may set Quashy to doing . 
Because I do n't like work , Quashy shall work . 
Because the sun burns me , Quashy shall stay in the sun . 
Quashy shall earn the money , and I will spend it . 
Quashy shall lie down in every puddle , that I may walk over dry-shod . 
Quashy shall do my will , and not his , all the days of his mortal life , and have such chance of getting to heaven , at last , as I find convenient . 
This I take to be about what slavery is . 
I defy anybody on earth to read our slave-code , as it stands in our law-books , and make anything else of it . 
Talk of the abuses of slavery ! 
Humbug ! 
The thing itself is the essence of all abuse ! 
And the only reason why the land do n't sink under it , like Sodom and Gomorrah , is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it is . 
For pity 's sake , for shame 's sake , because we are men born of women , and not savage beasts , many of us do not , and dare not , -- we would scorn to use the full power which our savage laws put into our hands . 
And he who goes the furthest , and does the worst , only uses within limits the power that the law gives him . '' 
St. Clare had started up , and , as his manner was when excited , was walking , with hurried steps , up and down the floor . 
His fine face , classic as that of a Greek statue , seemed actually to burn with the fervor of his feelings . 
His large blue eyes flashed , and he gestured with an unconscious eagerness . 
Miss Ophelia had never seen him in this mood before , and she sat perfectly silent . 
`` I declare to you , '' said he , suddenly stopping before his cousin '' -LRB- It 's no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject -RRB- , but I declare to you , there have been times when I have thought , if the whole country would sink , and hide all this injustice and misery from the light , I would willingly sink with it . 
When I have been travelling up and down on our boats , or about on my collecting tours , and reflected that every brutal , disgusting , mean , low-lived fellow I met , was allowed by our laws to become absolute despot of as many men , women and children , as he could cheat , steal , or gamble money enough to buy , -- when I have seen such men in actual ownership of helpless children , of young girls and women , -- I have been ready to curse my country , to curse the human race ! '' 
`` Augustine ! 
Augustine ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , `` I 'm sure you 've said enough . 
I never , in my life , heard anything like this , even at the North . '' 
`` At the North ! '' 
said St. Clare , with a sudden change of expression , and resuming something of his habitual careless tone . 
`` Pooh ! 
your northern folks are cold-blooded ; you are cool in everything ! 
You ca n't begin to curse up hill and down as we can , when we get fairly at it . '' 
`` Well , but the question is , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` O , yes , to be sure , the question is , -- and a deuce of a question it is ! 
How came you in this state of sin and misery ? 
Well , I shall answer in the good old words you used to teach me , Sundays . 
I came so by ordinary generation . 
My servants were my father 's , and , what is more , my mother 's ; and now they are mine , they and their increase , which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item .
