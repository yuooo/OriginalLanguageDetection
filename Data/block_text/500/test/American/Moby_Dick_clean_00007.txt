But those chaps there are worse yet -- they are your white squalls , they . 
White squalls ? 
white whale , shirr ! 
shirr ! 
Here have I heard all their chat just now , and the white whale -- shirr ! 
shirr ! 
-- but spoken of once ! 
and only this evening -- it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine -- that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him ! 
Oh , thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness , have mercy on this small black boy down here ; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear ! 
I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul . 
A wild , mystical , sympathetical feeling was in me ; Ahab 's quenchless feud seemed mine . 
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge . 
For some time past , though at intervals only , the unaccompanied , secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen . 
But not all of them knew of his existence ; only a few of them , comparatively , had knowingly seen him ; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him , was small indeed . 
For , owing to the large number of whale-cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick . 
It was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , I say , that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick . 
Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause . 
In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded . 
And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species . 
But at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come . 
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters . 
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events , -- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to . 
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there . 
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them . 
Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth . 
No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears . 
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw . 
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work . 
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body . 
There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling . 
Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him . 
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- Olassen and Povelson -- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood . 
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier 's , were these or almost similar impressions effaced . 
For in his Natural History , the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale , all fish -LRB- sharks included -RRB- are `` struck with the most lively terrors , '' and `` often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death . '' 
And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters . 
So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to Moby Dick , the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man . 
That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity . 
On this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted . 
Nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered . 
One of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time . 
Nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability . 
For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points . 
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas . 
Nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days . 
Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ' West Passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale . 
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal -LRB- near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface -RRB- ; and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse -LRB- whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage -RRB- ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen . 
Forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal -LRB- for immortality is but ubiquity in time -RRB- ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen . 
But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power . 
For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump . 
These were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him . 
The rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings . 
Nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults . 
More than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else . 
For , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship . 
Already several fatalities had attended his chase . 
But though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale 's infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent . 
Judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale 's direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal . 
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line-knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale . 
That captain was Ahab . 
And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab 's leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . 
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . 
Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . 
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . 
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ; -- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it . 
All that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy Ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in Moby Dick . 
He piled upon the whale 's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart 's shell upon it . 
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment . 
Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more . 
Yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling Patagonian Cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad . 
That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock . 
In a strait-jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales . 
And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ` sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man 's delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , raved on . 
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing . 
When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form . 
Ahab 's full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated Hudson , when that noble Northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge . 
But , as in his narrow-flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab 's broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . 
That before living agent , now became the living instrument . 
If such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object . 
This is much ; yet Ahab 's larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted . 
But vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound . 
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ; -- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man 's upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes ! 
So with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a Caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages . 
Wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls ! 
question that proud , sad king ! 
A family likeness ! 
aye , he did beget ye , ye young exiled royalties ; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come . 
Now , in his heart , Ahab had some glimpse of this , namely : all my means are sane , my motive and my object mad . 
Yet without power to kill , or change , or shun the fact ; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble ; in some sort , did still . 
But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility , not to his will determinate . 
Nevertheless , so well did he succeed in that dissembling , that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last , no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved , and that to the quick , with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him . 
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause . 
And so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow . 
Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales . 
Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes . 
Or , if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that , yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack . 
But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale . 
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then , how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man ! 
They were bent on profitable cruises , the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint . 
He was intent on an audacious , immitigable , and supernatural revenge . 
Here , then , was this grey-headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job 's whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck , the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask . 
Such a crew , so officered , seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge . 
How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man 's ire -- by what evil magic their souls were possessed , that at times his hate seemed almost theirs ; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his ; how all this came to be -- what the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life , -- all this to explain , would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go . 
The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ? 
Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag ? 
What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still ? 
For one , I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place ; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale , could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill . 
What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid . 
Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick , which could not but occasionally awaken in any man 's soul some alarm , there was another thought , or rather vague , nameless horror concerning him , which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest ; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it , that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form . 
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me . 
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught . 
Though in many natural objects , whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if imparting some special virtue of its own , as in marbles , japonicas , and pearls ; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue ; even the barbaric , grand old kings of Pegu placing the title `` Lord of the White Elephants '' above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion ; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard ; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger ; and the great Austrian Empire , Caesarian , heir to overlording Rome , having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue ; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself , giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe ; and though , besides , all this , whiteness has been even made significant of gladness , for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day ; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings , this same hue is made the emblem of many touching , noble things -- the innocence of brides , the benignity of age ; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour ; though in many climes , whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge , and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds ; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power ; by the Persian fire worshippers , the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar ; and in the Greek mythologies , Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull ; and though to the noble Iroquois , the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology , that spotless , faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity ; and though directly from the Latin word for white , all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture , the alb or tunic , worn beneath the cassock ; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith , white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord ; though in the Vision of St. John , white robes are given to the redeemed , and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne , and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool ; yet for all these accumulated associations , with whatever is sweet , and honourable , and sublime , there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue , which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood . 
This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds . 
Witness the white bear of the poles , and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth , flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are ? 
That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness , even more loathsome than terrific , to the dumb gloating of their aspect . 
So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark . 
* * With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . 
But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror . 
As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped . 
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish . 
The Romish mass for the dead begins with `` Requiem eternam '' -LRB- eternal rest -RRB- , whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music . 
Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French call him REQUIN . 
Bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ? 
Not Coleridge first threw that spell ; but God 's great , unflattering laureate , Nature . 
* * I remember the first albatross I ever saw . 
It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas . 
From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime . 
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . 
Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . 
Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress . 
Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God . 
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . 
Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage . 
I can not tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . 
But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this . 
A goney , he replied . 
Goney ! 
never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore ! 
never ! 
But some time after , I learned that goney was some seaman 's name for albatross . 
So that by no possibility could Coleridge 's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine , when I saw that bird upon our deck . 
For neither had I then read the Rhyme , nor knew the bird to be an albatross . 
Yet , in saying this , I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet . 
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl . 
But how had the mystic thing been caught ? 
Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea . 
At last the Captain made a postman of it ; tying a lettered , leathern tally round its neck , with the ship 's time and place ; and then letting it escape . 
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim ! 
Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies ; a magnificent milk-white charger , large-eyed , small-headed , bluff-chested , and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty , overscorning carriage . 
He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses , whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies . 
At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light . 
The flashing cascade of his mane , the curving comet of his tail , invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him . 
A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen , western world , which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god , bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed . 
Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains , like an Ohio ; or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon , the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness ; in whatever aspect he presented himself , always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe . 
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse , that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness ; and that this divineness had that in it which , though commanding worship , at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror . 
But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross . 
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin ! 
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears . 
The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion . 
Why should this be so ? 
Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible . 
From its snowy aspect , the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White Squall . 
Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . 
How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in Froissart , when , masked in the snowy symbol of their faction , the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place ! 
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue . 
It can not well be doubted , that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer , is the marble pallor lingering there ; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world , as of mortal trepidation here . 
And from that pallor of the dead , we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them . 
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms ; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog -- Yea , while these terrors seize us , let us add , that even the king of terrors , when personified by the evangelist , rides on his pallid horse . 
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul . 
But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ? 
To analyse it , would seem impossible . 
Can we , then , by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness -- though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful , but nevertheless , is found to exert over us the same sorcery , however modified ; -- can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ? 
Let us try . 
But in a matter like this , subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls . 
And though , doubtless , some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men , yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time , and therefore may not be able to recall them now . 
Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims , down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow ? 
Or , to the unread , unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States , why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ? 
Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings -LRB- which will not wholly account for it -RRB- that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American , than those other storied structures , its neighbors -- the Byward Tower , or even the Bloody ? 
And those sublimer towers , the White Mountains of New Hampshire , whence , in peculiar moods , comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name , while the thought of Virginia 's Blue Ridge is full of a soft , dewy , distant dreaminess ? 
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ? 
Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does `` the tall pale man '' of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ? 
Nor is it , altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes ; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas ; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain ; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires , wrenched cope-stones , and crosses all adroop -LRB- like canted yards of anchored fleets -RRB- ; and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of cards ; -- it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima , the strangest , saddest city thou can ` st see . 
For Lima has taken the white veil ; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe . 
Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions . 
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality . 
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples . 
First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again . 
Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , `` Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ? '' 
Second : To the native Indian of Peru , the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread , except , perhaps , in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes , and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes . 
Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West , who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow , no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness . 
Not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses . 
But thou sayest , methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael . 
Tell me , why this strong young colt , foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont , far removed from all beasts of prey -- why is it that upon the sunniest day , if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him , so that he can not even see it , but only smells its wild animal muskiness -- why will he start , snort , and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright ? 
There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home , so that the strange muskiness he smells can not recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils ; for what knows he , this New England colt , of the black bisons of distant Oregon ? 
No ; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute , the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world . 
Though thousands of miles from Oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust . 
Thus , then , the muffled rollings of a milky sea ; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains ; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies ; all these , to Ishmael , are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt ! 
Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints ; yet with me , as with the colt , somewhere those things must exist . 
Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love , the invisible spheres were formed in fright . 
But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness , and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul ; and more strange and far more portentous -- why , as we have seen , it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things , nay , the very veil of the Christian 's Deity ; and yet should be as it is , the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind . 
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ? 
Or is it , that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour ; and at the same time the concrete of all colours ; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness , full of meaning , in a wide landscape of snows -- a colourless , all-colour of atheism from which we shrink ? 
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colourless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in Lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him . 
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol . 
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ? 
`` HIST ! 
Did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? '' 
It was the middle-watch ; a fair moonlight ; the seamen were standing in a cordon , extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist , to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail . 
In this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt . 
Standing , for the most part , on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck , they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet . 
From hand to hand , the buckets went in the deepest silence , only broken by the occasional flap of a sail , and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel . 
It was in the midst of this repose , that Archy , one of the cordon , whose post was near the after-hatches , whispered to his neighbor , a Cholo , the words above . 
`` Hist ! 
did you hear that noise , Cabaco ? '' 
`` Take the bucket , will ye , Archy ? 
what noise d'ye mean ? '' 
`` There it is again -- under the hatches -- do n't you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough . '' 
`` Cough be damned ! 
Pass along that return bucket . '' 
`` There again -- there it is ! 
-- it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over , now ! '' 
`` Caramba ! 
have done , shipmate , will ye ? 
It 's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye -- nothing else . 
Look to the bucket ! '' 
`` Say what ye will , shipmate ; I 've sharp ears . '' 
`` Aye , you are the chap , ai n't ye , that heard the hum of the old Quakeress 's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket ; you 're the chap . '' 
`` Grin away ; we 'll see what turns up . 
Hark ye , Cabaco , there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too . 
I heard Stubb tell Flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind . '' 
`` Tish ! 
the bucket ! '' 
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed-down table . 
Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank . 
At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen . 
While thus employed , the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head , continually rocked with the motion of the ship , and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts , some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead . 
But it was not this night in particular that , in the solitude of his cabin , Ahab thus pondered over his charts . 
Almost every night they were brought out ; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced , and others were substituted . 
For with the charts of all four oceans before him , Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies , with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul . 
Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans , it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet . 
But not so did it seem to Ahab , who knew the sets of all tides and currents ; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale 's food ; and , also , calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes ; could arrive at reasonable surmises , almost approaching to certainties , concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey . 
So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale 's resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows . 
On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale . 
* * Since the above was written , the statement is happily borne out by an official circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of the National Observatory , Washington , April 16th , 1851 . 
By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular . 
`` This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen . '' 
Besides , when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct -- say , rather , secret intelligence from the Deity -- mostly swim in VEINS , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision . 
Though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor 's parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width -LRB- more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract -RRB- ; but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship 's mast-heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone . 
The sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for . 
And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding-grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting . 
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme . 
But not so in the reality , perhaps . 
Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you can not conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true . 
In general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales . 
So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen , for example , on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean , or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast ; yet it did not follow , that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season , she would infallibly encounter him there . 
So , too , with some other feeding grounds , where he had at times revealed himself . 
But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns , so to speak , not his places of prolonged abode . 
And where Ahab 's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way-side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as Ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty . 
That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase -- the Season-on-the-Line . 
For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac . 
There it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . 
But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest . 
Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the Season-on-the-Line . 
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards , double Cape Horn , and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there . 
Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season . 
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod 's sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things . 
Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race . 
So that Monsoons , Pampas , Nor ' - Westers , Harmattans , Trades ; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon , might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod 's circumnavigating wake . 
But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ? 
Yes . 
For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow-white hump , could not but be unmistakable . 
And have I not tallied the whale , Ahab would mutter to himself , as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries -- tallied him , and shall he escape ? 
His broad fins are bored , and scalloped out like a lost sheep 's ear ! 
And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength .
