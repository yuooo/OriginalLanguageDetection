Crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale 's head . 
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale 's head may be compared to a Roman war-chariot -LRB- especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded -RRB- ; so , at a broad view , the Right Whale 's head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe . 
Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker 's last . 
And in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny . 
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view . 
If you stand on its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass-viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding-board . 
Then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green , barnacled thing , which the Greenlanders call the `` crown , '' and the Southern fishers the `` bonnet '' of the Right Whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird 's nest in its crotch . 
At any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term `` crown '' also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner . 
But if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem . 
Look at that hanging lower lip ! 
what a huge sulk and pout is there ! 
a sulk and pout , by carpenter 's measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more . 
A great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped . 
The fissure is about a foot across . 
Probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape . 
Over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth . 
Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam . 
Good Lord ! 
is this the road that Jonah went ? 
The roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge-pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned . 
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the Right Whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time . 
In the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature 's age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings . 
Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability . 
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable . 
In old times , there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds . 
One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous `` whiskers '' inside of the whale 's mouth ; * another , `` hogs ' bristles '' ; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language : `` There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper CHOP , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth . '' 
* This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw . 
Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance . 
As every one knows , these same `` hogs ' bristles , '' `` fins , '' `` whiskers , '' `` blinds , '' or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances . 
But in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline . 
It was in Queen Anne 's time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion . 
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone . 
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale 's mouth , look around you afresh . 
Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ? 
For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth . 
It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck . 
This particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil . 
Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with -- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads . 
To sum up , then : in the Right Whale 's there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the Sperm Whale 's . 
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue . 
Again , the Right Whale has two external spout-holes , the Sperm Whale only one . 
Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following . 
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale 's there ? 
It is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away . 
I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death . 
But mark the other head 's expression . 
See that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel 's side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw . 
Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ? 
This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic ; the Sperm Whale , a Platonian , who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years . 
Ere quitting , for the nonce , the Sperm Whale 's head , I would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply -- particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness . 
I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there . 
Here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history . 
You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin . 
Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has -- his spout hole -- is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front . 
Wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale 's head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever . 
Furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development . 
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad . 
Finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy . 
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange . 
Just so with the head ; but with this difference : about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it . 
The severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it . 
It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses ' hoofs . 
I do not think that any sensation lurks in it . 
Bethink yourself also of another thing . 
When two large , loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ? 
They do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood . 
No , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and cork , enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide . 
That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars . 
By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at . 
But supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , I say , that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction . 
If this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes . 
Now , mark . 
Unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect . 
So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien , and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow . 
For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth . 
But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ? 
What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess 's veil at Lais ? 
Now comes the Baling of the Case . 
But to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon . 
Regarding the Sperm Whale 's head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins , * whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale . 
At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance . 
* Quoin is not a Euclidean term . 
It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics . 
I know not that it has been defined before . 
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides . 
The lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent . 
The upper part , known as the Case , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale . 
And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale 's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun . 
Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly-prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state . 
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature . 
Though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . 
A large whale 's case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can . 
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale 's case . 
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship 's side . 
As in decapitating the whale , the operator 's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents . 
It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . 
Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale 's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped . 
Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun . 
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single-sheaved block . 
Securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard-arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck . 
Then , hand-over-hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head . 
There -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . 
A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun . 
In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure-hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in . 
By the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron-bound bucket , precisely like a well-bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands . 
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole . 
Inserting this pole into the bucket , Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy-maid 's pail of new milk . 
Carefully lowered from its height , the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub . 
Then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more . 
Towards the end , Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the Tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down . 
Now , the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened . 
Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my God ! 
poor Tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight ! 
`` Man overboard ! '' 
cried Daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses . 
`` Swing the bucket this way ! '' 
and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom . 
Meantime , there was a terrible tumult . 
Looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk . 
At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg . 
The one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head . 
`` Come down , come down ! '' 
yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out . 
`` In heaven 's name , man , '' cried Stubb , `` are you ramming home a cartridge there ? 
-- Avast ! 
How will that help him ; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of his head ? 
Avast , will ye ! '' 
`` Stand clear of the tackle ! '' 
cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket . 
Almost in the same instant , with a thunder-boom , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like Niagara 's Table-Rock into the whirlpool ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging -- now over the sailors ' heads , and now over the water -- Daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea ! 
But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks . 
The next , a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue . 
One packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen . 
Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship . 
`` Ha ! 
ha ! '' 
cried Daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave . 
`` Both ! 
both ! 
-- it is both ! '' 
-- cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout ; and soon after , Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian . 
Drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but Tashtego was long in coming to , and Queequeg did not look very brisk . 
Now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ? 
Why , diving after the slowly descending head , Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor Tash by the head . 
He averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ; -- he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the Indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost . 
As for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected . 
And thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of Tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten . 
Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing . 
I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header 's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one 's falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian 's , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale 's well . 
But , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ? 
We thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself . 
We have thee there . 
Not at all , but I have ye ; for at the time poor Tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well -- a double welded , hammered substance , as I have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost . 
But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say . 
Yes , it was a running delivery , so it was . 
Now , had Tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious perishing ; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti ; coffined , hearsed , and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale . 
Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled -- the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed . 
How many , think ye , have likewise fallen into Plato 's honey head , and sweetly perished there ? 
To scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan ; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken . 
Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar , or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon . 
Still , in that famous work of his , Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein . 
Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man . 
Therefore , though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale , I will do my endeavor . 
I try all things ; I achieve what I can . 
Physiognomically regarded , the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature . 
He has no proper nose . 
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale . 
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose . 
Dash the nose from Phidias 's marble Jove , and what a sorry remainder ! 
Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all . 
Nay , it is an added grandeur . 
A nose to the whale would have been impertinent . 
As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled . 
A pestilent conceit , which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne . 
In some particulars , perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale , is that of the full front of his head . 
This aspect is sublime . 
In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning . 
In the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it . 
Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant 's brow is majestic . 
Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees . 
It signifies -- `` God : done this day by my hand . '' 
But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line . 
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare 's or Melancthon 's rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead 's wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer . 
But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature . 
For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men . 
Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so . 
In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi-crescentic depression in the forehead 's middle , which , in man , is Lavater 's mark of genius . 
But how ? 
Genius in the Sperm Whale ? 
Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book , spoken a speech ? 
No , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it . 
It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence . 
And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World , he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts . 
They deified the crocodile of the Nile , because the crocodile is tongueless ; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue , or at least it is so exceedingly small , as to be incapable of protrusion . 
If hereafter any highly cultured , poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right , the merry May-day gods of old ; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky ; in the now unhaunted hill ; then be sure , exalted to Jove 's high seat , the great Sperm Whale shall lord it . 
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics . 
But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man 's and every being 's face . 
Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable . 
If then , Sir William Jones , who read in thirty languages , could not read the simplest peasant 's face in its profounder and more subtle meanings , how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale 's brow ? 
I but put that brow before you . 
Read it if you can . 
If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx , to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square . 
In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length . 
Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base . 
But in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm . 
At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass ; while under the long floor of this crater -- in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -- reposes the mere handful of this monster 's brain . 
The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec . 
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine . 
Lying in strange folds , courses , and convolutions , to their apprehensions , it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence . 
It is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan , in the creature 's living intact state , is an entire delusion . 
As for his true brain , you can then see no indications of it , nor feel any . 
The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world . 
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view . 
Indeed , place this reversed skull -LRB- scaled down to the human magnitude -RRB- among a plate of men 's skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say -- This man had no self-esteem , and no veneration . 
And by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is . 
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale 's proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you . 
If you attentively regard almost any quadruped 's spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper . 
It is a German conceit , that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls . 
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive . 
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso-relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe . 
Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal . 
For I believe that much of a man 's character will be found betokened in his backbone . 
I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are . 
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul . 
I rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world . 
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale . 
His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra ; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across , being eight in height , and of a triangular figure with the base downwards . 
As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size , but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity . 
Now , of course , this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance -- the spinal cord -- as the brain ; and directly communicates with the brain . 
And what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain 's cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain . 
Under all these circumstances , would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale 's spine phrenologically ? 
For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord . 
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the Sperm Whale 's hump . 
This august hump , if I mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebrae , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it . 
From its relative situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale . 
And that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know . 
The predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship Jungfrau , Derick De Deer , master , of Bremen . 
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the Dutch and Germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific . 
For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects . 
While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern . 
`` What has he in his hand there ? '' 
cried Starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the German . 
`` Impossible ! 
-- a lamp-feeder ! '' 
`` Not that , '' said Stubb , `` no , no , it 's a coffee-pot , Mr. Starbuck ; he 's coming off to make us our coffee , is the Yarman ; do n't you see that big tin can there alongside of him ? 
-- that 's his boiling water . 
Oh ! 
he 's all right , is the Yarman . '' 
`` Go along with you , '' cried Flask , `` it 's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can . 
He 's out of oil , and has come a-begging . '' 
However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare . 
As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one -LRB- that is , an empty one -RRB- , well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin . 
His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship 's side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders . 
Now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod 's keels . 
There were eight whales , an average pod . 
Aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness . 
They left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea . 
Full in this rapid wake , and many fathoms in the rear , swam a huge , humped old bull , which by his comparatively slow progress , as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him , seemed afflicted with the jaundice , or some other infirmity . 
Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance , seemed questionable ; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social . 
Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet . 
His spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble . 
`` Who 's got some paregoric ? '' 
said Stubb , `` he has the stomach-ache , I 'm afraid . 
Lord , think of having half an acre of stomach-ache ! 
Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys . 
It 's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ? 
it must be , he 's lost his tiller . '' 
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses , careens , buries , rolls , and wallows on her way ; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk , and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends , expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin . 
Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say . 
`` Only wait a bit , old chap , and I 'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm , '' cried cruel Flask , pointing to the whale-line near him . 
`` Mind he do n't sling thee with it , '' cried Starbuck . 
`` Give way , or the German will have him . '' 
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time . 
At this juncture the Pequod 's keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick 's boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals . 
The only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him . 
As for Derick , he seemed quite confident that this would be the case , and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats . 
`` The ungracious and ungrateful dog ! '' 
cried Starbuck ; `` he mocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago ! '' 
-- then in his old intense whisper -- `` Give way , greyhounds ! 
Dog to it ! '' 
`` I tell ye what it is , men '' -- cried Stubb to his crew -- `` it 's against my religion to get mad ; but I 'd like to eat that villainous Yarman -- Pull -- wo n't ye ? 
Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye ? 
Do ye love brandy ? 
A hogshead of brandy , then , to the best man . 
Come , why do n't some of ye burst a blood-vessel ? 
Who 's that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we do n't budge an inch -- we 're becalmed . 
Halloo , here 's grass growing in the boat 's bottom -- and by the Lord , the mast there 's budding . 
This wo n't do , boys . 
Look at that Yarman ! 
The short and long of it is , men , will ye spit fire or not ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
see the suds he makes ! '' 
cried Flask , dancing up and down -- `` What a hump -- Oh , DO pile on the beef -- lays like a log ! 
Oh ! 
my lads , DO spring -- slap-jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , DO , DO , spring , -- he 's a hundred barreller -- do n't lose him now -- do n't oh , DO N'T ! 
-- see that Yarman -- Oh , wo n't ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog ! 
such a sogger ! 
Do n't ye love sperm ? 
There goes three thousand dollars , men ! 
-- a bank ! 
-- a whole bank ! 
The bank of England ! 
-- Oh , DO , DO , DO ! 
-- What 's that Yarman about now ? '' 
At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing boats , and also his oil-can ; perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals ' way , and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss . 
`` The unmannerly Dutch dogger ! '' 
cried Stubb . 
`` Pull now , men , like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils . 
What d'ye say , Tashtego ; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead ? 
What d'ye say ? '' 
`` I say , pull like god-dam , '' -- cried the Indian . 
Fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the German , the Pequod 's three boats now began ranging almost abreast ; and , so disposed , momentarily neared him . 
In that fine , loose , chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey , the three mates stood up proudly , occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of , `` There she slides , now ! 
Hurrah for the white-ash breeze ! 
Down with the Yarman ! 
Sail over him ! '' 
But so decided an original start had Derick had , that spite of all their gallantry , he would have proved the victor in this race , had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman . 
While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash , and while , in consequence , Derick 's boat was nigh to capsizing , and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage ; -- that was a good time for Starbuck , Stubb , and Flask . 
With a shout , they took a mortal start forwards , and slantingly ranged up on the German 's quarter . 
An instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale 's immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made . 
It was a terrific , most pitiable , and maddening sight . 
The whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright . 
Now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin . 
So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air , vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks . 
But the bird has a voice , and with plaintive cries will make known her fear ; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea , was chained up and enchanted in him ; he had no voice , save that choking respiration through his spiracle , and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable ; while still , in his amazing bulk , portcullis jaw , and omnipotent tail , there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied . 
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod 's boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape . 
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke , than all three tigers -- Queequeg , Tashtego , Daggoo -- instinctively sprang to their feet , and standing in a diagonal row , simultaneously pointed their barbs ; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer , their three Nantucket irons entered the whale . 
Blinding vapours of foam and white-fire ! 
The three boats , in the first fury of the whale 's headlong rush , bumped the German 's aside with such force , that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out , and sailed over by the three flying keels . 
`` Do n't be afraid , my butter-boxes , '' cried Stubb , casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by ; `` ye 'll be picked up presently -- all right -- I saw some sharks astern -- St. Bernard 's dogs , you know -- relieve distressed travellers . 
Hurrah ! 
this is the way to sail now . 
Every keel a sunbeam ! 
Hurrah ! 
-- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar ! 
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel-spokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there 's danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill . 
Hurrah ! 
this is the way a fellow feels when he 's going to Davy Jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane ! 
Hurrah ! 
this whale carries the everlasting mail ! '' 
But the monster 's run was a brief one . 
Giving a sudden gasp , he tumultuously sounded . 
With a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air . 
And the whale soon ceasing to sound , for some time they remained in that attitude , fearful of expending more line , though the position was a little ticklish . 
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way , yet it is this `` holding on , '' as it is called ; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back ; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes . 
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing , it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best ; for it is but reasonable to presume , that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the more he is exhausted . 
Because , owing to the enormous surface of him -- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet -- the pressure of the water is immense . 
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under ; even here , above-ground , in the air ; how vast , then , the burden of a whale , bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean ! 
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres . 
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board . 
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea , gazing down into its eternal blue noon ; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort , nay , not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths ; what landsman would have thought , that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony ! 
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows . 
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock . 
Suspended ? 
and to what ? 
To three bits of board . 
Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said -- `` Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ? 
or his head with fish-spears ? 
The sword of him that layeth at him can not hold , the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon : he esteemeth iron as straw ; the arrow can not make him flee ; darts are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear ! '' 
This the creature ? 
this he ? 
Oh ! 
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets . 
For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail , Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea , to hide him from the Pequod 's fish-spears ! 
In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army . 
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head ! 
`` Stand by , men ; he stirs , '' cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat . 
The next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea . 
`` Haul in ! 
Haul in ! '' 
cried Starbuck again ; `` he 's rising . '' 
The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand 's breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship 's lengths of the hunters . 
His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion . 
In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions . 
Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams . 
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills . 
Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air . 
From this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck . 
His life , as they significantly call it , was untouched . 
As the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed . 
His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld . 
As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale 's eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see . 
But pity there was none . 
For all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all . 
Still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank . 
`` A nice spot , '' cried Flask ; `` just let me prick him there once . '' 
`` Avast ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` there 's no need of that ! '' 
But humane Starbuck was too late . 
At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing Flask 's boat and marring the bows . 
It was his death stroke . 
For , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died . 
It was most piteous , that last expiring spout . 
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale . 
Soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled . 
Immediately , by Starbuck 's orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords . 
By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom . 
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described . 
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to . 
But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it . 
Who had darted that stone lance ? 
And when ? 
It might have been darted by some Nor ' West Indian long before America was discovered . 
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling . 
But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship 's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body 's immensely increasing tendency to sink . 
However , Starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off . 
Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant . 
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house . 
The ship groaned and gasped . 
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation . 
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over . 
`` Hold on , hold on , wo n't ye ? '' 
cried Stubb to the body , `` do n't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink ! 
By thunder , men , we must do something or go for it . 
No use prying there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife , and cut the big chains . '' 
`` Knife ? 
Aye , aye , '' cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter 's heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke-chains . 
But a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest . 
With a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank . 
Now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it . 
Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface . 
If the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken-hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him . 
But it is not so . 
For young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink . 
Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species . 
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do . 
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free . 
But there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life . 
But the reason of this is obvious . 
Gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon . 
A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then . 
In the Shore Whaling , on soundings , among the Bays of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again . 
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod 's mast-heads , announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming . 
Nevertheless , the Fin-Back 's spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale 's , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it . 
And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute . 
The Virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase . 
Oh ! 
many are the Fin-Backs , and many are the Dericks , my friend . 
There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method . 
The more I dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity ; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity . 
The gallant Perseus , a son of Jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honour of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent . 
Those were the knightly days of our profession , when we only bore arms to succor the distressed , and not to fill men 's lamp-feeders . 
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda ; how the lovely Andromeda , the daughter of a king , was tied to a rock on the sea-coast , and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , Perseus , the prince of whalemen , intrepidly advancing , harpooned the monster , and delivered and married the maid . 
It was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart . 
And let no man doubt this Arkite story ; for in the ancient Joppa , now Jaffa , on the Syrian coast , in one of the Pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city 's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew . 
When the Romans took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph . 
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail . 
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda -- indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it -- is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon ; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other . 
`` Thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea , '' saith Ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the Bible use that word itself . 
Besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep . 
Any man may kill a snake , but only a Perseus , a St. George , a Coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale . 
Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in Perseus ' case , St. George 's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal , or sea-horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself . 
In fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the Philistines , Dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of Israel , his horse 's head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained . 
Thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St. George . 
And therefore , let not the knights of that honourable company -LRB- none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron -RRB- , let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. George 's decoration than they . 
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not , concerning this I long remained dubious : for though according to the Greek mythologies , that antique Crockett and Kit Carson -- that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted . 
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside . 
Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale . 
I claim him for one of our clan . 
But , by the best contradictory authorities , this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale ; and vice versa ; certainly they are very similar . 
If I claim the demigod then , why not the prophet ? 
Nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order . 
Our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves . 
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster , which gives us the dread Vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos ; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord ; -- Vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale . 
When Brahma , or the God of Gods , saith the Shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to Vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the Vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes . 
Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman , then ? 
even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ? 
Perseus , St. George , Hercules , Jonah , and Vishnoo ! 
there 's a member-roll for you ! 
What club but the whaleman 's can head off like that ? 
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter . 
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale . 
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale , and Arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that . 
One old Sag-Harbor whaleman 's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this : -- He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented Jonah 's whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan -LRB- the Right Whale , and the varieties of that order -RRB- , concerning which the fishermen have this saying , `` A penny roll would choke him '' ; his swallow is so very small . 
But , to this , Bishop Jebb 's anticipative answer is ready . 
It is not necessary , hints the Bishop , that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale 's belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth . 
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop . 
For truly , the Right Whale 's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables , and comfortably seat all the players . 
Possibly , too , Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is toothless . 
Another reason which Sag-Harbor -LRB- he went by that name -RRB- urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale 's gastric juices . 
But this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a DEAD whale -- even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them . 
Besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure-head ; and , I would add , possibly called `` The Whale , '' as some craft are nowadays christened the `` Shark , '' the `` Gull , '' the `` Eagle . '' 
Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver -- an inflated bag of wind -- which the endangered prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom . 
Poor Sag-Harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round . 
But he had still another reason for his want of faith . 
It was this , if I remember right : Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days ' journey of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , very much more than three days ' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast . 
How is that ? 
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ? 
Yes . 
He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope . 
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in . 
Besides , this idea of Jonah 's weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar . 
But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason -- a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea . 
I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy . 
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest , this very idea of Jonah 's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle . 
And so it was . 
Besides , to this day , the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah . 
And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris 's Voyages , speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah , in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil . 
To make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom . 
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely .
