They stood the representatives of their races . 
The Saxon , born of ages of cultivation , command , education , physical and moral eminence ; the Afric , born of ages of oppression , submission , ignorance , toil and vice ! 
Something , perhaps , of such thoughts struggled through Eva 's mind . 
But a child 's thoughts are rather dim , undefined instincts ; and in Eva 's noble nature many such were yearning and working , for which she had no power of utterance . 
When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy 's naughty , wicked conduct , the child looked perplexed and sorrowful , but said , sweetly . 
`` Poor Topsy , why need you steal ? 
You 're going to be taken good care of now . 
I 'm sure I 'd rather give you anything of mine , than have you steal it . '' 
It was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life ; and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild , rude heart , and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen , round , glittering eye ; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin . 
No ! 
the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness ; and Topsy only thought Eva 's speech something funny and inexplicable , -- she did not believe it . 
But what was to be done with Topsy ? 
Miss Ophelia found the case a puzzler ; her rules for bringing up did n't seem to apply . 
She thought she would take time to think of it ; and , by the way of gaining time , and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets , Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she had arranged her ideas further on the subject . 
`` I do n't see , '' said Miss Ophelia to St. Clare , `` how I 'm going to manage that child , without whipping her . '' 
`` Well , whip her , then , to your heart 's content ; I 'll give you full power to do what you like . '' 
`` Children always have to be whipped , '' said Miss Ophelia ; `` I never heard of bringing them up without . '' 
`` O , well , certainly , '' said St. Clare ; `` do as you think best . 
Only I 'll make one suggestion : I 've seen this child whipped with a poker , knocked down with the shovel or tongs , whichever came handiest , & c. ; and , seeing that she is used to that style of operation , I think your whippings will have to be pretty energetic , to make much impression . '' 
`` What is to be done with her , then ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` You have started a serious question , '' said St. Clare ; `` I wish you 'd answer it . 
What is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash , -- that fails , -- it 's a very common state of things down here ! '' 
`` I 'm sure I do n't know ; I never saw such a child as this . '' 
`` Such children are very common among us , and such men and women , too . 
How are they to be governed ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` I 'm sure it 's more than I can say , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Or I either , '' said St. Clare . 
`` The horrid cruelties and outrages that once and a while find their way into the papers , -- such cases as Prue 's , for example , -- what do they come from ? 
In many cases , it is a gradual hardening process on both sides , -- the owner growing more and more cruel , as the servant more and more callous . 
Whipping and abuse are like laudanum ; you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline . 
I saw this very early when I became an owner ; and I resolved never to begin , because I did not know when I should stop , -- and I resolved , at least , to protect my own moral nature . 
The consequence is , that my servants act like spoiled children ; but I think that better than for us both to be brutalized together . 
You have talked a great deal about our responsibilities in educating , Cousin . 
I really wanted you to try with one child , who is a specimen of thousands among us . '' 
`` It is your system makes such children , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I know it ; but they are made , -- they exist , -- and what is to be done with them ? '' 
`` Well , I ca n't say I thank you for the experiment . 
But , then , as it appears to be a duty , I shall persevere and try , and do the best I can , '' said Miss Ophelia ; and Miss Ophelia , after this , did labor , with a commendable degree of zeal and energy , on her new subject . 
She instituted regular hours and employments for her , and undertook to teach her to read and sew . 
In the former art , the child was quick enough . 
She learned her letters as if by magic , and was very soon able to read plain reading ; but the sewing was a more difficult matter . 
The creature was as lithe as a cat , and as active as a monkey , and the confinement of sewing was her abomination ; so she broke her needles , threw them slyly out of the window , or down in chinks of the walls ; she tangled , broke , and dirtied her thread , or , with a sly movement , would throw a spool away altogether . 
Her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised conjurer , and her command of her face quite as great ; and though Miss Ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly happen in succession , yet she could not , without a watchfulness which would leave her no time for anything else , detect her . 
Topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment . 
Her talent for every species of drollery , grimace , and mimicry , -- for dancing , tumbling , climbing , singing , whistling , imitating every sound that hit her fancy , -- seemed inexhaustible . 
In her play-hours , she invariably had every child in the establishment at her heels , open-mouthed with admiration and wonder , -- not excepting Miss Eva , who appeared to be fascinated by her wild diablerie , as a dove is sometimes charmed by a glittering serpent . 
Miss Ophelia was uneasy that Eva should fancy Topsy 's society so much , and implored St. Clare to forbid it . 
`` Poh ! 
let the child alone , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Topsy will do her good . '' 
`` But so depraved a child , -- are you not afraid she will teach her some mischief ? '' 
`` She ca n't teach her mischief ; she might teach it to some children , but evil rolls off Eva 's mind like dew off a cabbage-leaf , -- not a drop sinks in . '' 
`` Do n't be too sure , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I know I 'd never let a child of mine play with Topsy . '' 
`` Well , your children need n't , '' said St. Clare , `` but mine may ; if Eva could have been spoiled , it would have been done years ago . '' 
Topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants . 
They soon found reason to alter their opinion . 
It was very soon discovered that whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with some inconvenient accident shortly after ; -- either a pair of ear-rings or some cherished trinket would be missing , or an article of dress would be suddenly found utterly ruined , or the person would stumble accidently into a pail of hot water , or a libation of dirty slop would unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress ; - and on all these occasions , when investigation was made , there was nobody found to stand sponsor for the indignity . 
Topsy was cited , and had up before all the domestic judicatories , time and again ; but always sustained her examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance . 
Nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things ; but not a scrap of any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions , and Miss Ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length without it . 
The mischiefs done were always so nicely timed , also , as further to shelter the aggressor . 
Thus , the times for revenge on Rosa and Jane , the two chamber maids , were always chosen in those seasons when -LRB- as not unfrequently happened -RRB- they were in disgrace with their mistress , when any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy . 
In short , Topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her alone ; and she was let alone , accordingly . 
Topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations , learning everything that was taught her with surprising quickness . 
With a few lessons , she had learned to do the proprieties of Miss Ophelia 's chamber in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault . 
Mortal hands could not lay spread smoother , adjust pillows more accurately , sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly , than Topsy , when she chose , -- but she did n't very often choose . 
If Miss Ophelia , after three or four days of careful patient supervision , was so sanguine as to suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her way , could do without over-looking , and so go off and busy herself about something else , Topsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion , for some one or two hours . 
Instead of making the bed , she would amuse herself with pulling off the pillowcases , butting her woolly head among the pillows , till it would sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various directions ; she would climb the posts , and hang head downward from the tops ; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment ; dress the bolster up in Miss Ophelia 's night-clothes , and enact various performances with that , -- singing and whistling , and making grimaces at herself in the looking-glass ; in short , as Miss Ophelia phrased it , `` raising Cain '' generally . 
On one occasion , Miss Ophelia found Topsy with her very best scarlet India Canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban , going on with her rehearsals before the glass in great style , -- Miss Ophelia having , with carelessness most unheard-of in her , left the key for once in her drawer . 
`` Topsy ! '' 
she would say , when at the end of all patience , `` what does make you act so ? '' 
`` Dunno , Missis , -- I spects cause I 's so wicked ! '' 
`` I do n't know anything what I shall do with you , Topsy . '' 
`` Law , Missis , you must whip me ; my old Missis allers whipped me . 
I a n't used to workin ' unless I gets whipped . '' 
`` Why , Topsy , I do n't want to whip you . 
You can do well , if you 've a mind to ; what is the reason you wo n't ? '' 
`` Laws , Missis , I 's used to whippin ' ; I spects it 's good for me . '' 
Miss Ophelia tried the recipe , and Topsy invariably made a terrible commotion , screaming , groaning and imploring , though half an hour afterwards , when roosted on some projection of the balcony , and surrounded by a flock of admiring `` young uns , '' she would express the utmost contempt of the whole affair . 
`` Law , Miss Feely whip ! 
-- would n't kill a skeeter , her whippins . 
Oughter see how old Mas ' r made the flesh fly ; old Mas ' r know 'd how ! '' 
Topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities , evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing . 
`` Law , you niggers , '' she would say to some of her auditors , `` does you know you 's all sinners ? 
Well , you is -- everybody is . 
White folks is sinners too , -- Miss Feely says so ; but I spects niggers is the biggest ones ; but lor ! 
ye a n't any on ye up to me . 
I 's so awful wicked there ca n't nobody do nothin ' with me . 
I used to keep old Missis a swarin ' at me half de time . 
I spects I 's the wickedest critter in the world ; '' and Topsy would cut a summerset , and come up brisk and shining on to a higher perch , and evidently plume herself on the distinction . 
Miss Ophelia busied herself very earnestly on Sundays , teaching Topsy the catechism . 
Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory , and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress . 
`` What good do you expect it is going to do her ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` Why , it always has done children good . 
It 's what children always have to learn , you know , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Understand it or not , '' said St. Clare . 
`` O , children never understand it at the time ; but , after they are grown up , it 'll come to them . '' 
`` Mine has n't come to me yet , '' said St. Clare , `` though I 'll bear testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy . '' ' 
`` Ah , you were always good at learning , Augustine . 
I used to have great hopes of you , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Well , have n't you now ? '' 
said St. Clare . 
`` I wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy , Augustine . '' 
`` So do I , that 's a fact , Cousin , '' said St. Clare . 
`` Well , go ahead and catechize Topsy ; may be you 'll make out something yet . '' 
Topsy , who had stood like a black statue during this discussion , with hands decently folded , now , at a signal from Miss Ophelia , went on : `` Our first parents , being left to the freedom of their own will , fell from the state wherein they were created . '' 
Topsy 's eyes twinkled , and she looked inquiringly . 
`` What is it , Topsy ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Please , Missis , was dat ar state Kintuck ? '' 
`` What state , Topsy ? '' 
`` Dat state dey fell out of . 
I used to hear Mas ' r tell how we came down from Kintuck . '' 
St. Clare laughed . 
`` You 'll have to give her a meaning , or she 'll make one , '' said he . 
`` There seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there . '' 
`` O ! 
Augustine , be still , '' said Miss Ophelia ; `` how can I do anything , if you will be laughing ? '' 
`` Well , I wo n't disturb the exercises again , on my honor ; '' and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor , and sat down , till Topsy had finished her recitations . 
They were all very well , only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words , and persist in the mistake , in spite of every effort to the contrary ; and St. Clare , after all his promises of goodness , took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes , calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself , and getting her to repeat the offending passages , in spite of Miss Ophelia 's remonstrances . 
`` How do you think I can do anything with the child , if you will go on so , Augustine ? '' 
she would say . 
`` Well , it is too bad , -- I wo n't again ; but I do like to hear the droll little image stumble over those big words ! '' 
`` But you confirm her in the wrong way . '' 
`` What 's the odds ? 
One word is as good as another to her . '' 
`` You wanted me to bring her up right ; and you ought to remember she is a reasonable creature , and be careful of your influence over her . '' 
`` O , dismal ! 
so I ought ; but , as Topsy herself says , ' I 's so wicked ! ' '' 
In very much this way Topsy 's training proceeded , for a year or two , -- Miss Ophelia worrying herself , from day to day , with her , as a kind of chronic plague , to whose inflictions she became , in time , as accustomed , as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache . 
St. Clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer . 
Topsy , whenever her sins brought her into disgrace in other quarters , always took refuge behind his chair ; and St. Clare , in one way or other , would make peace for her . 
From him she got many a stray picayune , which she laid out in nuts and candies , and distributed , with careless generosity , to all the children in the family ; for Topsy , to do her justice , was good-natured and liberal , and only spiteful in self-defence . 
She is fairly introduced into our corps de ballet , and will figure , from time to time , in her turn , with other performers . 
Our readers may not be unwilling to glance back , for a brief interval , at Uncle Tom 's Cabin , on the Kentucky farm , and see what has been transpiring among those whom he had left behind . 
It was late in the summer afternoon , and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open , to invite any stray breeze , that might feel in a good humor , to enter . 
Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room , and running through the whole length of the house , to a balcony on either end . 
Leisurely tipped back on one chair , with his heels in another , he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar . 
Mrs. Shelby sat in the door , busy about some fine sewing ; she seemed like one who had something on her mind , which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce . 
`` Do you know , '' she said , `` that Chloe has had a letter from Tom ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
has she ? 
Tom 's got some friend there , it seems . 
How is the old boy ? '' 
`` He has been bought by a very fine family , I should think , '' said Mrs. Shelby , -- `` is kindly treated , and has not much to do . '' 
`` Ah ! 
well , I 'm glad of it , -- very glad , '' said Mr. Shelby , heartily . 
`` Tom , I suppose , will get reconciled to a Southern residence ; -- hardly want to come up here again . '' 
`` On the contrary he inquires very anxiously , '' said Mrs. Shelby , `` when the money for his redemption is to be raised . '' 
`` I 'm sure I do n't know , '' said Mr. Shelby . 
`` Once get business running wrong , there does seem to be no end to it . 
It 's like jumping from one bog to another , all through a swamp ; borrow of one to pay another , and then borrow of another to pay one , -- and these confounded notes falling due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round , -- dunning letters and dunning messages , -- all scamper and hurry-scurry . '' 
`` It does seem to me , my dear , that something might be done to straighten matters . 
Suppose we sell off all the horses , and sell one of your farms , and pay up square ? '' 
`` O , ridiculous , Emily ! 
You are the finest woman in Kentucky ; but still you have n't sense to know that you do n't understand business ; -- women never do , and never can . 
`` But , at least , '' said Mrs. Shelby , `` could not you give me some little insight into yours ; a list of all your debts , at least , and of all that is owed to you , and let me try and see if I ca n't help you to economize . '' 
`` O , bother ! 
do n't plague me , Emily ! 
-- I ca n't tell exactly . 
I know somewhere about what things are likely to be ; but there 's no trimming and squaring my affairs , as Chloe trims crust off her pies . 
You do n't know anything about business , I tell you . '' 
And Mr. Shelby , not knowing any other way of enforcing his ideas , raised his voice , -- a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing , when a gentleman is discussing matters of business with his wife . 
Mrs. Shelby ceased talking , with something of a sigh . 
The fact was , that though her husband had stated she was a woman , she had a clear , energetic , practical mind , and a force of character every way superior to that of her husband ; so that it would not have been so very absurd a supposition , to have allowed her capable of managing , as Mr. Shelby supposed . 
Her heart was set on performing her promise to Tom and Aunt Chloe , and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her . 
`` Do n't you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money ? 
Poor Aunt Chloe ! 
her heart is so set on it ! '' 
`` I 'm sorry , if it is . 
I think I was premature in promising . 
I 'm not sure , now , but it 's the best way to tell Chloe , and let her make up her mind to it . 
Tom 'll have another wife , in a year or two ; and she had better take up with somebody else . '' 
`` Mr. Shelby , I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours . 
I never could think of giving Chloe such advice . '' 
`` It 's a pity , wife , that you have burdened them with a morality above their condition and prospects . 
I always thought so . '' 
`` It 's only the morality of the Bible , Mr. Shelby . '' 
`` Well , well , Emily , I do n't pretend to interfere with your religious notions ; only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that condition . '' 
`` They are , indeed , '' said Mrs. Shelby , `` and that is why , from my soul , I hate the whole thing . 
I tell you , my dear , I can not absolve myself from the promises I make to these helpless creatures . 
If I can get the money no other way I will take music-scholars ; -- I could get enough , I know , and earn the money myself . '' 
`` You would n't degrade yourself that way , Emily ? 
I never could consent to it . '' 
`` Degrade ! 
would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless ? 
No , indeed ! '' 
`` Well , you are always heroic and transcendental , '' said Mr. Shelby , `` but I think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of Quixotism . '' 
Here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Aunt Chloe , at the end of the verandah . 
`` If you please , Missis , '' said she . 
`` Well , Chloe , what is it ? '' 
said her mistress , rising , and going to the end of the balcony . 
`` If Missis would come and look at dis yer lot o ' poetry . '' 
Chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry , -- an application of language in which she always persisted , notwithstanding frequent corrections and advisings from the young members of the family . 
`` La sakes ! '' 
she would say , `` I ca n't see ; one jis good as turry , -- poetry suthin good , any how ; '' and so poetry Chloe continued to call it . 
Mrs. Shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks , over which Chloe stood , with a very grave face of consideration . 
`` I 'm a thinkin whether Missis would be a havin a chicken pie o ' dese yer . '' 
`` Really , Aunt Chloe , I do n't much care ; -- serve them any way you like . '' 
Chloe stood handling them over abstractedly ; it was quite evident that the chickens were not what she was thinking of . 
At last , with the short laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal , she said , `` Laws me , Missis ! 
what should Mas ' r and Missis be a troublin theirselves ` bout de money , and not a usin what 's right in der hands ? '' 
and Chloe laughed again . 
`` I do n't understand you , Chloe , '' said Mrs. Shelby , nothing doubting , from her knowledge of Chloe 's manner , that she had heard every word of the conversation that had passed between her and her husband . 
`` Why , laws me , Missis ! '' 
said Chloe , laughing again , `` other folks hires out der niggers and makes money on 'em ! 
Do n't keep sich a tribe eatin 'em out of house and home . '' 
`` Well , Chloe , who do you propose that we should hire out ? '' 
`` Laws ! 
I a n't a proposin nothin ; only Sam he said der was one of dese yer perfectioners , dey calls 'em , in Louisville , said he wanted a good hand at cake and pastry ; and said he 'd give four dollars a week to one , he did . '' 
`` Well , Chloe . '' 
`` Well , laws , I 's a thinkin , Missis , it 's time Sally was put along to be doin ' something . 
Sally 's been under my care , now , dis some time , and she does most as well as me , considerin ; and if Missis would only let me go , I would help fetch up de money . 
I a n't afraid to put my cake , nor pies nother , ` long side no perfectioner 's . 
`` Confectioner 's , Chloe . '' 
`` Law sakes , Missis ! 
` ta n't no odds ; -- words is so curis , ca n't never get 'em right ! '' 
`` But , Chloe , do you want to leave your children ? '' 
`` Laws , Missis ! 
de boys is big enough to do day 's works ; dey does well enough ; and Sally , she 'll take de baby , -- she 's such a peart young un , she wo n't take no lookin arter . '' 
`` Louisville is a good way off . '' 
`` Law sakes ! 
who 's afeard ? 
-- it 's down river , somer near my old man , perhaps ? '' 
said Chloe , speaking the last in the tone of a question , and looking at Mrs. Shelby . 
`` No , Chloe ; it 's many a hundred miles off , '' said Mrs. Shelby . 
Chloe 's countenance fell . 
`` Never mind ; your going there shall bring you nearer , Chloe . 
Yes , you may go ; and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your husband 's redemption . '' 
As when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver , so Chloe 's dark face brightened immediately , -- it really shone . 
`` Laws ! 
if Missis is n't too good ! 
I was thinking of dat ar very thing ; cause I should n't need no clothes , nor shoes , nor nothin , -- I could save every cent . 
How many weeks is der in a year , Missis ? '' 
`` Fifty-two , '' said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` Laws ! 
now , dere is ? 
and four dollars for each on em . 
Why , how much 'd dat ar be ? '' 
`` Two hundred and eight dollars , '' said Mrs. Shelby . 
`` Why-e ! '' 
said Chloe , with an accent of surprise and delight ; `` and how long would it take me to work it out , Missis ? '' 
`` Some four or five years , Chloe ; but , then , you need n't do it all , -- I shall add something to it . '' 
`` I would n't hear to Missis ' givin lessons nor nothin . 
Mas ` r 's quite right in dat ar ; -- ' t would n't do , no ways . 
I hope none our family ever be brought to dat ar , while I 's got hands . '' 
`` Do n't fear , Chloe ; I 'll take care of the honor of the family , '' said Mrs. Shelby , smiling . 
`` But when do you expect to go ? '' 
`` Well , I want spectin nothin ; only Sam , he 's a gwine to de river with some colts , and he said I could go long with him ; so I jes put my things together . 
If Missis was willin , I 'd go with Sam tomorrow morning , if Missis would write my pass , and write me a commendation . '' 
`` Well , Chloe , I 'll attend to it , if Mr. Shelby has no objections . 
I must speak to him . '' 
Mrs. Shelby went up stairs , and Aunt Chloe , delighted , went out to her cabin , to make her preparation . 
`` Law sakes , Mas ' r George ! 
ye did n't know I 's a gwine to Louisville tomorrow ! '' 
she said to George , as entering her cabin , he found her busy in sorting over her baby 's clothes . 
`` I thought I 'd jis look over sis 's things , and get 'em straightened up . 
But I 'm gwine , Mas ' r George , -- gwine to have four dollars a week ; and Missis is gwine to lay it all up , to buy back my old man agin ! '' 
`` Whew ! '' 
said George , `` here 's a stroke of business , to be sure ! 
How are you going ? '' 
`` Tomorrow , wid Sam . 
And now , Mas ' r George , I knows you 'll jis sit down and write to my old man , and tell him all about it , -- wo n't ye ? '' 
`` To be sure , '' said George ; `` Uncle Tom 'll be right glad to hear from us . 
I 'll go right in the house , for paper and ink ; and then , you know , Aunt Chloe , I can tell about the new colts and all . '' 
`` Sartin , sartin , Mas ' r George ; you go ` long , and I 'll get ye up a bit o ' chicken , or some sich ; ye wo n't have many more suppers wid yer poor old aunty . '' 
Life passes , with us all , a day at a time ; so it passed with our friend Tom , till two years were gone . 
Though parted from all his soul held dear , and though often yearning for what lay beyond , still was he never positively and consciously miserable ; for , so well is the harp of human feeling strung , that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can wholly mar its harmony ; and , on looking back to seasons which in review appear to us as those of deprivation and trial , we can remember that each hour , as it glided , brought its diversions and alleviations , so that , though not happy wholly , we were not , either , wholly miserable . 
Tom read , in his only literary cabinet , of one who had `` learned in whatsoever state he was , therewith to be content . '' 
It seemed to him good and reasonable doctrine , and accorded well with the settled and thoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same book . 
His letter homeward , as we related in the last chapter , was in due time answered by Master George , in a good , round , school-boy hand , that Tom said might be read `` most acrost the room . '' 
It contained various refreshing items of home intelligence , with which our reader is fully acquainted : stated how Aunt Chloe had been hired out to a confectioner in Louisville , where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful sums of money , all of which , Tom was informed , was to be laid up to go to make up the sum of his redemption money ; Mose and Pete were thriving , and the baby was trotting all about the house , under the care of Sally and the family generally . 
Tom 's cabin was shut up for the present ; but George expatiated brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when Tom came back . 
The rest of this letter gave a list of George 's school studies , each one headed by a flourishing capital ; and also told the names of four new colts that appeared on the premises since Tom left ; and stated , in the same connection , that father and mother were well . 
The style of the letter was decidedly concise and terse ; but Tom thought it the most wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times . 
He was never tired of looking at it , and even held a council with Eva on the expediency of getting it framed , to hang up in his room . 
Nothing but the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would show at once stood in the way of this undertaking . 
The friendship between Tom and Eva had grown with the child 's growth . 
It would be hard to say what place she held in the soft , impressible heart of her faithful attendant . 
He loved her as something frail and earthly , yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine . 
He gazed on her as the Italian sailor gazes on his image of the child Jesus , -- with a mixture of reverence and tenderness ; and to humor her graceful fancies , and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like a many-colored rainbow , was Tom 's chief delight . 
In the market , at morning , his eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare bouquets for her , and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to give to her when he came back ; and the sight that pleased him most was her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach , and her childish questions , -- `` Well , Uncle Tom , what have you got for me today ? '' 
Nor was Eva less zealous in kind offices , in return . 
Though a child , she was a beautiful reader ; -- a fine musical ear , a quick poetic fancy , and an instinctive sympathy with what 's grand and noble , made her such a reader of the Bible as Tom had never before heard . 
At first , she read to please her humble friend ; but soon her own earnest nature threw out its tendrils , and wound itself around the majestic book ; and Eva loved it , because it woke in her strange yearnings , and strong , dim emotions , such as impassioned , imaginative children love to feel . 
The parts that pleased her most were the Revelations and the Prophecies , -- parts whose dim and wondrous imagery , and fervent language , impressed her the more , that she questioned vainly of their meaning ; -- and she and her simple friend , the old child and the young one , felt just alike about it . 
All that they knew was , that they spoke of a glory to be revealed , -- a wondrous something yet to come , wherein their soul rejoiced , yet knew not why ; and though it be not so in the physical , yet in moral science that which can not be understood is not always profitless . 
For the soul awakes , a trembling stranger , between two dim eternities , -- the eternal past , the eternal future . 
The light shines only on a small space around her ; therefore , she needs must yearn towards the unknown ; and the voices and shadowy movings which come to her from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one echoes and answers in her own expecting nature . 
Its mystic imagery are so many talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics ; she folds them in her bosom , and expects to read them when she passes beyond the veil . 
At this time in our story , the whole St. Clare establishment is , for the time being , removed to their villa on Lake Pontchartrain . 
The heats of summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and unhealthy city , to seek the shores of the lake , and its cool sea-breezes . 
St. Clare 's villa was an East Indian cottage , surrounded by light verandahs of bamboo-work , and opening on all sides into gardens and pleasure-grounds . 
The common sitting-room opened on to a large garden , fragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics , where winding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake , whose silvery sheet of water lay there , rising and falling in the sunbeams , -- a picture never for an hour the same , yet every hour more beautiful . 
It is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole horizon into one blaze of glory , and makes the water another sky . 
The lake lay in rosy or golden streaks , save where white-winged vessels glided hither and thither , like so many spirits , and little golden stars twinkled through the glow , and looked down at themselves as they trembled in the water . 
Tom and Eva were seated on a little mossy seat , in an arbor , at the foot of the garden . 
It was Sunday evening , and Eva 's Bible lay open on her knee . 
She read , -- `` And I saw a sea of glass , mingled with fire . '' 
`` Tom , '' said Eva , suddenly stopping , and pointing to the lake , `` there ' t is . '' 
`` What , Miss Eva ? '' 
`` Do n't you see , -- there ? '' 
said the child , pointing to the glassy water , which , as it rose and fell , reflected the golden glow of the sky . 
`` There 's a ` sea of glass , mingled with fire . ' '' 
`` True enough , Miss Eva , '' said Tom ; and Tom sang -- `` O , had I the wings of the morning , I 'd fly away to Canaan 's shore ; Bright angels should convey me home , To the new Jerusalem . '' 
`` Where do you suppose new Jerusalem is , Uncle Tom ? '' 
said Eva . 
`` O , up in the clouds , Miss Eva . '' 
`` Then I think I see it , '' said Eva . 
`` Look in those clouds ! 
-- they look like great gates of pearl ; and you can see beyond them -- far , far off -- it 's all gold . 
Tom , sing about ` spirits bright . ' '' 
Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn , `` I see a band of spirits bright , That taste the glories there ; They all are robed in spotless white , And conquering palms they bear . '' 
`` Uncle Tom , I 've seen them , '' said Eva . 
Tom had no doubt of it at all ; it did not surprise him in the least . 
If Eva had told him she had been to heaven , he would have thought it entirely probable . 
`` They come to me sometimes in my sleep , those spirits ; '' and Eva 's eyes grew dreamy , and she hummed , in a low voice , `` They are all robed in spotless white , And conquering palms they bear . '' 
`` Uncle Tom , '' said Eva , `` I 'm going there . '' 
`` Where , Miss Eva ? '' 
The child rose , and pointed her little hand to the sky ; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance , and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies . 
`` I 'm going there , '' she said , `` to the spirits bright , Tom ; I 'm going , before long . '' 
The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust ; and Tom thought how often he had noticed , within six months , that Eva 's little hands had grown thinner , and her skin more transparent , and her breath shorter ; and how , when she ran or played in the garden , as she once could for hours , she became soon so tired and languid . 
He had heard Miss Ophelia speak often of a cough , that all her medicaments could not cure ; and even now that fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever ; and yet the thought that Eva 's words suggested had never come to him till now . 
Has there ever been a child like Eva ? 
Yes , there have been ; but their names are always on grave-stones , and their sweet smiles , their heavenly eyes , their singular words and ways , are among the buried treasures of yearning hearts . 
In how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not . 
It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels , whose office it was to sojourn for a season here , and endear to them the wayward human heart , that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight . 
When you see that deep , spiritual light in the eye , -- when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of children , -- hope not to retain that child ; for the seal of heaven is on it , and the light of immortality looks out from its eyes . 
Even so , beloved Eva ! 
fair star of thy dwelling ! 
Thou art passing away ; but they that love thee dearest know it not . 
The colloquy between Tom and Eva was interrupted by a hasty call from Miss Ophelia . 
`` Eva -- Eva ! 
-- why , child , the dew is falling ; you must n't be out there ! '' 
Eva and Tom hastened in . 
Miss Ophelia was old , and skilled in the tactics of nursing . 
She was from New England , and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that soft , insidious disease , which sweeps away so many of the fairest and loveliest , and , before one fibre of life seems broken , seals them irrevocably for death . 
She had noted the slight , dry cough , the daily brightening cheek ; nor could the lustre of the eye , and the airy buoyancy born of fever , deceive her . 
She tried to communicate her fears to St. Clare ; but he threw back her suggestions with a restless petulance , unlike his usual careless good-humor . 
`` Do n't be croaking , Cousin , -- I hate it ! '' 
he would say ; `` do n't you see that the child is only growing . 
Children always lose strength when they grow fast . '' 
`` But she has that cough ! '' 
`` O ! 
nonsense of that cough ! 
-- it is not anything . 
She has taken a little cold , perhaps . '' 
`` Well , that was just the way Eliza Jane was taken , and Ellen and Maria Sanders . '' 
`` O ! 
stop these hobgoblin ' nurse legends . 
You old hands got so wise , that a child can not cough , or sneeze , but you see desperation and ruin at hand . 
Only take care of the child , keep her from the night air , and do n't let her play too hard , and she 'll do well enough . '' 
So St. Clare said ; but he grew nervous and restless . 
He watched Eva feverishly day by day , as might be told by the frequency with which he repeated over that `` the child was quite well '' -- that there was n't anything in that cough , -- it was only some little stomach affection , such as children often had . 
But he kept by her more than before , took her oftener to ride with him , brought home every few days some receipt or strengthening mixture , -- `` not , '' he said , `` that the child needed it , but then it would not do her any harm . '' 
If it must be told , the thing that struck a deeper pang to his heart than anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the child 's mind and feelings . 
While still retaining all a child 's fanciful graces , yet she often dropped , unconsciously , words of such a reach of thought , and strange unworldly wisdom , that they seemed to be an inspiration . 
At such times , St. Clare would feel a sudden thrill , and clasp her in his arms , as if that fond clasp could save her ; and his heart rose up with wild determination to keep her , never to let her go . 
The child 's whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and kindness . 
Impulsively generous she had always been ; but there was a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now , that every one noticed . 
She still loved to play with Topsy , and the various colored children ; but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their plays , and she would sit for half an hour at a time , laughing at the odd tricks of Topsy , -- and then a shadow would seem to pass across her face , her eyes grew misty , and her thoughts were afar . 
`` Mamma , '' she said , suddenly , to her mother , one day , `` why do n't we teach our servants to read ? '' 
`` What a question child ! 
People never do . '' 
`` Why do n't they ? '' 
said Eva . 
`` Because it is no use for them to read . 
It do n't help them to work any better , and they are not made for anything else . '' 
`` But they ought to read the Bible , mamma , to learn God 's will . '' 
`` O ! 
they can get that read to them all they need . '' 
`` It seems to me , mamma , the Bible is for every one to read themselves . 
They need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it . '' 
`` Eva , you are an odd child , '' said her mother . 
`` Miss Ophelia has taught Topsy to read , '' continued Eva . 
`` Yes , and you see how much good it does . 
Topsy is the worst creature I ever saw ! '' 
`` Here 's poor Mammy ! '' 
said Eva . 
`` She does love the Bible so much , and wishes so she could read ! 
And what will she do when I ca n't read to her ? '' 
Marie was busy , turning over the contents of a drawer , as she answered , `` Well , of course , by and by , Eva , you will have other things to think of besides reading the Bible round to servants . 
Not but that is very proper ; I 've done it myself , when I had health . 
But when you come to be dressing and going into company , you wo n't have time . 
See here ! '' 
she added , `` these jewels I 'm going to give you when you come out . 
I wore them to my first ball . 
I can tell you , Eva , I made a sensation . '' 
Eva took the jewel-case , and lifted from it a diamond necklace . 
Her large , thoughtful eyes rested on them , but it was plain her thoughts were elsewhere . 
`` How sober you look child ! '' 
said Marie . 
`` Are these worth a great deal of money , mamma ? '' 
`` To be sure , they are . 
Father sent to France for them . 
They are worth a small fortune . '' 
`` I wish I had them , '' said Eva , `` to do what I pleased with ! '' 
`` What would you do with them ? '' 
`` I 'd sell them , and buy a place in the free states , and take all our people there , and hire teachers , to teach them to read and write . '' 
Eva was cut short by her mother 's laughing . 
`` Set up a boarding-school ! 
Would n't you teach them to play on the piano , and paint on velvet ? '' 
`` I 'd teach them to read their own Bible , and write their own letters , and read letters that are written to them , '' said Eva , steadily . 
`` I know , mamma , it does come very hard on them that they ca n't do these things . 
Tom feels it -- Mammy does , -- a great many of them do . 
I think it 's wrong . '' 
`` Come , come , Eva ; you are only a child ! 
You do n't know anything about these things , '' said Marie ; `` besides , your talking makes my head ache . '' 
Marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not exactly suit her . 
Eva stole away ; but after that , she assiduously gave Mammy reading lessons . 
About this time , St. Clare 's brother Alfred , with his eldest son , a boy of twelve , spent a day or two with the family at the lake . 
No sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers . 
Nature , instead of instituting resemblances between them , had made them opposites on every point ; yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary . 
They used to saunter , arm in arm , up and down the alleys and walks of the garden . 
Augustine , with his blue eyes and golden hair , his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features ; and Alfred , dark-eyed , with haughty Roman profile , firmly-knit limbs , and decided bearing . 
They were always abusing each other 's opinions and practices , and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other 's society ; in fact , the very contrariety seemed to unite them , like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet . 
Henrique , the eldest son of Alfred , was a noble , dark-eyed , princely boy , full of vivacity and spirit ; and , from the first moment of introduction , seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his cousin Evangeline . 
Eva had a little pet pony , of a snowy whiteness . 
It was easy as a cradle , and as gentle as its little mistress ; and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by Tom , while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black Arabian , which had just been imported , at a great expense , for Henrique . 
Henrique had a boy 's pride in his new possession ; and , as he advanced and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom , he looked carefully over him , and his brow darkened . 
`` What 's this , Dodo , you little lazy dog ! 
you have n't rubbed my horse down , this morning . '' 
`` Yes , Mas ` r , '' said Dodo , submissively ; `` he got that dust on his own self . '' 
`` You rascal , shut your mouth ! '' 
said Henrique , violently raising his riding-whip . 
`` How dare you speak ? '' 
The boy was a handsome , bright-eyed mulatto , of just Henrique 's size , and his curling hair hung round a high , bold forehead . 
He had white blood in his veins , as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek , and the sparkle of his eye , as he eagerly tried to speak . 
`` Mas ' r Henrique ! 
-- '' he began . 
Henrique struck him across the face with his riding-whip , and , seizing one of his arms , forced him on to his knees , and beat him till he was out of breath . 
`` There , you impudent dog ! 
Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you ? 
Take the horse back , and clean him properly . 
I 'll teach you your place ! '' 
`` Young Mas ` r , '' said Tom , `` I specs what he was gwine to say was , that the horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable ; he 's so full of spirits , -- that 's the way he got that dirt on him ; I looked to his cleaning . '' 
`` You hold your tongue till you 're asked to speak ! '' 
said Henrique , turning on his heel , and walking up the steps to speak to Eva , who stood in her riding-dress . 
`` Dear Cousin , I 'm sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting , '' he said . 
`` Let 's sit down here , on this seat till they come . 
What 's the matter , Cousin ? 
-- you look sober . '' 
`` How could you be so cruel and wicked to poor Dodo ? '' 
asked Eva . 
`` Cruel , -- wicked ! '' 
said the boy , with unaffected surprise . 
`` What do you mean , dear Eva ? '' 
`` I do n't want you to call me dear Eva , when you do so , '' said Eva . 
`` Dear Cousin , you do n't know Dodo ; it 's the only way to manage him , he 's so full of lies and excuses . 
The only way is to put him down at once , -- not let him open his mouth ; that 's the way papa manages . '' 
`` But Uncle Tom said it was an accident , and he never tells what is n't true . '' 
`` He 's an uncommon old nigger , then ! '' 
said Henrique . 
`` Dodo will lie as fast as he can speak . '' 
`` You frighten him into deceiving , if you treat him so . '' 
`` Why , Eva , you 've really taken such a fancy to Dodo , that I shall be jealous . '' 
`` But you beat him , -- and he did n't deserve it . '' 
`` O , well , it may go for some time when he does , and do n't get it . 
A few cuts never come amiss with Dodo , -- he 's a regular spirit , I can tell you ; but I wo n't beat him again before you , if it troubles you . '' 
Eva was not satisfied , but found it in vain to try to make her handsome cousin understand her feelings . 
Dodo soon appeared , with the horses . 
`` Well , Dodo , you 've done pretty well , this time , '' said his young master , with a more gracious air . 
`` Come , now , and hold Miss Eva 's horse while I put her on to the saddle . '' 
Dodo came and stood by Eva 's pony . 
His face was troubled ; his eyes looked as if he had been crying . 
Henrique , who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all matters of gallantry , soon had his fair cousin in the saddle , and , gathering the reins , placed them in her hands . 
But Eva bent to the other side of the horse , where Dodo was standing , and said , as he relinquished the reins , -- `` That 's a good boy , Dodo ; -- thank you ! '' 
Dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face ; the blood rushed to his cheeks , and the tears to his eyes . 
`` Here , Dodo , '' said his master , imperiously . 
Dodo sprang and held the horse , while his master mounted . 
`` There 's a picayune for you to buy candy with , Dodo , '' said Henrique ; `` go get some . '' 
And Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva . 
Dodo stood looking after the two children . 
One had given him money ; and one had given him what he wanted far more , -- a kind word , kindly spoken . 
Dodo had been only a few months away from his mother . 
His master had bought him at a slave warehouse , for his handsome face , to be a match to the handsome pony ; and he was now getting his breaking in , at the hands of his young master . 
The scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St. Clare , from another part of the garden . 
Augustine 's cheek flushed ; but he only observed , with his usual sarcastic carelessness . 
`` I suppose that 's what we may call republican education , Alfred ? '' 
`` Henrique is a devil of a fellow , when his blood 's up , '' said Alfred , carelessly . 
`` I suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him , '' said Augustine , drily . 
`` I could n't help it , if I did n't . 
Henrique is a regular little tempest ; -- his mother and I have given him up , long ago . 
But , then , that Dodo is a perfect sprite , -- no amount of whipping can hurt him . '' 
`` And this by way of teaching Henrique the first verse of a republican 's catechism , ` All men are born free and equal ! ' '' 
`` Poh ! '' 
said Alfred ; `` one of Tom Jefferson 's pieces of French sentiment and humbug . 
It 's perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds among us , to this day . '' 
`` I think it is , '' said St. Clare , significantly . 
`` Because , '' said Alfred , `` we can see plainly enough that all men are not born free , nor born equal ; they are born anything else . 
For my part , I think half this republican talk sheer humbug . 
It is the educated , the intelligent , the wealthy , the refined , who ought to have equal rights and not the canaille . '' 
`` If you can keep the canaille of that opinion , '' said Augustine . 
`` They took their turn once , in France . '' 
`` Of course , they must be kept down , consistently , steadily , as I should , '' said Alfred , setting his foot hard down as if he were standing on somebody . 
`` It makes a terrible slip when they get up , '' said Augustine , -- `` in St. Domingo , for instance . '' 
`` Poh ! ''
