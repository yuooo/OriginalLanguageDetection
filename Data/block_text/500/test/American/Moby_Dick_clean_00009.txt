Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock . 
Never could Starbuck forget the old man 's aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair ; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat . 
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of . 
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand . 
Though the body was erect , the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling . 
* * The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale , because without going to the compass at the helm , the Captain , while below , can inform himself of the course of the ship . 
Terrible old man ! 
thought Starbuck with a shudder , sleeping in this gale , still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose . 
South-eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney -LRB- Albatross -RRB- by name . 
As she slowly drew nigh , from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head , I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries -- a whaler at sea , and long absent from home . 
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus . 
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost . 
Only her lower sails were set . 
A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . 
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising . 
Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast , they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea ; and though , when the ship slowly glided close under our stern , we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other ; yet , those forlorn-looking fishermen , mildly eyeing us as they passed , said not one word to our own look-outs , while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below . 
`` Ship ahoy ! 
Have ye seen the White Whale ? '' 
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it . 
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between . 
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale 's name to another ship , Ahab for a moment paused ; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger , had not the threatening wind forbade . 
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed -- `` Ahoy there ! 
This is the Pequod , bound round the world ! 
Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean ! 
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to -- '' At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed , and instantly , then , in accordance with their singular ways , shoals of small harmless fish , that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side , darted away with what seemed shuddering fins , and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger 's flanks . 
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings . 
`` Swim away from me , do ye ? '' 
murmured Ahab , gazing over into the water . 
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced . 
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice , -- `` Up helm ! 
Keep her off round the world ! '' 
Round the world ! 
There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings ; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct ? 
Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started , where those that we left behind secure , were all the time before us . 
Were this world an endless plain , and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances , and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon , then there were promise in the voyage . 
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed . 
The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this : the wind and sea betokened storms . 
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put . 
For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought . 
But all this might remain inadequately estimated , were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas , and especially on a common cruising-ground . 
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State , or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England ; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds , these twain , for the life of them , can not well avoid a mutual salutation ; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news ; and , perhaps , sitting down for a while and resting in concert : then , how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea , two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth -- off lone Fanning 's Island , or the far away King 's Mills ; how much more natural , I say , that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails , but come into still closer , more friendly and sociable contact . 
And especially would this seem to be a matter of course , in the case of vessels owned in one seaport , and whose captains , officers , and not a few of the men are personally known to each other ; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about . 
For the long absent ship , the outward-bounder , perhaps , has letters on board ; at any rate , she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files . 
And in return for that courtesy , the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her . 
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other 's track on the cruising-ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home . 
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets . 
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat . 
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors , but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils . 
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English . 
Though , to be sure , from the small number of English whalers , such meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them ; for your Englishman is rather reserved , and your Yankee , he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself . 
Besides , the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers ; regarding the long , lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript provincialisms , as a sort of sea-peasant . 
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years . 
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters , which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart ; probably , because he knows that he has a few foibles himself . 
So , then , we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea , the whalers have most reason to be sociable -- and they are so . 
Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other 's wake in the mid-Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other 's rig . 
As for Men-of-War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all . 
As touching Slave-ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . 
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other 's cross-bones , the first hail is -- `` How many skulls ? '' 
-- the same way that whalers hail -- `` How many barrels ? '' 
And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and do n't like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likenesses . 
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! 
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? 
She has a `` GAM , '' a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about `` spouters '' and `` blubber-boilers , '' and such like pretty exclamations . 
Why it is that all Merchant-seamen , and also all Pirates and Man-of-War 's men , and Slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer . 
Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . 
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . 
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . 
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . 
But what is a GAM ? 
You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word . 
Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition ; Noah Webster 's ark does not hold it . 
Nevertheless , this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees . 
Certainly , it needs a definition , and should be incorporated into the Lexicon . 
With that view , let me learnedly define it . 
GAM . 
NOUN -- A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO -LRB- OR MORE -RRB- WHALESHIPS , GENERALLY ON A CRUISING-GROUND ; WHEN , AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS , THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS ' CREWS ; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING , FOR THE TIME , ON BOARD OF ONE SHIP , AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER . 
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here . 
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail ; so has the whale fishery . 
In a pirate , man-of-war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons . 
But the whale-boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all . 
High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs . 
And as for a tiller , the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy ; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat 's crew must leave the ship , and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion , and the captain , having no place to sit in , is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree . 
And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships , this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs . 
Nor is this any very easy matter ; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back , the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front . 
He is thus completely wedged before and behind , and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs ; but a sudden , violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him , because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth . 
Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you can not stand them up . 
Then , again , it would never do in plain sight of the world 's riveted eyes , it would never do , I say , for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands ; indeed , as token of his entire , buoyant self-command , he generally carries his hands in his trowsers ' pockets ; but perhaps being generally very large , heavy hands , he carries them there for ballast . 
Nevertheless there have occurred instances , well authenticated ones too , where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two , in a sudden squall say -- to seize hold of the nearest oarsman 's hair , and hold on there like grim death . 
-LRB- AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN -RRB- The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part . 
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound whaleman , the Town-Ho , * was encountered . 
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians . 
In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick . 
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho 's story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men . 
This latter circumstance , with its own particular accompaniments , forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated , never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates . 
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself . 
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . 
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod 's main-mast . 
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record . 
* The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin . 
For my humor 's sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint 's eve , smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn . 
Of those fine cavaliers , the young Dons , Pedro and Sebastian , were on the closer terms with me ; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put , and which are duly answered at the time . 
`` Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you , gentlemen , the Town-Ho , Sperm Whaler of Nantucket , was cruising in your Pacific here , not very many days ' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn . 
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line . 
One morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common . 
They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her , gentlemen . 
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased . 
So much so , that now taking some alarm , the captain , making all sail , stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands , there to have his hull hove out and repaired . 
`` Though no small passage was before her , yet , if the commonest chance favoured , he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way , because his pumps were of the best , and being periodically relieved at them , those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free ; never mind if the leak should double on her . 
In truth , well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes , the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate , a Vineyarder , and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt , a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo . '' 
` Lakeman ! 
-- Buffalo ! 
Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ? ' 
said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass . 
`` On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie , Don ; but -- I crave your courtesy -- may be , you shall soon hear further of all that . 
Now , gentlemen , in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships , well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land-locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean . 
For in their interflowing aggregate , those grand fresh-water seas of ours , -- Erie , and Ontario , and Huron , and Superior , and Michigan , -- possess an ocean-like expansiveness , with many of the ocean 's noblest traits ; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes . 
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew . 
Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild-ocean born , and wild-ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any . 
And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach , to nurse at his maternal sea ; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific ; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman , fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives . 
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits ; and this Lakeman , a mariner , who though a sort of devil indeed , might yet by inflexible firmness , only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave 's right ; thus treated , this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile . 
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear . 
`` It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven , that the Town-Ho 's leak seemed again increasing , but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day . 
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom . 
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward , gentlemen , is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length ; that is , if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast , or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them . 
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious . 
`` Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho ; so when her leak was found gaining once more , there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company ; especially by Radney the mate . 
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted , sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . 
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen . 
Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship , some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her . 
So when they were working that evening at the pumps , there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them , as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water ; clear as any mountain spring , gentlemen -- that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck , and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes . 
`` Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . 
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy 's snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne 's father . 
But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . 
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it . 
`` Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings . '' 
` Aye , aye , my merry lads , it 's a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let 's have a taste . 
By the Lord , it 's worth bottling ! 
I tell ye what , men , old Rad 's investment must go for it ! 
he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home . 
The fact is , boys , that sword-fish only began the job ; he 's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters , saw-fish , and file-fish , and what not ; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom ; making improvements , I suppose . 
If old Rad were here now , I 'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em . 
They 're playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him . 
But he 's a simple old soul , -- Rad , and a beauty too . 
Boys , they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses . 
I wonder if he 'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose . ' '' 
` Damn your eyes ! 
what 's that pump stopping for ? ' 
roared Radney , pretending not to have heard the sailors ' talk . 
` Thunder away at it ! ' '' 
` Aye , aye , sir , ' said Steelkilt , merry as a cricket . 
` Lively , boys , lively , now ! ' 
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life 's utmost energies . 
`` Quitting the pump at last , with the rest of his band , the Lakeman went forward all panting , and sat himself down on the windlass ; his face fiery red , his eyes bloodshot , and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . 
Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened . 
Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large . 
`` Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship 's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time . 
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces . 
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard . 
Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades . 
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men . 
`` But there was more than this : the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt , as though Radney had spat in his face . 
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command . 
But as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate 's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being -- a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved -- this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over Steelkilt . 
`` Therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it . 
And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day . 
To this , Radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper 's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by . 
`` Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps , for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate ; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him , without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat , till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face , furiously commanding him to do his bidding . 
`` Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey . 
Seeing , however , that his forbearance had not the slightest effect , by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man ; but it was to no purpose . 
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer : '' ` Mr. Radney , I will not obey you . 
Take that hammer away , or look to yourself . ' 
But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him , where the Lakeman stood fixed , now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions . 
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch ; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance , Steelkilt , clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back , told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he -LRB- Steelkilt -RRB- would murder him . 
But , gentlemen , the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods . 
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale . 
`` Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads . 
They were both Canallers . '' 
` Canallers ! ' 
cried Don Pedro . 
` We have seen many whale-ships in our harbours , but never heard of your Canallers . 
Pardon : who and what are they ? ' '' 
` Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal . 
You must have heard of it . ' '' 
` Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North . ' '' 
` Aye ? 
Well then , Don , refill my cup . 
Your chicha 's very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are ; for such information may throw side-light upon my story . ' 
`` For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard-room and bar-room ; through the holy-of-holies of great forests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow-white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life . 
There 's your true Ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long-flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches . 
For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities . '' 
` Is that a friar passing ? ' 
said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern . '' 
` Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella 's Inquisition wanes in Lima , ' laughed Don Sebastian . 
` Proceed , Senor . ' '' ' 
A moment ! 
Pardon ! ' 
cried another of the company . 
` In the name of all us Limeese , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison . 
Oh ! 
do not bow and look surprised ; you know the proverb all along this coast -- `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables , and for ever open -- and `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
So , too , Venice ; I have been there ; the holy city of the blessed evangelist , St. Mark ! 
-- St. Dominic , purge it ! 
Your cup ! 
Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again . ' 
`` Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . 
Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green-turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck . 
But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed . 
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features . 
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities . 
Once a vagabond on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one . 
In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains . 
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas . '' ' 
I see ! 
I see ! ' 
impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles . 
` No need to travel ! 
The world 's one Lima . 
I had thought , now , that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills . 
-- But the story . ' 
`` I left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the backstay . 
Hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck . 
But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two Canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle . 
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm 's way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter-deck . 
At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment . 
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade . '' 
` Come out of that , ye pirates ! ' 
roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward . 
` Come out of that , ye cut-throats ! ' 
`` Steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his -LRB- Steelkilt 's -RRB- death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands . 
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty . '' 
` Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ? ' 
demanded their ringleader . '' 
` Turn to ! 
turn to ! 
-- I make no promise ; -- to your duty ! 
Do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ? 
Turn to ! ' 
and he once more raised a pistol . '' 
` Sink the ship ? ' 
cried Steelkilt . 
` Aye , let her sink . 
Not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us . 
What say ye , men ? ' 
turning to his comrades . 
A fierce cheer was their response . 
`` The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such sentences as these : -- ` It 's not our fault ; we did n't want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy 's business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ai n't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ? 
look to those handspikes , my hearties . 
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; do n't be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we 're your men ; but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! 
I make no promises , turn to , I say ! ' '' 
` Look ye , now , ' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ` there are a few of us here -LRB- and I am one of them -RRB- who have shipped for the cruise , d'ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we do n't want a row ; it 's not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! ' 
roared the Captain . 
`` Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said : -- ' I tell you what it is now , Captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a shabby rascal , we wo n't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not flogging us , we do n't do a hand 's turn . ' '' 
` Down into the forecastle then , down with ye , I 'll keep ye there till ye 're sick of it . 
Down ye go . ' '' 
` Shall we ? ' 
cried the ringleader to his men . 
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave . 
`` As the Lakeman 's bare head was just level with the planks , the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway . 
`` Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral . 
`` All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below . 
But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship . 
`` At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused . 
Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the Captain returned to the quarter-deck . 
Twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to . 
The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion . 
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged . 
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them . 
Only three were left . '' 
` Better turn to , now ? ' 
said the Captain with a heartless jeer . '' 
` Shut us up again , will ye ! ' 
cried Steelkilt . '' 
` Oh certainly , ' said the Captain , and the key clicked . 
`` It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives -LRB- long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end -RRB- run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship . 
For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not . 
That was the last night he should spend in that den . 
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender . 
And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come . 
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time . 
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out . 
`` Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit . 
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight . 
`` Thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle . 
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies , who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder . 
But all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning . 
` Damn ye , ' cried the Captain , pacing to and fro before them , ` the vultures would not touch ye , ye villains ! ' 
`` At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the whole , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular . '' 
` But as for you , ye carrion rogues , ' turning to the three men in the rigging -- ` for you , I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots ; ' and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors , till they yelled no more , but lifelessly hung their heads sideways , as the two crucified thieves are drawn . '' 
` My wrist is sprained with ye ! ' 
he cried , at last ; ` but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that would n't give up . 
Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself . ' 
`` For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ` What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you ! ' '' 
` Say ye so ? 
then see how ye frighten me ' -- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike . '' 
` Best not , ' hissed the Lakeman . '' 
` But I must , ' -- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke . 
`` Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I wo n't do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d'ye hear ? ' 
`` But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- Radney the chief mate . 
Ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene . 
Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe . '' 
` You are a coward ! ' 
hissed the Lakeman . '' 
` So I am , but take that . ' 
The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm . 
He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt 's threat , whatever that might have been . 
The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before . 
`` Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew . 
Entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship 's run for salvation . 
Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest . 
On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt 's instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body . 
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered . 
For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale . 
`` But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel -LRB- at least till all was over -RRB- concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart . 
He was in Radney the chief mate 's watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night . 
Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge . 
`` During the night , Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship 's side . 
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed . 
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea . 
Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed . 
At his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below . '' 
` What are you making there ? ' 
said a shipmate . '' 
` What do you think ? 
what does it look like ? ' '' 
` Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it 's an odd one , seems to me . ' '' 
` Yes , rather oddish , ' said the Lakeman , holding it at arm 's length before him ; ` but I think it will answer . 
Shipmate , I have n't enough twine , -- have you any ? ' 
`` But there was none in the forecastle . '' 
` Then I must get some from old Rad ; ' and he rose to go aft . '' 
` You do n't mean to go a begging to HIM ! ' 
said a sailor . '' 
` Why not ? 
Do you think he wo n't do me a turn , when it 's to help himself in the end , shipmate ? ' 
and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock . 
It was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman 's monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow . 
Twenty-four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman 's hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in . 
`` But , gentlemen , a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned . 
Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger . 
For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done . 
`` It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid Teneriffe man , drawing water in the main-chains , all at once shouted out , ` There she rolls ! 
there she rolls ! ' 
Jesu , what a whale ! 
It was Moby Dick . '' 
` Moby Dick ! ' 
cried Don Sebastian ; ` St. Dominic ! 
Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ? 
Whom call you Moby Dick ? ' '' ' 
A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ; -- but that would be too long a story . ' '' 
` How ? 
how ? ' 
cried all the young Spaniards , crowding . '' 
` Nay , Dons , Dons -- nay , nay ! 
I can not rehearse that now . 
Let me get more into the air , Sirs . ' '' 
` The chicha ! 
the chicha ! ' 
cried Don Pedro ; ` our vigorous friend looks faint ; -- fill up his empty glass ! ' 
`` No need , gentlemen ; one moment , and I proceed . 
-- Now , gentlemen , so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment , the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads . 
All was now a phrensy . 
` The White Whale -- the White Whale ! ' 
was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea . 
Gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted . 
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command . 
Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate 's got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar . 
After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow . 
He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat . 
And now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale 's topmost back . 
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate . 
That instant , as he fell on the whale 's slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale . 
He struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick . 
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down . 
`` Meantime , at the first tap of the boat 's bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts . 
But a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line . 
He cut it ; and the whale was free . 
But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some tatters of Radney 's red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him . 
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared . 
`` In good time , the Town-Ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided . 
There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor . 
`` The ship 's company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak . 
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel . 
After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale-boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew . 
`` On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals . 
He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water . 
The captain presented a pistol . 
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam . '' 
` What do you want of me ? ' 
cried the captain . '' 
` Where are you bound ? 
and for what are you bound ? ' 
demanded Steelkilt ; ` no lies . ' '' ' 
I am bound to Tahiti for more men . ' '' 
` Very good . 
Let me board you a moment -- I come in peace . ' 
With that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain . '' 
` Cross your arms , sir ; throw back your head . 
Now , repeat after me . 
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me , I swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days . 
If I do not , may lightning strike me ! ' '' ' 
A pretty scholar , ' laughed the Lakeman . 
` Adios , Senor ! ' 
and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades . 
`` Watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of destination . 
There , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for France , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed . 
They embarked ; and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution . 
`` Some ten days after the French ships sailed , the whale-boat arrived , and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians , who had been somewhat used to the sea . 
Chartering a small native schooner , he returned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right there , again resumed his cruisings . 
`` Where Steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of Nantucket , the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him . '' 
` Are you through ? ' 
said Don Sebastian , quietly . '' ' 
I am , Don . ' '' 
` Then I entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ? 
It is so passing wonderful ! 
Did you get it from an unquestionable source ? 
Bear with me if I seem to press . ' '' 
` Also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian 's suit , ' cried the company , with exceeding interest . '' 
` Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ? ' '' 
` Nay , ' said Don Sebastian ; ` but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me . 
I go for it ; but are you well advised ? 
this may grow too serious . ' '' 
` Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ? ' '' 
` Though there are no Auto-da-Fe 's in Lima now , ' said one of the company to another ; ' I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy . 
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight . 
I see no need of this . ' '' 
` Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can . ' '' 
` This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists , ' said Don Sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure . '' 
` Let me remove my hat . 
Now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it . '' 
` So help me Heaven , and on my honour the story I have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true . 
I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney . ' '' 
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there . 
It may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman . 
It is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong . 
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and Grecian sculptures . 
For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin 's , and a helmeted head like St. George 's ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him . 
Now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale 's , is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta , in India . 
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being . 
No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth . 
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar . 
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong . 
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale 's majestic flukes . 
But go to the old Galleries , and look now at a great Christian painter 's portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo . 
It is Guido 's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale . 
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ? 
Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own `` Perseus Descending , '' make out one whit better . 
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water . 
It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower . 
Then , there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah 's whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers . 
What shall be said of these ? 
As for the book-binder 's whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases . 
Though universally denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this book-binder 's fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced . 
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the Revival of Learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan . 
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d'eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden-Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain . 
In the title-page of the original edition of the `` Advancement of Learning '' you will find some curious whales . 
But quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know . 
In old Harris 's collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A.D. 1671 , entitled `` A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master . '' 
In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice-isles , with white bears running over their living backs . 
In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes . 
Then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one Captain Colnett , a Post Captain in the English navy , entitled `` A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries . '' 
In this book is an outline purporting to be a `` Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck . '' 
I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . 
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long . 
Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye ! 
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . 
Look at that popular work `` Goldsmith 's Animated Nature . '' 
In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged `` whale '' and a `` narwhale . '' 
I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys . 
Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan . 
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale -LRB- that is to say , the Right whale -RRB- , even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature . 
But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron . 
In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale . 
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket . 
In a word , Frederick Cuvier 's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash . 
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage -LRB- such men seldom have -RRB- , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ? 
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing . 
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us . 
As for the sign-painters ' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers , what shall be said of them ? 
They are generally Richard III . 
whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint . 
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all . 
Consider ! 
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . 
Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . 
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . 
And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship 's deck , such is then the outlandish , eel-like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch . 
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form . 
Not at all . 
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape . 
Though Jeremy Bentham 's skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy 's other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan 's articulated bones . 
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it . 
This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown . 
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb . 
This fin has four regular bone-fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger . 
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering . 
`` However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , '' said humorous Stubb one day , `` he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens . '' 
For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . 
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness .
