So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . 
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . 
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan . 
Pictures of Whaling Scenes . 
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , Purchas , Hackluyt , Harris , Cuvier , etc. . 
But I pass that matter by . 
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett 's , Huggins 's , Frederick Cuvier 's , and Beale 's . 
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to . 
Huggins 's is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale 's is the best . 
All Beale 's drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . 
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect . 
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . 
That is not his fault though . 
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression . 
He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters . 
But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one Garnery . 
Respectively , they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale . 
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks . 
The prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster 's spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice . 
The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true . 
The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene . 
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , I could not draw so good a one . 
In the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs . 
His jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below . 
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell-fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back . 
And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer . 
Thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole . 
Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not . 
But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman . 
The French are the lads for painting action . 
Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell-mell , through the consecutive great battles of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ? 
Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery . 
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes . 
With not one tenth of England 's experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . 
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . 
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals . 
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager -LRB- I honour him for a veteran -RRB- , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace . 
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself `` H. Durand . '' 
One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . 
It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . 
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . 
The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove-to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel -LRB- in the act of cutting-in -RRB- hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . 
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half-erect out of the water , like a rearing horse . 
From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen . 
Stone ; in Mountains ; in Stars . 
On Tower-hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar -LRB- or KEDGER , as the sailors say -RRB- holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg . 
There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats -LRB- presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity -RRB- is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale . 
Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world . 
But the time of his justification has now come . 
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings . 
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . 
Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . 
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . 
But , in general , they toil with their jack-knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner 's fancy . 
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i.e. what is called savagery . 
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois . 
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . 
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . 
An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon . 
For , with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark 's tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application . 
As with the Hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor-savage . 
With the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark 's tooth , of his one poor jack-knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles 's shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer . 
Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers . 
Some of them are done with much accuracy . 
At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door . 
When the porter is sleepy , the anvil-headed whale would be best . 
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . 
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with `` HANDS OFF ! '' 
you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit . 
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges . 
Then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges . 
But you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point , else so chance-like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery ; like the Soloma Islands , which still remain incognita , though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them . 
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds . 
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me . 
And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis , and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish . 
With a frigate 's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight ! 
Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds . 
For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat . 
On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip . 
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea . 
* * That part of the sea known among whalemen as the `` Brazil Banks '' does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased . 
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers . 
Seen from the mast-heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else . 
And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea . 
And even when recognised at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse . 
Indeed , in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore . 
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ? 
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him . 
But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment 's consideration will teach , that however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it . 
The first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow . 
That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year . 
Yea , foolish mortals , Noah 's flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers . 
Wherein differ the sea and the land , that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other ? 
Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews . 
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . 
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . 
No mercy , no power but its own controls it . 
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe . 
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure . 
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks . 
Consider , once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began . 
Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ? 
For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life . 
God keep thee ! 
Push not off from that isle , thou canst never return ! 
Slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the Pequod still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of Java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain . 
And still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen . 
But one transparent blue morning , when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea , however unattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , enjoining some secrecy ; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head . 
In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide , new slid from the hills . 
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank . 
Then once more arose , and silently gleamed . 
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ? 
thought Daggoo . 
Again the phantom went down , but on re-appearing once more , with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out -- `` There ! 
there again ! 
there she breaches ! 
right ahead ! 
The White Whale , the White Whale ! '' 
Upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard-arms , as in swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs . 
Bare-headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo . 
Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering . 
The four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab 's in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey . 
Soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo ! 
in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose . 
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind . 
A vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream-colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach . 
No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance-like apparition of life . 
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed -- `` Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost ! '' 
`` What was it , Sir ? '' 
said Flask . 
`` The great live squid , which , they say , few whale-ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it . '' 
But Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following . 
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness . 
So rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food . 
For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists . 
At times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length . 
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it . 
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid . 
The manner in which the Bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond . 
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it . 
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle-fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the Anak of the tribe . 
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale-line . 
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapoured with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope 's durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss . 
Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add -LRB- since there is an aesthetics in all things -RRB- , is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp . 
Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold . 
The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness . 
At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is . 
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons . 
In length , the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms . 
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm-pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded `` sheaves , '' or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the `` heart , '' or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese . 
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody 's arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub . 
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists . 
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs . 
There is some advantage in this ; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one . 
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales . 
Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything . 
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts . 
First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon . 
In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort . 
Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety 's sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again . 
Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man 's oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out . 
From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms -LRB- called box-line -RRB- being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short-warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail . 
Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction . 
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs . 
Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he can not be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly . 
Yet habit -- strange thing ! 
what can not habit accomplish ? 
-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat , when thus hung in hangman 's nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say . 
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost . 
For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you . 
It is worse ; for you can not sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out . 
Again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair . 
But why say more ? 
All men live enveloped in whale-lines . 
All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever-present perils of life . 
And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale-boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side . 
If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object . 
`` When you see him ` quid , '' said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , `` then you quick see him ` parm whale . '' 
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod 's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea . 
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying-fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in-shore ground off Peru . 
It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air . 
No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn . 
Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy . 
So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman . 
The waves , too , nodded their indolent crests ; and across the wide trance of the sea , east nodded to west , and the sun over all . 
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes ; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds ; some invisible , gracious agency preserved me ; with a shock I came back to life . 
And lo ! 
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun 's rays like a mirror . 
But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . 
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . 
As if struck by some enchanter 's wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . 
`` Clear away the boats ! 
Luff ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes . 
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale ; and ere the boats were down , majestically turning , he swam away to the leeward , but with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam , that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed , Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used , and no man must speak but in whispers . 
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set . 
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up . 
`` There go flukes ! '' 
was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb 's producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted . 
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker 's boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture . 
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers . 
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use . 
Paddles were dropped , and oars came loudly into play . 
And still puffing at his pipe , Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault . 
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish . 
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going `` head out '' ; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed . 
* * It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale 's enormous head consists . 
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him . 
So that with ease he elevates it in the air , and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed . 
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat . 
`` Start her , start her , my men ! 
Do n't hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder-claps , that 's all , '' cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke . 
`` Start her , now ; give 'em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego . 
Start her , Tash , my boy -- start her , all ; but keep cool , keep cool -- cucumbers is the word -- easy , easy -- only start her like grim death and grinning devils , and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves , boys -- that 's all . 
Start her ! '' 
`` Woo-hoo ! 
Wa-hee ! '' 
screamed the Gay-Header in reply , raising some old war-whoop to the skies ; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave . 
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild . 
`` Kee-hee ! 
Kee-hee ! '' 
yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage . 
`` Ka-la ! 
Koo-loo ! '' 
howled Queequeg , as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier 's steak . 
And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea . 
Meanwhile , Stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth . 
Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained , till the welcome cry was heard -- `` Stand up , Tashtego ! 
-- give it to him ! '' 
The harpoon was hurled . 
`` Stern all ! '' 
The oarsmen backed water ; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists . 
It was the magical line . 
An instant before , Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead , whence , by reason of its increased rapid circlings , a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe . 
As the line passed round and round the loggerhead ; so also , just before reaching that point , it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb 's hands , from which the hand-cloths , or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times , had accidentally dropped . 
It was like holding an enemy 's sharp two-edged sword by the blade , and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch . 
`` Wet the line ! 
wet the line ! '' 
cried Stubb to the tub oarsman -LRB- him seated by the tub -RRB- who , snatching off his hat , dashed sea-water into it . 
* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place . 
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins . 
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places -- stem for stern -- a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion . 
* Partly to show the indispensableness of this act , it may here be stated , that , in the old Dutch fishery , a mop was used to dash the running line with water ; in many other ships , a wooden piggin , or bailer , is set apart for that purpose . 
Your hat , however , is the most convenient . 
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat , and from its now being more tight than a harpstring , you would have thought the craft had two keels -- one cleaving the water , the other the air -- as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once . 
A continual cascade played at the bows ; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake ; and , at the slightest motion from within , even but of a little finger , the vibrating , cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea . 
Thus they rushed ; each man with might and main clinging to his seat , to prevent being tossed to the foam ; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double , in order to bring down his centre of gravity . 
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way , till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight . 
`` Haul in -- haul in ! '' 
cried Stubb to the bowsman ! 
and , facing round towards the whale , all hands began pulling the boat up to him , while yet the boat was being towed on . 
Soon ranging up by his flank , Stubb , firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat , darted dart after dart into the flying fish ; at the word of command , the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale 's horrible wallow , and then ranging up for another fling . 
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill . 
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake . 
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men . 
And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance -LRB- by the line attached to it -RRB- , Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale . 
`` Pull up -- pull up ! '' 
he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath . 
`` Pull up ! 
-- close to ! '' 
and the boat ranged along the fish 's flank . 
When reaching far over the bow , Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out . 
But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish . 
And now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his `` flurry , '' the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day . 
And now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout-hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations . 
At last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea . 
His heart had burst ! 
`` He 's dead , Mr. Stubb , '' said Daggoo . 
`` Yes ; both pipes smoked out ! '' 
and withdrawing his own from his mouth , Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made . 
A word concerning an incident in the last chapter . 
According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale-boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer-oar . 
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet . 
But however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one 's compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it . 
For one , I can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time . 
In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry -- `` Stand up , and give it to him ! '' 
He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale . 
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted ! 
Again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else . 
It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat . 
Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary . 
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman . 
I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them . 
To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil . 
Out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs . 
So , in productive subjects , grow the chapters . 
The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention . 
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow . 
Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall . 
It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons . 
But these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this : to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold . 
It is a doubling of the chances . 
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning-like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him . 
Nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands . 
Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line -LRB- mentioned in a preceding chapter -RRB- making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable . 
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties . 
Furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp-edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions . 
Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse . 
Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him . 
For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery . 
All these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted . 
Stubb 's whale had been killed some distance from the ship . 
It was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod . 
And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved . 
For , upon the great canal of Hang-Ho , or whatever they call it , in China , four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig-lead in bulk . 
Darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the Pequod 's main-rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks . 
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning . 
Though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object . 
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod 's decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port-holes . 
But by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored . 
Tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel 's and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two -- ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing . 
* * A little item may as well be related here . 
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other -LRB- excepting the side-fins -RRB- , its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you can not get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it . 
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship . 
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes . 
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement . 
Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs . 
One small , helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb , was soon made strangely manifest . 
Stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate . 
`` A steak , a steak , ere I sleep ! 
You , Daggoo ! 
overboard you go , and cut me one from his small ! '' 
Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war -LRB- at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage -RRB- , yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body . 
About midnight that steak was cut and cooked ; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil , Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head , as if that capstan were a sideboard . 
Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale 's flesh that night . 
Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness . 
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull , within a few inches of the sleepers ' hearts . 
Peering over the side you could just see them -LRB- as before you heard them -RRB- wallowing in the sullen , black waters , and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head . 
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous . 
How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things . 
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw . 
Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship 's decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other 's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel-hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea . 
If you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil . 
But , as yet , Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips . 
`` Cook , cook ! 
-- where 's that old Fleece ? '' 
he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; `` cook , you cook ! 
-- sail this way , cook ! '' 
The old black , not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour , came shambling along from his galley , for , like many old blacks , there was something the matter with his knee-pans , which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans ; this old Fleece , as they called him , came shuffling and limping along , assisting his step with his tongs , which , after a clumsy fashion , were made of straightened iron hoops ; this old Ebony floundered along , and in obedience to the word of command , came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb 's sideboard ; when , with both hands folded before him , and resting on his two-legged cane , he bowed his arched back still further over , at the same time sideways inclining his head , so as to bring his best ear into play . 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth , `` do n't you think this steak is rather overdone ? 
You 've been beating this steak too much , cook ; it 's too tender . 
Do n't I always say that to be good , a whale-steak must be tough ? 
There are those sharks now over the side , do n't you see they prefer it tough and rare ? 
What a shindy they are kicking up ! 
Cook , go and talk to 'em ; tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation , but they must keep quiet . 
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice . 
Away , cook , and deliver my message . 
Here , take this lantern , '' snatching one from his sideboard ; `` now then , go and preach to 'em ! '' 
Sullenly taking the offered lantern , old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said . 
`` Fellow-critters : I ` se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare . 
You hear ? 
Stop dat dam smackin ' ob de lips ! 
Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by Gor ! 
you must stop dat dam racket ! '' 
`` Cook , '' here interposed Stubb , accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder , -- `` Cook ! 
why , damn your eyes , you must n't swear that way when you 're preaching . 
That 's no way to convert sinners , cook ! '' 
`` Who dat ? 
Den preach to him yourself , '' sullenly turning to go . 
`` No , cook ; go on , go on . '' 
`` Well , den , Belubed fellow-critters : '' -- `` Right ! '' 
exclaimed Stubb , approvingly , `` coax 'em to it ; try that , '' and Fleece continued . 
`` Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow-critters , dat dat woraciousness -- ` top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail ! 
How you tink to hear , spose you keep up such a dam slappin ' and bitin ' dare ? '' 
`` Cook , '' cried Stubb , collaring him , `` I wo n't have that swearing . 
Talk to 'em gentlemanly . '' 
Once more the sermon proceeded . 
`` Your woraciousness , fellow-critters , I do n't blame ye so much for ; dat is natur , and ca n't be helped ; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint . 
You is sharks , sartin ; but if you gobern de shark in you , why den you be angel ; for all angel is not ` ing more dan de shark well goberned . 
Now , look here , bred ` ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale . 
Do n't be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour 's mout , I say . 
Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale ? 
And , by Gor , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else . 
I know some o ' you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat ca n't get into de scrouge to help demselves . '' 
`` Well done , old Fleece ! '' 
cried Stubb , `` that 's Christianity ; go on . '' 
`` No use goin ' on ; de dam willains will keep a scougin ' and slappin ' each oder , Massa Stubb ; dey do n't hear one word ; no use a-preaching to such dam g ` uttons as you call 'em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get 'em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in the sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and ca n't hear noting at all , no more , for eber and eber . '' 
`` Upon my soul , I am about of the same opinion ; so give the benediction , Fleece , and I 'll away to my supper . '' 
Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried -- `` Cussed fellow-critters ! 
Kick up de damndest row as ever you can ; fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust -- and den die . '' 
`` Now , cook , '' said Stubb , resuming his supper at the capstan ; `` stand just where you stood before , there , over against me , and pay particular attention . '' 
`` All ` dention , '' said Fleece , again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position . 
`` Well , '' said Stubb , helping himself freely meanwhile ; `` I shall now go back to the subject of this steak . 
In the first place , how old are you , cook ? '' 
`` What dat do wid de ` teak , '' said the old black , testily . 
`` Silence ! 
How old are you , cook ? '' '' 
` Bout ninety , dey say , '' he gloomily muttered . 
`` And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and do n't know yet how to cook a whale-steak ? '' 
rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question . 
`` Where were you born , cook ? '' '' 
` Hind de hatchway , in ferry-boat , goin ' ober de Roanoke . '' 
`` Born in a ferry-boat ! 
That 's queer , too . 
But I want to know what country you were born in , cook ! '' 
`` Did n't I say de Roanoke country ? '' 
he cried sharply . 
`` No , you did n't , cook ; but I 'll tell you what I 'm coming to , cook . 
You must go home and be born over again ; you do n't know how to cook a whale-steak yet . '' 
`` Bress my soul , if I cook noder one , '' he growled , angrily , turning round to depart . 
`` Come back here , cook ; -- here , hand me those tongs ; -- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ? 
Take it , I say '' -- holding the tongs towards him -- `` take it , and taste it . '' 
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment , the old negro muttered , `` Best cooked ` teak I eber taste ; joosy , berry joosy . '' 
`` Cook , '' said Stubb , squaring himself once more ; `` do you belong to the church ? '' 
`` Passed one once in Cape-Down , '' said the old man sullenly . 
`` And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town , where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures , have you , cook ! 
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ? '' 
said Stubb . 
`` Where do you expect to go to , cook ? '' 
`` Go to bed berry soon , '' he mumbled , half-turning as he spoke . 
`` Avast ! 
heave to ! 
I mean when you die , cook . 
It 's an awful question . 
Now what 's your answer ? '' 
`` When dis old brack man dies , '' said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , `` he hisself wo n't go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him . '' 
`` Fetch him ? 
How ? 
In a coach and four , as they fetched Elijah ? 
And fetch him where ? '' 
`` Up dere , '' said Fleece , holding his tongs straight over his head , and keeping it there very solemnly . 
`` So , then , you expect to go up into our main-top , do you , cook , when you are dead ? 
But do n't you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ? 
Main-top , eh ? '' 
`` Did n't say dat t ` all , '' said Fleece , again in the sulks . 
`` You said up there , did n't you ? 
and now look yourself , and see where your tongs are pointing . 
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber 's hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you do n't get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging . 
It 's a ticklish business , but must be done , or else it 's no go . 
But none of us are in heaven yet . 
Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders . 
Do ye hear ? 
Hold your hat in one hand , and clap t ` other a ` top of your heart , when I 'm giving my orders , cook . 
What ! 
that your heart , there ? 
-- that 's your gizzard ! 
Aloft ! 
aloft ! 
-- that 's it -- now you have it . 
Hold it there now , and pay attention . '' 
`` All ` dention , '' said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time . 
`` Well then , cook , you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , do n't you ? 
Well , for the future , when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here , the capstan , I 'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing . 
Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d'ye hear ? 
And now to-morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle . 
As for the ends of the flukes , have them soused , cook . 
There , now ye may go . '' 
But Fleece had hardly got three paces off , when he was recalled . 
`` Cook , give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch . 
D'ye hear ? 
away you sail , then . 
-- Halloa ! 
stop ! 
make a bow before you go . 
-- Avast heaving again ! 
Whale-balls for breakfast -- do n't forget . '' 
`` Wish , by gor ! 
whale eat him , ` stead of him eat whale . 
I 'm bressed if he ai n't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself , '' muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock . 
That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp , and , like Stubb , eat him by his own light , as you may say ; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it . 
It is upon record , that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France , and commanded large prices there . 
Also , that in Henry VIIIth 's time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale . 
Porpoises , indeed , are to this day considered fine eating . 
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls , and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls . 
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them . 
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown . 
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite . 
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb , nowadays partake of cooked whales ; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious . 
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil . 
Zogranda , one of their most famous doctors , recommends strips of blubber for infants , as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing . 
And this reminds me that certain Englishmen , who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel -- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . 
Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called `` fritters '' ; which , indeed , they greatly resemble , being brown and crisp , and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives ' dough-nuts or oly-cooks , when fresh . 
They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off . 
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness . 
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good . 
Look at his hump , which would be as fine eating as the buffalo 's -LRB- which is esteemed a rare dish -RRB- , were it not such a solid pyramid of fat . 
But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half-jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter . 
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it . 
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile . 
Many a good supper have I thus made . 
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish . 
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn -LRB- precisely resembling two large puddings -RRB- , they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf 's head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination . 
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf 's head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see . 
The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him , with an `` Et tu Brute ! '' 
expression . 
It is not , perhaps , entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence ; that appears to result , in some way , from the consideration before mentioned : i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea , and eat it too by its own light . 
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ; perhaps he was hung ; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen , he certainly would have been ; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does . 
Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds . 
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal 's jaw ? 
Cannibals ? 
who is not a cannibal ? 
I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine ; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee , I say , in the day of judgment , than for thee , civilized and enlightened gourmand , who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras . 
But Stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ? 
and that is adding insult to injury , is it ? 
Look at your knife-handle , there , my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef , what is that handle made of ? 
-- what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating ? 
And what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ? 
With a feather of the same fowl . 
And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars ?
