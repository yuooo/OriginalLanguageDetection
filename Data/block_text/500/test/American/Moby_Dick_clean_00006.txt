That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship . 
For be a man 's intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base . 
This it is , that for ever keeps God 's true princes of the Empire from the world 's hustings ; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass . 
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency . 
But when , as in the case of Nicholas the Czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization . 
Nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to . 
But Ahab , my Captain , still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings , I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me . 
Oh , Ahab ! 
what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air ! 
It is noon ; and Dough-Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter-boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion-shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg . 
From his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial . 
But presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , `` Dinner , Mr. Starbuck , '' disappears into the cabin . 
When the last echo of his sultan 's step has died away , and Starbuck , the first Emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then Starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , `` Dinner , Mr. Stubb , '' and descends the scuttle . 
The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid `` Dinner , Mr. Flask , '' follows after his predecessors . 
But the third Emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk 's head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music . 
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab 's presence , in the character of Abjectus , or the Slave . 
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander 's cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical . 
Wherefore this difference ? 
A problem ? 
Perhaps not . 
To have been Belshazzar , King of Babylon ; and to have been Belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur . 
But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests , that man 's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man 's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar 's , for Belshazzar was not the greatest . 
Who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be Caesar . 
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding . 
Now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned . 
Over his ivory-inlaid table , Ahab presided like a mute , maned sea-lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs . 
In his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served . 
They were as little children before Ahab ; and yet , in Ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance . 
With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man 's knife , as he carved the chief dish before him . 
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather . 
No ! 
And when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck 's plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection . 
For , like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort , where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb . 
What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . 
And poor little Flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party . 
His were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks . 
For Flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree . 
Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him . 
And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it . 
Least of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter . 
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , Flask , alas ! 
was a butterless man ! 
Another thing . 
Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up . 
Consider ! 
For hereby Flask 's dinner was badly jammed in point of time . 
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . 
If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck . 
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less . 
For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him . 
Peace and satisfaction , thought Flask , have for ever departed from my stomach . 
I am an officer ; but , how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle , as I used to when I was before the mast . 
There 's the fruits of promotion now ; there 's the vanity of glory : there 's the insanity of life ! 
Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask 's official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner-time , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab . 
Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod 's cabin . 
After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward . 
And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees . 
They made a sort of temporary servants ' hall of the high and mighty cabin . 
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain 's table , was the entire care-free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers . 
While their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it . 
They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices . 
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox . 
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon-wise . 
And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted Dough-Boy 's memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him . 
He was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread-faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse . 
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , Dough-Boy 's whole life was one continual lip-quiver . 
Commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over . 
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the Indian 's : crosswise to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship . 
But for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty . 
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person . 
But , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds . 
Not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished . 
But Queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating -- an ugly sound enough -- so much so , that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms . 
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy . 
Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy . 
How could he forget that in his Island days , Queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions . 
Alas ! 
Dough-Boy ! 
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals . 
Not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler . 
In good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable-mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like Moorish scimetars in scabbards . 
But , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping-time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters . 
In this one matter , Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship 's cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there . 
So that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it . 
For when they did enter it , it was something as a street-door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air . 
Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , Ahab was inaccessible . 
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom , he was still an alien to it . 
He lived in the world , as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri . 
And as when Spring and Summer had departed , that wild Logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , Ahab 's soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom ! 
It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round . 
In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel 's leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground . 
And if , after a three , four , or five years ' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her -- say , an empty vial even -- then , her mast-heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more . 
Now , as the business of standing mast-heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here . 
I take it , that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them . 
For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet -LRB- ere the final truck was put to it -RRB- as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God 's wrath ; therefore , we can not give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians . 
And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight . 
In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post . 
Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight . 
There is Napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of Vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether Louis Philippe , Louis Blanc , or Louis the Devil . 
Great Washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore , and like one of Hercules ' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go . 
Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun-metal , stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square ; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire . 
But neither great Washington , nor Napoleon , nor Nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned . 
It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable . 
The worthy Obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast , to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house . 
A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach . 
But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast-head , that of a whale-ship at sea . 
The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set ; the seamen taking their regular turns -LRB- as at the helm -RRB- , and relieving each other every two hours . 
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful . 
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes . 
There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves . 
The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor . 
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable . 
In one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years ' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months . 
And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves . 
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ' gallant-mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks -LRB- almost peculiar to whalemen -RRB- called the t ' gallant cross-trees . 
Here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull 's horns . 
To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch-coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and can not freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing -LRB- like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter -RRB- ; so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you . 
You can not put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat . 
Concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called CROW 'S - NESTS , in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas . 
In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled `` A Voyage among the Icebergs , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland ; '' in this admirable volume , all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROW 'S - NEST of the Glacier , which was the name of Captain Sleet 's good craft . 
He called it the SLEET 'S CROW 'S - NEST , in honour of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names -LRB- we fathers being the original inventors and patentees -RRB- , so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget . 
In shape , the Sleet 's crow 's - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale . 
Being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom . 
On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats . 
In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences . 
When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow 's - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him -LRB- also fixed in the rack -RRB- , together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you can not successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing . 
Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow 's - nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow 's - nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the `` local attraction '' of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship 's planks , and in the Glacier 's case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew ; I say , that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned `` binnacle deviations , '' `` azimuth compass observations , '' and `` approximate errors , '' he knows very well , Captain Sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow 's nest , within easy reach of his hand . 
Though , upon the whole , I greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird 's nest within three or four perches of the pole . 
But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float . 
For one , I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg , or any one else off duty whom I might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination . 
Let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard . 
With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I -- being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships ' standing orders , `` Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time . '' 
And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship-owners of Nantucket ! 
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head . 
Beware of such an one , I say ; your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer . 
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded . 
For nowadays , the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent-minded young men , disgusted with the carking cares of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber . 
Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates : -- `` Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! 
Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain . '' 
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient `` interest '' in the voyage ; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . 
But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? 
They have left their opera-glasses at home . 
`` Why , thou monkey , '' said a harpooneer to one of these lads , `` we 've been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet . 
Whales are scarce as hen 's teeth whenever thou art up here . '' 
Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half-seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly-discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . 
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer 's -LRB- Thomas Cranmer -RRB- sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over . 
There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God . 
But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror . 
Over Descartian vortices you hover . 
And perhaps , at mid-day , in the fairest weather , with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever . 
Heed it well , ye Pantheists ! 
-LRB- ENTER AHAB : THEN , ALL -RRB- It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck . 
There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden . 
Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk . 
Did you fixedly gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger foot-prints -- the foot-prints of his one unsleeping , ever-pacing thought . 
But on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark . 
And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement . 
`` D'ye mark him , Flask ? '' 
whispered Stubb ; `` the chick that 's in him pecks the shell . 
` Twill soon be out . '' 
The hours wore on ; -- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect . 
It drew near the close of day . 
Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft . 
`` Sir ! '' 
said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case . 
`` Send everybody aft , '' repeated Ahab . 
`` Mast-heads , there ! 
come down ! '' 
When the entire ship 's company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck . 
With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat . 
But this did not last long . 
Vehemently pausing , he cried : -- `` What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ? '' 
`` Sing out for him ! '' 
was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices . 
`` Good ! '' 
cried Ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them . 
`` And what do ye next , men ? '' 
`` Lower away , and after him ! '' 
`` And what tune is it ye pull to , men ? '' 
`` A dead whale or a stove boat ! '' 
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions . 
But , they were all eagerness again , as Ahab , now half-revolving in his pivot-hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and tightly , almost convulsively grasping it , addressed them thus : -- `` All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale . 
Look ye ! 
d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ? '' 
-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun -- `` it is a sixteen dollar piece , men . 
D'ye see it ? 
Mr. Starbuck , hand me yon top-maul . '' 
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him . 
Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : `` Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys ! '' 
`` Huzza ! 
huzza ! '' 
cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast . 
`` It 's a white whale , I say , '' resumed Ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : `` a white whale . 
Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out . '' 
All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection . 
`` Captain Ahab , '' said Tashtego , `` that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick . '' 
`` Moby Dick ? '' 
shouted Ahab . 
`` Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ? '' 
`` Does he fan-tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ? '' 
said the Gay-Header deliberately . 
`` And has he a curious spout , too , '' said Daggoo , `` very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ? '' 
`` And he have one , two , three -- oh ! 
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain , '' cried Queequeg disjointedly , `` all twiske-tee be-twisk , like him -- him -- '' faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle -- `` like him -- him -- '' `` Corkscrew ! '' 
cried Ahab , `` aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing ; aye , Tashtego , and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall . 
Death and devils ! 
men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen -- Moby Dick -- Moby Dick ! '' 
`` Captain Ahab , '' said Starbuck , who , with Stubb and Flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder . 
`` Captain Ahab , I have heard of Moby Dick -- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg ? '' 
`` Who told thee that ? '' 
cried Ahab ; then pausing , `` Aye , Starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me ; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now . 
Aye , aye , '' he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart-stricken moose ; `` Aye , aye ! 
it was that accursed white whale that razed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day ! '' 
Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : `` Aye , aye ! 
and I 'll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition 's flames before I give him up . 
And this is what ye have shipped for , men ! 
to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out . 
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ? 
I think ye do look brave . '' 
`` Aye , aye ! '' 
shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : `` A sharp eye for the white whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick ! '' 
`` God bless ye , '' he seemed to half sob and half shout . 
`` God bless ye , men . 
Steward ! 
go draw the great measure of grog . 
But what 's this long face about , Mr. Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ? 
art not game for Moby Dick ? '' 
`` I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander 's vengeance . 
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , Captain Ahab ? 
it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market . '' 
`` Nantucket market ! 
Hoot ! 
But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . 
If money 's to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE ! '' 
`` He smites his chest , '' whispered Stubb , `` what 's that for ? 
methinks it rings most vast , but hollow . '' 
`` Vengeance on a dumb brute ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` that simply smote thee from blindest instinct ! 
Madness ! 
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous . '' 
`` Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer . 
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks . 
But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask . 
If man will strike , strike through the mask ! 
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? 
To me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me . 
Sometimes I think there 's naught beyond . 
But 't is enough . 
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it . 
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him . 
Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I 'd strike the sun if it insulted me . 
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations . 
But not my master , man , is even that fair play . 
Who 's over me ? 
Truth hath no confines . 
Take off thine eye ! 
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare ! 
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow . 
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself . 
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity . 
I meant not to incense thee . 
Let it go . 
Look ! 
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . 
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! 
The crew , man , the crew ! 
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ? 
See Stubb ! 
he laughs ! 
See yonder Chilian ! 
he snorts to think of it . 
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling can not , Starbuck ! 
And what is it ? 
Reckon it . 
'T is but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck . 
What is it more ? 
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone ? 
Ah ! 
constrainings seize thee ; I see ! 
the billow lifts thee ! 
Speak , but speak ! 
-- Aye , aye ! 
thy silence , then , THAT voices thee . 
-LRB- ASIDE -RRB- Something shot from my dilated nostrils , he has inhaled it in his lungs . 
Starbuck now is mine ; can not oppose me now , without rebellion . '' 
`` God keep me ! 
-- keep us all ! '' 
murmured Starbuck , lowly . 
But in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in . 
For again Starbuck 's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before . 
Ah , ye admonitions and warnings ! 
why stay ye not when ye come ? 
But rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows ! 
Yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the foregoing things within . 
For with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on . 
`` The measure ! 
the measure ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . 
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship 's company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . 
But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian . 
`` Drink and pass ! '' 
he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . 
`` The crew alone now drink . 
Round with it , round ! 
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; 't is hot as Satan 's hoof . 
So , so ; it goes round excellently . 
It spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye . 
Well done ; almost drained . 
That way it went , this way it comes . 
Hand it me -- here 's a hollow ! 
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . 
Steward , refill ! 
`` Attend now , my braves . 
I have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . 
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha ! 
boy , come back ? 
bad pennies come not sooner . 
Hand it me . 
Why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , were ' t not thou St. Vitus ' imp -- away , thou ague ! 
`` Advance , ye mates ! 
Cross your lances full before me . 
Well done ! 
Let me touch the axis . '' 
So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask . 
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life . 
The three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect . 
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright . 
`` In vain ! '' 
cried Ahab ; `` but , maybe , 't is well . 
For did ye three but once take the full-forced shock , then mine own electric thing , THAT had perhaps expired from out me . 
Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . 
Perchance ye need it not . 
Down lances ! 
And now , ye mates , I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . 
Disdain the task ? 
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? 
Oh , my sweet cardinals ! 
your own condescension , THAT shall bend ye to it . 
I do not order ye ; ye will it . 
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! '' 
Silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him . 
`` Stab me not with that keen steel ! 
Cant them ; cant them over ! 
know ye not the goblet end ? 
Turn up the socket ! 
So , so ; now , ye cup-bearers , advance . 
The irons ! 
take them ; hold them while I fill ! '' 
Forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter . 
`` Now , three to three , ye stand . 
Commend the murderous chalices ! 
Bestow them , ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league . 
Ha ! 
Starbuck ! 
but the deed is done ! 
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it . 
Drink , ye harpooneers ! 
drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat 's bow -- Death to Moby Dick ! 
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death ! '' 
The long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss . 
Starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered . 
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin . 
THE CABIN ; BY THE STERN WINDOWS ; AHAB SITTING ALONE , AND GAZING OUT . 
I leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where'er I sail . 
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass . 
Yonder , by ever-brimming goblet 's rim , the warm waves blush like wine . 
The gold brow plumbs the blue . 
The diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up ! 
she wearies with her endless hill . 
Is , then , the crown too heavy that I wear ? 
this Iron Crown of Lombardy . 
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds . 
'T is iron -- that I know -- not gold . 
'T is split , too -- that I feel ; the jagged edge galls me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight ! 
Dry heat upon my brow ? 
Oh ! 
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed . 
No more . 
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne'er enjoy . 
Gifted with the high perception , I lack the low , enjoying power ; damned , most subtly and most malignantly ! 
damned in the midst of Paradise ! 
Good night -- good night ! 
-LRB- WAVING HIS HAND , HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW . -RRB- 
'T was not so hard a task . 
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve . 
Or , if you will , like so many ant-hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match . 
Oh , hard ! 
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting ! 
What I 've dared , I 've willed ; and what I 've willed , I 'll do ! 
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac , I am madness maddened ! 
That wild madness that 's only calm to comprehend itself ! 
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye ! 
I lost this leg . 
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer . 
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one . 
That 's more than ye , ye great gods , ever were . 
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket-players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes ! 
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; do n't pommel ME ! 
No , ye 've knocked me down , and I am up again ; but YE have run and hidden . 
Come forth from behind your cotton bags ! 
I have no long gun to reach ye . 
Come , Ahab 's compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me . 
Swerve me ? 
ye can not swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves ! 
man has ye there . 
Swerve me ? 
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run . 
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! 
Naught 's an obstacle , naught 's an angle to the iron way ! 
BY THE MAINMAST ; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT . 
My soul is more than matched ; she 's overmanned ; and by a madman ! 
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field ! 
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me ! 
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it . 
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut . 
Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it . 
Yet is there hope . 
Time and tide flow wide . 
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe . 
His heaven-insulting purpose , God may wedge aside . 
I would up heart , were it not like lead . 
But my whole clock 's run down ; my heart the all-controlling weight , I have no key to lift again . 
-LSB- A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE . -RSB- 
Oh , God ! 
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! 
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea . 
The white whale is their demigorgon . 
Hark ! 
the infernal orgies ! 
that revelry is forward ! 
mark the unfaltering silence aft ! 
Methinks it pictures life . 
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . 
The long howl thrills me through ! 
Peace ! 
ye revellers , and set the watch ! 
Oh , life ! 
't is in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , -- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life ! 
't is now that I do feel the latent horror in thee ! 
but 't is not me ! 
that horror 's out of me ! 
and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! 
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences ! 
Fore-Top . 
-LRB- STUBB SOLUS , AND MENDING A BRACE . -RRB- 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
hem ! 
clear my throat ! 
-- I 've been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha 's the final consequence . 
Why so ? 
Because a laugh 's the wisest , easiest answer to all that 's queer ; and come what will , one comfort 's always left -- that unfailing comfort is , it 's all predestinated . 
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt . 
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him , too . 
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it . 
Well , Stubb , WISE Stubb -- that 's my title -- well , Stubb , what of it , Stubb ? 
Here 's a carcase . 
I know not all that may be coming , but be it what it will , I 'll go to it laughing . 
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles ! 
I feel funny . 
Fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
What 's my juicy little pear at home doing now ? 
Crying its eyes out ? 
-- Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers , I dare say , gay as a frigate 's pennant , and so am I -- fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- ASIDE -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming . 
HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS . 
-LRB- FORESAIL RISES AND DISCOVERS THE WATCH STANDING , LOUNGING , LEANING , AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES , ALL SINGING IN CHORUS . -RRB- 
Farewell and adieu to you , Spanish ladies ! 
Farewell and adieu to you , ladies of Spain ! 
Our captain 's commanded . 
-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
Oh , boys , do n't be sentimental ; it 's bad for the digestion ! 
Take a tonic , follow me ! 
-LRB- SINGS , AND ALL FOLLOW -RRB- Our captain stood upon the deck , A spy-glass in his hand , A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand . 
Oh , your tubs in your boats , my boys , And by your braces stand , And we 'll have one of those fine whales , Hand , boys , over hand ! 
So , be cheery , my lads ! 
may your hearts never fail ! 
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale ! 
MATE 'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK . 
Eight bells there , forward ! 
2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
Avast the chorus ! 
Eight bells there ! 
d'ye hear , bell-boy ? 
Strike the bell eight , thou Pip ! 
thou blackling !
