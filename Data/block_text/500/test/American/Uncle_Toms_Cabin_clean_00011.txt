My father , you know , came first from New England ; and he was just such another man as your father , -- a regular old Roman , -- upright , energetic , noble-minded , with an iron will . 
Your father settled down in New England , to rule over rocks and stones , and to force an existence out of Nature ; and mine settled in Louisiana , to rule over men and women , and force existence out of them . 
My mother , '' said St. Clare , getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room , and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration , '' she was divine ! 
Do n't look at me so ! 
-- you know what I mean ! 
She probably was of mortal birth ; but , as far as ever I could observe , there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her ; and everybody that lives to remember her , whether bond or free , servant , acquaintance , relation , all say the same . 
Why , cousin , that mother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for years . 
She was a direct embodiment and personification of the New Testament , -- a living fact , to be accounted for , and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth . 
O , mother ! 
mother ! '' 
said St. Clare , clasping his hands , in a sort of transport ; and then suddenly checking himself , he came back , and seating himself on an ottoman , he went on : `` My brother and I were twins ; and they say , you know , that twins ought to resemble each other ; but we were in all points a contrast . 
He had black , fiery eyes , coal-black hair , a strong , fine Roman profile , and a rich brown complexion . 
I had blue eyes , golden hair , a Greek outline , and fair complexion . 
He was active and observing , I dreamy and inactive . 
He was generous to his friends and equals , but proud , dominant , overbearing , to inferiors , and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself up against him . 
Truthful we both were ; he from pride and courage , I from a sort of abstract ideality . 
We loved each other about as boys generally do , -- off and on , and in general ; -- he was my father 's pet , and I my mother 's . 
`` There was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all possible subjects , of which he and my father had no kind of understanding , and with which they could have no possible sympathy . 
But mother did ; and so , when I had quarreled with Alfred , and father looked sternly on me , I used to go off to mother 's room , and sit by her . 
I remember just how she used to look , with her pale cheeks , her deep , soft , serious eyes , her white dress , -- she always wore white ; and I used to think of her whenever I read in Revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen , clean and white . 
She had a great deal of genius of one sort and another , particularly in music ; and she used to sit at her organ , playing fine old majestic music of the Catholic church , and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman ; and I would lay my head down on her lap , and cry , and dream , and feel , -- oh , immeasurably ! 
-- things that I had no language to say ! 
`` In those days , this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it has now ; nobody dreamed of any harm in it . 
`` My father was a born aristocrat . 
I think , in some preexistent state , he must have been in the higher circles of spirits , and brought all his old court pride along with him ; for it was ingrain , bred in the bone , though he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family . 
My brother was begotten in his image . 
`` Now , an aristocrat , you know , the world over , has no human sympathies , beyond a certain line in society . 
In England the line is in one place , in Burmah in another , and in America in another ; but the aristocrat of all these countries never goes over it . 
What would be hardship and distress and injustice in his own class , is a cool matter of course in another one . 
My father 's dividing line was that of color . 
Among his equals , never was a man more just and generous ; but he considered the negro , through all possible gradations of color , as an intermediate link between man and animals , and graded all his ideas of justice or generosity on this hypothesis . 
I suppose , to be sure , if anybody had asked him , plump and fair , whether they had human immortal souls , he might have hemmed and hawed , and said yes . 
But my father was not a man much troubled with spiritualism ; religious sentiment he had none , beyond a veneration for God , as decidedly the head of the upper classes . 
`` Well , my father worked some five hundred negroes ; he was an inflexible , driving , punctilious business man ; everything was to move by system , -- to be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision . 
Now , if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy , twaddling , shiftless laborers , who had grown up , all their lives , in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but ` shirk , ' as you Vermonters say , and you 'll see that there might naturally be , on his plantation , a great many things that looked horrible and distressing to a sensitive child , like me . 
`` Besides all , he had an overseer , -- great , tall , slab-sided , two-fisted renegade son of Vermont -- -LRB- begging your pardon -RRB- , -- who had gone through a regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree to be admitted to practice . 
My mother never could endure him , nor I ; but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father ; and this man was the absolute despot of the estate . 
`` I was a little fellow then , but I had the same love that I have now for all kinds of human things , -- a kind of passion for the study of humanity , come in what shape it would . 
I was found in the cabins and among the field-hands a great deal , and , of course , was a great favorite ; and all sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear ; and I told them to mother , and we , between us , formed a sort of committee for a redress of grievances . 
We hindered and repressed a great deal of cruelty , and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good , till , as often happens , my zeal overacted . 
Stubbs complained to my father that he could n't manage the hands , and must resign his position . 
Father was a fond , indulgent husband , but a man that never flinched from anything that he thought necessary ; and so he put down his foot , like a rock , between us and the field-hands . 
He told my mother , in language perfectly respectful and deferential , but quite explicit , that over the house-servants she should be entire mistress , but that with the field-hands he could allow no interference . 
He revered and respected her above all living beings ; but he would have said it all the same to the virgin Mary herself , if she had come in the way of his system . 
`` I used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with him , -- endeavoring to excite his sympathies . 
He would listen to the most pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity . 
` It all resolves itself into this , ' he would say ; ` must I part with Stubbs , or keep him ? 
Stubbs is the soul of punctuality , honesty , and efficiency , -- a thorough business hand , and as humane as the general run . 
We ca n't have perfection ; and if I keep him , I must sustain his administration as a whole , even if there are , now and then , things that are exceptionable . 
All government includes some necessary hardness . 
General rules will bear hard on particular cases . ' 
This last maxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of cruelty . 
After he had said that , he commonly drew up his feet on the sofa , like a man that has disposed of a business , and betook himself to a nap , or the newspaper , as the case might be . 
`` The fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman . 
He could have divided Poland as easily as an orange , or trod on Ireland as quietly and systematically as any man living . 
At last my mother gave up , in despair . 
It never will be known , till the last account , what noble and sensitive natures like hers have felt , cast , utterly helpless , into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty , and which seems so to nobody about them . 
It has been an age of long sorrow of such natures , in such a hell-begotten sort of world as ours . 
What remained for her , but to train her children in her own views and sentiments ? 
Well , after all you say about training , children will grow up substantially what they are by nature , and only that . 
From the cradle , Alfred was an aristocrat ; and as he grew up , instinctively , all his sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line , and all mother 's exhortations went to the winds . 
As to me , they sunk deep into me . 
She never contradicted , in form , anything my father said , or seemed directly to differ from him ; but she impressed , burnt into my very soul , with all the force of her deep , earnest nature , an idea of the dignity and worth of the meanest human soul . 
I have looked in her face with solemn awe , when she would point up to the stars in the evening , and say to me , ` See there , Auguste ! 
the poorest , meanest soul on our place will be living , when all these stars are gone forever , -- will live as long as God lives ! ' 
`` She had some fine old paintings ; one , in particular , of Jesus healing a blind man . 
They were very fine , and used to impress me strongly . 
` See there , Auguste , ' she would say ; ` the blind man was a beggar , poor and loathsome ; therefore , he would not heal him afar off ! 
He called him to him , and put his hands on him ! 
Remember this , my boy . ' 
If I had lived to grow up under her care , she might have stimulated me to I know not what of enthusiasm . 
I might have been a saint , reformer , martyr , -- but , alas ! 
alas ! 
I went from her when I was only thirteen , and I never saw her again ! '' 
St. Clare rested his head on his hands , and did not speak for some minutes . 
After a while , he looked up , and went on : `` What poor , mean trash this whole business of human virtue is ! 
A mere matter , for the most part , of latitude and longitude , and geographical position , acting with natural temperament . 
The greater part is nothing but an accident ! 
Your father , for example , settles in Vermont , in a town where all are , in fact , free and equal ; becomes a regular church member and deacon , and in due time joins an Abolition society , and thinks us all little better than heathens . 
Yet he is , for all the world , in constitution and habit , a duplicate of my father . 
I can see it leaking out in fifty different ways , -- just the same strong , overbearing , dominant spirit . 
You know very well how impossible it is to persuade some of the folks in your village that Squire Sinclair does not feel above them . 
The fact is , though he has fallen on democratic times , and embraced a democratic theory , he is to the heart an aristocrat , as much as my father , who ruled over five or six hundred slaves . '' 
Miss Ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture , and was laying down her knitting to begin , but St. Clare stopped her . 
`` Now , I know every word you are going to say . 
I do not say they were alike , in fact . 
One fell into a condition where everything acted against the natural tendency , and the other where everything acted for it ; and so one turned out a pretty wilful , stout , overbearing old democrat , and the other a wilful , stout old despot . 
If both had owned plantations in Louisiana , they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould . '' 
`` What an undutiful boy you are ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I do n't mean them any disrespect , '' said St. Clare . 
`` You know reverence is not my forte . 
But , to go back to my history : `` When father died , he left the whole property to us twin boys , to be divided as we should agree . 
There does not breathe on God 's earth a nobler-souled , more generous fellow , than Alfred , in all that concerns his equals ; and we got on admirably with this property question , without a single unbrotherly word or feeling . 
We undertook to work the plantation together ; and Alfred , whose outward life and capabilities had double the strength of mine , became an enthusiastic planter , and a wonderfully successful one . 
`` But two years ' trial satisfied me that I could not be a partner in that matter . 
To have a great gang of seven hundred , whom I could not know personally , or feel any individual interest in , bought and driven , housed , fed , worked like so many horned cattle , strained up to military precision , -- the question of how little of life 's commonest enjoyments would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring problem , -- the necessity of drivers and overseers , -- the ever-necessary whip , first , last , and only argument , -- the whole thing was insufferably disgusting and loathsome to me ; and when I thought of my mother 's estimate of one poor human soul , it became even frightful ! 
`` It 's all nonsense to talk to me about slaves enjoying all this ! 
To this day , I have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of your patronizing Northerners have made up , as in their zeal to apologize for our sins . 
We all know better . 
Tell me that any man living wants to work all his days , from day-dawn till dark , under the constant eye of a master , without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition , on the same dreary , monotonous , unchanging toil , and all for two pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year , with enough food and shelter to keep him in working order ! 
Any man who thinks that human beings can , as a general thing , be made about as comfortable that way as any other , I wish he might try it . 
I 'd buy the dog , and work him , with a clear conscience ! '' 
`` I always have supposed , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` that you , all of you , approved of these things , and thought them right -- according to Scripture . '' 
`` Humbug ! 
We are not quite reduced to that yet . 
Alfred who is as determined a despot as ever walked , does not pretend to this kind of defence ; -- no , he stands , high and haughty , on that good old respectable ground , the right of the strongest ; and he says , and I think quite sensibly , that the American planter is ` only doing , in another form , what the English aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower classes ; ' that is , I take it , appropriating them , body and bone , soul and spirit , to their use and convenience . 
He defends both , -- and I think , at least , consistently . 
He says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses , either nominal or real . 
There must , he says , be a lower class , given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature ; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement , and becomes the directing soul of the lower . 
So he reasons , because , as I said , he is born an aristocrat ; -- so I do n't believe , because I was born a democrat . '' 
`` How in the world can the two things be compared ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` The English laborer is not sold , traded , parted from his family , whipped . '' 
`` He is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him . 
The slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death , -- the capitalist can starve him to death . 
As to family security , it is hard to say which is the worst , -- to have one 's children sold , or see them starve to death at home . '' 
`` But it 's no kind of apology for slavery , to prove that it is n't worse than some other bad thing . '' 
`` I did n't give it for one , -- nay , I 'll say , besides , that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights ; actually buying a man up , like a horse , -- looking at his teeth , cracking his joints , and trying his paces and then paying down for him , -- having speculators , breeders , traders , and brokers in human bodies and souls , -- sets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form , though the thing done be , after all , in its nature , the same ; that is , appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own . '' 
`` I never thought of the matter in this light , '' said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Well , I 've travelled in England some , and I 've looked over a good many documents as to the state of their lower classes ; and I really think there is no denying Alfred , when he says that his slaves are better off than a large class of the population of England . 
You see , you must not infer , from what I have told you , that Alfred is what is called a hard master ; for he is n't . 
He is despotic , and unmerciful to insubordination ; he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he would shoot a buck , if he opposed him . 
But , in general , he takes a sort of pride in having his slaves comfortably fed and accommodated . 
`` When I was with him , I insisted that he should do something for their instruction ; and , to please me , he did get a chaplain , and used to have them catechized Sunday , though , I believe , in his heart , that he thought it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dogs and horses . 
And the fact is , that a mind stupefied and animalized by every bad influence from the hour of birth , spending the whole of every week-day in unreflecting toil , can not be done much with by a few hours on Sunday . 
The teachers of Sunday-schools among the manufacturing population of England , and among plantation-hands in our country , could perhaps testify to the same result , there and here . 
Yet some striking exceptions there are among us , from the fact that the negro is naturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white . '' 
`` Well , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` how came you to give up your plantation life ? '' 
`` Well , we jogged on together some time , till Alfred saw plainly that I was no planter . 
He thought it absurd , after he had reformed , and altered , and improved everywhere , to suit my notions , that I still remained unsatisfied . 
The fact was , it was , after all , the THING that I hated -- the using these men and women , the perpetuation of all this ignorance , brutality and vice , -- just to make money for me ! 
`` Besides , I was always interfering in the details . 
Being myself one of the laziest of mortals , I had altogether too much fellow-feeling for the lazy ; and when poor , shiftless dogs put stones at the bottom of their cotton-baskets to make them weigh heavier , or filled their sacks with dirt , with cotton at the top , it seemed so exactly like what I should do if I were they , I could n't and would n't have them flogged for it . 
Well , of course , there was an end of plantation discipline ; and Alf and I came to about the same point that I and my respected father did , years before . 
So he told me that I was a womanish sentimentalist , and would never do for business life ; and advised me to take the bank-stock and the New Orleans family mansion , and go to writing poetry , and let him manage the plantation . 
So we parted , and I came here . '' 
`` But why did n't you free your slaves ? '' 
`` Well , I was n't up to that . 
To hold them as tools for money-making , I could not ; -- have them to help spend money , you know , did n't look quite so ugly to me . 
Some of them were old house-servants , to whom I was much attached ; and the younger ones were children to the old . 
All were well satisfied to be as they were . '' 
He paused , and walked reflectively up and down the room . 
`` There was , '' said St. Clare , `` a time in my life when I had plans and hopes of doing something in this world , more than to float and drift . 
I had vague , indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator , -- to free my native land from this spot and stain . 
All young men have had such fever-fits , I suppose , some time , -- but then -- '' `` Why did n't you ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia ; -- `` you ought not to put your hand to the plough , and look back . '' 
`` O , well , things did n't go with me as I expected , and I got the despair of living that Solomon did . 
I suppose it was a necessary incident to wisdom in us both ; but , some how or other , instead of being actor and regenerator in society , I became a piece of driftwood , and have been floating and eddying about , ever since . 
Alfred scolds me , every time we meet ; and he has the better of me , I grant , -- for he really does something ; his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a contemptible non sequitur . '' 
`` My dear cousin , can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation ? '' 
`` Satisfied ! 
Was I not just telling you I despised it ? 
But , then , to come back to this point , -- we were on this liberation business . 
I do n't think my feelings about slavery are peculiar . 
I find many men who , in their hearts , think of it just as I do . 
The land groans under it ; and , bad as it is for the slave , it is worse , if anything , for the master . 
It takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious , improvident , degraded people , among us , are an evil to us , as well as to themselves . 
The capitalist and aristocrat of England can not feel that as we do , because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do . 
They are in our homes ; they are the associates of our children , and they form their minds faster than we can ; for they are a race that children always will cling to and assimilate with . 
If Eva , now , was not more angel than ordinary , she would be ruined . 
We might as well allow the small-pox to run among them , and think our children would not take it , as to let them be uninstructed and vicious , and think our children will not be affected by that . 
Yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system , and they do it wisely , too ; for , just begin and thoroughly educate one generation , and the whole thing would be blown sky high . 
If we did not give them liberty , they would take it . '' 
`` And what do you think will be the end of this ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` I do n't know . 
One thing is certain , -- that there is a mustering among the masses , the world over ; and there is a dies iræ coming on , sooner or later . 
The same thing is working in Europe , in England , and in this country . 
My mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming , when Christ should reign , and all men should be free and happy . 
And she taught me , when I was a boy , to pray , ` thy kingdom come . ' 
Sometimes I think all this sighing , and groaning , and stirring among the dry bones foretells what she used to tell me was coming . 
But who may abide the day of His appearing ? '' 
`` Augustine , sometimes I think you are not far from the kingdom , '' said Miss Ophelia , laying down her knitting , and looking anxiously at her cousin . 
`` Thank you for your good opinion , but it 's up and down with me , -- up to heaven 's gate in theory , down in earth 's dust in practice . 
But there 's the teabell , -- do let 's go , -- and do n't say , now , I have n't had one downright serious talk , for once in my life . '' 
At table , Marie alluded to the incident of Prue . 
`` I suppose you 'll think , cousin , '' she said , `` that we are all barbarians . '' 
`` I think that 's a barbarous thing , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` but I do n't think you are all barbarians . '' 
`` Well , now , '' said Marie , `` I know it 's impossible to get along with some of these creatures . 
They are so bad they ought not to live . 
I do n't feel a particle of sympathy for such cases . 
If they 'd only behave themselves , it would not happen . '' 
`` But , mamma , '' said Eva , `` the poor creature was unhappy ; that 's what made her drink . '' 
`` O , fiddlestick ! 
as if that were any excuse ! 
I 'm unhappy , very often . 
I presume , '' she said , pensively , `` that I 've had greater trials than ever she had . 
It 's just because they are so bad . 
There 's some of them that you can not break in by any kind of severity . 
I remember father had a man that was so lazy he would run away just to get rid of work , and lie round in the swamps , stealing and doing all sorts of horrid things . 
That man was caught and whipped , time and again , and it never did him any good ; and the last time he crawled off , though he could n't but just go , and died in the swamp . 
There was no sort of reason for it , for father 's hands were always treated kindly . '' 
`` I broke a fellow in , once , '' said St. Clare , `` that all the overseers and masters had tried their hands on in vain . '' 
`` You ! '' 
said Marie ; `` well , I 'd be glad to know when you ever did anything of the sort . '' 
`` Well , he was a powerful , gigantic fellow , -- a native-born African ; and he appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon degree . 
He was a regular African lion . 
They called him Scipio . 
Nobody could do anything with him ; and he was sold round from overseer to overseer , till at last Alfred bought him , because he thought he could manage him . 
Well , one day he knocked down the overseer , and was fairly off into the swamps . 
I was on a visit to Alf 's plantation , for it was after we had dissolved partnership . 
Alfred was greatly exasperated ; but I told him that it was his own fault , and laid him any wager that I could break the man ; and finally it was agreed that , if I caught him , I should have him to experiment on . 
So they mustered out a party of some six or seven , with guns and dogs , for the hunt . 
People , you know , can get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer , if it is only customary ; in fact , I got a little excited myself , though I had only put in as a sort of mediator , in case he was caught . 
`` Well , the dogs bayed and howled , and we rode and scampered , and finally we started him . 
He ran and bounded like a buck , and kept us well in the rear for some time ; but at last he got caught in an impenetrable thicket of cane ; then he turned to bay , and I tell you he fought the dogs right gallantly . 
He dashed them to right and left , and actually killed three of them with only his naked fists , when a shot from a gun brought him down , and he fell , wounded and bleeding , almost at my feet . 
The poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his eye . 
I kept back the dogs and the party , as they came pressing up , and claimed him as my prisoner . 
It was all I could do to keep them from shooting him , in the flush of success ; but I persisted in my bargain , and Alfred sold him to me . 
Well , I took him in hand , and in one fortnight I had him tamed down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire . '' 
`` What in the world did you do to him ? '' 
said Marie . 
`` Well , it was quite a simple process . 
I took him to my own room , had a good bed made for him , dressed his wounds , and tended him myself , until he got fairly on his feet again . 
And , in process of time , I had free papers made out for him , and told him he might go where he liked . '' 
`` And did he go ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` No . 
The foolish fellow tore the paper in two , and absolutely refused to leave me . 
I never had a braver , better fellow , -- trusty and true as steel . 
He embraced Christianity afterwards , and became as gentle as a child . 
He used to oversee my place on the lake , and did it capitally , too . 
I lost him the first cholera season . 
In fact , he laid down his life for me . 
For I was sick , almost to death ; and when , through the panic , everybody else fled , Scipio worked for me like a giant , and actually brought me back into life again . 
But , poor fellow ! 
he was taken , right after , and there was no saving him . 
I never felt anybody 's loss more . '' 
Eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father , as he told the story , -- her small lips apart , her eyes wide and earnest with absorbing interest . 
As he finished , she suddenly threw her arms around his neck , burst into tears , and sobbed convulsively . 
`` Eva , dear child ! 
what is the matter ? '' 
said St. Clare , as the child 's small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feelings . 
`` This child , '' he added , `` ought not to hear any of this kind of thing , -- she 's nervous . '' 
`` No , papa , I 'm not nervous , '' said Eva , controlling herself , suddenly , with a strength of resolution singular in such a child . 
`` I 'm not nervous , but these things sink into my heart . '' 
`` What do you mean , Eva ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you , papa , I think a great many thoughts . 
Perhaps some day I shall tell you . '' 
`` Well , think away , dear , -- only do n't cry and worry your papa , '' said St. Clare , `` Look here , -- see what a beautiful peach I have got for you . '' 
Eva took it and smiled , though there was still a nervous twiching about the corners of her mouth . 
`` Come , look at the gold-fish , '' said St. Clare , taking her hand and stepping on to the verandah . 
A few moments , and merry laughs were heard through the silken curtains , as Eva and St. Clare were pelting each other with roses , and chasing each other among the alleys of the court . 
There is danger that our humble friend Tom be neglected amid the adventures of the higher born ; but , if our readers will accompany us up to a little loft over the stable , they may , perhaps , learn a little of his affairs . 
It was a decent room , containing a bed , a chair , and a small , rough stand , where lay Tom 's Bible and hymn-book ; and where he sits , at present , with his slate before him , intent on something that seems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought . 
The fact was , that Tom 's home-yearnings had become so strong that he had begged a sheet of writing-paper of Eva , and , mustering up all his small stock of literary attainment acquired by Mas ' r George 's instructions , he conceived the bold idea of writing a letter ; and he was busy now , on his slate , getting out his first draft . 
Tom was in a good deal of trouble , for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely ; and of what he did remember , he did not know exactly which to use . 
And while he was working , and breathing very hard , in his earnestness , Eva alighted , like a bird , on the round of his chair behind him , and peeped over his shoulder . 
`` O , Uncle Tom ! 
what funny things you are making , there ! '' 
`` I 'm trying to write to my poor old woman , Miss Eva , and my little chil ` en , '' said Tom , drawing the back of his hand over his eyes ; `` but , some how , I 'm feard I sha n't make it out . '' 
`` I wish I could help you , Tom ! 
I 've learnt to write some . 
Last year I could make all the letters , but I 'm afraid I 've forgotten . '' 
So Eva put her golden head close to his , and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion , each one equally earnest , and about equally ignorant ; and , with a deal of consulting and advising over every word , the composition began , as they both felt very sanguine , to look quite like writing . 
`` Yes , Uncle Tom , it really begins to look beautiful , '' said Eva , gazing delightedly on it . 
`` How pleased your wife 'll be , and the poor little children ! 
O , it 's a shame you ever had to go away from them ! 
I mean to ask papa to let you go back , some time . '' 
`` Missis said that she would send down money for me , as soon as they could get it together , '' said Tom . 
`` I 'm ` spectin , she will . 
Young Mas ' r George , he said he 'd come for me ; and he gave me this yer dollar as a sign ; '' and Tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar . 
`` O , he 'll certainly come , then ! '' 
said Eva . 
`` I 'm so glad ! '' 
`` And I wanted to send a letter , you know , to let 'em know whar I was , and tell poor Chloe that I was well off , -- cause she felt so drefful , poor soul ! '' 
`` I say Tom ! '' 
said St. Clare 's voice , coming in the door at this moment . 
Tom and Eva both started . 
`` What 's here ? '' 
said St. Clare , coming up and looking at the slate . 
`` O , it 's Tom 's letter . 
I 'm helping him to write it , '' said Eva ; `` is n't it nice ? '' 
`` I would n't discourage either of you , '' said St. Clare , `` but I rather think , Tom , you 'd better get me to write your letter for you . 
I 'll do it , when I come home from my ride . '' 
`` It 's very important he should write , '' said Eva , `` because his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him , you know , papa ; he told me they told him so . '' 
St. Clare thought , in his heart , that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants , to alleviate their horror of being sold , without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited . 
But he did not make any audible comment upon it , -- only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride . 
Tom 's letter was written in due form for him that evening , and safely lodged in the post-office . 
Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line . 
It was universally agreed , among all the household , from Dinah down to the youngest urchin , that Miss Ophelia was decidedly `` curis , '' -- a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters do n't exactly suit them . 
The higher circle in the family -- to wit , Adolph , Jane and Rosa -- agreed that she was no lady ; ladies never keep working about as she did , -- that she had no air at all ; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares . 
Even Marie declared that it was absolutely fatiguing to see Cousin Ophelia always so busy . 
And , in fact , Miss Ophelia 's industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the complaint . 
She sewed and stitched away , from daylight till dark , with the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency ; and then , when the light faded , and the work was folded away , with one turn out came the ever-ready knitting-work , and there she was again , going on as briskly as ever . 
It really was a labor to see her . 
One morning , while Miss Ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares , St. Clare 's voice was heard , calling her at the foot of the stairs . 
`` Come down here , Cousin , I 've something to show you . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , coming down , with her sewing in her hand . 
`` I 've made a purchase for your department , -- see here , '' said St. Clare ; and , with the word , he pulled along a little negro girl , about eight or nine years of age . 
She was one of the blackest of her race ; and her round shining eyes , glittering as glass beads , moved with quick and restless glances over everything in the room . 
Her mouth , half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new Mas ` r 's parlor , displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth . 
Her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails , which stuck out in every direction . 
The expression of her face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning , over which was oddly drawn , like a kind of veil , an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity . 
She was dressed in a single filthy , ragged garment , made of bagging ; and stood with her hands demurely folded before her . 
Altogether , there was something odd and goblin-like about her appearance , -- something , as Miss Ophelia afterwards said , `` so heathenish , '' as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay ; and turning to St. Clare , she said , `` Augustine , what in the world have you brought that thing here for ? '' 
`` For you to educate , to be sure , and train in the way she should go . 
I thought she was rather a funny specimen in the Jim Crow line . 
Here , Topsy , '' he added , giving a whistle , as a man would to call the attention of a dog , `` give us a song , now , and show us some of your dancing . '' 
The black , glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery , and the thing struck up , in a clear shrill voice , an odd negro melody , to which she kept time with her hands and feet , spinning round , clapping her hands , knocking her knees together , in a wild , fantastic sort of time , and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the native music of her race ; and finally , turning a summerset or two , and giving a prolonged closing note , as odd and unearthly as that of a steam-whistle , she came suddenly down on the carpet , and stood with her hands folded , and a most sanctimonious expression of meekness and solemnity over her face , only broken by the cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes . 
Miss Ophelia stood silent , perfectly paralyzed with amazement . 
St. Clare , like a mischievous fellow as he was , appeared to enjoy her astonishment ; and , addressing the child again , said , `` Topsy , this is your new mistress . 
I 'm going to give you up to her ; see now that you behave yourself . '' 
`` Yes , Mas ` r , '' said Topsy , with sanctimonious gravity , her wicked eyes twinkling as she spoke . 
`` You 're going to be good , Topsy , you understand , '' said St. Clare . 
`` O yes , Mas ` r , '' said Topsy , with another twinkle , her hands still devoutly folded . 
`` Now , Augustine , what upon earth is this for ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Your house is so full of these little plagues , now , that a body ca n't set down their foot without treading on 'em . 
I get up in the morning , and find one asleep behind the door , and see one black head poking out from under the table , one lying on the door-mat , -- and they are mopping and mowing and grinning between all the railings , and tumbling over the kitchen floor ! 
What on earth did you want to bring this one for ? '' 
`` For you to educate -- did n't I tell you ? 
You 're always preaching about educating . 
I thought I would make you a present of a fresh-caught specimen , and let you try your hand on her , and bring her up in the way she should go . '' '' 
I do n't want her , I am sure ; -- I have more to do with 'em now than I want to . '' 
`` That 's you Christians , all over ! 
-- you 'll get up a society , and get some poor missionary to spend all his days among just such heathen . 
But let me see one of you that would take one into your house with you , and take the labor of their conversion on yourselves ! 
No ; when it comes to that , they are dirty and disagreeable , and it 's too much care , and so on . '' 
`` Augustine , you know I did n't think of it in that light , '' said Miss Ophelia , evidently softening . 
`` Well , it might be a real missionary work , '' said she , looking rather more favorably on the child . 
St. Clare had touched the right string . 
Miss Ophelia 's conscientiousness was ever on the alert . 
`` But , '' she added , `` I really did n't see the need of buying this one ; -- there are enough now , in your house , to take all my time and skill . '' 
`` Well , then , Cousin , '' said St. Clare , drawing her aside , `` I ought to beg your pardon for my good-for-nothing speeches . 
You are so good , after all , that there 's no sense in them . 
Why , the fact is , this concern belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low restaurant that I have to pass by every day , and I was tired of hearing her screaming , and them beating and swearing at her . 
She looked bright and funny , too , as if something might be made of her ; -- so I bought her , and I 'll give her to you . 
Try , now , and give her a good orthodox New England bringing up , and see what it 'll make of her . 
You know I have n't any gift that way ; but I 'd like you to try . '' 
`` Well , I 'll do what I can , '' said Miss Ophelia ; and she approached her new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider , supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it . 
`` She 's dreadfully dirty , and half naked , '' she said . 
`` Well , take her down stairs , and make some of them clean and clothe her up . '' 
Miss Ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions . 
`` Do n't see what Mas ' r St. Clare wants of ` nother nigger ! '' 
said Dinah , surveying the new arrival with no friendly air . 
`` Wo n't have her around under my feet , I know ! '' 
`` Pah ! '' 
said Rosa and Jane , with supreme disgust ; `` let her keep out of our way ! 
What in the world Mas ' r wanted another of these low niggers for , I ca n't see ! '' 
`` You go long ! 
No more nigger dan you be , Miss Rosa , '' said Dinah , who felt this last remark a reflection on herself . 
`` You seem to tink yourself white folks . 
You a n't nerry one , black nor white , I 'd like to be one or turrer . '' 
Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival ; and so she was forced to do it herself , with some very ungracious and reluctant assistance from Jane . 
It is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of a neglected , abused child . 
In fact , in this world , multitudes must live and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of their fellow-mortals even to hear described . 
Miss Ophelia had a good , strong , practical deal of resolution ; and she went through all the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness , though , it must be confessed , with no very gracious air , -- for endurance was the utmost to which her principles could bring her . 
When she saw , on the back and shoulders of the child , great welts and calloused spots , ineffaceable marks of the system under which she had grown up thus far , her heart became pitiful within her . 
`` See there ! '' 
said Jane , pointing to the marks , `` do n't that show she 's a limb ? 
We 'll have fine works with her , I reckon . 
I hate these nigger young uns ! 
so disgusting ! 
I wonder that Mas ' r would buy her ! '' 
The `` young un '' alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her , only scanning , with a keen and furtive glance of her flickering eyes , the ornaments which Jane wore in her ears . 
When arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing , her hair cropped short to her head , Miss Ophelia , with some satisfaction , said she looked more Christian-like than she did , and in her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction . 
Sitting down before her , she began to question her . 
`` How old are you , Topsy ? '' 
`` Dun no , Missis , '' said the image , with a grin that showed all her teeth . 
`` Do n't know how old you are ? 
Did n't anybody ever tell you ? 
Who was your mother ? '' 
`` Never had none ! '' 
said the child , with another grin . 
`` Never had any mother ? 
What do you mean ? 
Where were you born ? '' 
`` Never was born ! '' 
persisted Topsy , with another grin , that looked so goblin-like , that , if Miss Ophelia had been at all nervous , she might have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land of Diablerie ; but Miss Ophelia was not nervous , but plain and business-like , and she said , with some sternness , `` You must n't answer me in that way , child ; I 'm not playing with you . 
Tell me where you were born , and who your father and mother were . '' 
`` Never was born , '' reiterated the creature , more emphatically ; `` never had no father nor mother , nor nothin ' . 
I was raised by a speculator , with lots of others . 
Old Aunt Sue used to take car on us . '' 
The child was evidently sincere , and Jane , breaking into a short laugh , said , `` Laws , Missis , there 's heaps of 'em . 
Speculators buys 'em up cheap , when they 's little , and gets 'em raised for market . '' 
`` How long have you lived with your master and mistress ? '' 
`` Dun no , Missis . '' 
`` Is it a year , or more , or less ? '' 
`` Dun no , Missis . '' 
`` Laws , Missis , those low negroes , -- they ca n't tell ; they do n't know anything about time , '' said Jane ; `` they do n't know what a year is ; they do n't know their own ages . 
`` Have you ever heard anything about God , Topsy ? '' 
The child looked bewildered , but grinned as usual . 
`` Do you know who made you ? '' 
`` Nobody , as I knows on , '' said the child , with a short laugh . 
The idea appeared to amuse her considerably ; for her eyes twinkled , and she added , `` I spect I grow 'd . 
Do n't think nobody never made me . '' 
`` Do you know how to sew ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia , who thought she would turn her inquiries to something more tangible . 
`` No , Missis . '' 
`` What can you do ? 
-- what did you do for your master and mistress ? '' 
`` Fetch water , and wash dishes , and rub knives , and wait on folks . '' 
`` Were they good to you ? '' 
`` Spect they was , '' said the child , scanning Miss Ophelia cunningly . 
Miss Ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy ; St. Clare was leaning over the back of her chair . 
`` You find virgin soil there , Cousin ; put in your own ideas , -- you wo n't find many to pull up . '' 
Miss Ophelia 's ideas of education , like all her other ideas , were very set and definite ; and of the kind that prevailed in New England a century ago , and which are still preserved in some very retired and unsophisticated parts , where there are no railroads . 
As nearly as could be expressed , they could be comprised in very few words : to teach them to mind when they were spoken to ; to teach them the catechism , sewing , and reading ; and to whip them if they told lies . 
And though , of course , in the flood of light that is now poured on education , these are left far away in the rear , yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers raised some tolerably fair men and women under this regime , as many of us can remember and testify . 
At all events , Miss Ophelia knew of nothing else to do ; and , therefore , applied her mind to her heathen with the best diligence she could command . 
The child was announced and considered in the family as Miss Ophelia 's girl ; and , as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen , Miss Ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction chiefly to her own chamber . 
With a self-sacrifice which some of our readers will appreciate , she resolved , instead of comfortably making her own bed , sweeping and dusting her own chamber , -- which she had hitherto done , in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the establishment , -- to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing Topsy to perform these operations , -- ah , woe the day ! 
Did any of our readers ever do the same , they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice . 
Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber , the first morning , and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making . 
Behold , then , Topsy , washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted , arrayed in a clean gown , with well-starched apron , standing reverently before Miss Ophelia , with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral . 
`` Now , Topsy , I 'm going to show you just how my bed is to be made . 
I am very particular about my bed . 
You must learn exactly how to do it . '' 
`` Yes , ma'am , '' says Topsy , with a deep sigh , and a face of woful earnestness . 
`` Now , Topsy , look here ; -- this is the hem of the sheet , -- this is the right side of the sheet , and this is the wrong ; -- will you remember ? '' 
`` Yes , ma'am , '' says Topsy , with another sigh . 
`` Well , now , the under sheet you must bring over the bolster , -- so -- and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth , -- so , -- do you see ? '' 
`` Yes , ma'am , '' said Topsy , with profound attention . 
`` But the upper sheet , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` must be brought down in this way , and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot , -- so , -- the narrow hem at the foot . '' 
`` Yes , ma'am , '' said Topsy , as before ; -- but we will add , what Miss Ophelia did not see , that , during the time when the good lady 's back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations , the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon , which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves , and stood with her hands dutifully folded , as before . 
`` Now , Topsy , let 's see you do this , '' said Miss Ophelia , pulling off the clothes , and seating herself . 
Topsy , with great gravity and adroitness , went through the exercise completely to Miss Ophelia 's satisfaction ; smoothing the sheets , patting out every wrinkle , and exhibiting , through the whole process , a gravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified . 
By an unlucky slip , however , a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her sleeves , just as she was finishing , and caught Miss Ophelia 's attention . 
Instantly , she pounced upon it . 
`` What 's this ? 
You naughty , wicked child , -- you 've been stealing this ! '' 
The ribbon was pulled out of Topsy 's own sleeve , yet was she not in the least disconcerted ; she only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence . 
`` Laws ! 
why , that ar 's Miss Feely 's ribbon , a n't it ? 
How could it a got caught in my sleeve ? 
`` Topsy , you naughty girl , do n't you tell me a lie , -- you stole that ribbon ! '' 
`` Missis , I declar for ` t , I did n't ; -- never seed it till dis yer blessed minnit . '' 
`` Topsy , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` do n't you know it 's wicked to tell lies ? '' 
`` I never tell no lies , Miss Feely , '' said Topsy , with virtuous gravity ; `` it 's jist the truth I 've been a tellin now , and a n't nothin else . '' 
`` Topsy , I shall have to whip you , if you tell lies so . '' 
`` Laws , Missis , if you 's to whip all day , could n't say no other way , '' said Topsy , beginning to blubber . 
`` I never seed dat ar , -- it must a got caught in my sleeve . 
Miss Feeley must have left it on the bed , and it got caught in the clothes , and so got in my sleeve . '' 
Miss Ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie , that she caught the child and shook her . 
`` Do n't you tell me that again ! '' 
The shake brought the glove on to the floor , from the other sleeve . 
`` There , you ! '' 
said Miss Ophelia , `` will you tell me now , you did n't steal the ribbon ? '' 
Topsy now confessed to the gloves , but still persisted in denying the ribbon . 
`` Now , Topsy , '' said Miss Ophelia , `` if you 'll confess all about it , I wo n't whip you this time . '' 
Thus adjured , Topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves , with woful protestations of penitence . 
`` Well , now , tell me . 
I know you must have taken other things since you have been in the house , for I let you run about all day yesterday . 
Now , tell me if you took anything , and I sha n't whip you . '' 
`` Laws , Missis ! 
I took Miss Eva 's red thing she wars on her neck . '' 
`` You did , you naughty child ! 
-- Well , what else ? '' 
`` I took Rosa 's yer-rings , -- them red ones . '' 
`` Go bring them to me this minute , both of 'em . '' 
`` Laws , Missis ! 
I ca n't , -- they 's burnt up ! '' 
`` Burnt up ! 
-- what a story ! 
Go get 'em , or I 'll whip you . '' 
Topsy , with loud protestations , and tears , and groans , declared that she could not . 
`` They 's burnt up , -- they was . '' 
`` What did you burn 'em for ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Cause I 's wicked , -- I is . 
I 's mighty wicked , any how . 
I ca n't help it . '' 
Just at this moment , Eva came innocently into the room , with the identical coral necklace on her neck . 
`` Why , Eva , where did you get your necklace ? '' 
said Miss Ophelia . 
`` Get it ? 
Why , I 've had it on all day , '' said Eva . 
`` Did you have it on yesterday ? '' 
`` Yes ; and what is funny , Aunty , I had it on all night . 
I forgot to take it off when I went to bed . '' 
Miss Ophelia looked perfectly bewildered ; the more so , as Rosa , at that instant , came into the room , with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised on her head , and the coral ear-drops shaking in her ears ! 
`` I 'm sure I ca n't tell anything what to do with such a child ! '' 
she said , in despair . 
`` What in the world did you tell me you took those things for , Topsy ? '' 
`` Why , Missis said I must ` fess ; and I could n't think of nothin ' else to ` fess , '' said Topsy , rubbing her eyes . 
`` But , of course , I did n't want you to confess things you did n't do , '' said Miss Ophelia ; `` that 's telling a lie , just as much as the other . '' 
`` Laws , now , is it ? '' 
said Topsy , with an air of innocent wonder . 
`` La , there a n't any such thing as truth in that limb , '' said Rosa , looking indignantly at Topsy . 
`` If I was Mas ' r St. Clare , I 'd whip her till the blood run . 
I would , -- I 'd let her catch it ! '' 
`` No , no Rosa , '' said Eva , with an air of command , which the child could assume at times ; `` you must n't talk so , Rosa . 
I ca n't bear to hear it . '' 
`` La sakes ! 
Miss Eva , you 's so good , you do n't know nothing how to get along with niggers . 
There 's no way but to cut 'em well up , I tell ye . '' 
`` Rosa ! '' 
said Eva , `` hush ! 
Do n't you say another word of that sort ! '' 
and the eye of the child flashed , and her cheek deepened its color . 
Rosa was cowed in a moment . 
`` Miss Eva has got the St. Clare blood in her , that 's plain . 
She can speak , for all the world , just like her papa , '' she said , as she passed out of the room . 
Eva stood looking at Topsy . 
There stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of society . 
The fair , high-bred child , with her golden head , her deep eyes , her spiritual , noble brow , and prince-like movements ; and her black , keen , subtle , cringing , yet acute neighbor .
