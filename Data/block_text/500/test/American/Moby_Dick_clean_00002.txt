This young fellow 's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he can not have been three days landed from his Indian voyage . 
That man next him looks a few shades lighter ; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him . 
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore . 
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg ? 
which , barred with various tints , seemed like the Andes ' western slope , to show forth in one array , contrasting climates , zone by zone . 
`` Grub , ho ! '' 
now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast . 
They say that men who have seen the world , thereby become quite at ease in manner , quite self-possessed in company . 
Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor . 
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of Africa , which was the sum of poor Mungo 's performances -- this kind of travel , I say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish . 
Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere . 
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence . 
And not only that , but they looked embarrassed . 
Yes , here were a set of sea-dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas -- entire strangers to them -- and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table -- all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes -- looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains . 
A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen ! 
But as for Queequeg -- why , Queequeg sat there among them -- at the head of the table , too , it so chanced ; as cool as an icicle . 
To be sure I can not say much for his breeding . 
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him . 
But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people 's estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly . 
We will not speak of all Queequeg 's peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare . 
Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk-pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll . 
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford . 
In thoroughfares nigh the docks , any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts . 
Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets , Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies . 
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays ; and at Bombay , in the Apollo Green , live Yankees have often scared the natives . 
But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping . 
In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh . 
It makes a stranger stare . 
But , besides the Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs , Erromanggoans , Pannangians , and Brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical . 
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery . 
They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance . 
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came . 
In some things you would think them but a few hours old . 
Look there ! 
that chap strutting round the corner . 
He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat , girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife . 
Here comes another with a sou ' - wester and a bombazine cloak . 
No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one -- I mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog-days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands . 
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale-fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport . 
In bespeaking his sea-outfit , he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers . 
Ah , poor Hay-Seed ! 
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest . 
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . 
Not at all . 
Still New Bedford is a queer place . 
Had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador . 
As it is , parts of her back country are enough to frighten one , they look so bony . 
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England . 
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine . 
The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs . 
Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in New Bedford . 
Whence came they ? 
how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ? 
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered . 
Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans . 
One and all , they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea . 
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ? 
In New Bedford , fathers , they say , give whales for dowers to their daughters , and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece . 
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles . 
In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold . 
And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts , candelabra-wise , proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . 
So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation 's final day . 
And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses . 
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens . 
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye can not , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands . 
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman 's Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot . 
I am sure that I did not . 
Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand . 
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist . 
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , I fought my way against the stubborn storm . 
Entering , I found a small scattered congregation of sailors , and sailors ' wives and widows . 
A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm . 
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable . 
The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit . 
Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to quote : -- SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT , Who , at the age of eighteen , was lost overboard , Near the Isle of Desolation , off Patagonia , November 1st , 1836 . 
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER . 
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG , WILLIS ELLERY , NATHAN COLEMAN , WALTER CANNY , SETH MACY , AND SAMUEL GLEIG , Forming one of the boats ' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale , On the Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC , December 31st , 1839 . 
THIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES . 
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY , Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan , AUGUST 3d , 1833 . 
THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW . 
Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me . 
Affected by the solemnity of the scene , there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance . 
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall . 
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh . 
Oh ! 
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass ; who standing among flowers can say -- here , HERE lies my beloved ; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these . 
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes ! 
What despair in those immovable inscriptions ! 
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave . 
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here . 
In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city . 
All these things are not without their meanings . 
But Faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope . 
It needs scarcely to be told , with what feelings , on the eve of a Nantucket voyage , I regarded those marble tablets , and by the murky light of that darkened , doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me . 
Yes , Ishmael , the same fate may be thine . 
But somehow I grew merry again . 
Delightful inducements to embark , fine chance for promotion , it seems -- aye , a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet . 
Yes , there is death in this business of whaling -- a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity . 
But what then ? 
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death . 
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance . 
Methinks that in looking at things spiritual , we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water , and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air . 
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being . 
In fact take my body who will , take it I say , it is not me . 
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket ; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will , for stave my soul , Jove himself can not . 
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered ; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him , a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation , sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain . 
Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite . 
He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth , but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry . 
At the time I now write of , Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age ; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth , for among all the fissures of his wrinkles , there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom -- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February 's snow . 
No one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led . 
When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed . 
However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit . 
Like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea . 
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste . 
Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel . 
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth-covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint . 
At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary . 
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec . 
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this . 
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage . 
No , thought I , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen . 
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ? 
Yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of God , this pulpit , I see , is a self-containing stronghold -- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls . 
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain 's former sea-farings . 
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers . 
But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel 's face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship 's tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory 's plank where Nelson fell . 
`` Ah , noble ship , '' the angel seemed to say , `` beat on , beat on , thou noble ship , and bear a hardy helm ; for lo ! 
the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand . '' 
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture . 
Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship 's bluff bows , and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship 's fiddle-headed beak . 
What could be more full of meaning ? 
-- for the pulpit is ever this earth 's foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world . 
From thence it is the storm of God 's quick wrath is first descried , and the bow must bear the earliest brunt . 
From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds . 
Yes , the world 's a ship on its passage out , and not a voyage complete ; and the pulpit is its prow . 
Father Mapple rose , and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense . 
`` Starboard gangway , there ! 
side away to larboard -- larboard gangway to starboard ! 
Midships ! 
midships ! '' 
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women 's shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher . 
He paused a little ; then kneeling in the pulpit 's bows , folded his large brown hands across his chest , uplifted his closed eyes , and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea . 
This ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog -- in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy -- `` The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God 's sun-lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom . 
`` I saw the opening maw of hell , With endless pains and sorrows there ; Which none but they that feel can tell -- Oh , I was plunging to despair . 
`` In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine . 
`` With speed he flew to my relief , As on a radiant dolphin borne ; Awful , yet bright , as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God . 
`` My song for ever shall record That terrible , that joyful hour ; I give the glory to my God , His all the mercy and the power . '' 
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm . 
A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : `` Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah -- ` And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . ' '' 
`` Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures . 
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah 's deep sealine sound ! 
what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet ! 
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish 's belly ! 
How billow-like and boisterously grand ! 
We feel the floods surging over us ; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us ! 
But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches ? 
Shipmates , it is a two-stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God . 
As sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard-heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah . 
As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command . 
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . 
And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists . 
`` With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him . 
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign , but only the Captains of this earth . 
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that 's bound for Tarshish . 
There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here . 
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz . 
That 's the opinion of learned men . 
And where is Cadiz , shipmates ? 
Cadiz is in Spain ; as far by water , from Joppa , as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days , when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea . 
Because Joppa , the modern Jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean , the Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar . 
See ye not then , shipmates , that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God ? 
Miserable man ! 
Oh ! 
most contemptible and worthy of all scorn ; with slouched hat and guilty eye , skulking from his God ; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas . 
So disordered , self-condemning is his look , that had there been policemen in those days , Jonah , on the mere suspicion of something wrong , had been arrested ere he touched a deck . 
How plainly he 's a fugitive ! 
no baggage , not a hat-box , valise , or carpet-bag , -- no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux . 
At last , after much dodging search , he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo ; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin , all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods , to mark the stranger 's evil eye . 
Jonah sees this ; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence ; in vain essays his wretched smile . 
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent . 
In their gamesome but still serious way , one whispers to the other -- `` Jack , he 's robbed a widow ; '' or , `` Joe , do you mark him ; he 's a bigamist ; '' or , `` Harry lad , I guess he 's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah , or belike , one of the missing murderers from Sodom . '' 
Another runs to read the bill that 's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person . 
He reads , and looks from Jonah to the bill ; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah , prepared to lay their hands upon him . 
Frighted Jonah trembles , and summoning all his boldness to his face , only looks so much the more a coward . 
He will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion . 
So he makes the best of it ; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised , they let him pass , and he descends into the cabin . '' 
` Who 's there ? ' 
cries the Captain at his busy desk , hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs -- ` Who 's there ? ' 
Oh ! 
how that harmless question mangles Jonah ! 
For the instant he almost turns to flee again . 
But he rallies . ' 
I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish ; how soon sail ye , sir ? ' 
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance . 
` We sail with the next coming tide , ' at last he slowly answered , still intently eyeing him . 
` No sooner , sir ? ' 
-- ` Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger . ' 
Ha ! 
Jonah , that 's another stab . 
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent . 
` I 'll sail with ye , ' -- he says , -- ` the passage money how much is that ? 
-- I 'll pay now . ' 
For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ` that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail . 
And taken with the context , this is full of meaning . 
`` Now Jonah 's Captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless . 
In this world , shipmates , sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport ; whereas Virtue , if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers . 
So Jonah 's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah 's purse , ere he judge him openly . 
He charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it 's assented to . 
Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive ; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold . 
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse , prudent suspicions still molest the Captain . 
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit . 
Not a forger , any way , he mutters ; and Jonah is put down for his passage . 
` Point out my state-room , Sir , ' says Jonah now , ` I 'm travel-weary ; I need sleep . ' 
` Thou lookest like it , ' says the Captain , ` there 's thy room . ' 
Jonah enters , and would lock the door , but the lock contains no key . 
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within . 
All dressed and dusty as he is , Jonah throws himself into his berth , and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead . 
The air is close , and Jonah gasps . 
Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship 's water-line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards . 
`` Screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah 's room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung . 
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance . 
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him . 
The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry . 
` Oh ! 
so my conscience hangs in me ! ' 
he groans , ` straight upwards , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! ' 
`` Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there 's naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestlings in his berth , Jonah 's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep . 
`` And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish , all careening , glides to sea . 
That ship , my friends , was the first of recorded smugglers ! 
the contraband was Jonah . 
But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden . 
A dreadful storm comes on , the ship is like to break . 
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah 's head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep . 
He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him . 
Aye , shipmates , Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship -- a berth in the cabin as I have taken it , and was fast asleep . 
But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ` What meanest thou , O , sleeper ! 
arise ! ' 
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea . 
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks . 
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat . 
And ever , as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead , aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward , but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep . 
`` Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul . 
In all his cringing attitudes , the God-fugitive is now too plainly known . 
The sailors mark him ; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him , and at last , fully to test the truth , by referring the whole matter to high Heaven , they fall to casting lots , to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them . 
The lot is Jonah 's ; that discovered , then how furiously they mob him with their questions . 
` What is thine occupation ? 
Whence comest thou ? 
Thy country ? 
What people ? 
But mark now , my shipmates , the behavior of poor Jonah . 
The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him . '' ' 
I am a Hebrew , ' he cries -- and then -- ' I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land ! ' 
Fear him , O Jonah ? 
Aye , well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN ! 
Straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful . 
For when Jonah , not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts , -- when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea , for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them ; they mercifully turn from him , and seek by other means to save the ship . 
But all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to God , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah . 
`` And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea ; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east , and the sea is still , as Jonah carries down the gale with him , leaving smooth water behind . 
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison . 
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish 's belly . 
But observe his prayer , and learn a weighty lesson . 
For sinful as he is , Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance . 
He feels that his dreadful punishment is just . 
He leaves all his deliverance to God , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards His holy temple . 
And here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment . 
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale . 
Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance . 
Sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like Jonah . '' 
While he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing Jonah 's sea-storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself . 
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them . 
There now came a lull in his look , as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more ; and , at last , standing motionless , with closed eyes , for the moment , seemed communing with God and himself . 
But again he leaned over towards the people , and bowing his head lowly , with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words : `` Shipmates , God has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me . 
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater sinner than ye . 
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME , as a pilot of the living God . 
How being an anointed pilot-prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa . 
But God is everywhere ; Tarshish he never reached . 
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ` into the midst of the seas , ' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ` the weeds were wrapped about his head , ' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him . 
Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet -- ` out of the belly of hell ' -- when the whale grounded upon the ocean 's utmost bones , even then , God heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried . 
Then God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ` vomited out Jonah upon the dry land ; ' when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea-shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- Jonah did the Almighty 's bidding . 
And what was that , shipmates ? 
To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood ! 
That was it ! 
`` This , shipmates , this is that other lesson ; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it . 
Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty ! 
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale ! 
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal ! 
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness ! 
Woe to him who , in this world , courts not dishonour ! 
Woe to him who would not be true , even though to be false were salvation ! 
Yea , woe to him who , as the great Pilot Paul has it , while preaching to others is himself a castaway ! '' 
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm , -- `` But oh ! 
shipmates ! 
on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep . 
Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low ? 
Delight is to him -- a far , far upward , and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self . 
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him . 
Delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges . 
Delight , -- top-gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven . 
Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages . 
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father ! 
-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die . 
I have striven to be Thine , more than to be this world 's , or mine own . 
Yet this is nothing : I leave eternity to Thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God ? '' 
He said no more , but slowly waving a benediction , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place . 
Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time . 
He was sitting on a bench before the fire , with his feet on the stove hearth , and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his ; peering hard into its face , and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose , meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way . 
But being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page -- as I fancied -- stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment . 
He would then begin again at the next fifty ; seeming to commence at number one each time , as though he could not count more than fifty , and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited . 
With much interest I sat watching him . 
Savage though he was , and hideously marred about the face -- at least to my taste -- his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable . 
You can not hide the soul . 
Through all his unearthly tattooings , I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart ; and in his large , deep eyes , fiery black and bold , there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils . 
And besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim . 
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor . 
Whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one . 
It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington 's head , as seen in the popular busts of him . 
It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top . 
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed . 
Whilst I was thus closely scanning him , half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book . 
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , I thought this indifference of his very strange . 
But savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them . 
At first they are overawing ; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom . 
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all , or but very little , with the other seamen in the inn . 
He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances . 
All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it . 
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home , by the way of Cape Horn , that is -- which was the only way he could get there -- thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter ; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease ; preserving the utmost serenity ; content with his own companionship ; always equal to himself . 
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that . 
But , perhaps , to be true philosophers , we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving . 
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher , I conclude that , like the dyspeptic old woman , he must have `` broken his digester . '' 
As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings . 
I felt a melting in me . 
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world . 
This soothing savage had redeemed it . 
There he sat , his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits . 
Wild he was ; a very sight of sights to see ; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him . 
And those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me . 
I 'll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy . 
I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile . 
At first he little noticed these advances ; but presently , upon my referring to his last night 's hospitalities , he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows . 
I told him yes ; whereat I thought he looked pleased , perhaps a little complimented . 
We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it . 
Thus I soon engaged his interest ; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town . 
Soon I proposed a social smoke ; and , producing his pouch and tomahawk , he quietly offered me a puff . 
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us . 
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan 's breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies . 
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country 's phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be . 
In a countryman , this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature , a thing to be much distrusted ; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply . 
After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together . 
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . 
I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets . 
I let them stay . 
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard . 
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise . 
I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church . 
How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ? 
But what is worship ? 
thought I. Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ? 
Impossible ! 
But what is worship ? 
-- to do the will of God -- THAT is worship . 
And what is the will of God ? 
-- to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me -- THAT is the will of God . 
Now , Queequeg is my fellow man . 
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me ? 
Why , unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship . 
Consequently , I must then unite with him in his ; ergo , I must turn idolator . 
So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world . 
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat . 
How it is I know not ; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends . 
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning . 
Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair . 
We had lain thus in bed , chatting and napping at short intervals , and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine , and then drawing them back ; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we ; when , at last , by reason of our confabulations , what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed , and we felt like getting up again , though day-break was yet some way down the future . 
Yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming-pans . 
We felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed-clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room . 
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . 
Nothing exists in itself . 
If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable , and have been so a long time , then you can not be said to be comfortable any more . 
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm . 
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich . 
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air . 
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal . 
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed . 
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed ; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences , though light be more congenial to our clayey part . 
Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion . 
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light , seeing that we were so wide awake ; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk . 
Be it said , that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before , yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them . 
For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then . 
I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord 's policy of insurance . 
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend . 
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders , we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke , illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp . 
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes , I know not , but he now spoke of his native island ; and , eager to hear his history , I begged him to go on and tell it . 
He gladly complied . 
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give . 
Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko , an island far away to the West and South . 
It is not down in any map ; true places never are . 
When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in Queequeg 's ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two . 
His father was a High Chief , a King ; his uncle a High Priest ; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors . 
There was excellent blood in his veins -- royal stuff ; though sadly vitiated , I fear , by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth . 
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father 's bay , and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands . 
But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father 's influence could prevail . 
But Queequeg vowed a vow . 
Alone in his canoe , he paddled off to a distant strait , which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island . 
On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water . 
Hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring-bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces . 
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard ; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists ; Queequeg was the son of a King , and Queequeg budged not . 
Struck by his desperate dauntlessness , and his wild desire to visit Christendom , the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at home . 
But this fine young savage -- this sea Prince of Wales , never saw the Captain 's cabin . 
They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him . 
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen . 
For at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were . 
But , alas ! 
the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father 's heathens . 
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost . 
Thought he , it 's a wicked world in all meridians ; I 'll die a pagan . 
And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish . 
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home . 
By hints , I asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts . 
He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful Christianity , or rather Christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him . 
But by and by , he said , he would return , -- as soon as he felt himself baptized again . 
For the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans . 
They had made a harpooneer of him , and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now . 
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements . 
He answered , to go to sea again , in his old vocation . 
Upon this , I told him that whaling was my own design , and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket , as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from . 
He at once resolved to accompany me to that island , ship aboard the same vessel , get into the same watch , the same boat , the same mess with me , in short to share my every hap ; with both my hands in his , boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds . 
To all this I joyously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen . 
His story being ended with his pipe 's last dying puff , Queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping . 
Next morning , Monday , after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber , for a block , I settled my own and comrade 's bill ; using , however , my comrade 's money . 
The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg -- especially as Peter Coffin 's cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with . 
We borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things , including my own poor carpet-bag , and Queequeg 's canvas sack and hammock , away we went down to `` the Moss , '' the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf . 
As we were going along the people stared ; not at Queequeg so much -- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets , -- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms . 
But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs . 
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons . 
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales . 
In short , like many inland reapers and mowers , who go into the farmers ' meadows armed with their own scythes -- though in no wise obliged to furnish them -- even so , Queequeg , for his own private reasons , preferred his own harpoon . 
Shifting the barrow from my hand to his , he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen . 
It was in Sag Harbor . 
The owners of his ship , it seems , had lent him one , in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house . 
Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf . 
`` Why , '' said I , `` Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think . 
Did n't the people laugh ? '' 
Upon this , he told me another story . 
The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held . 
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko , and its commander -- from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain -- this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg 's sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten . 
Well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride 's bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg 's father . 
Grace being said , -- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates . 
Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being Captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island King , especially in the King 's own house -- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ; -- taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass . 
`` Now , '' said Queequeg , `` what you tink now ? 
-- Did n't our people laugh ? '' 
At last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner . 
Hoisting sail , it glided down the Acushnet river . 
On one side , New Bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air . 
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye . 
Such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort . 
Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings . 
How I snuffed that Tartar air ! 
-- how I spurned that turnpike earth ! 
-- that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs ; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records . 
At the same foam-fountain , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me . 
His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth . 
On , on we flew ; and our offing gained , the Moss did homage to the blast ; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan . 
Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes . 
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber-like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro . 
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there , who , by their intense greenness , must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure . 
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back . 
I thought the bumpkin 's hour of doom was come . 
Dropping his harpoon , the brawny savage caught him in his arms , and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength , sent him high up bodily into the air ; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset , the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet , while Queequeg , turning his back upon him , lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff . 
`` Capting ! 
Capting ! '' 
yelled the bumpkin , running towards that officer ; `` Capting , Capting , here 's the devil . '' 
`` Hallo , you sir , '' cried the Captain , a gaunt rib of the sea , stalking up to Queequeg , `` what in thunder do you mean by that ? 
Do n't you know you might have killed that chap ? '' 
`` What him say ? '' 
said Queequeg , as he mildly turned to me . 
`` He say , '' said I , `` that you came near kill-e that man there , '' pointing to the still shivering greenhorn . 
`` Kill-e , '' cried Queequeg , twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain , `` ah ! 
him bevy small-e fish-e ; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e ; Queequeg kill-e big whale ! '' 
`` Look you , '' roared the Captain , `` I 'll kill-e YOU , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye . '' 
But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye . 
The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck . 
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly , was swept overboard ; all hands were in a panic ; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it , seemed madness . 
It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters . 
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale . 
In the midst of this consternation , Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees , and crawling under the path of the boom , whipped hold of a rope , secured one end to the bulwarks , and then flinging the other like a lasso , caught it round the boom as it swept over his head , and at the next jerk , the spar was that way trapped , and all was safe . 
The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap . 
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam . 
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved . 
The greenhorn had gone down . 
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg , now took an instant 's glance around him , and seeming to see just how matters were , dived down and disappeared . 
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form . 
The boat soon picked them up . 
The poor bumpkin was restored . 
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon . 
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive . 
Was there ever such unconsciousness ? 
He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies .
