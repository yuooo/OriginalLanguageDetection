`` Do I know it ? '' 
asked Foma , laughing . 
`` Is n't that enough for you ? 
I shall tell you nothing more about it . 
What for ? 
We all come from the same place , both people and beasts . 
And what is there that I can tell you about myself ? 
And what for ? 
All this talk is nonsense . 
Let 's rather think a little as to how we shall pass the day . '' 
On that day they took a trip on a steamer , with an orchestra of music , drank champagne , and every one of them got terribly drunk . 
Sasha sang a peculiar , wonderfully sad song , and Foma , moved by her singing , wept like a child . 
Then he danced with her the `` Russian dance , '' and finally , perspiring and fatigued , threw himself overboard in his clothes and was nearly drowned . 
Now , recalling all this and a great deal more , he felt ashamed of himself and dissatisfied with Sasha . 
He looked at her well-shaped figure , heard her even breathing and felt that he did not love this woman , and that she was unnecessary to him . 
Certain gray , oppressive thoughts were slowly springing up in his heavy , aching head . 
It seemed to him as though everything he had lived through during this time was twisted within him into a heavy and moist ball , and that now this ball was rolling about in his breast , unwinding itself slowly , and the thin gray cords were binding him . 
`` What is going on in me ? '' 
he thought . 
`` I 've begun to carouse . 
Why ? 
I do n't know how to live . 
I do n't understand myself . 
Who am I ? '' 
He was astonished by this question , and he paused over it , attempting to make it clear to himself -- why he was unable to live as firmly and confidently as other people do . 
He was now still more tortured . 
by conscience . 
More uneasy at this thought , he tossed about on the hay and irritated , pushed Sasha with his elbow . 
`` Be careful ! '' 
said she , although nearly asleep . 
`` It 's all right . 
You 're not such a lady of quality ! '' 
muttered Foma . 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
She turned her back to him , and said lazily , with a lazy yawn : `` I dreamed that I became a harpist again . 
It seemed to me that I was singing a solo , and opposite me stood a big , dirty dog , snarling and waiting for me to finish the song . 
And I was afraid of the dog . 
And I knew that it would devour me , as soon as I stopped singing . 
So I kept singing , singing . 
And suddenly it seemed my voice failed me . 
Horrible ! 
And the dog is gnashing his teeth . 
Oh Lord , have mercy on me ! 
What does it mean ? '' 
`` Stop your idle talk ! '' 
Foma interrupted her sternly . 
`` You better tell me what you know about me . '' 
`` I know , for instance , that you are awake now , '' she answered , without turning to him . 
`` Awake ? 
That 's true . 
I 've awakened , '' said Foma , thoughtfully and , throwing his arm behind his head , went on : `` That 's why I am asking you . 
What sort of man do you think I am ? '' 
`` A man with a drunken headache , '' answered Sasha , yawning . 
`` Aleksandra ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , beseechingly , `` do n't talk nonsense ! 
Tell me conscientiously , what do you think of me ? '' 
`` I do n't think anything ! '' 
she said drily . 
`` Why are you bothering me with nonsense ? '' 
`` Is this nonsense ? '' 
said Foma , sadly . 
`` Eh , you devils ! 
This is the principal thing . 
The most essential thing to me . '' 
He heaved a deep sigh and became silent . 
After a minute 's silence , Sasha began to speak in her usual , indifferent voice : `` Tell him who he is , and why he is such as he is ? 
Did you ever see ! 
Is it proper to ask such questions of our kind of women ? 
And on what ground should I think about each and every man ? 
I have not even time to think about myself , and , perhaps , I do n't feel like doing it at all . '' 
Foma laughed drily and said : `` I wish I were like this -- and had no desires for anything . '' 
Then the woman raised her head from the pillow , looked into Foma 's face and lay down again , saying : `` You are musing too much . 
Look out -- no good will come of it to you . 
I can not tell you anything about yourself . 
It is impossible to say anything true about a man . 
Who can understand him ? 
Man does not know himself . 
Well , here , I 'll tell you -- you are better than others . 
But what of it ? '' 
`` And in what way am I better ? '' 
asked Foma , thoughtfully . 
`` So ! 
When one sings a good song -- you weep . 
When one does some mean thing -- you beat him . 
With women you are simple , you are not impudent to them . 
You are peaceable . 
And you can also be daring , sometimes . '' 
Yet all this did not satisfy Foma . 
`` You 're not telling me the right thing ! '' 
said he , softly . 
`` Well , I do n't know what you want . 
But see here , what are we going to do after they have raised the barge ? '' 
`` What can we do ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Shall we go to Nizhni or to Kazan ? '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` To carouse . '' 
`` I do n't want to carouse any more . '' 
`` What else are you going to do ? '' 
`` What ? 
Nothing . '' 
And both were silent for a long time , without looking at each other . 
`` You have a disagreeable character , '' said Sasha , `` a wearisome character . '' 
`` But nevertheless I wo n't get drunk any more ! '' 
said Foma , firmly and confidently . 
`` You are lying ! '' 
retorted Sasha , calmly . 
`` You 'll see ! 
What do you think -- is it good to lead such a life as this ? '' 
`` I 'll see . '' 
`` No , just tell me -- is it good ? '' 
`` But what is better ? '' 
Foma looked at her askance and , irritated , said : `` What repulsive words you speak . '' 
`` Well , here again I have n't pleased him ! '' 
said Sasha , laughing . 
`` What a fine crowd ! '' 
said Foma , painfully wrinkling his face . 
`` They 're like trees . 
They also live , but how ? 
No one understands . 
They are crawling somewhere . 
And can give no account either to themselves or to others . 
When the cockroach crawls , he knows whither and wherefore he wants to go ? 
And you ? 
Whither are you going ? '' 
`` Hold on ! '' 
Sasha interrupted him , and asked him calmly : `` What have you to do with me ? 
You may take from me all that you want , but do n't you creep into my soul ! '' 
`` Into your so-o-ul ! '' 
Foma drawled out , with contempt . 
`` Into what soul ? 
He , he ! '' 
She began to pace the room , gathering together the clothes that were scattered everywhere . 
Foma watched her and was displeased because she did not get angry at him for his words about her soul . 
Her face looked calm and indifferent , as usual , but he wished to see her angry or offended ; he wished for something human from the woman . 
`` The soul ! '' 
he exclaimed , persisting in his aim . 
`` Can one who has a soul live as you live ? 
A soul has fire burning in it , there is a sense of shame in it . '' 
By this time she was sitting on a bench , putting on her stockings , but at his words she raised her head and sternly fixed her eyes upon his face . 
`` What are you staring at ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Why do you speak that way ? '' 
said she , without lifting her eyes from him . 
`` Because I must . '' 
`` Look out -- must you really ? '' 
There was something threatening in her question . 
Foma felt intimidated and said , this time without provocation in his voice : `` How could I help speaking ? '' 
`` Oh , you ! '' 
sighed Sasha and resumed dressing herself `` And what about me ? '' 
`` Merely so . 
You seem as though you were born of two fathers . 
Do you know what I have observed among people ? '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` If a man can not answer for himself , it means that he is afraid of himself , that his price is a grosh ! '' 
`` Do you refer to me ? '' 
asked Foma , after a pause . 
`` To you , too . '' 
She threw a pink morning gown over her shoulders and , standing in the centre of the room , stretched out her hand toward Foma , who lay at her feet , and said to him in a low , dull voice : `` You have no right to speak about my soul . 
You have nothing to do with it ! 
And therefore hold your tongue ! 
I may speak ! 
If I please , I could tell something to all of you . 
Eh , how I could tell it ! 
Only , -- who will dare to listen to me , if I should speak at the top of my voice ? 
And I have some words about you , -- they 're like hammers ! 
And I could knock you all on your heads so that you would lose your wits . 
And although you are all rascals -- you can not be cured by words . 
You should be burned in the fire -- just as frying-pans are burned out on the first Monday of Lent . '' 
Raising her hands she abruptly loosened her hair , and when it fell over her shoulders in heavy , black locks -- the woman shook her head haughtily and said , with contempt : `` Never mind that I am leading a loose life ! 
It often happens , that the man who lives in filth is purer than he who goes about in silks . 
If you only knew what I think of you , you dogs , what wrath I bear against you ! 
And because of this wrath -- I am silent ! 
For I fear that if I should sing it to you -- my soul would become empty . 
I would have nothing to live on . '' 
Foma looked at her , and now he was pleased with her . 
In her words there was something akin to his frame of mind . 
Laughing , he said to her , with satisfaction on his face and in his voice : `` And I also feel that something is growing within my soul . 
Eh , I too shall have my say , when the time comes . '' 
`` Against whom ? '' 
asked Sasha , carelessly . 
`` I -- against everybody ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , jumping to his feet . 
`` Against falsehood . 
I shall ask -- '' `` Ask whether the samovar is ready , '' Sasha ordered indifferently . 
Foma glanced at her and cried , enraged : `` Go to the devil ! 
Ask yourself . '' 
`` Well , all right , I shall . 
What are you snarling about ? '' 
And she stepped out of the hut . 
In piercing gusts the wind blew across the river , striking against its bosom , and covered with troubled dark waves , the river was spasmodically rushing toward the wind with a noisy splash , and all in the froth of wrath . 
The willow bushes on the shore bent low to the ground -- trembling , they now were about to lie down on the ground , now , frightened , they thrust themselves away from it , driven by the blows of the wind . 
In the air rang a whistling , a howling , and a deep groaning sound , that burst from dozens of human breasts : `` It goes -- it goes -- it goes ! '' 
This exclamation , abrupt as a blow , and heavy as the breath from an enormous breast , which is suffocating from exertion , was soaring over the river , falling upon the waves , as if encouraging their mad play with the wind , and they struck the shores with might . 
Two empty barges lay anchored by the mountainous shore , and their tall masts , rising skyward , rocked in commotion from side to side , as though describing some invisible pattern in the air . 
The decks of both barges were encumbered with scaffolds , built of thick brown beams ; huge sheaves were hanging everywhere ; chains and ropes were fastened to them , and rocking in the air ; the links of the chains were faintly clanging . 
A throng of peasants in blue and in red blouses pulled a large beam across the dock and , heavily stamping their feet , groaned with full chest : `` It goes -- it goes -- it goes ! '' 
Here and there human figures clung to the scaffoldings , like big lumps of blue and red ; the wind , blowing their blouses and their trousers , gave the men odd forms , making them appear now hump-backed , now round and puffed up like bladders . 
The people on the scaffolds and on the decks of the barges were making fast , hewing , sawing , driving in nails ; and big arms , with shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows were seen everywhere . 
The wind scattered splinters of wood , and a varied , lively , brisk noise in the air ; the saw gnawed the wood , choking with wicked joy ; the beams , wounded by the axes , moaned and groaned drily ; the boards cracked sickly as they split from the blows they received ; the jointer squeaked maliciously . 
The iron clinking of the chains and the groaning creaking of the sheaves joined the wrathful roaring of the waves , and the wind howled loudly , scattering over the river the noise of toil and drove the clouds across the sky . 
`` Mishka-a ! 
The deuce take you ! '' 
cried someone from the top of the scaffolding . 
And from the deck , a large-formed peasant , with his head thrown upward , answered : `` Wh-a-at ? '' 
And the wind , playing with his long , flaxen beard , flung it into his face . 
`` Hand us the end . '' 
A resounding basso shouted as through a speaking-trumpet : `` See how you 've fastened this board , you blind devil ? 
Ca n't you see ? 
I 'll rub your eyes for you ! '' 
`` Pull , my boys , come on ! '' 
`` Once more -- brave -- boys ! '' 
cried out some one in a loud , beseeching voice . 
Handsome and stately , in a short cloth jacket and high boots , Foma stood , leaning his back against a mast , and stroking his beard with his trembling hand , admired the daring work of the peasants . 
The noise about him called forth in him a persistent desire to shout , to work together with the peasants , to hew wood , to carry burdens , to command -- to compel everybody to pay attention to him , and to show them his strength , his skill , and the live soul within him . 
But he restrained himself . 
And standing speechless , motionless , he felt ashamed and afraid of something . 
He was embarrassed by the fact that he was master over everybody there , and that if he were to start to work himself , no one would believe that he was working merely to satisfy his desire , and not to spur them on in their work ; to set them an example . 
And then , the peasants might laugh at him , in all probability . 
A fair and curly-headed fellow , with his shirt collar unbuttoned , was now and again running past him , now carrying a log on his shoulder , now an axe in his hands ; he was skipping along , like a frolicsome goat , scattering about him cheerful , ringing laughter , jests , violent oaths , and working unceasingly , now assisting one , now another , as he was cleverly and quickly running across the deck , which was obstructed with timber and shavings . 
Foma watched him closely , and envied this merry fellow , who was radiant with something healthy and inspiring . 
`` Evidently he is happy , '' thought Foma , and this thought provoked in him a keen , piercing desire to insult him somehow , to embarrass him . 
All those about him were seized with the zest of pressing work , all were unanimously and hastily fastening the scaffoldings , arranging the pulleys , preparing to raise the sunken barge from the bottom of the river ; all were sound and merry -- they all lived . 
While he stood alone , aside from them , not knowing what to do , not knowing how to do anything , feeling himself superfluous to this great toil . 
It vexed him to feel that he was superfluous among men , and the more closely he watched them , the more intense was this vexation . 
And he was stung most by the thought that all this was being done for him . 
And yet he was out of place there . 
`` Where is my place , then ? '' 
he thought gloomily . 
`` Where is my work ? 
Am I , then , some deformed being ? 
I have just as much strength as any of them . 
But of what use is it to me ? '' 
The chains clanged , the pulleys groaned , the blows of the axes resounded loud over the river , and the barges rocked from the shocks of the waves , but to Foma it seemed that he was rocking not because the barge was rocking under his feet , but rather because he was not able to stand firmly anywhere , he was not destined to do so . 
The contractor , a small-sized peasant with a small pointed gray beard , and with narrow little eyes on his gray wrinkled face , came up to him and said , not loud , but pronouncing his words with a certain tone from the bottom of the river . 
He wished that they might not succeed , that they might feel embarrassed in his presence , and a wicked thought flashed through his mind : `` Perhaps the chains will break . '' 
`` Boys ! 
Attention ! '' 
shouted the contractor . 
`` Start all together . 
God bless us ! '' 
And suddenly , clasping his hands in the air , he cried in a shrill voice : `` Let -- her -- go-o-o ! '' 
The labourers took up his shout , and all cried out in one voice , with excitement and exertion : `` Let her go ! 
She moves . '' 
The pulleys squeaked and creaked , the chains clanked , strained under the heavy weight that suddenly fell upon them ; and the labourers , bracing their chests against the handle of the windlasses , roared and tramped heavily . 
The waves splashed noisily between the barges as though unwilling to give up their prize to the men . 
Everywhere about Foma , chains and ropes were stretched and they quivered from the strain -- they were creeping somewhere across the deck , past his feet , like huge gray worms ; they were lifted upward , link after link , falling back with a rattling noise , and all these sounds were drowned by the deafening roaring of the labourers . 
`` It goes , it goes , it goes , '' they all sang in unison , triumphantly . 
But the ringing voice of the contractor pierced the deep wave of their voices , and cut it even as a knife cuts bread . 
`` My boys ! 
Go ahead , all at once , all at once . '' 
Foma was seized with a strange emotion ; passionately he now longed to mingle with this excited roaring of the labourers , which was as broad and as powerful as the river -- to blend with this irritating , creaking , squeaking , clanging of iron and turbulent splashing of waves . 
Perspiration came out on his face from the intensity of his desire , and suddenly pale from agitation , he tore himself away from the mast , and rushed toward the windlasses with big strides . 
`` All at once ! 
At once ! '' 
he cried in a fierce voice . 
When he reached the lever of the windlass , he dashed his chest against it with all his might , and not feeling the pain , he began to go around the windlass , roaring , and firmly stamping his feet against the deck . 
Something powerful and burning rushed into his breast , replacing the efforts which he spent while turning the windlass-lever ! 
Inexpressible joy raged within him and forced itself outside in an agitated cry . 
It seemed to him that he alone , that only his strength was turning the lever , thus raising the weight , and that his strength was growing and growing . 
Stooping , and lowering his head , like a bull he massed the power of the weight , which threw him back , but yielded to him , nevertheless . 
Each step forward excited him the more , each expended effort was immediately replaced in him by a flood of burning and vehement pride . 
His head reeled , his eyes were blood-shot , he saw nothing , he only felt that they were yielding to him , that he would soon conquer , that he would overthrow with his strength something huge which obstructed his way -- would overthrow , conquer and then breathe easily and freely , full of proud delight . 
For the first time in his life he experienced such a powerful , spiritualizing sensation , and he drank it with all the strength of a hungry , thirsty soul ; he was intoxicated by it and he gave vent to his joy in loud , exulting cries in unison with the workers : `` It goes -- it goes -- it goes . '' 
`` Hold on ! 
Fasten ! 
Hold on , boys ! '' 
Something dashed against Foma 's chest , and he was hurled backward . 
`` I congratulate you on a successful result , Foma Ignatyich ! '' 
the contractor congratulated him and the wrinkles quivered on his face in cheerful beams . 
`` Thank God ! 
You must be quite tired now ? '' 
Cold wind blew in Foma 's face . 
A contented , boastful bustle was in the air about him ; swearing at one another in a friendly way , merry , with smiles on their perspiring brows , the peasants approached him and surrounded him closely . 
He smiled in embarrassment : the excitement within him had not yet calmed down and this hindered him from understanding what had happened and why all those who surrounded him were so merry and contented . 
`` We 've raised a hundred and seventy thousand puds as if we plucked a radish from a garden-bed ! '' 
said some one . 
`` We ought to get a vedro of whisky from our master . '' 
Foma , standing on a heap of cable , looked over the heads of the workers and saw ; between the barges , side by side with them , stood a third barge , black , slippery , damaged , wrapped in chains . 
It was warped all over , it seemed as though it swelled from some terrible disease and , impotent , clumsy , it was suspended between its companions , leaning against them . 
Its broken mast stood out mournfully in the centre ; reddish streams of water , like blood , were running across the deck , which was covered with stains of rust . 
Everywhere on the deck lay heaps of iron , of black , wet stumps of wood , and of ropes . 
`` Raised ? '' 
asked Foma , not knowing what to say at the sight of this ugly , heavy mass , and again feeling offended at the thought that merely for the sake of raising this dirty , bruised monster from the water , his soul had foamed up with such joy . 
`` How 's the barge ? '' 
asked Foma , indefinitely , addressing the contractor . 
`` It 's pretty good ! 
We must unload right away , and put a company of about twenty carpenters to work on it -- they 'll bring it quickly into shape , '' said the contractor in a consoling tone . 
And the light-haired fellow , gaily and broadly smiling into Foma 's face , asked : `` Are we going to have any vodka ? '' 
`` Ca n't you wait ? 
You have time ! '' 
said the contractor , sternly . 
`` Do n't you see -- the man is tired . '' 
Then the peasants began to speak : `` Of course , he is tired ! 
`` That was n't easy work ! '' 
`` Of course , one gets tired if he is n't used to work . '' 
`` It is even hard to eat gruel if you are not used to it . '' 
`` I am not tired , '' said Foma , gloomily , and again were heard the respectful exclamations of the peasants , as they surrounded him more closely . 
`` Work , if one likes it , is a pleasant thing . '' 
`` It 's just like play . '' 
`` It 's like playing with a woman . '' 
But the light-haired fellow persisted in his request : `` Your Honour ! 
You ought to treat us to a vedro of vodka , eh ? '' 
he said , smiling and sighing . 
Foma looked at the bearded faces before him and felt like saying something offensive to them . 
But somehow everything became confused in his brain , he found no thoughts in it and , finally , without giving himself an account of his words , said angrily : `` All you want is to drink all the time ! 
It makes no difference to you what you do ! 
You should have thought -- why ? 
to what purpose ? 
Eh , you ! '' 
There was an expression of perplexity on the faces of those that surrounded him , blue and red , bearded figures began to sigh , scratch themselves , shift themselves from one foot to another . 
Others cast a hopeless glance at Foma and turned away . 
`` Yes , yes ! '' 
said the contractor , with a sigh . 
`` That would n't harm ! 
That is -- to think -- why and how . 
These are words of wisdom . '' 
The light-haired fellow had a different opinion on the matter ; smiling kind-heartedly , he waved his hand and said : `` We do n't have to think over our work ! 
If we have it -- we do it ! 
Our business is simple ! 
When a rouble is earned -- thank God ! 
we can do everything . '' 
`` And do you know what 's necessary to do ? '' 
questioned Foma , irritated by the contradiction . 
`` Everything is necessary -- this and that . '' 
`` But where 's the sense ? '' 
`` There 's but one and the same sense in everything for our class -- when you have earned for bread and taxes -- live ! 
And when there 's something to drink , into the bargain . '' 
`` Eh , you ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , with contempt . 
`` You 're also talking ! 
What do you understand ? '' 
`` Is it our business to understand ? '' 
said the light-haired fellow , with a nod of the head . 
It now bored him to speak to Foma . 
He suspected that he was unwilling to treat them to vodka and he was somewhat angry . 
`` That 's it ! '' 
said Foma , instructively , pleased that the fellow yielded to him , and not noticing the cross , sarcastic glances . 
`` And he who understands feels that it is necessary to do everlasting work ! '' 
`` That is , for God ! '' 
explained the contractor , eyeing the peasants , and added , with a devout sigh : `` That 's true . 
Oh , how true that is ! '' 
And Foma was inspired with the desire to say something correct and important , after which these people might regard him in a different light , for he was displeased with the fact that all , save the light-haired fellow , kept silent and looked at him askance , surlily , with such weary , gloomy eyes . 
`` It is necessary to do such work , '' he said , moving his eyebrows . 
`` Such work that people may say a thousand years hence : ` This was done by the peasants of Bogorodsk -- yes ! ' '' 
The light-haired fellow glanced at Foma with astonishment and asked : `` Are we , perhaps , to drink the Volga dry ? '' 
Then he sniffed and , nodding his head , announced : `` We ca n't do that -- we should all burst . '' 
Foma became confused at his words and looked about him ; the peasants were smiling morosely , disdainfully , sarcastically . 
And these smiles stung him like needles . 
A serious-looking peasant , with a big gray beard , who had not yet opened his mouth up to that time , suddenly opened it now , came closer to Foma and said slowly : `` And even if we were to drink the Volga dry , and eat up that mountain , into the bargain -- that too would be forgotten , your Honour . 
Everything will be forgotten . 
Life is long . 
It is not for us to do such deeds as would stand out above everything else . 
But we can put up scaffoldings -- that we can ! '' 
He spoke and sceptically spitting at his feet , indifferently walked off from Foma , and slipped into the crowd , as a wedge into a tree . 
His words crushed Foma completely ; he felt , that the peasants considered him stupid and ridiculous . 
And in order to save his importance as master in their eyes , to attract again the now exhausted attention of the peasants to himself , he bristled up , comically puffed up his cheeks and blurted out in an impressive voice : `` I make you a present of three buckets of vodka . '' 
Brief speeches have always the most meaning and are always apt to produce a strong impression . 
The peasants respectfully made way for Foma , making low bows to him , and , smiling merrily and gratefully , thanked him for his generosity in a unanimous roar of approval . 
`` Take me over to the shore , '' said Foma , feeling that the excitement that had just been aroused in him would not last long . 
A worm was gnawing his heart , and he was weary . 
`` I feel disgusted ! '' 
he said , entering the hut where Sasha , in a smart , pink gown , was bustling about the table , arranging wines and refreshments . 
`` I feel disgusted , Aleksandra ! 
If you could only do something with me , eh ? '' 
She looked at him attentively and , seating herself on the bench , shoulder to shoulder with him , said : `` Since you feel disgusted -- it means that you want something . 
What is it you want ? '' 
`` I do n't know ! '' 
replied Foma , nodding his head mournfully . 
`` Think of it -- search . '' 
`` I am unable to think . 
Nothing comes out of my thinking . '' 
`` Eh , you , my child ! '' 
said Sasha , softly and disdainfully , moving away from him . 
`` Your head is superfluous to you . '' 
Foma neither caught her tone nor noticed her movement . 
Leaning his hands against the bench , he bent forward , looked at the floor , and , swaying his body to and fro , said : `` Sometimes I think and think -- and the whole soul is stuck round with thoughts as with tar . 
And suddenly everything disappears , without leaving any trace . 
Then it is dark in the soul as in a cellar -- dark , damp and empty -- there is nothing at all in it ! 
It is even terrible -- I feel then as though I were not a man , but a bottomless ravine . 
You ask me what I want ? '' 
Sasha looked at him askance and pensively began to sing softly : `` Eh , when the wind blows -- mist comes from the sea . '' 
`` I do n't want to carouse -- it is repulsive ! 
Always the same -- the people , the amusements , the wine . 
When I grow malicious -- I 'd thrash everybody . 
I am not pleased with men -- what are they ? 
It is impossible to understand them -- why do they keep on living ? 
And when they speak the truth -- to whom are we to listen ? 
One says this , another that . 
While I -- I can not say anything . '' 
`` Eh , without thee , dear , my life is weary , '' sang Sasha , staring at the wall before her . 
And Foma kept on rocking and said : `` There are times when I feel guilty before men . 
Everybody lives , makes noise , while I am frightened , staggered -- as if I did not feel the earth under me . 
Was it , perhaps , my mother that endowed me with apathy ? 
My godfather says that she was as cold as ice -- that she was forever yearning towards something . 
I am also yearning . 
Toward men I am yearning . 
I 'd like to go to them and say : ` Brethren , help me ! 
Teach me ! 
I know not how to live ! . 
And if I am guilty -- forgive me ! ' 
But looking about , I see there 's no one to speak to . 
No one wants it -- they are all rascals ! 
And it seems they are even worse than I am . 
For I am , at least , ashamed of living as I am , while they are not ! 
They go on . '' 
Foma uttered some violent , unbecoming invectives and became silent . 
Sasha broke off her song and moved still farther away from him . 
The wind was raging outside the window , hurling dust against the window-panes . 
Cockroaches were rustling on the oven as they crawled over a bunch of pine wood splinters . 
Somewhere in the yard a calf was lowing pitifully . 
Sasha glanced at Foma , with a sarcastic smile , and said : `` There 's another unfortunate creature lowing . 
You ought to go to him ; perhaps you could sing in unison . 
And placing her hand on his curly head she jestingly pushed it on the side . 
`` What are people like yourself good for ? 
That 's what you ought to think of . 
What are you groaning about ? 
You are disgusted with being idle -- occupy yourself , then , with business . '' 
`` Oh Lord ! '' 
Foma nodded his head . 
`` It is hard for one to make himself understood . 
Yes , it is hard ! '' 
And irritated , he almost cried out : `` What business ? 
I have no yearning toward business ! 
What is business ? 
Business is merely a name -- and if you should look into the depth , into the root of it -- you 'll find it is nothing but absurdity ! 
Do I not understand it ? 
I understand everything , I see everything , I feel everything ! 
Only my tongue is dumb . 
What aim is there in business ? 
Money ? 
I have plenty of it ! 
I could choke you to death with it , cover you with it . 
All this business is nothing but fraud . 
I meet business people -- well , and what about them ? 
Their greediness is immense , and yet they purposely whirl about in business that they might not see themselves . 
They hide themselves , the devils . 
Try to free them from this bustle -- what will happen ? 
Like blind men they will grope about hither and thither ; they 'll lose their mind -- they 'll go mad ! 
I know it ! 
Do you think that business brings happiness into man ? 
No , that 's not so -- something else is missing here . 
This is not everything yet ! 
The river flows that men may sail on it ; the tree grows -- to be useful ; the dog -- to guard the house . 
There is justification for everything in the world ! 
And men , like cockroaches , are altogether superfluous on earth . 
Everything is for them , and they -- what are they for ? 
Aha ! 
Wherein is their justification ? 
Ha , ha , ha ! '' 
Foma was triumphant . 
It seemed to him that he had found something good for himself , something severe against men . 
And feeling that , because of this , there was great joy in him , he laughed loudly . 
`` Does not your head ache ? '' 
inquired Sasha , anxiously , scrutinizing his face . 
`` My soul aches ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , passionately . 
`` And it aches because it is upright -- because it is not to be satisfied with trifles . 
Answer it , how to live ? 
To what purpose ? 
There -- take my godfather -- he is wise ! 
He says -- create life ! 
But he 's the only one like this . 
Well , I 'll ask him , wait ! 
And everybody says -- life has usurped us ! 
Life has choked us . 
I shall ask these , too . 
And how can we create life ? 
You must keep it in your hands to do this , you must be master over it . 
You can not make even a pot , without taking the clay into your hands . '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
said Sasha , seriously . 
`` I think you ought to get married , that 's all ! '' 
`` What for ? '' 
asked Foma , shrugging his shoulders . 
`` You need a bridle . '' 
`` All right ! 
I am living with you -- you are all of a kind , are you not ? 
One is not sweeter than the other . 
I had one before you , of the same kind as you . 
No , but that one did it for love 's sake . 
She had taken a liking to me -- and consented ; she was good -- but , otherwise , she was in every way the same as you -- though you are prettier than she . 
But I took a liking to a certain lady -- a lady of noble birth ! 
They said she led a loose life , but I did not get her . 
Yes , she was clever , intelligent ; she lived in luxury . 
I used to think -- that 's where I 'll taste the real thing ! 
I did not get her -- and , it may be , if I had succeeded , all would have taken a different turn . 
I yearned toward her . 
I thought -- I could not tear myself away . 
While now that I have given myself to drink , I 've drowned her in wine -- I am forgetting her -- and that also is wrong . 
O man ! 
You are a rascal , to be frank . '' 
Foma became silent and sank into meditation . 
And Sasha rose from the bench and paced the hut to and fro , biting her lips . 
Then she stopped short before him , and , clasping her hands to her head , said : `` Do you know what ? 
I 'll leave you . '' 
`` Where will you go ? '' 
asked Foma , without lifting his head . 
`` I do n't know -- it 's all the same ! ''
