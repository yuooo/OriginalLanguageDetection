`` I am -- Stepan , '' said the peasant , smiling confusedly , and also rose to his feet . 
`` I 'm Stepan . 
Of course ! '' 
`` How you sing ! 
Ah ! '' 
Foma exclaimed in astonishment , uneasily shifting from foot to foot . 
`` Eh , your Honour ! '' 
sighed the peasant and added softly and convincingly : `` Sorrow can compel an ox to sing like a nightingale . 
And what makes the lady sing like this , only God knows . 
And she sings , with all her veins -- that is to say , so you might just lie down and die with sorrow ! 
Well , that 's a lady . '' 
`` That was sung very well ! '' 
said Ookhtishchev in a drunken voice . 
`` No , the devil knows what this is ! '' 
Zvantzev suddenly shouted , almost crying , irritated as he jumped up from the table . 
`` I 've come out here for a good time . 
I want to enjoy myself , and here they perform a funeral service for me ! 
What an outrage ! 
I ca n't stand this any longer . 
I 'm going away ! '' 
`` Jean , I am also going . 
I 'm weary , too , '' announced the gentleman with the side whiskers . 
`` Vassa , '' cried Zvantzev to his lady , `` dress yourself ! '' 
`` Yes , it 's time to go , '' said the red-haired lady to Ookhtishchev . 
`` It is cold , and it will soon be dark . '' 
`` Stepan ! 
Clear everything away ! '' 
commanded Vassa . 
All began to bustle about , all began to speak of something . 
Foma stared at them in suspense and shuddered . 
Staggering , the crowd walked along the rafts . 
Pale and fatigued , they said to one another stupid , disconnected things . 
Sasha jostled them unceremoniously , as she was getting her things together . 
`` Stepan ! 
Call for the horses ! '' 
`` And I 'll drink some more cognac . 
Who wants some more cognac with me ? '' 
drawled the gentleman with the side whiskers in a beatific voice , holding a bottle in his hands . 
Vassa was muffling Zvantzev 's neck with a scarf . 
He stood in front of her , frowning , dissatisfied , his lips curled capriciously , the calves of his legs shivering . 
Foma became disgusted as he looked at them , and he went off to the other raft . 
He was astonished that all these people behaved as though they had not heard the song at all . 
In his breast the song was alive and there it called to life a restless desire to do something , to say something . 
But he had no one there to speak to . 
The sun had set and the distance was enveloped in blue mist . 
Foma glanced thither and turned away . 
He did not feel like going to town with these people , neither did he care to stay here with them . 
And they were still pacing the raft with uneven steps , shaking from side to side and muttering disconnected words . 
The women were not quite as drunk as the men , and only the red-haired one could not lift herself from the bench for a long time , and finally , when she rose , she declared : `` Well , I 'm drunk . '' 
Foma sat down on a log of wood , and lifting the axe , with which the peasant had chopped wood for the fire , he began to play with it , tossing it up in the air and catching it . 
`` Oh , my God ! 
How mean this is ! '' 
Zvantzev 's capricious voice was heard . 
Foma began to feel that he hated it , and him , and everybody , except Sasha , who awakened in him a certain uneasy feeling , which contained at once admiration for her and a fear lest she might do something unexpected and terrible . 
`` Brute ! '' 
shouted Zvantzev in a shrill voice , and Foma noticed that he struck the peasant on the chest , after which the peasant removed his cap humbly and stepped aside . 
`` Fo-o-ol ! '' 
cried Zvantzev , walking after him and lifting his hand . 
Foma jumped to his feet and said threateningly , in a loud voice : `` Eh , you ! 
Do n't touch him ! '' 
`` Wha-a-at ? '' 
Zvantzev turned around toward him . 
`` Stepan , come over here , '' called Foma . 
`` Peasant ! '' 
Zvantzev hurled with contempt , looking at Foma . 
Foma shrugged his shoulders and made a step toward him ; but suddenly a thought flashed vividly through his mind ! 
He smiled maliciously and inquired of Stepan , softly : `` The string of rafts is moored in three places , is n't it ? 
`` In three , of course ! '' 
`` Cut the connections ! '' 
`` And they ? '' 
`` Keep quiet ! 
Cut ! '' 
`` But -- '' `` Cut ! 
Quietly , so they do n't notice it ! '' 
The peasant took the axe in his hands , slowly walked up to the place where one link was well fastened to another link , struck a few times with his axe , and returned to Foma . 
`` I 'm not responsible , your Honour , '' he said . 
`` Do n't be afraid . '' 
`` They 've started off , '' whispered the peasant with fright , and hastily made the sign of the cross . 
And Foma gazed , laughing softly , and experienced a painful sensation that keenly and sharply stung his heart with a certain strange , pleasant and sweet fear . 
The people on the raft were still pacing to and fro , moving about slowly , jostling one another , assisting the ladies with their wraps , laughing and talking , and the raft was meanwhile turning slowly and irresolutely in the water . 
`` If the current carries them against the fleet , '' whispered the peasant , `` they 'll strike against the bows -- and they 'll be smashed into splinters . '' 
`` Keep quiet ! '' 
`` They 'll drown ! '' 
`` You 'll get a boat , and overtake them . '' 
`` That 's it ! 
Thank you . 
What then ? 
They 're after all human beings . 
And we 'll be held responsible for them . '' 
Satisfied now , laughing with delight , the peasant dashed in bounds across the rafts to the shore . 
And Foma stood by the water and felt a passionate desire to shout something , but he controlled himself , in order to give time for the raft to float off farther , so that those drunken people would not be able to jump across to the moored links . 
He experienced a pleasant caressing sensation as he saw the raft softly rocking upon the water and floating off farther and farther from him every moment . 
The heavy and dark feeling , with which his heart had been filled during this time , now seemed to float away together with the people on the raft . 
Calmly he inhaled the fresh air and with it something sound that cleared his brain . 
At the very edge of the floating raft stood Sasha , with her back toward Foma ; he looked at her beautiful figure and involuntarily recalled Medinskaya . 
The latter was smaller in size . 
The recollection of her stung him , and he cried out in a loud , mocking voice : `` Eh , there ! 
Good-bye ! 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! '' 
Suddenly the dark figures of the people moved toward him and crowded together in one group , in the centre of the raft . 
But by this time a clear strip of water , about three yards wide , was flashing between them and Foma . 
There was a silence lasting for a few seconds . 
Then suddenly a hurricane of shrill , repulsively pitiful sounds , which were full of animal fright , was hurled at Foma , and louder than all and more repulsive than all , Zvantzev 's shrill , jarring cry pierced the ear : `` He-e-elp ! '' 
Some one -- in all probability , the sedate gentleman with the side whiskers -- roared in his basso : `` Drowning ! 
They 're drowning people ! '' 
`` Are you people ? '' 
cried Foma , angrily , irritated by their screams which seemed to bite him . 
And the people ran about on the raft in the madness of fright ; the raft rocked under their feet , floated faster on account of this , and the agitated water was loudly splashing against and under it . 
The screams rent the air , the people jumped about , waving their hands , and the stately figure of Sasha alone stood motionless and speechless on the edge of the raft . 
`` Give my regards to the crabs ! '' 
cried Foma . 
Foma felt more and more cheerful and relieved in proportion as the raft was floating away from him . 
`` Foma Ignatyevich ! '' 
said Ookhtishchev in a faint , but sober voice , `` look out , this is a dangerous joke . 
I 'll make a complaint . '' 
`` When you are drowned ? 
You may complain ! '' 
answered Foma , cheerfully . 
`` You are a murderer ! '' 
exclaimed Zvantzev , sobbing . 
But at this time a ringing splash of water was heard as though it groaned with fright or with astonishment . 
Foma shuddered and became as though petrified . 
Then rang out the wild , deafening shrieks of the women , and the terror-stricken screams of men , and all the figures on the raft remained petrified in their places . 
And Foma , staring at the water , felt as though he really were petrified . 
In the water something black , surrounded with splashes , was floating toward him . 
Rather instinctively than consciously , Foma threw himself with his chest on the beams of the raft , and stretched out his hands , his head hanging down over the water . 
Several incredibly long seconds passed . 
Cold , wet arms clasped his neck and dark eyes flashed before him . 
Then he understood that it was Sasha . 
The dull horror , which had suddenly seized him , vanished , replaced now by wild , rebellious joy . 
Having dragged the woman out of the water , he grasped her by the waist , clasped her to his breast , and , not knowing what to say to her , he stared into her eyes with astonishment . 
She smiled at him caressingly . 
`` I am cold , '' said Sasha , softly , and quivered in every limb . 
Foma laughed gaily at the sound of her voice , lifted her into his arms and quickly , almost running , dashed across the rafts to the shore . 
She was wet and cold , but her breathing was hot , it burned Foma 's cheek and filled his breast with wild joy . 
`` You wanted to drown me ? '' 
said she , firmly , pressing close to him . 
`` It was rather too early . 
Wait ! '' 
`` How well you have done it , '' muttered Foma , as he ran . 
`` You 're a fine , brave fellow ! 
And your device was n't bad , either , though you seem to be so peaceable . '' 
`` And they are still roaring there , ha ! 
ha ! '' 
`` The devil take them ! 
If they are drowned , we 'll be sent to Siberia , '' said the woman , as though she wanted to console and encourage him by this . 
She began to shiver , and the shudder of her body , felt by Foma , made him hasten his pace . 
Sobs and cries for help followed them from the river . 
There , on the placid water , floated in the twilight a small island , withdrawing from the shore toward the stream of the main current of the river , and on that little island dark human figures were running about . 
Night was closing down upon them . 
ONE Sunday afternoon , Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin was drinking tea in his garden and talking to his daughter . 
The collar of his shirt unbuttoned , a towel wound round his neck , he sat on a bench under a canopy of verdant cherry-trees , waved his hands in the air , wiped the perspiration off his face , and incessantly poured forth into the air his brisk speech . 
`` The man who permits his belly to have the upper hand over him is a fool and a rogue ! 
Is there nothing better in the world than eating and drinking ? 
Upon what will you pride yourself before people , if you are like a hog ? '' 
The old man 's eyes sparkled irritably and angrily , his lips twisted with contempt , and the wrinkles of his gloomy face quivered . 
`` If Foma were my own son , I would have made a man of him ! '' 
Playing with an acacia branch , Lubov mutely listened to her father 's words , now and then casting a close and searching look in his agitated , quivering face . 
Growing older , she changed , without noticing it , her suspicious and cold relation toward the old man . 
In his words she now began to find the same ideas that were in her books , and this won her over on her father 's side , involuntarily causing the girl to prefer his live words to the cold letters of the book . 
Always overwhelmed with business affairs , always alert and clever , he went his own way alone , and she perceived his solitude , knew how painful it was , and her relations toward her father grew in warmth . 
At times she even entered into arguments with the old man ; he always regarded her remarks contemptuously and sarcastically ; but more tenderly and attentively from time to time . 
`` If the deceased Ignat could read in the newspapers of the indecent life his son is leading , he would have killed Foma ! '' 
said Mayakin , striking the table with his fists . 
`` How they have written it up ! 
It 's a disgrace ! '' 
`` He deserves it , '' said Lubov . 
`` I do n't say it was done at random ! 
They 've barked at him , as was necessary . 
And who was it that got into such a fit of anger ? '' 
`` What difference does it make to you ? '' 
asked the girl . 
`` It 's interesting to know . 
How cleverly the rascal described Foma 's behaviour . 
Evidently he must have been with him and witnessed all the indecency himself . '' 
`` Oh , no , he would n't go with Foma on a spree ! ' 
said Lubov , confidently , and blushed deeply at her father 's searching look . 
`` So ! 
You have fine acquaintances , Lubka ! '' 
said Mayakin with humorous bitterness . 
`` Well , who wrote it ? '' 
`` What do you wish to know it for , papa ? '' 
`` Come , tell me ! '' 
She had no desire to tell , but the old man persisted , and his voice was growing more and more dry and angry . 
Then she asked him uneasily : `` And you will not do him any ill for it ? '' 
`` I ? 
I will -- bite his head off ! 
Fool ! 
What can I do to him ? 
They , these writers , are not a foolish lot and are therefore a power -- a power , the devils ! 
And I am not the governor , and even he can not put one 's hand out of joint or tie one 's tongue . 
Like mice , they gnaw us little by little . 
And we have to poison them not with matches , but with roubles . 
Yes ! 
Well , who is it ? '' 
`` Do you remember , when I was going to school , a Gymnasium student used to come up to us . 
Yozhov ? 
Such a dark little fellow ! '' 
`` Mm ! 
Of course , I saw him . 
I know him . 
So it 's he ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` The little mouse ! 
Even at that time one could see already that something wrong would come out of him . 
Even then he stood in the way of other people . 
A bold boy he was . 
I should have looked after him then . 
Perhaps , I might have made a man of him . '' 
Lubov looked at her father , smiled inimically , and asked hotly : `` And is n't he who writes for newspapers a man ? '' 
For a long while , the old man did not answer his daughter . 
Thoughtfully , he drummed with his fingers against the table and examined his face , which was reflected in the brightly polished brass of the samovar . 
Then he raised his head , winked his eyes and said impressively and irritably : `` They are not men , they are sores ! 
The blood of the Russian people has become mixed , it has become mixed and spoiled , and from the bad blood have come all these book and newspaper-writers , these terrible Pharisees . 
They have broken out everywhere , and they are still breaking out , more and more . 
Whence comes this spoiling of the blood ? 
From slowness of motion . 
Whence the mosquitoes , for instance ? 
From the swamp . 
All sorts of uncleanliness multiply in stagnant waters . 
The same is true of a disordered life . '' 
`` That is n't right , papa ! '' 
said Lubov , softly . 
`` What do you mean by -- not right ? '' 
`` Writers are the most unselfish people , they are noble personalities ! 
They do n't want anything -- all they strive for is justice -- truth ! 
They 're not mosquitoes . '' 
Lubov grew excited as she lauded her beloved people ; her face was flushed , and her eyes looked at her father with so much feeling , as though imploring him to believe her , being unable to convince him . 
`` Eh , you ! '' 
said the old man , with a sigh , interrupting her . 
`` You 've read too much ! 
You 've been poisoned ! 
Tell me -- who are they ? 
No one knows ! 
That Yozhov -- what is he ? 
Only God knows . 
All they want is the truth , you say ? 
What modest people they are ! 
And suppose truth is the very dearest thing there is ? 
Perhaps everybody is seeking it in silence ? 
Believe me -- man can not be unselfish . 
Man will not fight for what belongs not to him , and if he does fight -- his name is ` fool , ' and he is of no use to anybody . 
A man must be able to stand up for himself , for his own , then will he attain something ! 
Here you have it ! 
Truth ! 
Here I have been reading the same newspaper for almost forty years , and I can see well -- here is my face before you , and before me , there on the samovar is again my face , but it is another face . 
You see , these newspapers give a samovar face to everything , and do not see the real one . 
And yet you believe them . 
But I know that my face on the samovar is distorted . 
No one can tell the real truth ; man 's throat is too delicate for this . 
And then , the real truth is known to nobody . '' 
`` Papa ! '' 
exclaimed Lubov , sadly , `` But in books and in newspapers they defend the general interests of all the people . '' 
`` And in what paper is it written that you are weary of life , and that it was time for you to get married ? 
So , there your interest is not defended ! 
Eh ! 
You ! 
Neither is mine defended . 
Who knows what I need ? 
Who , but myself , understands my interests ? '' 
`` No , papa , that is n't right , that is n't right ! 
I can not refute you , but I feel that this is n't right ! '' 
said Lubov almost with despair . 
`` It is right ! '' 
said the old man , firmly . 
`` Russia is confused , and there is nothing steadfast in it ; everything is staggering ! 
Everybody lives awry , everybody walks on one side , there 's no harmony in life . 
All are yelling out of tune , in different voices . 
And not one understands what the other is in need of ! 
There is a mist over everything -- everybody inhales that mist , and that 's why the blood of the people has become spoiled -- hence the sores . 
Man is given great liberty to reason , but is not permitted to do anything -- that 's why man does not live ; but rots and stinks . '' 
`` What ought one to do , then ? '' 
asked Lubov , resting her elbows on the table and bending toward her father . 
`` Everything ! '' 
cried the old man , passionately . 
`` Do everything . 
Go ahead ! 
Let each man do whatever he knows best ! 
But for that liberty must be given to man -- complete freedom ! 
Since there has come a time , when everyraw youth believes that he knows everything and was created for the complete arrangement of life -- give him , give the rogue freedom ! 
Here , Carrion , live ! 
Come , come , live ! 
Ah ! 
Then such a comedy will follow ; feeling that his bridle is off , man will then rush up higher than his ears , and like a feather will fly hither and thither . 
He 'll believe himself to be a miracle worker , and then he 'll start to show his spirit . '' 
The old man paused awhile and , lowering his voice , went on , with a malicious smile : `` But there is very little of that creative spirit in him ! 
He 'll bristle up for a day or two , stretch himself on all sides -- and the poor fellow will soon grow weak . 
For his heart is rotten -- he , he , he ! 
Here , he , he , he ! 
The dear fellow will be caught by the real , worthy people , by those real people who are competent to be the actual civil masters , who will manage life not with a rod nor with a pen , but with a finger and with brains . 
`` What , they will say . 
Have you grown tired , gentlemen ? 
What , they will say , your spleens can not stand a real fire , can they ? 
So -- '' and , raising his voice , the old man concluded his speech in an authoritative tone : `` Well , then , now , you rabble , hold your tongues , and do n't squeak ! 
Or we 'll shake you off the earth , like worms from a tree ! 
Silence , dear fellows ! 
Ha , ha , ha ! 
That 's how it 's going to happen , Lubavka ! 
He , he , he ! '' 
The old man was in a merry mood . 
His wrinkles quivered , and carried away by his words , he trembled , closed his eyes now and then , and smacked his lips as though tasting his own wisdom . 
`` And then those who will take the upper hand in the confusion will arrange life wisely , after their own fashion . 
Then things wo n't go at random , but as if by rote . 
It 's a pity that we shall not live to see it ! '' 
The old man 's words fell one after another upon Lubov like meshes of a big strong net -- they fell and enmeshed her , and the girl , unable to free herself from them , maintained silence , dizzied by her father 's words . 
Staring into his face with an intense look , she sought support for herself in his words and heard in them something similar to what she had read in books , and which seemed to her the real truth . 
But the malignant , triumphant laughter of her father stung her heart , and the wrinkles , which seemed to creep about on his face like so many dark little snakes , inspired her with a certain fear for herself in his presence . 
She felt that he was turning her aside from what had seemed so simple and so easy in her dreams . 
`` Papa ! '' 
she suddenly asked the old man , in obedience to a thought and a desire that unexpectedly flashed through her mind . 
`` Papa ! 
and what sort of a man -- what in your opinion is Taras ? '' 
Mayakin shuddered . 
His eyebrows began to move angrily , he fixed his keen , small eyes on his daughter 's face and asked her drily : `` What sort of talk is this ? '' 
`` Must he not even be mentioned ? '' 
said Lubov , softly and confusedly . 
I do n't want to speak of him -- and I also advise you not to speak of him ! '' 
-- the old man threatened her with his finger and lowered his head with a gloomy frown . 
But when he said that he did not want to speak of his son , he evidently did not understand himself correctly , for after a minute 's silence he said sternly and angrily : `` Taraska , too , is a sore . 
Life is breathing upon you , milksops , and you can not discriminate its genuine scents , and you swallow all sorts of filth , wherefore there is trouble in your heads . 
That 's why you are not competent to do anything , and you are unhappy because of this incompetence . 
Taraska . 
Yes . 
He must be about forty now . 
He is lost to me ! 
A galley-slave -- is that my son ? 
A blunt-snouted young pig . 
He would not speak to his father , and -- he stumbled . '' 
`` What did he do ? '' 
asked Lubov , eagerly listening to the old man 's words . 
`` Who knows ? 
It may be that now he can not understand himself , if he became sensible , and he must have become a sensible man ; he 's the son of a father who 's not stupid , and then he must have suffered not a little . 
They coddle them , the nihilists ! 
They should have turned them over to me . 
I 'd show them what to do . 
Into the desert ! 
Into the isolated places -- march ! 
Come , now , my wise fellows , arrange life there according to your own will ! 
Go ahead ! 
And as authorities over them I 'd station the robust peasants . 
Well , now , honourable gentlemen , you were given to eat and to drink , you were given an education -- what have you learned ? 
Pay your debts , pray . 
Yes , I would not spend a broken grosh on them . 
I would squeeze all the price out of them -- give it up ! 
You must not set a man at naught . 
It is not enough to imprison him ! 
You transgressed the law , and are a gentleman ? 
Never mind , you must work . 
Out of a single seed comes an ear of corn , and a man ought not be permitted to perish without being of use ! 
An economical carpenter finds a place for each and every chip of wood -- just so must every man be profitably used up , and used up entire , to the very last vein . 
All sorts of trash have a place in life , and man is never trash . 
Eh ! 
it is bad when power lives without reason , nor is it good when reason lives without power . 
Take Foma now . 
Who is coming there -- give a look . '' 
Turning around , Lubov noticed the captain of the `` Yermak , '' Yefim , coming along the garden path . 
He had respectfully removed his cap and bowed to her . 
There was a hopelessly guilty expression on his face and he seemed abashed . 
Yakov Tarasovich recognized him and , instantly grown alarmed , he cried : `` Where are you coming from ? 
What has happened ? '' 
`` I -- I have come to you ! '' 
said Yefim , stopping short at the table , with a low bow . 
`` Well , I see , you 've come to me . 
What 's the matter ? 
Where 's the steamer ? '' 
`` The steamer is there ! '' 
Yefim thrust his hand somewhere into the air and heavily shifted from one foot to the other . 
`` Where is it , devil ? 
Speak coherently -- what has happened ? '' 
cried the old man , enraged . 
`` So -- a misfortune , Yakov . '' 
`` Have you been wrecked ? '' 
`` No , God saved us . '' 
`` Burned up ? 
Well , speak more quickly . '' 
Yefim drew air into his chest and said slowly : `` Barge No. 9 was sunk -- smashed up . 
One man 's back was broken , and one is altogether missing , so that he must have drowned . 
About five more were injured , but not so very badly , though some were disabled . '' 
`` So-o ! '' 
drawled out Mayakin , measuring the captain with an ill-omened look . 
`` Well , Yefimushka , I 'll strip your skin off . '' 
`` It was n't I who did it ! '' 
said Yefim , quickly . 
`` Not you ? '' 
cried the old man , shaking with rage . 
`` Who then ? '' 
`` The master himself . '' 
`` Foma ? 
And you . 
Where were you ? '' 
`` I was lying in the hatchway . '' 
`` Ah ! 
You were lying . '' 
`` I was bound there . '' 
`` Wha-at ? '' 
screamed the old man in a shrill voice . 
`` Allow me to tell you everything as it happened . 
He was drunk and he shouted : '' ` Get away ! 
I 'll take command myself ! ' 
I said ' I ca n't ! 
I am the captain . ' 
` Bind him ! ' 
said he . 
And when they had bound me , they lowered me into the hatchway , with the sailors . 
And as the master was drunk , he wanted to have some fun . 
A fleet of boats was coming toward us . 
Six empty barges towed by ` Cheruigorez . ' 
So Foma Ignatyich blocked their way . 
They whistled . 
More than once . 
I must tell the truth -- they whistled ! '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , and they could n't manage it -- the two barges in front crashed into us . 
And as they struck the side of our ninth , we were smashed to pieces . 
And the two barges were also smashed . 
But we fared much worse . '' 
Mayakin rose from the chair and burst into jarring , angry laughter . 
And Yefim sighed , and , outstretching his hands , said : `` He has a very violent character . 
When he is sober he is silent most of the time , and walks around thoughtfully , but when he wets his springs with wine -- then he breaks loose . 
Then he is not master of himself and of his business -- but their wild enemy -- you must excuse me ! 
And I want to leave , Yakov Tarasovich ! 
I am not used to being without a master , I can not live without a master ! '' 
`` Keep quiet ! '' 
said Mayakin , sternly . 
`` Where 's Foma ? '' 
`` There ; at the same place . 
Immediately after the accident , he came to himself and at once sent for workmen . 
They 'll lift the barge . 
They may have started by this time . '' 
`` Is he there alone ? '' 
asked Mayakin , lowering his head . 
`` Not quite , '' replied Yefim , softly , glancing stealthily at Lubov . 
`` Really ? '' 
`` There 's a lady with him . 
A dark one . '' 
`` So . '' 
`` It looks as though the woman is out of her wits , '' said Yefim , with a sigh . 
`` She 's forever singing . 
She sings very well . 
It 's very captivating . '' 
`` I am not asking you about her ! '' 
cried Mayakin , angrily . 
The wrinkles of his face were painfully quivering , and it seemed to Lubov that her father was about to weep . 
`` Calm yourself , papa ! '' 
she entreated caressingly . 
`` Maybe the loss is n't so great . '' 
`` Not great ? '' 
cried Yakov Tarasovich in a ringing voice . 
`` What do you understand , you fool ? 
Is it only that the barge was smashed ? 
Eh , you ! 
A man is lost ! 
That 's what it is ! 
And he is essential to me ! 
I need him , dull devils that you are ! '' 
The old man shook his head angrily and with brisk steps walked off along the garden path leading toward the house . 
And Foma was at this time about four hundred versts away from his godfather , in a village hut , on the shore of the Volga . 
He had just awakened from sleep , and lying on the floor , on a bed of fresh hay , in the middle of the hut , he gazed gloomily out of the window at the sky , which was covered with gray , scattered clouds . 
The wind was tearing them asunder and driving them somewhere ; heavy and weary , one overtaking another , they were passing across the sky in an enormous flock . 
Now forming a solid mass , now breaking into fragments , now falling low over the earth , in silent confusion , now again rising upward , one swallowed by another . 
Without moving his head , which was heavy from intoxication , Foma looked long at the clouds and finally began to feel as though silent clouds were also passing through his breast , -- passing , breathing a damp coldness upon his heart and oppressing him . 
There was something impotent in the motion of the clouds across the sky . 
And he felt the same within him . 
Without thinking , he pictured to himself all he had gone through during the past months . 
It seemed to him as though he had fallen into a turbid , boiling stream , and now he had been seized by dark waves , that resembled these clouds in the sky ; had been seized and carried away somewhere , even as the clouds were carried by the wind . 
In the darkness and the tumult which surrounded him , he saw as though through a mist that certain other people were hastening together with him -- to-day not those of yesterday , new ones each day , yet all looking alike -- equally pitiful and repulsive . 
Intoxicated , noisy , greedy , they flew about him as in a whirlwind , caroused at his expense , abused him , fought , screamed , and even wept more than once . 
And he beat them . 
He remembered that one day he had struck somebody on the face , torn someone 's coat off and thrown it into the water and that some one had kissed his hands with wet , cold lips as disgusting as frogs . 
Had kissed and wept , imploring him not to kill . 
Certain faces flashed through his memory , certain sounds and words rang in it . 
A woman in a yellow silk waist , unfastened at the breast , had sung in a loud , sobbing voice : `` And so let us live while we can And then -- e ` en grass may cease to grow . '' 
All these people , like himself , grown wild and beastlike , were seized by the same dark wave and carried away like rubbish . 
All these people , like himself , must have been afraid to look forward to see whither this powerful , wild wave was carrying them . 
And drowning their fear in wine , they were rushing forward down the current struggling , shouting , doing something absurd , playing the fool , clamouring , clamouring , without ever being cheerful . 
He was doing the same , whirling in their midst . 
And now it seemed to him , that he was doing all this for fear of himself , in order to pass the sooner this strip of life , or in order not to think of what would be afterward . 
Amid the burning turmoil of carouses , in the crowd of people , seized by debauchery , perplexed by violent passions , half-crazy in their longing to forget themselves -- only Sasha was calm and contained . 
She never drank to intoxication , always addressed people in a firm , authoritative voice , and all her movements were equally confident , as though this stream had not taken possession of her , but she was herself mastering its violent course . 
She seemed to Foma the cleverest person of all those that surrounded him , and the most eager for noise and carouse ; she held them all in her sway , forever inventing something new and speaking in one and the same manner to everybody ; for the driver , the lackey and the sailor she had the same tone and the same words as for her friends and for Foma . 
She was younger and prettier than Pelageya , but her caresses were silent , cold . 
Foma imagined that deep in her heart she was concealing from everybody something terrible , that she would never love anyone , never reveal herself entire . 
This secrecy in the woman attracted him toward her with a feeling of timorous curiosity , of a great , strained interest in her calm , cold soul , which seemed even as dark as her eyes . 
Somehow Foma said to her one day : `` But what piles of money you and I have squandered ! '' 
She glanced at him , and asked : `` And why should we save it ? '' 
`` Indeed , why ? '' 
thought Foma , astonished by the fact that she reasoned so simply . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
he asked her at another occasion . 
`` Why , have you forgotten my name ? '' 
`` Well , the idea ! '' 
`` What do you wish to know then ? '' 
`` I am asking you about your origin . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I am a native of the province of Yaroslavl . 
I 'm from Ooglich . 
I was a harpist . 
Well , shall I taste sweeter to you , now that you know who I am ? ''
