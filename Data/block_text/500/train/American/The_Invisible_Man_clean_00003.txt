Just imagination ? '' 
`` What else can you be ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rubbing the back of his neck . 
`` Very well , '' said the Voice , in a tone of relief . 
`` Then I 'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently . '' 
`` But where are yer ? '' 
The Voice made no answer . 
Whizz came a flint , apparently out of the air , and missed Mr. Marvel 's shoulder by a hair 's - breadth . 
Mr. Marvel , turning , saw a flint jerk up into the air , trace a complicated path , hang for a moment , and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity . 
He was too amazed to dodge . 
Whizz it came , and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud . 
Then he started to run , tripped over an unseen obstacle , and came head over heels into a sitting position . '' 
Now , '' said the Voice , as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp . 
`` Am I imagination ? '' 
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet , and was immediately rolled over again . 
He lay quiet for a moment . 
`` If you struggle any more , '' said the Voice , `` I shall throw the flint at your head . '' 
`` It 's a fair do , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , sitting up , taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile . 
`` I do n't understand it . 
Stones flinging themselves . 
Stones talking . 
Put yourself down . 
Rot away . 
I 'm done . '' 
The third flint fell . 
`` It 's very simple , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm an invisible man . '' 
`` Tell us something I do n't know , '' said Mr. Marvel , gasping with pain . 
`` Where you 've hid -- how you do it -- I do n't know . 
I 'm beat . '' 
`` That 's all , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's what I want you to understand . '' 
`` Anyone could see that . 
There is no need for you to be so confounded impatient , mister . 
Now then . 
Give us a notion . 
How are you hid ? '' 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's the great point . 
And what I want you to understand is this -- '' `` But whereabouts ? '' 
interrupted Mr. Marvel . 
`` Here ! 
Six yards in front of you . '' 
`` Oh , come ! 
I ai n't blind . 
You 'll be telling me next you 're just thin air . 
I 'm not one of your ignorant tramps -- '' `` Yes , I am -- thin air . 
You 're looking through me . '' 
`` What ! 
Ai n't there any stuff to you . 
Vox et -- what is it ? 
-- jabber . 
Is it that ? '' 
`` I am just a human being -- solid , needing food and drink , needing covering too -- But I 'm invisible . 
You see ? 
Invisible . 
Simple idea . 
Invisible . '' 
`` What , real like ? '' 
`` Yes , real . '' 
`` Let 's have a hand of you , '' said Marvel , `` if you are real . 
It wo n't be so darn out-of-the-way like , then -- Lord ! '' 
he said , `` how you made me jump ! 
-- gripping me like that ! '' 
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers , and his fingers went timorously up the arm , patted a muscular chest , and explored a bearded face . 
Marvel 's face was astonishment . 
`` I 'm dashed ! '' 
he said . 
`` If this do n't beat cock-fighting ! 
Most remarkable ! 
-- And there I can see a rabbit clean through you , ` arf a mile away ! 
Not a bit of you visible -- except -- '' He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly . 
`` You ` ave n't been eatin ' bread and cheese ? '' 
he asked , holding the invisible arm . 
`` You 're quite right , and it 's not quite assimilated into the system . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Sort of ghostly , though . '' 
`` Of course , all this is n't half so wonderful as you think . '' 
`` It 's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Howjer manage it ! 
How the dooce is it done ? '' 
`` It 's too long a story . 
And besides -- '' `` I tell you , the whole business fairly beats me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` What I want to say at present is this : I need help . 
I have come to that -- I came upon you suddenly . 
I was wandering , mad with rage , naked , impotent . 
I could have murdered . 
And I saw you -- '' '' Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I came up behind you -- hesitated -- went on -- '' Mr. Marvel 's expression was eloquent . '' 
-- then stopped . 
` Here , ' I said , ` is an outcast like myself . 
This is the man for me . ' 
So I turned back and came to you -- you . 
And -- '' '' Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But I 'm all in a tizzy . 
May I ask -- How is it ? 
And what you may be requiring in the way of help ? 
-- Invisible ! '' 
`` I want you to help me get clothes -- and shelter -- and then , with other things . 
I 've left them long enough . 
If you wo n't -- well ! 
But you will -- must . '' 
`` Look here , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I 'm too flabbergasted . 
Do n't knock me about any more . 
And leave me go . 
I must get steady a bit . 
And you 've pretty near broken my toe . 
It 's all so unreasonable . 
Empty downs , empty sky . 
Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature . 
And then comes a voice . 
A voice out of heaven ! 
And stones ! 
And a fist -- Lord ! '' 
`` Pull yourself together , '' said the Voice , `` for you have to do the job I 've chosen for you . '' 
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks , and his eyes were round . 
`` I 've chosen you , '' said the Voice . 
`` You are the only man except some of those fools down there , who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man . 
You have to be my helper . 
Help me -- and I will do great things for you . 
An invisible man is a man of power . '' 
He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently . 
`` But if you betray me , '' he said , `` if you fail to do as I direct you -- '' He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel 's shoulder smartly . 
Mr. Marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch . 
`` I do n't want to betray you , '' said Mr. Marvel , edging away from the direction of the fingers . 
`` Do n't you go a-thinking that , whatever you do . 
All I want to do is to help you -- just tell me what I got to do . 
-LRB- Lord ! -RRB- 
Whatever you want done , that I 'm most willing to do . '' 
After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative . 
Scepticism suddenly reared its head -- rather nervous scepticism , not at all assured of its back , but scepticism nevertheless . 
It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man ; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air , or felt the strength of his arm , could be counted on the fingers of two hands . 
And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing , having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house , and Jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller , more tangible considerations . 
Iping was gay with bunting , and everybody was in gala dress . 
Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or more . 
By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion , on the supposition that he had quite gone away , and with the sceptics he was already a jest . 
But people , sceptics and believers alike , were remarkably sociable all that day . 
Haysman 's meadow was gay with a tent , in which Mrs. Bunting and other ladies were preparing tea , while , without , the Sunday-school children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut . 
No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air , but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced . 
On the village green an inclined strong -LSB- rope ? -RSB- 
, down which , clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle , one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end , came in for considerable favour among the adolescents , as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies . 
There was also promenading , and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music . 
Members of the club , who had attended church in the morning , were splendid in badges of pink and green , and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon . 
Old Fletcher , whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe , was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door -LRB- whichever way you chose to look -RRB- , poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs , and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room . 
About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs . 
He was a short , stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat , and he appeared to be very much out of breath . 
His cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed . 
His mottled face was apprehensive , and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity . 
He turned the corner of the church , and directed his way to the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him , and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him . 
This stranger , to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , appeared to be talking to himself , and Mr. Huxter remarked the same thing . 
He stopped at the foot of the `` Coach and Horses '' steps , and , according to Mr. Huxter , appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house . 
Finally he marched up the steps , and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour . 
Mr. Huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error . 
`` That room 's private ! '' 
said Hall , and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar . 
In the course of a few minutes he reappeared , wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed . 
He stood looking about him for some moments , and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard , upon which the parlour window opened . 
The stranger , after some hesitation , leant against one of the gate-posts , produced a short clay pipe , and prepared to fill it . 
His fingers trembled while doing so . 
He lit it clumsily , and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude , an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied . 
All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window , and the singularity of the man 's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation . 
Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket . 
Then he vanished into the yard . 
Forthwith Mr. Huxter , conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny , leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief . 
As he did so , Mr. Marvel reappeared , his hat askew , a big bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand , and three books tied together -- as it proved afterwards with the Vicar 's braces -- in the other . 
Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp , and turning sharply to the left , began to run . 
`` Stop , thief ! '' 
cried Huxter , and set off after him . 
Mr. Huxter 's sensations were vivid but brief . 
He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road . 
He saw the village flags and festivities beyond , and a face or so turned towards him . 
He bawled , `` Stop ! '' 
again . 
He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion , and he was no longer running , but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air . 
He saw the ground suddenly close to his face . 
The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light , and subsequent proceedings interested him no more . 
Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn , it is necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view of Mr. Huxter 's window . 
At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour . 
They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning , and were , with Mr. Hall 's permission , making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man 's belongings . 
Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends . 
The stranger 's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up . 
And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work , Cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled `` Diary . '' 
`` Diary ! '' 
said Cuss , putting the three books on the table . 
`` Now , at any rate , we shall learn something . '' 
The Vicar stood with his hands on the table . 
`` Diary , '' repeated Cuss , sitting down , putting two volumes to support the third , and opening it . 
`` H 'm -- no name on the fly-leaf . 
Bother ! 
-- cypher . 
And figures . '' 
The vicar came round to look over his shoulder . 
Cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed . 
`` I 'm -- dear me ! 
It 's all cypher , Bunting . '' 
`` There are no diagrams ? '' 
asked Mr. Bunting . 
`` No illustrations throwing light -- '' `` See for yourself , '' said Mr. Cuss . 
`` Some of it 's mathematical and some of it 's Russian or some such language -LRB- to judge by the letters -RRB- , and some of it 's Greek . 
Now the Greek I thought you -- '' `` Of course , '' said Mr. Bunting , taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable -- for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about ; `` yes -- the Greek , of course , may furnish a clue . '' 
`` I 'll find you a place . '' 
`` I 'd rather glance through the volumes first , '' said Mr. Bunting , still wiping . 
`` A general impression first , Cuss , and then , you know , we can go looking for clues . '' 
He coughed , put on his glasses , arranged them fastidiously , coughed again , and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure . 
Then he took the volume Cuss handed him in a leisurely manner . 
And then something did happen . 
The door opened suddenly . 
Both gentlemen started violently , looked round , and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat . 
`` Tap ? '' 
asked the face , and stood staring . 
`` No , '' said both gentlemen at once . 
`` Over the other side , my man , '' said Mr. Bunting . 
And `` Please shut that door , '' said Mr. Cuss , irritably . 
`` All right , '' said the intruder , as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry . 
`` Right you are , '' said the intruder in the former voice . 
`` Stand clear ! '' 
and he vanished and closed the door . 
`` A sailor , I should judge , '' said Mr. Bunting . 
`` Amusing fellows , they are . 
Stand clear ! 
indeed . 
A nautical term , referring to his getting back out of the room , I suppose . '' 
`` I daresay so , '' said Cuss . 
`` My nerves are all loose to-day . 
It quite made me jump -- the door opening like that . '' 
Mr. Bunting smiled as if he had not jumped . 
`` And now , '' he said with a sigh , `` these books . '' 
Someone sniffed as he did so . 
`` One thing is indisputable , '' said Bunting , drawing up a chair next to that of Cuss . 
`` There certainly have been very strange things happen in Iping during the last few days -- very strange . 
I can not of course believe in this absurd invisibility story -- '' `` It 's incredible , '' said Cuss -- `` incredible . 
But the fact remains that I saw -- I certainly saw right down his sleeve -- '' `` But did you -- are you sure ? 
Suppose a mirror , for instance -- hallucinations are so easily produced . 
I do n't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror -- '' `` I wo n't argue again , '' said Cuss . 
`` We 've thrashed that out , Bunting . 
And just now there 's these books -- Ah ! 
here 's some of what I take to be Greek ! 
Greek letters certainly . '' 
He pointed to the middle of the page . 
Mr. Bunting flushed slightly and brought his face nearer , apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses . 
Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck . 
He tried to raise his head , and encountered an immovable resistance . 
The feeling was a curious pressure , the grip of a heavy , firm hand , and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table . 
`` Do n't move , little men , '' whispered a voice , `` or I 'll brain you both ! '' 
He looked into the face of Cuss , close to his own , and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment . 
`` I 'm sorry to handle you so roughly , '' said the Voice , `` but it 's unavoidable . '' 
`` Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator 's private memoranda , '' said the Voice ; and two chins struck the table simultaneously , and two sets of teeth rattled . 
`` Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune ? '' 
and the concussion was repeated . 
`` Where have they put my clothes ? '' 
`` Listen , '' said the Voice . 
`` The windows are fastened and I 've taken the key out of the door . 
I am a fairly strong man , and I have the poker handy -- besides being invisible . 
There 's not the slightest doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to -- do you understand ? 
Very well . 
If I let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what I tell you ? '' 
The vicar and the doctor looked at one another , and the doctor pulled a face . 
`` Yes , '' said Mr. Bunting , and the doctor repeated it . 
Then the pressure on the necks relaxed , and the doctor and the vicar sat up , both very red in the face and wriggling their heads . 
`` Please keep sitting where you are , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` Here 's the poker , you see . '' 
`` When I came into this room , '' continued the Invisible Man , after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors , `` I did not expect to find it occupied , and I expected to find , in addition to my books of memoranda , an outfit of clothing . 
Where is it ? 
No -- do n't rise . 
I can see it 's gone . 
Now , just at present , though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark , the evenings are quite chilly . 
I want clothing -- and other accommodation ; and I must also have those three books . '' 
It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again , for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent . 
While these things were going on in the parlour , and while Mr. Huxter was watching Mr. Marvel smoking his pipe against the gate , not a dozen yards away were Mr. Hall and Teddy Henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic . 
Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour , a sharp cry , and then -- silence . 
`` Hul-lo ! '' 
said Teddy Henfrey . 
`` Hul-lo ! '' 
from the Tap . 
Mr. Hall took things in slowly but surely . 
`` That ai n't right , '' he said , and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door . 
He and Teddy approached the door together , with intent faces . 
Their eyes considered . 
`` Summat wrong , '' said Hall , and Henfrey nodded agreement . 
Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them , and there was a muffled sound of conversation , very rapid and subdued . 
`` You all right thur ? '' 
asked Hall , rapping . 
The muttered conversation ceased abruptly , for a moment silence , then the conversation was resumed , in hissing whispers , then a sharp cry of `` No ! 
no , you do n't ! '' 
There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair , a brief struggle . 
Silence again . 
`` What the dooce ? '' 
exclaimed Henfrey , sotto voce . 
`` You -- all -- right thur ? '' 
asked Mr. Hall , sharply , again . 
The Vicar 's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation : `` Quite ri-right . 
Please do n't -- interrupt . '' 
`` Odd ! '' 
said Mr. Henfrey . 
`` Odd ! '' 
said Mr. Hall . 
`` Says , ` Do n't interrupt , ' '' said Henfrey . 
`` I heerd ` n , '' said Hall . 
`` And a sniff , '' said Henfrey . 
They remained listening . 
The conversation was rapid and subdued . 
`` I ca n't , '' said Mr. Bunting , his voice rising ; `` I tell you , sir , I will not . '' 
`` What was that ? '' 
asked Henfrey . 
`` Says he wi ' nart , '' said Hall . 
`` War n't speaking to us , wuz he ? '' 
`` Disgraceful ! '' 
said Mr. Bunting , within . '' 
` Disgraceful , ' '' said Mr. Henfrey . 
`` I heard it -- distinct . '' 
`` Who 's that speaking now ? '' 
asked Henfrey . 
`` Mr. Cuss , I s ` pose , '' said Hall . 
`` Can you hear -- anything ? '' 
Silence . 
The sounds within indistinct and perplexing . 
`` Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about , '' said Hall . 
Mrs. Hall appeared behind the bar . 
Hall made gestures of silence and invitation . 
This aroused Mrs. Hall 's wifely opposition . 
`` What yer listenin ' there for , Hall ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Ai n't you nothin ' better to do -- busy day like this ? '' 
Hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show , but Mrs. Hall was obdurate . 
She raised her voice . 
So Hall and Henfrey , rather crestfallen , tiptoed back to the bar , gesticulating to explain to her . 
At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all . 
Then she insisted on Hall keeping silence , while Henfrey told her his story . 
She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense -- perhaps they were just moving the furniture about . 
`` I heerd 'n say ` disgraceful ' ; that I did , '' said Hall . '' 
I heerd that , Mrs. Hall , '' said Henfrey . 
`` Like as not -- '' began Mrs. Hall . 
`` Hsh ! '' 
said Mr. Teddy Henfrey . 
`` Did n't I hear the window ? '' 
`` What window ? '' 
asked Mrs. Hall . 
`` Parlour window , '' said Henfrey . 
Everyone stood listening intently . 
Mrs. Hall 's eyes , directed straight before her , saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door , the road white and vivid , and Huxter 's shop-front blistering in the June sun . 
Abruptly Huxter 's door opened and Huxter appeared , eyes staring with excitement , arms gesticulating . 
`` Yap ! '' 
cried Huxter . 
`` Stop thief ! '' 
and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates , and vanished . 
Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour , and a sound of windows being closed . 
Hall , Henfrey , and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell into the street . 
They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road , and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder . 
Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them . 
Mr. Huxter was stunned . 
Henfrey stopped to discover this , but Hall and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner , shouting incoherent things , and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall . 
They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the Invisible Man suddenly become visible , and set off at once along the lane in pursuit . 
But Hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways , clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground . 
He had been charged just as one charges a man at football . 
The second labourer came round in a circle , stared , and conceiving that Hall had tumbled over of his own accord , turned to resume the pursuit , only to be tripped by the ankle just as Huxter had been . 
Then , as the first labourer struggled to his feet , he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox . 
As he went down , the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner . 
The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , a burly man in a blue jersey . 
He was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground . 
And then something happened to his rear-most foot , and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner , following headlong . 
The two were then kicked , knelt on , fallen over , and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty people . 
Now when Hall and Henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house , Mrs. Hall , who had been disciplined by years of experience , remained in the bar next the till . 
And suddenly the parlour door was opened , and Mr. Cuss appeared , and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Do n't let him drop that parcel . '' 
He knew nothing of the existence of Marvel . 
For the Invisible Man had handed over the books and bundle in the yard . 
The face of Mr. Cuss was angry and resolute , but his costume was defective , a sort of limp white kilt that could only have passed muster in Greece . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
he bawled . 
`` He 's got my trousers ! 
And every stitch of the Vicar 's clothes ! '' '' 
` Tend to him in a minute ! '' 
he cried to Henfrey as he passed the prostrate Huxter , and , coming round the corner to join the tumult , was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl . 
Somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger . 
He yelled , struggled to regain his feet , was knocked against and thrown on all fours again , and became aware that he was involved not in a capture , but a rout . 
Everyone was running back to the village . 
He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear . 
He staggered and set off back to the `` Coach and Horses '' forthwith , leaping over the deserted Huxter , who was now sitting up , on his way . 
Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage , rising sharply out of the confusion of cries , and a sounding smack in someone 's face . 
He recognised the voice as that of the Invisible Man , and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow . 
In another moment Mr. Cuss was back in the parlour . 
`` He 's coming back , Bunting ! '' 
he said , rushing in . 
`` Save yourself ! '' 
Mr. Bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself in the hearth-rug and a West Surrey Gazette . 
`` Who 's coming ? '' 
he said , so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration . 
`` Invisible Man , '' said Cuss , and rushed on to the window . 
`` We 'd better clear out from here ! 
He 's fighting mad ! 
Mad ! '' 
In another moment he was out in the yard . 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
said Mr. Bunting , hesitating between two horrible alternatives . 
He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn , and his decision was made . 
He clambered out of the window , adjusted his costume hastily , and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him . 
From the moment when the Invisible Man screamed with rage and Mr. Bunting made his memorable flight up the village , it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping . 
Possibly the Invisible Man 's original intention was simply to cover Marvel 's retreat with the clothes and books . 
But his temper , at no time very good , seems to have gone completely at some chance blow , and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing , for the mere satisfaction of hurting . 
You must figure the street full of running figures , of doors slamming and fights for hiding-places . 
You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher 's planks and two chairs -- with cataclysmic results . 
You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing . 
And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen , and littered with cocoanuts , overthrown canvas screens , and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall . 
Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts , and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane . 
The Invisible Man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the `` Coach and Horses , '' and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble . 
He it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins ' cottage on the Adderdean road . 
And after that , as his peculiar qualities allowed , he passed out of human perceptions altogether , and he was neither heard , seen , nor felt in Iping any more . 
He vanished absolutely . 
But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street . 
When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday , a short , thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst . 
He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature , and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth . 
His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue ; he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry . 
He was accompanied by a voice other than his own , and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands . 
`` If you give me the slip again , '' said the Voice , `` if you attempt to give me the slip again -- '' `` Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` That shoulder 's a mass of bruises as it is . '' 
`` On my honour , '' said the Voice , `` I will kill you . '' 
`` I did n't try to give you the slip , '' said Marvel , in a voice that was not far remote from tears . 
`` I swear I did n't . 
I did n't know the blessed turning , that was all ! 
How the devil was I to know the blessed turning ? 
As it is , I 've been knocked about -- '' `` You 'll get knocked about a great deal more if you do n't mind , '' said the Voice , and Mr. Marvel abruptly became silent . 
He blew out his cheeks , and his eyes were eloquent of despair . 
`` It 's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret , without your cutting off with my books . 
It 's lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did ! 
Here am I ... No one knew I was invisible ! 
And now what am I to do ? '' 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
asked Marvel , sotto voce . 
`` It 's all about . 
It will be in the papers ! 
Everybody will be looking for me ; everyone on their guard -- '' The Voice broke off into vivid curses and ceased . 
The despair of Mr. Marvel 's face deepened , and his pace slackened . 
`` Go on ! '' 
said the Voice . 
Mr. Marvel 's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches . 
`` Do n't drop those books , stupid , '' said the Voice , sharply -- overtaking him . 
`` The fact is , '' said the Voice , `` I shall have to make use of you ... . 
You 're a poor tool , but I must . '' 
`` I 'm a miserable tool , '' said Marvel . 
`` You are , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm the worst possible tool you could have , '' said Marvel . 
`` I 'm not strong , '' he said after a discouraging silence . 
`` I 'm not over strong , '' he repeated . 
`` No ? '' 
`` And my heart 's weak . 
That little business -- I pulled it through , of course -- but bless you ! 
I could have dropped . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` I have n't the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want . '' '' 
I 'll stimulate you . '' 
`` I wish you would n't . 
I would n't like to mess up your plans , you know . 
But I might -- out of sheer funk and misery . '' 
`` You 'd better not , '' said the Voice , with quiet emphasis . 
`` I wish I was dead , '' said Marvel . 
`` It ai n't justice , '' he said ; `` you must admit ... . 
It seems to me I 've a perfect right -- '' '' Get on ! '' 
said the Voice . 
Mr. Marvel mended his pace , and for a time they went in silence again . 
`` It 's devilish hard , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
This was quite ineffectual . 
He tried another tack . 
`` What do I make by it ? '' 
he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong . 
`` Oh ! 
shut up ! '' 
said the Voice , with sudden amazing vigour . 
`` I 'll see to you all right . 
You do what you 're told . 
You 'll do it all right . 
You 're a fool and all that , but you 'll do -- '' `` I tell you , sir , I 'm not the man for it . 
Respectfully -- but it is so -- '' `` If you do n't shut up I shall twist your wrist again , '' said the Invisible Man . 
`` I want to think . '' 
Presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees , and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming . 
`` I shall keep my hand on your shoulder , '' said the Voice , `` all through the village . 
Go straight through and try no foolery . 
It will be the worse for you if you do . '' 
`` I know that , '' sighed Mr. Marvel , `` I know all that . '' 
The unhappy-looking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the little village with his burdens , and vanished into the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows . 
Ten o'clock the next morning found Mr. Marvel , unshaven , dirty , and travel-stained , sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets , looking very weary , nervous , and uncomfortable , and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals , on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe . 
Beside him were the books , but now they were tied with string . 
The bundle had been abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst , in accordance with a change in the plans of the Invisible Man . 
Mr. Marvel sat on the bench , and although no one took the slightest notice of him , his agitation remained at fever heat . 
His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling . 
When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him . 
`` Pleasant day , '' said the mariner . 
Mr. Marvel glanced about him with something very like terror . 
`` Very , '' he said . 
`` Just seasonable weather for the time of year , '' said the mariner , taking no denial .
