I was travelling post from Tiflis . 
All the luggage I had in my cart consisted of one small portmanteau half filled with travelling-notes on Georgia ; of these the greater part has been lost , fortunately for you ; but the portmanteau itself and the rest of its contents have remained intact , fortunately for me . 
As I entered the Koishaur Valley the sun was disappearing behind the snow-clad ridge of the mountains . 
In order to accomplish the ascent of Mount Koishaur by nightfall , my driver , an Ossete , urged on the horses indefatigably , singing zealously the while at the top of his voice . 
What a glorious place that valley is ! 
On every hand are inaccessible mountains , steep , yellow slopes scored by water-channels , and reddish rocks draped with green ivy and crowned with clusters of plane-trees . 
Yonder , at an immense height , is the golden fringe of the snow . 
Down below rolls the River Aragva , which , after bursting noisily forth from the dark and misty depths of the gorge , with an unnamed stream clasped in its embrace , stretches out like a thread of silver , its waters glistening like a snake with flashing scales . 
Arrived at the foot of Mount Koishaur , we stopped at a dukhan . 
-LSB- 1 -RSB- About a score of Georgians and mountaineers were gathered there in a noisy crowd , and , close by , a caravan of camels had halted for the night . 
I was obliged to hire oxen to drag my cart up that accursed mountain , as it was now autumn and the roads were slippery with ice . 
Besides , the mountain is about two versts -LSB- 2 -RSB- in length . 
There was no help for it , so I hired six oxen and a few Ossetes . 
One of the latter shouldered my portmanteau , and the rest , shouting almost with one voice , proceeded to help the oxen . 
Following mine there came another cart , which I was surprised to see four oxen pulling with the greatest ease , notwithstanding that it was loaded to the top . 
Behind it walked the owner , smoking a little , silver-mounted Kabardian pipe . 
He was wearing a shaggy Circassian cap and an officer 's overcoat without epaulettes , and he seemed to be about fifty years of age . 
The swarthiness of his complexion showed that his face had long been acquainted with Transcaucasian suns , and the premature greyness of his moustache was out of keeping with his firm gait and robust appearance . 
I went up to him and saluted . 
He silently returned my greeting and emitted an immense cloud of smoke . 
`` We are fellow-travellers , it appears . '' 
Again he bowed silently . 
`` I suppose you are going to Stavropol ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , exactly -- with Government things . '' 
`` Can you tell me how it is that that heavily-laden cart of yours is being drawn without any difficulty by four oxen , whilst six cattle are scarcely able to move mine , empty though it is , and with all those Ossetes helping ? '' 
He smiled slyly and threw me a meaning glance . 
`` You have not been in the Caucasus long , I should say ? '' 
`` About a year , '' I answered . 
He smiled a second time . 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Just so , sir , '' he answered . 
`` They 're terrible beasts , these Asiatics ! 
You think that all that shouting means that they are helping the oxen ? 
Why , the devil alone can make out what it is they do shout . 
The oxen understand , though ; and if you were to yoke as many as twenty they still would n't budge so long as the Ossetes shouted in that way of theirs ... . 
Awful scoundrels ! 
But what can you make of them ? 
They love extorting money from people who happen to be travelling through here . 
The rogues have been spoiled ! 
You wait and see : they will get a tip out of you as well as their hire . 
I know them of old , they ca n't get round me ! '' 
`` You have been serving here a long time ? '' 
`` Yes , I was here under Aleksei Petrovich , '' -LSB- 3 -RSB- he answered , assuming an air of dignity . 
`` I was a sub-lieutenant when he came to the Line ; and I was promoted twice , during his command , on account of actions against the mountaineers . '' 
`` And now -- ? '' 
`` Now I 'm in the third battalion of the Line . 
And you yourself ? '' 
I told him . 
With this the conversation ended , and we continued to walk in silence , side by side . 
On the summit of the mountain we found snow . 
The sun set , and -- as usually is the case in the south -- night followed upon the day without any interval of twilight . 
Thanks , however , to the sheen of the snow , we were able easily to distinguish the road , which still went up the mountain-side , though not so steeply as before . 
I ordered the Ossetes to put my portmanteau into the cart , and to replace the oxen by horses . 
Then for the last time I gazed down upon the valley ; but the thick mist which had gushed in billows from the gorges veiled it completely , and not a single sound now floated up to our ears from below . 
The Ossetes surrounded me clamorously and demanded tips ; but the staff-captain shouted so menacingly at them that they dispersed in a moment . 
`` What a people they are ! '' 
he said . 
`` They do n't even know the Russian for ` bread , ' but they have mastered the phrase ` Officer , give us a tip ! ' 
In my opinion , the very Tartars are better , they are no drunkards , anyhow . '' 
... We were now within a verst or so of the Station . 
Around us all was still , so still , indeed , that it was possible to follow the flight of a gnat by the buzzing of its wings . 
On our left loomed the gorge , deep and black . 
Behind it and in front of us rose the dark-blue summits of the mountains , all trenched with furrows and covered with layers of snow , and standing out against the pale horizon , which still retained the last reflections of the evening glow . 
The stars twinkled out in the dark sky , and in some strange way it seemed to me that they were much higher than in our own north country . 
On both sides of the road bare , black rocks jutted out ; here and there shrubs peeped forth from under the snow ; but not a single withered leaf stirred , and amid that dead sleep of nature it was cheering to hear the snorting of the three tired post-horses and the irregular tinkling of the Russian bell . 
-LSB- 4 -RSB- `` We will have glorious weather to-morrow , '' I said . 
The staff-captain answered not a word , but pointed with his finger to a lofty mountain which rose directly opposite us . 
`` What is it ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Mount Gut . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Do n't you see how it is smoking ? '' 
True enough , smoke was rising from Mount Gut . 
Over its sides gentle cloud-currents were creeping , and on the summit rested one cloud of such dense blackness that it appeared like a blot upon the dark sky . 
By this time we were able to make out the Post Station and the roofs of the huts surrounding it ; the welcoming lights were twinkling before us , when suddenly a damp and chilly wind arose , the gorge rumbled , and a drizzling rain fell . 
I had scarcely time to throw my felt cloak round me when down came the snow . 
I looked at the staff-captain with profound respect . 
`` We shall have to pass the night here , '' he said , vexation in his tone . 
`` There 's no crossing the mountains in such a blizzard . 
-- I say , have there been any avalanches on Mount Krestov ? '' 
he inquired of the driver . 
`` No , sir , '' the Ossete answered ; `` but there are a great many threatening to fall -- a great many . '' 
Owing to the lack of a travellers ' room in the Station , we were assigned a night 's lodging in a smoky hut . 
I invited my fellow-traveller to drink a tumbler of tea with me , as I had brought my cast-iron teapot -- my only solace during my travels in the Caucasus . 
One side of the hut was stuck against the cliff , and three wet and slippery steps led up to the door . 
I groped my way in and stumbled up against a cow -LRB- with these people the cow-house supplies the place of a servant 's room -RRB- . 
I did not know which way to turn -- sheep were bleating on the one hand and a dog growling on the other . 
Fortunately , however , I perceived on one side a faint glimmer of light , and by its aid I was able to find another opening by way of a door . 
And here a by no means uninteresting picture was revealed . 
The wide hut , the roof of which rested on two smoke-grimed pillars , was full of people . 
In the centre of the floor a small fire was crackling , and the smoke , driven back by the wind from an opening in the roof , was spreading around in so thick a shroud that for a long time I was unable to see about me . 
Seated by the fire were two old women , a number of children and a lank Georgian -- all of them in tatters . 
There was no help for it ! 
We took refuge by the fire and lighted our pipes ; and soon the teapot was singing invitingly . 
`` Wretched people , these ! '' 
I said to the staff-captain , indicating our dirty hosts , who were silently gazing at us in a kind of torpor . 
`` And an utterly stupid people too ! '' 
he replied . 
`` Would you believe it , they are absolutely ignorant and incapable of the slightest civilisation ! 
Why even our Kabardians or Chechenes , robbers and ragamuffins though they be , are regular dare-devils for all that . 
Whereas these others have no liking for arms , and you 'll never see a decent dagger on one of them ! 
Ossetes all over ! '' 
`` You have been a long time in the Chechenes ' country ? '' 
`` Yes , I was quartered there for about ten years along with my company in a fortress , near Kamennyi Brod . 
-LSB- 5 -RSB- Do you know the place ? '' 
`` I have heard the name . '' 
`` I can tell you , my boy , we had quite enough of those dare-devil Chechenes . 
At the present time , thank goodness , things are quieter ; but in the old days you had only to put a hundred paces between you and the rampart and wherever you went you would be sure to find a shaggy devil lurking in wait for you . 
You had just to let your thoughts wander and at any moment a lasso would be round your neck or a bullet in the back of your head ! 
Brave fellows , though ! '' 
... `` You used to have many an adventure , I dare say ? '' 
I said , spurred by curiosity . 
`` Of course ! 
Many a one . '' 
... Hereupon he began to tug at his left moustache , let his head sink on to his breast , and became lost in thought . 
I had a very great mind to extract some little anecdote out of him -- a desire natural to all who travel and make notes . 
Meanwhile , tea was ready . 
I took two travelling-tumblers out of my portmanteau , and , filling one of them , set it before the staff-captain . 
He sipped his tea and said , as if speaking to himself , `` Yes , many a one ! '' 
This exclamation gave me great hopes . 
Your old Caucasian officer loves , I know , to talk and yarn a bit ; he so rarely succeeds in getting a chance to do so . 
It may be his fate to be quartered five years or so with his company in some out-of-the-way place , and during the whole of that time he will not hear `` good morning '' from a soul -LRB- because the sergeant says `` good health '' -RRB- . 
And , indeed , he would have good cause to wax loquacious -- with a wild and interesting people all around him , danger to be faced every day , and many a marvellous incident happening . 
It is in circumstances like this that we involuntarily complain that so few of our countrymen take notes . 
`` Would you care to put some rum in your tea ? '' 
I said to my companion . 
`` I have some white rum with me -- from Tiflis ; and the weather is cold now . '' 
`` No , thank you , sir ; I do n't drink . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` Just so . 
I have sworn off drinking . 
Once , you know , when I was a sub-lieutenant , some of us had a drop too much . 
That very night there was an alarm , and out we went to the front , half seas over ! 
We did catch it , I can tell you , when Aleksei Petrovich came to hear about us ! 
Heaven save us , what a rage he was in ! 
He was within an ace of having us court-martialled . 
That 's just how things happen ! 
You might easily spend a whole year without seeing a soul ; but just go and have a drop and you 're a lost man ! '' 
On hearing this I almost lost hope . 
`` Take the Circassians , now , '' he continued ; `` once let them drink their fill of buza -LSB- 6 -RSB- at a wedding or a funeral , and out will come their knives . 
On one occasion I had some difficulty in getting away with a whole skin , and yet it was at the house of a ` friendly ' -LSB- 7 -RSB- prince , where I was a guest , that the affair happened . '' 
`` How was that ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Here , I 'll tell you . '' 
... He filled his pipe , drew in the smoke , and began his story . 
`` YOU see , sir , '' said the staff-captain , `` I was quartered , at the time , with a company in a fortress beyond the Terek -- getting on for five years ago now . 
One autumn day , a transport arrived with provisions , in charge of an officer , a young man of about twenty-five . 
He reported himself to me in full uniform , and announced that he had been ordered to remain in the fortress with me . 
He was so very elegant , his complexion so nice and white , his uniform so brand new , that I immediately guessed that he had not been long with our army in the Caucasus . '' ' 
I suppose you have been transferred from Russia ? ' 
I asked . '' 
` Exactly , captain , ' he answered . 
`` I took him by the hand and said : '' ` I 'm delighted to see you -- delighted ! 
It will be a bit dull for you ... but there , we will live together like a couple of friends . 
But , please , call me simply `` Maksim Maksimych '' ; and , tell me , what is this full uniform for ? 
Just wear your forage-cap whenever you come to me ! ' 
`` Quarters were assigned to him and he settled down in the fortress . '' 
`` What was his name ? '' 
I asked Maksim Maksimych . 
`` His name was Grigori Aleksandrovich Pechorin . 
He was a splendid fellow , I can assure you , but a little peculiar . 
Why , to give you an instance , one time he would stay out hunting the whole day , in the rain and cold ; the others would all be frozen through and tired out , but he would n't mind either cold or fatigue . 
Then , another time , he would be sitting in his own room , and , if there was a breath of wind , he would declare that he had caught cold ; if the shutters rattled against the window he would start and turn pale : yet I myself have seen him attack a boar single-handed . 
Often enough you could n't drag a word out of him for hours together ; but then , on the other hand , sometimes , when he started telling stories , you would split your sides with laughing . 
Yes , sir , a very eccentric man ; and he must have been wealthy too . 
What a lot of expensive trinkets he had ! '' 
... `` Did he stay there long with you ? '' 
I went on to ask . 
`` Yes , about a year . 
And , for that very reason , it was a memorable year to me . 
He gave me a great deal of trouble -- but there , let bygones be bygones ! 
... You see , it is true enough , there are people like that , fated from birth to have all sorts of strange things happening to them ! '' 
`` Strange ? '' 
I exclaimed , with an air of curiosity , as I poured out some tea . 
`` WELL , then , I 'll tell you , '' said Maksim Maksimych . 
`` About six versts from the fortress there lived a certain ` friendly ' prince . 
His son , a brat of about fifteen , was accustomed to ride over to visit us . 
Not a day passed but he would come , now for one thing , now for another . 
And , indeed , Grigori Aleksandrovich and I spoiled him . 
What a dare-devil the boy was ! 
Up to anything , picking up a cap at full gallop , or bringing things down with his gun ! 
He had one bad quality ; he was terribly greedy for money . 
Once , for the fun of the thing , Grigori Aleksandrovich promised to give him a ducat if he would steal the best he-goat from his father 's herd for him ; and , what do you think ? 
The very next night he came lugging it in by the horns ! 
At times we used to take it into our heads to tease him , and then his eyes would become bloodshot and his hand would fly to his dagger immediately . '' 
` You 'll be losing your life if you are not careful , Azamat , ' I would say to him . 
` That hot head of yours will get you into trouble . ' 
`` On one occasion , the old prince himself came to invite us to the wedding of his eldest daughter ; and , as we were guest-friends with him , it was impossible to decline , Tartar though he was . 
We set off . 
In the village we were met by a number of dogs , all barking loudly . 
The women , when they saw us coming , hid themselves , but those whose faces we were able to get a view of were far from being beauties . '' ' 
I had a much better opinion of the Circassian women , ' remarked Grigori Aleksandrovich . '' 
` Wait a bit ! ' 
I answered , with a smile ; I had my own views on the subject . 
`` A number of people had already gathered at the prince 's hut . 
It is the custom of the Asiatics , you know , to invite all and sundry to a wedding . 
We were received with every mark of honour and conducted to the guest-chamber . 
All the same , I did not forget quietly to mark where our horses were put , in case anything unforeseen should happen . '' 
`` How are weddings celebrated amongst them ? '' 
I asked the staff-captain . 
`` Oh , in the usual way . 
First of all , the Mullah reads them something out of the Koran ; then gifts are bestowed upon the young couple and all their relations ; the next thing is eating and drinking of buza , then the dance on horseback ; and there is always some ragamuffin , bedaubed with grease , bestriding a wretched , lame jade , and grimacing , buffooning , and making the worshipful company laugh . 
Finally , when darkness falls , they proceed to hold what we should call a ball in the guest-chamber . 
A poor , old greybeard strums on a three-stringed instrument -- I forget what they call it , but anyhow , it is something in the nature of our balalaika . 
-LSB- 8 -RSB- The girls and young children set themselves in two ranks , one opposite the other , and clap their hands and sing . 
Then a girl and a man come out into the centre and begin to chant verses to each other -- whatever comes into their heads -- and the rest join in as a chorus . 
Pechorin and I sat in the place of honour . 
All at once up came our host 's youngest daughter , a girl of about sixteen , and chanted to Pechorin -- how shall I put it ? 
-- something in the nature of a compliment . '' 
... `` What was it she sang -- do you remember ? '' 
`` It went like this , I fancy : ` Handsome , they say , are our young horsemen , and the tunics they wear are garnished with silver ; but handsomer still is the young Russian officer , and the lace on his tunic is wrought of gold . 
Like a poplar amongst them he stands , but in gardens of ours such trees will grow not nor bloom ! ' 
`` Pechorin rose , bowed to her , put his hand to his forehead and heart , and asked me to answer her . 
I know their language well , and I translated his reply . 
`` When she had left us I whispered to Grigori Aleksandrovich : '' ` Well , now , what do you think of her ? ' '' 
` Charming ! ' 
he replied . 
` What is her name ? ' '' 
` Her name is Bela , ' I answered . 
`` And a beautiful girl she was indeed ; her figure was tall and slender , her eyes black as those of a mountain chamois , and they fairly looked into your soul . 
Pechorin , deep in thought , kept his gaze fixed upon her , and she , for her part , stole glances at him often enough from under her lashes . 
Pechorin , however , was not the only one who was admiring the pretty princess ; another pair of eyes , fixed and fiery , were gazing at her from the corner of the room . 
I took a good look at their owner , and recognised my old acquaintance Kazbich , who , you must know , was neither exactly ` friendly ' nor yet the other thing . 
He was an object of much suspicion , although he had never actually been caught at any knavery . 
He used to bring rams to our fortress and sell them cheaply ; only he never would haggle ; whatever he demanded at first you had to give . 
He would have his throat cut rather than come down in price . 
He had the reputation of being fond of roaming on the far side of the Kuban with the Abreks ; and , to tell the truth , he had a regular thief 's visage . 
A little , wizened , broad-shouldered fellow he was -- but smart , I can tell you , smart as the very devil ! 
His tunic was always worn out and patched , but his weapons were mounted in silver . 
His horse was renowned throughout Kabardia -- and , indeed , a better one it would be impossible to imagine ! 
Not without good reason did all the other horsemen envy Kazbich , and on more than one occasion they had attempted to steal the horse , but they had never succeeded . 
I seem to see the animal before me now -- black as coal , with legs like bow-strings and eyes as fine as Bela 's ! 
How strong he was too ! 
He would gallop as much as fifty versts at a stretch ! 
And he was well trained besides -- he would trot behind his master like a dog , and actually knew his voice ! 
Kazbich never used to tether him either -- just the very horse for a robber ! 
... `` On that evening Kazbich was more sullen than ever , and I noticed that he was wearing a coat of mail under his tunic . 
` He has n't got that coat of mail on for nothing , ' I thought . 
` He has some plot in his head , I 'll be bound ! ' 
`` It grew oppressively hot in the hut , and I went out into the air to cool myself . 
Night had fallen upon the mountains , and a mist was beginning to creep along the gorges . 
`` It occurred to me to pop in under the shed where our horses were standing , to see whether they had their fodder ; and , besides , it is never any harm to take precautions . 
My horse was a splendid one too , and more than one Kabardian had already cast fond glances at it , repeating at the same time : ` Yakshi tkhe chok yakshi . ' 
-LSB- 9 -RSB- `` I stole along the fence . 
Suddenly I heard voices , one of which I immediately recognised . 
`` It was that of the young pickle , Azamat , our host 's son . 
The other person spoke less and in a quieter tone . '' 
` What are they discussing there ? ' 
I wondered . 
` Surely it ca n't be my horse ! ' 
I squatted down beside the fence and proceeded to play the eavesdropper , trying not to let slip a single word . 
At times the noise of songs and the buzz of voices , escaping from the hut , drowned the conversation which I was finding interesting . '' 
` That 's a splendid horse of yours , ' Azamat was saying . 
` If I were master of a house of my own and had a stud of three hundred mares , I would give half of it for your galloper , Kazbich ! ' '' 
` Aha ! 
Kazbich ! ' 
I said to myself , and I called to mind the coat of mail . '' 
` Yes , ' replied Kazbich , after an interval of silence . 
` There is not such another to be found in all Kabardia . 
Once -- it was on the other side of the Terek -- I had ridden with the Abreks to seize the Russian herds . 
We had no luck , so we scattered in different directions . 
Four Cossacks dashed after me . 
I could actually hear the cries of the giaours behind me , and in front of me there was a dense forest . 
I crouched down in the saddle , committed myself to Allah , and , for the first time in my life , insulted my horse with a blow of the whip . 
Like a bird , he plunged among the branches ; the sharp thorns tore my clothing , the dead boughs of the cork-elms struck against my face ! 
My horse leaped over tree-trunks and burst his way through bushes with his chest ! 
It would have been better for me to have abandoned him at the outskirts of the forest and concealed myself in it afoot , but it was a pity to part with him -- and the Prophet rewarded me . 
A few bullets whistled over my head . 
I could now hear the Cossacks , who had dismounted , running upon my tracks . 
Suddenly a deep gully opened before me . 
My galloper took thought -- and leaped . 
His hind hoofs slipped back off the opposite bank , and he remained hanging by his fore-feet . 
I dropped the bridle and threw myself into the hollow , thereby saving my horse , which jumped out . 
The Cossacks saw the whole scene , only not one of them got down to search for me , thinking probably that I had mortally injured myself ; and I heard them rushing to catch my horse . 
My heart bled within me . 
I crept along the hollow through the thick grass -- then I looked around : it was the end of the forest . 
A few Cossacks were riding out from it on to the clearing , and there was my Karagyoz -LSB- 10 -RSB- galloping straight towards them . 
With a shout they all dashed forward . 
For a long , long time they pursued him , and one of them , in particular , was once or twice almost successful in throwing a lasso over his neck . 
`` I trembled , dropped my eyes , and began to pray . 
After a few moments I looked up again , and there was my Karagyoz flying along , his tail waving -- free as the wind ; and the giaours , on their jaded horses , were trailing along far behind , one after another , across the steppe . 
Wallah ! 
It is true -- really true ! 
Till late at night I lay in the hollow . 
Suddenly -- what do you think , Azamat ? 
I heard in the darkness a horse trotting along the bank of the hollow , snorting , neighing , and beating the ground with his hoofs . 
I recognised my Karagyoz 's voice ; 't was he , my comrade ! '' 
... Since that time we have never been parted ! ' 
`` And I could hear him patting his galloper 's sleek neck with his hand , as he called him various fond names . '' 
` If I had a stud of a thousand mares , ' said Azamat , ' I would give it all for your Karagyoz ! ' '' 
` Yok ! 
-LSB- 11 -RSB- I would not take it ! ' 
said Kazbich indifferently . '' 
` Listen , Kazbich , ' said Azamat , trying to ingratiate himself with him . 
` You are a kindhearted man , you are a brave horseman , but my father is afraid of the Russians and will not allow me to go on the mountains . 
Give me your horse , and I will do anything you wish . 
I will steal my father 's best rifle for you , or his sabre -- just as you like -- and his sabre is a genuine Gurda ; -LSB- 12 -RSB- you have only to lay the edge against your hand , and it will cut you ; a coat of mail like yours is nothing against it . ' 
`` Kazbich remained silent . '' 
` The first time I saw your horse , ' continued Azamat , ` when he was wheeling and leaping under you , his nostrils distended , and the flints flying in showers from under his hoofs , something I could not understand took place within my soul ; and since that time I have been weary of everything . 
I have looked with disdain on my father 's best gallopers ; I have been ashamed to be seen on them , and yearning has taken possession of me . 
In my anguish I have spent whole days on the cliffs , and , every minute , my thoughts have kept turning to your black galloper with his graceful gait and his sleek back , straight as an arrow . 
With his keen , bright eyes he has looked into mine as if about to speak ! 
... I shall die , Kazbich , if you will not sell him to me ! ' 
said Azamat , with trembling voice . 
`` I could hear him burst out weeping , and I must tell you that Azamat was a very stubborn lad , and that not for anything could tears be wrung from him , even when he was a little younger . 
`` In answer to his tears , I could hear something like a laugh . '' 
` Listen , ' said Azamat in a firm voice . 
` You see , I am making up my mind for anything . 
If you like , I will steal my sister for you ! 
How she dances ! 
How she sings ! 
And the way she embroiders with gold -- marvellous ! 
Not even a Turkish Padishah -LSB- 13 -RSB- has had a wife like her ! 
... Shall I ? 
Wait for me to-morrow night , yonder , in the gorge where the torrent flows ; I will go by with her to the neighbouring village -- and she is yours . 
Surely Bela is worth your galloper ! ' 
`` Kazbich remained silent for a long , long time . 
At length , instead of answering , he struck up in an undertone the ancient song : `` Many a beauty among us dwells From whose eyes ' dark depths the starlight wells , 'T is an envied lot and sweet , to hold Their love ; but brighter is freedom bold . 
Four wives are yours if you pay the gold ; But a mettlesome steed is of price untold ; The whirlwind itself on the steppe is less fleet ; He knows no treachery -- no deceit . '' 
-LSB- 14 -RSB- `` In vain Azamat entreated him to consent . 
He wept , coaxed , and swore to him . 
Finally , Kazbich interrupted him impatiently : '' ` Begone , you crazy brat ! 
How should you think to ride on my horse ? 
In three steps you would be thrown and your neck broken on the stones ! ' '' 
` I ? ' 
cried Azamat in a fury , and the blade of the child 's dagger rang against the coat of mail . 
A powerful arm thrust him away , and he struck the wattle fence with such violence that it rocked . '' 
` Now we 'll see some fun ! ' 
I thought to myself . 
`` I rushed into the stable , bridled our horses and led them out into the back courtyard . 
In a couple of minutes there was a terrible uproar in the hut . 
What had happened was this : Azamat had rushed in , with his tunic torn , saying that Kazbich was going to murder him . 
All sprang out , seized their guns , and the fun began ! 
Noise -- shouts -- shots ! 
But by this time Kazbich was in the saddle , and , wheeling among the crowd along the street , defended himself like a madman , brandishing his sabre . '' 
` It is a bad thing to interfere in other people 's quarrels , ' I said to Grigori Aleksandrovich , taking him by the arm . 
` Would n't it be better for us to clear off without loss of time ? ' '' 
` Wait , though , and see how it will end ! ' '' 
` Oh , as to that , it will be sure enough to end badly ; it is always so with these Asiatics . 
Once let them get drunk on buza , and there 's certain to be bloodshed . ' 
`` We mounted and galloped home . '' 
`` TELL me , what became of Kazbich ? '' 
I asked the staff-captain impatiently . 
`` Why , what can happen to that sort of a fellow ? '' 
he answered , finishing his tumbler of tea . 
`` He slipped away , of course . '' 
`` And was n't he wounded ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Goodness only knows ! 
Those scoundrels take a lot of killing ! 
In action , for instance , I 've seen many a one , sir , stuck all over with bayonets like a sieve , and still brandishing his sabre . '' 
After an interval of silence the staff-captain continued , tapping the ground with his foot : `` One thing I 'll never forgive myself for . 
On our arrival at the fortress the devil put it into my head to repeat to Grigori Aleksandrovich all that I had heard when I was eavesdropping behind the fence . 
He laughed -- cunning fellow ! 
-- and thought out a little plan of his own . '' 
`` What was that ? 
Tell me , please . '' 
`` Well , there 's no help for it now , I suppose . 
I 've begun the story , and so I must continue . 
`` In about four days ' time Azamat rode over to the fortress . 
As his usual custom was , he went to see Grigori Aleksandrovich , who always used to give him sweetmeats to eat . 
I was present . 
The conversation was on the subject of horses , and Pechorin began to sound the praises of Kazbich 's Karagyoz . 
What a mettlesome horse it was , and how handsome ! 
A perfect chamois ! 
In fact , judging by his account , there simply was n't another like it in the whole world ! 
`` The young Tartar 's beady eyes began to sparkle , but Pechorin did n't seem to notice the fact . 
I started to talk about something else , but immediately , mark you , Pechorin caused the conversation to strike off on to Kazbich 's horse . 
Every time that Azamat came it was the same story . 
After about three weeks , I began to observe that Azamat was growing pale and wasted , just as people in novels do from love , sir . 
What wonder either ! 
... `` Well , you see , it was not until afterwards that I learned the whole trick -- Grigori Aleksandrovich exasperated Azamat to such an extent with his teasing that the boy was ready even to drown himself . 
One day Pechorin suddenly broke out with : '' ' I see , Azamat , that you have taken a desperate fancy to that horse of Kazbich 's , but you 'll no more see him than you will the back of your neck ! 
Come , tell me , what would you give if somebody made you a present of him ? ' '' 
` Anything he wanted , ' answered Azamat . '' 
` In that case I will get the horse for you , only on one condition ... Swear that you will fulfil it ? ' '' ' 
I swear . 
You swear too ! ' '' 
` Very well ! 
I swear that the horse shall be yours . 
But , in return , you must deliver your sister Bela into my hands . 
Karagyoz shall be her bridegroom 's gift . 
I hope the transaction will be a profitable one for you . ' 
`` Azamat remained silent . '' 
` Wo n't you ? 
Well , just as you like ! 
I thought you were a man , but it seems you are still a child ; it is early for you to be riding on horseback ! ' 
`` Azamat fired up . '' 
` But my father -- ' he said . '' 
` Does he never go away , then ? ' '' 
` True . ' '' 
` You agree ? ' '' ' 
I agree , ' whispered Azamat , pale as death . 
` But when ? ' '' 
` The first time Kazbich rides over here . 
He has promised to drive in half a score of rams ; the rest is my affair . 
Look out , then , Azamat ! ' 
`` And so they settled the business -- a bad business , to tell the truth ! 
I said as much to Pechorin afterwards , but he only answered that a wild Circassian girl ought to consider herself fortunate in having such a charming husband as himself -- because , according to their ideas , he really was her husband -- and that Kazbich was a scoundrel , and ought to be punished . 
Judge for yourself , what could I say to that ?
