... Yes , I have already passed that period of spiritual life when happiness alone is sought , when the heart feels the urgent necessity of violently and passionately loving somebody . 
Now my only wish is to be loved , and that by very few . 
I even think that I would be content with one constant attachment . 
A wretched habit of the heart ! 
... One thing has always struck me as strange . 
I have never made myself the slave of the woman I have loved . 
On the contrary , I have always acquired an invincible power over her will and heart , without in the least endeavouring to do so . 
Why is this ? 
Is it because I never esteem anything highly , and she has been continually afraid to let me out of her hands ? 
Or is it the magnetic influence of a powerful organism ? 
Or is it , simply , that I have never succeeded in meeting a woman of stubborn character ? 
I must confess that , in fact , I do not love women who possess strength of character . 
What business have they with such a thing ? 
Indeed , I remember now . 
Once and once only did I love a woman who had a firm will which I was never able to vanquish ... We parted as enemies -- and then , perhaps , if I had met her five years later we would have parted otherwise ... Vera is ill , very ill , although she does not admit it . 
I fear she has consumption , or that disease which is called `` fievre lente '' -- a quite unRussian disease , and one for which there is no name in our language . 
The storm overtook us while in the grotto and detained us half an hour longer . 
Vera did not make me swear fidelity , or ask whether I had loved others since we had parted ... She trusted in me anew with all her former unconcern , and I will not deceive her : she is the only woman in the world whom it would never be within my power to deceive . 
I know that we shall soon have to part again , and perchance for ever . 
We will both go by different ways to the grave , but her memory will remain inviolable within my soul . 
I have always repeated this to her , and she believes me , although she says she does not . 
At length we separated . 
For a long time I followed her with my eyes , until her hat was hidden behind the shrubs and rocks . 
My heart was painfully contracted , just as after our first parting . 
Oh , how I rejoiced in that emotion ! 
Can it be that youth is about to come back to me , with its salutary tempests , or is this only the farewell glance , the last gift -- in memory of itself ? 
... And to think that , in appearance , I am still a boy ! 
My face , though pale , is still fresh ; my limbs are supple and slender ; my hair is thick and curly , my eyes sparkle , my blood boils ... Returning home , I mounted on horseback and galloped to the steppe . 
I love to gallop on a fiery horse through the tall grass , in the face of the desert wind ; greedily I gulp down the fragrant air and fix my gaze upon the blue distance , endeavouring to seize the misty outlines of objects which every minute grow clearer and clearer . 
Whatever griefs oppress my heart , whatever disquietudes torture my thoughts -- all are dispersed in a moment ; my soul becomes at ease ; the fatigue of the body vanquishes the disturbance of the mind . 
There is not a woman 's glance which I would not forget at the sight of the tufted mountains , illumined by the southern sun ; at the sight of the dark-blue sky , or in hearkening to the roar of the torrent as it falls from cliff to cliff . 
I believe that the Cossacks , yawning on their watch-towers , when they saw me galloping thus needlessly and aimlessly , were long tormented by that enigma , because from my dress , I am sure , they took me to be a Circassian . 
I have , in fact , been told that when riding on horseback , in my Circassian costume , I resemble a Kabardian more than many a Kabardian himself . 
And , indeed , so far as regards that noble , warlike garb , I am a perfect dandy . 
I have not a single piece of gold lace too much ; my weapon is costly , but simply wrought ; the fur on my cap is neither too long nor too short ; my leggings and shoes are matched with all possible accuracy ; my tunic is white ; my Circassian jacket , dark-brown . 
I have long studied the mountaineer seat on horseback , and in no way is it possible to flatter my vanity so much as by acknowledging my skill in horsemanship in the Cossack mode . 
I keep four horses -- one for myself and three for my friends , so that I may not be bored by having to roam about the fields all alone ; they take my horses with pleasure , and never ride with me . 
It was already six o'clock in the evening , when I remembered that it was time to dine . 
My horse was jaded . 
I rode out on to the road leading from Pyatigorsk to the German colony , to which the society of the watering-place frequently rides en piquenique . 
The road meanders between bushes and descends into little ravines , through which flow noisy brooks beneath the shade of tall grasses . 
All around , in an amphitheatre , rise the blue masses of Mount Beshtau and the Zmeiny , Zhelezny and Lysy Mountains . 
-LSB- 26 -RSB- Descending into one of those ravines , I halted to water my horse . 
At that moment a noisy and glittering cavalcade made its appearance upon the road -- the ladies in black and dark-blue riding habits , the cavaliers in costumes which formed a medley of the Circassian and Nizhegorodian . 
-LSB- 27 -RSB- In front rode Grushnitski with Princess Mary . 
The ladies at the watering-place still believe in attacks by Circassians in broad daylight ; for that reason , doubtless , Grushnitski had slung a sabre and a pair of pistols over his soldier 's cloak . 
He looked ridiculous enough in that heroic attire . 
I was concealed from their sight by a tall bush , but I was able to see everything through the leaves , and to guess from the expression of their faces that the conversation was of a sentimental turn . 
At length they approached the slope ; Grushnitski took hold of the bridle of the Princess 's horse , and then I heard the conclusion of their conversation : `` And you wish to remain all your life in the Caucasus ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` What is Russia to me ? '' 
answered her cavalier . 
`` A country in which thousands of people , because they are richer than I , will look upon me with contempt , whilst here -- here this thick cloak has not prevented my acquaintance with you '' ... `` On the contrary '' ... said Princess Mary , blushing . 
Grushnitski 's face was a picture of delight . 
He continued : `` Here , my life will flow along noisily , unobserved , and rapidly , under the bullets of the savages , and if Heaven were every year to send me a single bright glance from a woman 's eyes -- like that which -- '' At that moment they came up to where I was . 
I struck my horse with the whip and rode out from behind the bush ... `` Mon Dieu , un circassien ! '' 
... exclaimed Princess Mary in terror . 
In order completely to undeceive her , I replied in French , with a slight bow : `` Ne craignez rien , madame , je ne suis pas plus dangereux que votre cavalier '' ... She grew embarrassed -- but at what ? 
At her own mistake , or because my answer struck her as insolent ? 
I should like the latter hypothesis to be correct . 
Grushnitski cast a discontented glance at me . 
Late in the evening , that is to say , about eleven o'clock , I went for a walk in the lilac avenue of the boulevard . 
The town was sleeping ; lights were gleaming in only a few windows . 
On three sides loomed the black ridges of the cliffs , the spurs of Mount Mashuk , upon the summit of which an ominous cloud was lying . 
The moon was rising in the east ; in the distance , the snow-clad mountains glistened like a fringe of silver . 
The calls of the sentries mingled at intervals with the roar of the hot springs let flow for the night . 
At times the loud clattering of a horse rang out along the street , accompanied by the creaking of a Nagai wagon and the plaintive burden of a Tartar song . 
I sat down upon a bench and fell into a reverie ... I felt the necessity of pouring forth my thoughts in friendly conversation ... But with whom ? 
... `` What is Vera doing now ? '' 
I wondered . 
I would have given much to press her hand at that moment . 
All at once I heard rapid and irregular steps ... Grushnitski , no doubt ! 
... So it was ! 
`` Where have you come from ? '' 
`` From Princess Ligovski 's , '' he said very importantly . 
`` How well Mary does sing ! '' 
... `` Do you know ? '' 
I said to him . 
`` I wager that she does not know that you are a cadet . 
She thinks you are an officer reduced to the ranks '' ... `` Maybe so . 
What is that to me ! '' 
... he said absently . 
`` No , I am only saying so '' ... `` But , do you know that you have made her terribly angry to-day ? 
She considered it an unheard-of piece of insolence . 
It was only with difficulty that I was able to convince her that you are so well bred and know society so well that you could not have had any intention of insulting her . 
She says that you have an impudent glance , and that you have certainly a very high opinion of yourself . '' 
`` She is not mistaken ... But do you not want to defend her ? '' 
`` I am sorry I have not yet the right to do so '' ... `` Oho ! '' 
I said to myself , `` evidently he has hopes already . '' 
`` However , it is the worse for you , '' continued Grushnitski ; `` it will be difficult for you to make their acquaintance now , and what a pity ! 
It is one of the most agreeable houses I know '' ... I smiled inwardly . 
`` The most agreeable house to me now is my own , '' I said , with a yawn , and I got up to go . 
`` Confess , though , you repent ? '' 
... `` What nonsense ! 
If I like I will be at Princess Ligovski 's to-morrow evening ! '' 
... `` We shall see '' ... `` I will even begin to pay my addresses to Princess Mary , if you would like me to '' ... `` Yes , if she is willing to speak to you '' ... `` I am only awaiting the moment when she will be bored by your conversation ... Goodbye '' ... `` Well , I am going for a stroll ; I could not go to sleep now for anything ... Look here , let us go to the restaurant instead , there is cardplaying going on there ... What I need now is violent sensations '' ... `` I hope you will lose '' ... I went home . 
NEARLY a week has passed , and I have not yet made the Ligovskis ' acquaintance . 
I am awaiting a convenient opportunity . 
Grushnitski follows Princess Mary everywhere like a shadow . 
Their conversations are interminable ; but , when will she be tired of him ? 
... Her mother pays no attention , because he is not a man who is in a position to marry . 
Behold the logic of mothers ! 
I have caught two or three tender glances -- this must be put a stop to . 
Yesterday , for the first time , Vera made her appearance at the well ... She has never gone out of doors since we met in the grotto . 
We let down our tumblers at the same time , and as she bent forward she whispered to me : `` You are not going to make the Ligovskis ' acquaintance ? 
... It is only there that we can meet '' ... A reproach ! 
... How tiresome ! 
But I have deserved it ... By the way , there is a subscription ball tomorrow in the saloon of the restaurant , and I will dance the mazurka with Princess Mary . 
THE saloon of the restaurant was converted into the assembly room of a Nobles ' Club . 
The company met at nine o'clock . 
Princess Ligovski and her daughter were amongst the latest to make their appearance . 
Several of the ladies looked at Princess Mary with envy and malevolence , because she dresses with taste . 
Those who look upon themselves as the aristocracy of the place concealed their envy and attached themselves to her train . 
What else could be expected ? 
Wherever there is a gathering of women , the company is immediately divided into a higher and a lower circle . 
Beneath the window , amongst a crowd of people , stood Grushnitski , pressing his face to the pane and never taking his eyes off his divinity . 
As she passed by , she gave him a hardly perceptible nod . 
He beamed like the sun ... The first dance was a polonaise , after which the musicians struck up a waltz . 
Spurs began to jingle , and skirts to rise and whirl . 
I was standing behind a certain stout lady who was overshadowed by rose-coloured feathers . 
The magnificence of her dress reminded me of the times of the farthingale , and the motley hue of her by no means smooth skin , of the happy epoch of the black taffeta patch . 
An immense wart on her neck was covered by a clasp . 
She was saying to her cavalier , a captain of dragoons : `` That young Princess Ligovski is a most intolerable creature ! 
Just fancy , she jostled against me and did not apologise , but even turned round and stared at me through her lorgnette ! 
... C'est impayable ! 
... And what has she to be proud of ? 
It is time somebody gave her a lesson '' ... `` That will be easy enough , '' replied the obliging captain , and he directed his steps to the other room . 
I went up to Princess Mary immediately , and , availing myself of the local customs which allowed one to dance with a stranger , I invited her to waltz with me . 
She was scarcely able to keep from smiling and letting her triumph be seen ; but quickly enough she succeeded in assuming an air of perfect indifference and even severity . 
Carelessly she let her hand fall upon my shoulder , inclined her head slightly to one side , and we began to dance . 
I have never known a waist more voluptuous and supple ! 
Her fresh breath touched my face ; at times a lock of hair , becoming separated from its companions in the eddy of the waltz , glided over my burning cheek ... I made three turns of the ballroom -LRB- she waltzes surprisingly well -RRB- . 
She was out of breath , her eyes were dulled , her half-open lips were scarcely able to whisper the indispensable : `` merci , monsieur . '' 
After a few moments ' silence I said to her , assuming a very humble air : `` I have heard , Princess , that although quite unacquainted with you , I have already had the misfortune to incur your displeasure ... that you have considered me insolent . 
Can that possibly true ? '' 
`` Would you like to confirm me in that opinion now ? '' 
she answered , with an ironical little grimace -- very becoming , however , to her mobile countenance . 
`` If I had the audacity to insult you in any way , then allow me to have the still greater audacity to beg your pardon ... And , indeed , I should very much like to prove to you that you are mistaken in regard to me '' ... `` You will find that a rather difficult task '' ... `` But why ? '' 
... `` Because you never visit us and , most likely , there will not be many more of these balls . '' 
`` That means , '' I thought , `` that their doors are closed to me for ever . '' 
`` You know , Princess , '' I said to her , with a certain amount of vexation , `` one should never spurn a penitent criminal : in his despair he may become twice as much a criminal as before ... and then '' ... Sudden laughter and whispering from the people around us caused me to turn my head and to interrupt my phrase . 
A few paces away from me stood a group of men , amongst them the captain of dragoons , who had manifested intentions hostile to the charming Princess . 
He was particularly well pleased with something or other , and was rubbing his hands , laughing and exchanging meaning glances with his companions . 
All at once a gentleman in an evening-dress coat and with long moustaches and a red face separated himself from the crowd and directed his uncertain steps straight towards Princess Mary . 
He was drunk . 
Coming to a halt opposite the embarrassed Princess and placing his hands behind his back , he fixed his dull grey eyes upon her , and said in a hoarse treble : `` Permettez ... but what is the good of that sort of thing here ... All I need say is : I engage you for the mazurka '' ... `` Very well ! '' 
she replied in a trembling voice , throwing a beseeching glance around . 
Alas ! 
Her mother was a long way off , and not one of the cavaliers of her acquaintance was near . 
A certain aide-de-camp apparently saw the whole scene , but he concealed himself behind the crowd in order not to be mixed up in the affair . 
`` What ? '' 
said the drunken gentleman , winking to the captain of dragoons , who was encouraging him by signs . 
`` Do you not wish to dance then ? 
... All the same I again have the honour to engage you for the mazurka ... You think , perhaps , that I am drunk ! 
That is all right ! 
... I can dance all the easier , I assure you '' ... I saw that she was on the point of fainting with fright and indignation . 
I went up to the drunken gentleman , caught him none too gently by the arm , and , looking him fixedly in the face , requested him to retire . 
`` Because , '' I added , `` the Princess promised long ago to dance the mazurka with me . '' 
`` Well , then , there 's nothing to be done ! 
Another time ! '' 
he said , bursting out laughing , and he retired to his abashed companions , who immediately conducted him into another room . 
I was rewarded by a deep , wondrous glance . 
The Princess went up to her mother and told her the whole story . 
The latter sought me out among the crowd and thanked me . 
She informed me that she knew my mother and was on terms of friendship with half a dozen of my aunts . 
`` I do not know how it has happened that we have not made your acquaintance up to now , '' she added ; `` but confess , you alone are to blame for that . 
You fight shy of everyone in a positively unseemly way . 
I hope the air of my drawingroom will dispel your spleen ... Do you not think so ? '' 
I uttered one of the phrases which everybody must have ready for such an occasion . 
The quadrilles dragged on a dreadfully long time . 
At last the music struck up from the gallery , Princess Mary and I took up our places . 
I did not once allude to the drunken gentleman , or to my previous behaviour , or to Grushnitski . 
The impression produced upon her by the unpleasant scene was gradually dispelled ; her face brightened up ; she jested very charmingly ; her conversation was witty , without pretensions to wit , vivacious and spontaneous ; her observations were sometimes profound ... In a very involved sentence I gave her to understand that I had liked her for a long time . 
She bent her head and blushed slightly . 
`` You are a strange man ! '' 
she said , with a forced laugh , lifting her velvet eyes upon me . 
`` I did not wish to make your acquaintance , '' I continued , `` because you are surrounded by too dense a throng of adorers , in which I was afraid of being lost to sight altogether . '' 
`` You need not have been afraid ; they are all very tiresome '' ... `` All ? 
Not all , surely ? '' 
She looked fixedly at me as if endeavouring to recollect something , then blushed slightly again and finally pronounced with decision : `` All ! '' 
`` Even my friend , Grushnitski ? '' 
`` But is he your friend ? '' 
she said , manifesting some doubt . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` He , of course , does not come into the category of the tiresome '' ... `` But into that of the unfortunate ! '' 
I said , laughing . 
`` Of course ! 
But do you consider that funny ? 
I should like you to be in his place '' ... `` Well ? 
I was once a cadet myself , and , in truth , it was the best time of my life ! '' 
`` Is he a cadet , then ? '' 
... she said rapidly , and then added : `` But I thought '' ... `` What did you think ? '' 
... `` Nothing ! 
Who is that lady ? '' 
Thereupon the conversation took a different direction , and it did not return to the former subject . 
And now the mazurka came to an end and we separated -- until we should meet again . 
The ladies drove off in different directions . 
I went to get some supper , and met Werner . 
`` Aha ! '' 
he said : `` so it is you ! 
And yet you did not wish to make the acquaintance of Princess Mary otherwise than by saving her from certain death . '' 
`` I have done better , '' I replied . 
`` I have saved her from fainting at the ball '' ... `` How was that ? 
Tell me . '' 
`` No , guess ! 
-- O , you who guess everything in the world ! '' 
ABOUT seven o'clock in the evening , I was walking on the boulevard . 
Grushnitski perceived me a long way off , and came up to me . 
A sort of ridiculous rapture was shining in his eyes . 
He pressed my hand warmly , and said in a tragic voice : `` I thank you , Pechorin ... You understand me ? '' 
`` No ; but in any case it is not worth gratitude , '' I answered , not having , in fact , any good deed upon my conscience . 
`` What ? 
But yesterday ! 
Have you forgotten ? 
... Mary has told me everything '' ... `` Why ! 
Have you everything in common so soon as this ? 
Even gratitude ? '' 
... `` Listen , '' said Grushnitski very earnestly ; `` pray do not make fun of my love , if you wish to remain my friend ... You see , I love her to the point of madness ... and I think -- I hope -- she loves me too ... I have a request to make of you . 
You will be at their house this evening ; promise me to observe everything . 
I know you are experienced in these matters , you know women better than I. . . 
Women ! 
Women ! 
Who can understand them ? 
Their smiles contradict their glances , their words promise and allure , but the tone of their voice repels ... At one time they grasp and divine in a moment our most secret thoughts , at another they can not understand the clearest hints ... Take Princess Mary , now : yesterday her eyes , as they rested upon me , were blazing with passion ; to-day they are dull and cold '' ... `` That is possibly the result of the waters , '' I replied . 
`` You see the bad side of everything ... materialist , '' he added contemptuously . 
`` However , let us talk of other matters . '' 
And , satisfied with his bad pun , he cheered up . 
At nine o'clock we went to Princess Ligovski 's together . 
Passing by Vera 's windows , I saw her looking out . 
We threw a fleeting glance at each other . 
She entered the Ligovskis ' drawing-room soon after us . 
Princess Ligovski presented me to her , as a relation of her own . 
Tea was served . 
The guests were numerous , and the conversation was general . 
I endeavoured to please the Princess , jested , and made her laugh heartily a few times . 
Princess Mary , also , was more than once on the point of bursting out laughing , but she restrained herself in order not to depart from the role she had assumed . 
She finds languor becoming to her , and perhaps she is not mistaken . 
Grushnitski appears to be very glad that she is not infected by my gaiety . 
After tea we all went into the drawingroom . 
`` Are you satisfied with my obedience , Vera ? '' 
I said as I was passing her . 
She threw me a glance full of love and gratitude . 
I have grown accustomed to such glances ; but at one time they constituted my felicity . 
The Princess seated her daughter at the pianoforte , and all the company begged her to sing . 
I kept silence , and , taking advantage of the hubbub , I went aside to the window with Vera , who wished to say something of great importance to both of us ... It turned out to be -- nonsense ... Meanwhile my indifference was vexing Princess Mary , as I was able to make out from a single angry , gleaming glance which she cast at me ... Oh ! 
I understand the method of conversation wonderfully well : mute but expressive , brief but forceful ! 
... She began to sing . 
She has a good voice , but she sings badly ... However , I was not listening . 
Grushnitski , on the contrary , leaning his elbows on the grand piano , facing her , was devouring her with his eyes and saying in an undertone every minute : `` Charmant ! 
Delicieux ! '' 
`` Listen , '' said Vera to me , `` I do not wish you to make my husband 's acquaintance , but you must , without fail , make yourself agreeable to the Princess ; that will be an easy task for you : you can do anything you wish . 
It is only here that we shall see each other '' ... `` Only here ? '' 
... She blushed and continued : `` You know that I am your slave : I have never been able to resist you ... and I shall be punished for it , you will cease to love me ! 
At least , I want to preserve my reputation ... not for myself -- that you know very well ! 
... Oh ! 
I beseech you : do not torture me , as before , with idle doubts and feigned coldness ! 
It may be that I shall die soon ; I feel that I am growing weaker from day to day ... And , yet , I can not think of the future life , I think only of you ... You men do not understand the delights of a glance , of a pressure of the hand ... but as for me , I swear to you that , when I listen to your voice , I feel such a deep , strange bliss that the most passionate kisses could not take its place . '' 
Meanwhile , Princess Mary had finished her song . 
Murmurs of praise were to be heard all around . 
I went up to her after all the other guests , and said something rather carelessly to her on the subject of her voice . 
She made a little grimace , pouting her lower lip , and dropped a very sarcastic curtsey . 
`` That is all the more flattering , '' she said , `` because you have not been listening to me at all ; but perhaps you do not like music ? '' 
... `` On the contrary , I do ... After dinner , especially . '' 
`` Grushnitski is right in saying that you have very prosaic tastes ... and I see that you like music in a gastronomic respect . '' 
`` You are mistaken again : I am by no means an epicure . 
I have a most wretched digestion . 
But music after dinner puts one to sleep , and to sleep after dinner is healthful ; consequently I like music in a medicinal respect . 
In the evening , on the contrary , it excites my nerves too much : I become either too melancholy or too gay . 
Both are fatiguing , where there is no positive reason for being either sorrowful or glad . 
And , moreover , melancholy in society is ridiculous , and too great gaiety is unbecoming '' ... She did not hear me to the end , but went away and sat beside Grushnitski , and they entered into a sort of sentimental conversation . 
Apparently the Princess answered his sage phrases rather absent-mindedly and inconsequently , although endeavouring to show that she was listening to him with attention , because sometimes he looked at her in astonishment , trying to divine the cause of the inward agitation which was expressed at times in her restless glance ... But I have found you out , my dear Princess ! 
Have a care ! 
You want to pay me back in the same coin , to wound my vanity -- you will not succeed ! 
And if you declare war on me , I will be merciless ! 
In the course of the evening , I purposely tried a few times to join in their conversation , but she met my remarks rather coldly , and , at last , I retired in pretended vexation . 
Princess Mary was triumphant , Grushnitski likewise . 
Triumph , my friends , and be quick about it ! 
... You will not have long to triumph ! 
... It can not be otherwise . 
I have a presentiment ... On making a woman 's acquaintance I have always unerringly guessed whether she would fall in love with me or not . 
The remaining part of the evening I spent at Vera 's side , and talked to the full about the old days ... Why does she love me so much ? 
In truth , I am unable to say , all the more so because she is the only woman who has understood me perfectly , with all my petty weaknesses and evil passions ... Can it be that wickedness is so attractive ? 
... Grushnitski and I left the house together . 
In the street he took my arm , and , after a long silence , said : `` Well ? '' 
`` You are a fool , '' I should have liked to answer . 
But I restrained myself and only shrugged my shoulders . 
ALL these days I have not once departed from my system . 
Princess Mary has come to like talking to me ; I have told her a few of the strange events of my life , and she is beginning to look on me as an extraordinary man . 
I mock at everything in the world , especially feelings ; and she is taking alarm . 
When I am present , she does not dare to embark upon sentimental discussions with Grushnitski , and already , on a few occasions , she has answered his sallies with a mocking smile . 
But every time that Grushnitski comes up to her I assume an air of meekness and leave the two of them together . 
On the first occasion , she was glad , or tried to make it appear so ; on the second , she was angry with me ; on the third -- with Grushnitski . 
`` You have very little vanity ! '' 
she said to me yesterday . 
`` What makes you think that I find Grushnitski the more entertaining ? '' 
I answered that I was sacrificing my own pleasure for the sake of the happiness of a friend . 
`` And my pleasure , too , '' she added . 
I looked at her intently and assumed a serious air . 
After that for the whole day I did not speak a single word to her ... In the evening , she was pensive ; this morning , at the well , more pensive still . 
When I went up to her , she was listening absent-mindedly to Grushnitski , who was apparently falling into raptures about Nature , but , so soon as she perceived me , she began to laugh -- at a most inopportune moment -- pretending not to notice me . 
I went on a little further and began stealthily to observe her . 
She turned away from her companion and yawned twice . 
Decidedly she had grown tired of Grushnitski -- I will not talk to her for another two days . 
I OFTEN ask myself why I am so obstinately endeavouring to win the love of a young girl whom I do not wish to deceive , and whom I will never marry . 
Why this woman-like coquetry ? 
Vera loves me more than Princess Mary ever will . 
Had I regarded the latter as an invincible beauty , I should perhaps have been allured by the difficulty of the undertaking ... However , there is no such difficulty in this case ! 
Consequently , my present feeling is not that restless craving for love which torments us in the early days of our youth , flinging us from one woman to another until we find one who can not endure us . 
And then begins our constancy -- that sincere , unending passion which may be expressed mathematically by a line falling from a point into space -- the secret of that endlessness lying only in the impossibility of attaining the aim , that is to say , the end . 
From what motive , then , am I taking all this trouble ? 
-- Envy of Grushnitski ? 
Poor fellow ! 
He is quite undeserving of it . 
Or , is it the result of that ugly , but invincible , feeling which causes us to destroy the sweet illusions of our neighbour in order to have the petty satisfaction of saying to him , when , in despair , he asks what he is to believe : `` My friend , the same thing happened to me , and you see , nevertheless , that I dine , sup , and sleep very peacefully , and I shall , I hope , know how to die without tears and lamentations . '' 
There is , in sooth , a boundless enjoyment in the possession of a young , scarce-budded soul ! 
It is like a floweret which exhales its best perfume at the kiss of the first ray of the sun . 
You should pluck the flower at that moment , and , breathing its fragrance to the full , cast it upon the road : perchance someone will pick it up ! 
I feel within me that insatiate hunger which devours everything it meets upon the way ; I look upon the sufferings and joys of others only from the point of view of their relation to myself , regarding them as the nutriment which sustains my spiritual forces . 
I myself am no longer capable of committing follies under the influence of passion ; with me , ambition has been repressed by circumstances , but it has emerged in another form , because ambition is nothing more nor less than a thirst for power , and my chief pleasure is to make everything that surrounds me subject to my will . 
To arouse the feeling of love , devotion and awe towards oneself -- is not that the first sign , and the greatest triumph , of power ? 
To be the cause of suffering and joy to another -- without in the least possessing any definite right to be so -- is not that the sweetest food for our pride ? 
And what is happiness ? 
-- Satisfied pride . 
Were I to consider myself the best , the most powerful man in the world , I should be happy ; were all to love me , I should find within me inexhaustible springs of love . 
Evil begets evil ; the first suffering gives us the conception of the satisfaction of torturing another . 
The idea of evil can not enter the mind without arousing a desire to put it actually into practice . 
`` Ideas are organic entities , '' someone has said . 
The very fact of their birth endows them with form , and that form is action . 
He in whose brain the most ideas are born accomplishes the most . 
From that cause a genius , chained to an official desk , must die or go mad , just as it often happens that a man of powerful constitution , and at the same time of sedentary life and simple habits , dies of an apoplectic stroke . 
Passions are naught but ideas in their first development ; they are an attribute of the youth of the heart , and foolish is he who thinks that he will be agitated by them all his life . 
Many quiet rivers begin their course as noisy waterfalls , and there is not a single stream which will leap or foam throughout its way to the sea . 
That quietness , however , is frequently the sign of great , though latent , strength . 
The fulness and depth of feelings and thoughts do not admit of frenzied outbursts . 
In suffering and in enjoyment the soul renders itself a strict account of all it experiences and convinces itself that such things must be . 
It knows that , but for storms , the constant heat of the sun would dry it up ! 
It imbues itself with its own life -- pets and punishes itself like a favourite child . 
It is only in that highest state of self-knowledge that a man can appreciate the divine justice . 
On reading over this page , I observe that I have made a wide digression from my subject ... But what matter ? 
... You see , it is for myself that I am writing this diary , and , consequently anything that I jot down in it will in time be a valuable reminiscence for me . . . . . . 
Grushnitski has called to see me to-day . 
He flung himself upon my neck ; he has been promoted to be an officer . 
We drank champagne . 
Doctor Werner came in after him . 
`` I do not congratulate you , '' he said to Grushnitski . 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Because the soldier 's cloak suits you very well , and you must confess that an infantry uniform , made by one of the local tailors , will not add anything of interest to you ... Do you not see ? 
Hitherto , you have been an exception , but now you will come under the general rule . '' 
`` Talk away , doctor , talk away ! 
You will not prevent me from rejoicing . 
He does not know , '' added Grushnitski in a whisper to me , `` how many hopes these epaulettes have lent me ... Oh ! 
... Epaulettes , epaulettes ! 
Your little stars are guiding stars ! 
No ! 
I am perfectly happy now ! '' 
`` Are you coming with us on our walk to the hollow ? '' 
I asked him . 
`` I ? 
Not on any account will I show myself to Princess Mary until my uniform is finished . '' 
`` Would you like me to inform her of your happiness ? '' 
`` No , please , not a word ... I want to give her a surprise '' ... `` Tell me , though , how are you getting on with her ? '' 
He became embarrassed , and fell into thought ; he would gladly have bragged and told lies , but his conscience would not let him ; and , at the same time , he was ashamed to confess the truth . 
`` What do you think ? 
Does she love you ? '' 
... `` Love me ? 
Good gracious , Pechorin , what ideas you do have ! 
... How could she possibly love me so soon ? 
... And a well-bred woman , even if she is in love , will never say so '' ... `` Very well ! 
And , I suppose , in your opinion , a well-bred man should also keep silence in regard to his passion ? '' 
... `` Ah , my dear fellow ! 
There are ways of doing everything ; often things may remain unspoken , but yet may be guessed '' ... `` That is true ... But the love which we read in the eyes does not pledge a woman to anything , whilst words ... Have a care , Grushnitski , she is befooling you ! '' 
`` She ? '' 
he answered , raising his eyes heavenward and smiling complacently . 
`` I am sorry for you , Pechorin ! '' 
... He took his departure . 
In the evening , a numerous company set off to walk to the hollow . 
In the opinion of the learned of Pyatigorsk , the hollow in question is nothing more nor less than an extinct crater . 
It is situated on a slope of Mount Mashuk , at the distance of a verst from the town , and is approached by a narrow path between brushwood and rocks . 
In climbing up the hill , I gave Princess Mary my arm , and she did not leave it during the whole excursion . 
Our conversation commenced with slander ; I proceeded to pass in review our present and absent acquaintances ; at first I exposed their ridiculous , and then their bad , sides . 
My choler rose . 
I began in jest , and ended in genuine malice . 
At first she was amused , but afterwards frightened . 
`` You are a dangerous man ! '' 
she said . 
`` I would rather perish in the woods under the knife of an assassin than under your tongue ... In all earnestness I beg of you : when it comes into your mind to speak evil of me , take a knife instead and cut my throat . 
I think you would not find that a very difficult matter . '' 
`` Am I like an assassin , then ? '' 
... `` You are worse '' ... I fell into thought for a moment ; then , assuming a deeply moved air , I said : `` Yes , such has been my lot from very childhood ! 
All have read upon my countenance the marks of bad qualities , which were not existent ; but they were assumed to exist -- and they were born . 
I was modest -- I was accused of slyness : I grew secretive . 
I profoundly felt both good and evil -- no one caressed me , all insulted me : I grew vindictive . 
I was gloomy -- other children merry and talkative ; I felt myself higher than they -- I was rated lower : I grew envious . 
I was prepared to love the whole world -- no one understood me : I learned to hate . 
My colourless youth flowed by in conflict with myself and the world ; fearing ridicule , I buried my best feelings in the depths of my heart , and there they died . 
I spoke the truth -- I was not believed : I began to deceive . 
Having acquired a thorough knowledge of the world and the springs of society , I grew skilled in the science of life ; and I saw how others without skill were happy , enjoying gratuitously the advantages which I so unweariedly sought . 
Then despair was born within my breast -- not that despair which is cured at the muzzle of a pistol , but the cold , powerless despair concealed beneath the mask of amiability and a good-natured smile . 
I became a moral cripple . 
One half of my soul ceased to exist ; it dried up , evaporated , died , and I cut it off and cast it from me .
