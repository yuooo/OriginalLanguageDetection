The other half moved and lived -- at the service of all ; but it remained unobserved , because no one knew that the half which had perished had ever existed . 
But , now , the memory of it has been awakened within me by you , and I have read you its epitaph . 
To many , epitaphs in general seem ridiculous , but to me they do not ; especially when I remember what reposes beneath them . 
I will not , however , ask you to share my opinion . 
If this outburst seems absurd to you , I pray you , laugh ! 
I forewarn you that your laughter will not cause me the least chagrin . '' 
At that moment I met her eyes : tears were welling in them . 
Her arm , as it leaned upon mine , was trembling ; her cheeks were aflame ; she pitied me ! 
Sympathy -- a feeling to which all women yield so easily , had dug its talons into her inexperienced heart . 
During the whole excursion she was preoccupied , and did not flirt with anyone -- and that is a great sign ! 
We arrived at the hollow ; the ladies left their cavaliers , but she did not let go my arm . 
The witticisms of the local dandies failed to make her laugh ; the steepness of the declivity beside which she was standing caused her no alarm , although the other ladies uttered shrill cries and shut their eyes . 
On the way back , I did not renew our melancholy conversation , but to my idle questions and jests she gave short and absent-minded answers . 
`` Have you ever been in love ? '' 
I asked her at length . 
She looked at me intently , shook her head and again fell into a reverie . 
It was evident that she was wishing to say something , but did not know how to begin . 
Her breast heaved ... And , indeed , that was but natural ! 
A muslin sleeve is a weak protection , and an electric spark was running from my arm to hers . 
Almost all passions have their beginning in that way , and frequently we are very much deceived in thinking that a woman loves us for our moral and physical merits ; of course , these prepare and predispose the heart for the reception of the holy flame , but for all that it is the first touch that decides the matter . 
`` I have been very amiable to-day , have I not ? '' 
Princess Mary said to me , with a forced smile , when we had returned from the walk . 
We separated . 
She is dissatisfied with herself . 
She accuses herself of coldness ... Oh , that is the first , the chief triumph ! 
To-morrow , she will be feeling a desire to recompense me . 
I know the whole proceeding by heart already -- that is what is so tiresome ! 
I HAVE seen Vera to-day . 
She has begun to plague me with her jealousy . 
Princess Mary has taken it into her head , it seems , to confide the secrets of her heart to Vera : a happy choice , it must be confessed ! 
`` I can guess what all this is leading to , '' said Vera to me . 
`` You had better simply tell me at once that you are in love with her . '' 
`` But supposing I am not in love with her ? '' 
`` Then why run after her , disturb her , agitate her imagination ! 
... Oh , I know you well ! 
Listen -- if you wish me to believe you , come to Kislovodsk in a week 's time ; we shall be moving thither the day after to-morrow . 
Princess Mary will remain here longer . 
Engage lodgings next door to us . 
We shall be living in the large house near the spring , on the mezzanine floor . 
Princess Ligovski will be below us , and next door there is a house belonging to the same landlord , which has not yet been taken ... Will you come ? '' 
... I gave my promise , and this very same day I have sent to engage the lodgings . 
Grushnitski came to me at six o'clock and announced that his uniform would be ready to-morrow , just in time for him to go to the ball in it . 
`` At last I shall dance with her the whole evening through ... And then I shall talk to my heart 's content , '' he added . 
`` When is the ball ? '' 
`` Why , to-morrow ! 
Do you not know , then ? 
A great festival -- and the local authorities have undertaken to organize it '' ... `` Let us go to the boulevard '' ... `` Not on any account , in this nasty cloak '' ... `` What ! 
Have you ceased to love it ? '' 
... I went out alone , and , meeting Princess Mary I asked her to keep the mazurka for me . 
She seemed surprised and delighted . 
`` I thought that you would only dance from necessity as on the last occasion , '' she said , with a very charming smile ... She does not seem to notice Grushnitski 's absence at all . 
`` You will be agreeably surprised to-morrow , '' I said to her . 
`` At what ? '' 
`` That is a secret ... You will find it out yourself , at the ball . '' 
I finished up the evening at Princess Ligovski 's ; there were no other guests present except Vera and a certain very amusing , little old gentleman . 
I was in good spirits , and improvised various extraordinary stories . 
Princess Mary sat opposite me and listened to my nonsense with such deep , strained , and even tender attention that I grew ashamed of myself . 
What had become of her vivacity , her coquetry , her caprices , her haughty mien , her contemptuous smile , her absentminded glance ? 
... Vera noticed everything , and her sickly countenance was a picture of profound grief . 
She was sitting in the shadow by the window , buried in a wide arm-chair ... I pitied her . 
Then I related the whole dramatic story of our acquaintanceship , our love -- concealing it all , of course , under fictitious names . 
So vividly did I portray my tenderness , my anxieties , my raptures ; in so favourable a light did I exhibit her actions and her character , that involuntarily she had to forgive me for my flirtation with Princess Mary . 
She rose , sat down beside us , and brightened up ... and it was only at two o'clock in the morning that we remembered that the doctors had ordered her to go to bed at eleven . 
HALF an hour before the ball , Grushnitski presented himself to me in the full splendour of the uniform of the Line infantry . 
Attached to his third button was a little bronze chain , on which hung a double lorgnette . 
Epaulettes of incredible size were bent backwards and upwards in the shape of a cupid 's wings ; his boots creaked ; in his left hand he held cinnamon-coloured kid gloves and a forage-cap , and with his right he kept every moment twisting his frizzled tuft of hair up into tiny curls . 
Complacency and at the same time a certain diffidence were depicted upon his face . 
His festal appearance and proud gait would have made me burst out laughing , if such a proceeding had been in accordance with my intentions . 
He threw his cap and gloves on the table and began to pull down the skirts of his coat and to put himself to rights before the looking-glass . 
An enormous black handkerchief , which was twisted into a very high stiffener for his cravat , and the bristles of which supported his chin , stuck out an inch over his collar . 
It seemed to him to be rather small , and he drew it up as far as his ears . 
As a result of that hard work -- the collar of his uniform being very tight and uncomfortable -- he grew red in the face . 
`` They say you have been courting my princess terribly these last few days ? '' 
he said , rather carelessly and without looking at me . '' 
` Where are we fools to drink tea ! ' '' 
-LSB- 271 -RSB- I answered , repeating a pet phrase of one of the cleverest rogues of past times , once celebrated in song by Pushkin . 
`` Tell me , does my uniform fit me well ? 
... Oh , the cursed Jew ! 
... How it cuts me under the armpits ! 
... Have you got any scent ? '' 
`` Good gracious , what more do you want ? 
You are reeking of rose pomade as it is . '' 
`` Never mind . 
Give me some '' ... He poured half a phial over his cravat , his pocket-handkerchief , his sleeves . 
`` You are going to dance ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I think not . '' 
`` I am afraid I shall have to lead off the mazurka with Princess Mary , and I scarcely know a single figure '' ... `` Have you asked her to dance the mazurka with you ? '' 
`` Not yet '' ... `` Mind you are not forestalled '' ... `` Just so , indeed ! '' 
he said , striking his forehead . 
`` Good-bye ... I will go and wait for her at the entrance . '' 
He seized his forage-cap and ran . 
Half an hour later I also set off . 
The street was dark and deserted . 
Around the assembly rooms , or inn -- whichever you prefer -- people were thronging . 
The windows were lighted up , the strains of the regimental band were borne to me on the evening breeze . 
I walked slowly ; I felt melancholy . 
`` Can it be possible , '' I thought , `` that my sole mission on earth is to destroy the hopes of others ? 
Ever since I began to live and to act , it seems always to have been my fate to play a part in the ending of other people 's dramas , as if , but for me , no one could either die or fall into despair ! 
I have been the indispensable person of the fifth act ; unwillingly I have played the pitiful part of an executioner or a traitor . 
What object has fate had in this ? 
... Surely , I have not been appointed by destiny to be an author of middle-class tragedies and family romances , or to be a collaborator with the purveyor of stories -- for the ` Reader 's Library , ' -LSB- 272 -RSB- for example ? 
... How can I tell ? 
... Are there not many people who , in beginning life , think to end it like Lord Byron or Alexander the Great , and , nevertheless , remain Titular Councillors -LSB- 273 -RSB- all their days ? '' 
Entering the saloon , I concealed myself in a crowd of men , and began to make my observations . 
Grushnitski was standing beside Princess Mary and saying something with great warmth . 
She was listening to him absent-mindedly and looking about her , her fan laid to her lips . 
Impatience was depicted upon her face , her eyes were searching all around for somebody . 
I went softly behind them in order to listen to their conversation . 
`` You torture me , Princess ! '' 
Grushnitski was saying . 
`` You have changed dreadfully since I saw you last '' ... `` You , too , have changed , '' she answered , casting a rapid glance at him , in which he was unable to detect the latent sneer . 
`` I ! 
Changed ? 
... Oh , never ! 
You know that such a thing is impossible ! 
Whoever has seen you once will bear your divine image with him for ever . '' 
`` Stop '' ... `` But why will you not let me say to-night what you have so often listened to with condescension -- and just recently , too ? '' 
... `` Because I do not like repetitions , '' she answered , laughing . 
`` Oh ! 
I have been bitterly mistaken ! 
... I thought , fool that I was , that these epaulettes , at least , would give me the right to hope ... No , it would have been better for me to have remained for ever in that contemptible soldier 's cloak , to which , probably , I was indebted for your attention '' ... `` As a matter of fact , the cloak is much more becoming to you '' ... At that moment I went up and bowed to Princess Mary . 
She blushed a little , and went on rapidly : `` Is it not true , Monsieur Pechorin , that the grey cloak suits Monsieur Grushnitski much better ? '' 
... `` I do not agree with you , '' I answered : `` he is more youthful-looking still in his uniform . '' 
That was a blow which Grushnitski could not bear : like all boys , he has pretensions to being an old man ; he thinks that the deep traces of passions upon his countenance take the place of the lines scored by Time . 
He cast a furious glance at me , stamped his foot , and took himself off . 
`` Confess now , '' I said to Princess Mary : `` that although he has always been most ridiculous , yet not so long ago he seemed to you to be interesting ... in the grey cloak ? '' 
... She cast her eyes down and made no reply . 
Grushnitski followed the Princess about during the whole evening and danced either with her or vis-a-vis . 
He devoured her with his eyes , sighed , and wearied her with prayers and reproaches . 
After the third quadrille she had begun to hate him . 
`` I did not expect this from you , '' he said , coming up to me and taking my arm . 
`` What ? '' 
`` You are going to dance the mazurka with her ? '' 
he asked in a solemn tone . 
`` She admitted it '' ... `` Well , what then ? 
It is not a secret , is it '' ? 
`` Of course not ... I ought to have expected such a thing from that chit -- that flirt ... I will have my revenge , though ! '' 
`` You should lay the blame on your cloak , or your epaulettes , but why accuse her ? 
What fault is it of hers that she does not like you any longer ? '' 
... `` But why give me hopes ? '' 
`` Why did you hope ? 
To desire and to strive after something -- that I can understand ! 
But who ever hopes ? '' 
`` You have won the wager , but not quite , '' he said , with a malignant smile . 
The mazurka began . 
Grushnitski chose no one but the Princess , other cavaliers chose her every minute : obviously a conspiracy against me -- all the better ! 
She wants to talk to me , they are preventing her -- she will want to twice as much . 
I squeezed her hand once or twice ; the second time she drew it away without saying a word . 
`` I shall sleep badly to-night , '' she said to me when the mazurka was over . 
`` Grushnitski is to blame for that . '' 
`` Oh , no ! '' 
And her face became so pensive , so sad , that I promised myself that I would not fail to kiss her hand that evening . 
The guests began to disperse . 
As I was handing Princess Mary into her carriage , I rapidly pressed her little hand to my lips . 
The night was dark and nobody could see . 
I returned to the saloon very well satisfied with myself . 
The young men , Grushnitski amongst them , were having supper at the large table . 
As I came in , they all fell silent : evidently they had been talking about me . 
Since the last ball many of them have been sulky with me , especially the captain of dragoons ; and now , it seems , a hostile gang is actually being formed against me , under the command of Grushnitski . 
He wears such a proud and courageous air ... I am very glad ; I love enemies , though not in the Christian sense . 
They amuse me , stir my blood . 
To be always on one 's guard , to catch every glance , the meaning of every word , to guess intentions , to crush conspiracies , to pretend to be deceived and suddenly with one blow to overthrow the whole immense and laboriously constructed edifice of cunning and design -- that is what I call life . 
During supper Grushnitski kept whispering and exchanging winks with the captain of dragoons . 
VERA and her husband left this morning for Kislovodsk . 
I met their carriage as I was walking to Princess Ligovski 's . 
Vera nodded to me : reproach was in her glance . 
Who is to blame , then ? 
Why will she not give me an opportunity of seeing her alone ? 
Love is like fire -- if not fed it dies out . 
Perchance , jealousy will accomplish what my entreaties have failed to do . 
I stayed a whole hour at Princess Ligovski 's . 
Mary has not been out , she is ill . 
In the evening she was not on the boulevard . 
The newly formed gang , armed with lorgnettes , has in very fact assumed a menacing aspect . 
I am glad that Princess Mary is ill ; they might be guilty of some impertinence towards her . 
Grushnitski goes about with dishevelled locks , and wears an appearance of despair : he is evidently afflicted , as a matter of fact ; his vanity especially has been injured . 
But , you see , there are some people in whom even despair is diverting ! 
... On my way home I noticed that something was lacking . 
I have not seen her ! 
She is ill ! 
Surely I have not fallen in love with her in real earnest ? 
... What nonsense ! 
AT eleven o'clock in the morning -- the hour at which Princess Ligovski is usually perspiring in the Ermolov baths -- I walked past her house . 
Princess Mary was sitting pensively at the window ; on seeing me she sprang up . 
I entered the ante-room , there was nobody there , and , availing myself of the freedom afforded by the local customs , I made my way , unannounced , into the drawing-room . 
Princess Mary 's charming countenance was shrouded with a dull pallor . 
She was standing by the pianoforte , leaning one hand on the back of an arm-chair ; her hand was very faintly trembling . 
I went up to her softly and said : `` You are angry with me ? '' 
... She lifted a deep , languid glance upon me and shook her head . 
Her lips were about to utter something , but failed ; her eyes filled with tears ; she sank into the arm-chair and buried her face in her hands . 
`` What is the matter with you ? '' 
I said , taking her hand . 
`` You do not respect me ! 
... Oh , leave me ! '' 
... I took a few steps ... She drew herself up in the chair , her eyes sparkled . 
I stopped still , took hold of the handle of the door , and said : `` Forgive me , Princess . 
I have acted like a madman ... It will not happen another time ; I shall see to that ... But how can you know what has been taking place hitherto within my soul ? 
That you will never learn , and so much the better for you . 
Farewell . '' 
As I was going out , I seemed to hear her weeping . 
I wandered on foot about the environs of Mount Mashuk till evening , fatigued myself terribly and , on arriving home , flung myself on my bed , utterly exhausted . 
Werner came to see me . 
`` Is it true , '' he asked , `` that you are going to marry Princess Mary ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` The whole town is saying so . 
All my patients are occupied with that important piece of news ; but you know what these patients are : they know everything . '' 
`` This is one of Grushnitski 's tricks , '' I said to myself . 
`` To prove the falsity of these rumours , doctor , I may mention , as a secret , that I am moving to Kislovodsk to-morrow '' ... `` And Princess Mary , too ? '' 
`` No , she remains here another week '' ... `` So you are not going to get married ? '' 
... `` Doctor , doctor ! 
Look at me ! 
Am I in the least like a bridegroom , or any such thing ? '' 
`` I am not saying so ... But you know there are occasions ... '' he added , with a crafty smile -- `` in which an honourable man is obliged to marry , and there are mothers who , to say the least , do not prevent such occasions ... And so , as a friend , I should advise you to be more cautious . 
The air of these parts is very dangerous . 
How many handsome young men , worthy of a better fate , have I not seen departing from here straight to the altar ! 
... Would you believe me , they were even going to find a wife for me ! 
That is to say , one person was -- a lady belonging to this district , who had a very pale daughter . 
I had the misfortune to tell her that the latter 's colour would be restored after wedlock , and then with tears of gratitude she offered me her daughter 's hand and the whole of her own fortune -- fifty souls , -LSB- 28 -RSB- I think . 
But I replied that I was unfit for such an honour . '' 
Werner left , fully convinced that he had put me on my guard . 
I gathered from his words that various ugly rumours were already being spread about the town on the subject of Princess Mary and myself : Grushnitski shall smart for this ! 
I HAVE been in Kislovodsk three days now . 
Every day I see Vera at the well and out walking . 
In the morning , when I awake , I sit by my window and direct my lorgnette at her balcony . 
She has already been dressed long ago , and is waiting for the signal agreed upon . 
We meet , as though unexpectedly , in the garden which slopes down from our houses to the well . 
The life-giving mountain air has brought back her colour and her strength . 
Not for nothing is Narzan called the `` Spring of Heroes . '' 
The inhabitants aver that the air of Kislovodsk predisposes the heart to love and that all the romances which have had their beginning at the foot of Mount Mashuk find their consummation here . 
And , in very fact , everything here breathes of solitude ; everything has an air of secrecy -- the thick shadows of the linden avenues , bending over the torrent which falls , noisy and foaming , from flag to flag and cleaves itself a way between the mountains now becoming clad with verdure -- the mist-filled , silent ravines , with their ramifications straggling away in all directions -- the freshness of the aromatic air , laden with the fragrance of the tall southern grasses and the white acacia -- the never-ceasing , sweetly-slumberous babble of the cool brooks , which , meeting at the end of the valley , flow along in friendly emulation , and finally fling themselves into the Podkumok . 
On this side , the ravine is wider and becomes converted into a verdant dell , through which winds the dusty road . 
Every time I look at it , I seem to see a carriage coming along and a rosy little face looking out of the carriage-window . 
Many carriages have already driven by -- but still there is no sign of that particular one . 
The village which lies behind the fortress has become populous . 
In the restaurant , built upon a hill a few paces distant from my lodgings , lights are beginning to flash in the evening through the double row of poplars ; noise and the jingling of glasses resound till late at night . 
In no place are such quantities of Kakhetian wine and mineral waters drunk as here . 
`` And many are willing to mix the two , But that is a thing I never do . '' 
Every day Grushnitski and his gang are to be found brawling in the inn , and he has almost ceased to greet me . 
He only arrived yesterday , and has already succeeded in quarrelling with three old men who were going to take their places in the baths before him . 
Decidedly , his misfortunes are developing a warlike spirit within him . 
AT last they have arrived . 
I was sitting by the window when I heard the clattering of their carriage . 
My heart throbbed ... What does it mean ? 
Can it be that I am in love ? 
... I am so stupidly constituted that such a thing might be expected of me . 
I dined at their house . 
Princess Ligovski looked at me with much tenderness , and did not leave her daughter 's side ... a bad sign ! 
On the other hand , Vera is jealous of me in regard to Princess Mary -- however , I have been striving for that good fortune . 
What will not a woman do in order to chagrin her rival ? 
I remember that once a woman loved me simply because I was in love with another woman . 
There is nothing more paradoxical than the female mind ; it is difficult to convince a woman of anything ; they have to be led into convincing themselves . 
The order of the proofs by which they demolish their prejudices is most original ; to learn their dialectic it is necessary to overthrow in your own mind every scholastic rule of logic . 
For example , the usual way : `` This man loves me ; but I am married : therefore I must not love him . '' 
The woman 's way : `` I must not love him , because I am married ; but he loves me -- therefore '' ... A few dots here , because reason has no more to say . 
But , generally , there is something to be said by the tongue , and the eyes , and , after these , the heart -- if there is such a thing . 
What if these notes should one day meet a woman 's eye ? 
`` Slander ! '' 
she will exclaim indignantly . 
Ever since poets have written and women have read them -LRB- for which the poets should be most deeply grateful -RRB- women have been called angels so many times that , in very truth , in their simplicity of soul , they have believed the compliment , forgetting that , for money , the same poets have glorified Nero as a demigod ... It would be unreasonable were I to speak of women with such malignity -- I who have loved nothing else in the world -- I who have always been ready to sacrifice for their sake ease , ambition , life itself ... But , you see , I am not endeavouring , in a fit of vexation and injured vanity , to pluck from them the magic veil through which only an accustomed glance can penetrate . 
No , all that I say about them is but the result of `` A mind which coldly hath observed , A heart which bears the stamp of woe . '' 
-LSB- 29 -RSB- Women ought to wish that all men knew them as well as I because I have loved them a hundred times better since I have ceased to be afraid of them and have comprehended their little weaknesses . 
By the way : the other day , Werner compared women to the enchanted forest of which Tasso tells in his `` Jerusalem Delivered . '' 
-LSB- 30 -RSB- `` So soon as you approach , '' he said , `` from all directions terrors , such as I pray Heaven may preserve us from , will take wing at you : duty , pride , decorum , public opinion , ridicule , contempt ... You must simply go straight on without looking at them ; gradually the monsters disappear , and , before you , opens a bright and quiet glade , in the midst of which blooms the green myrtle . 
On the other hand , woe to you if , at the first steps , your heart trembles and you turn back ! '' 
THIS evening has been fertile in events . 
About three versts from Kislovodsk , in the gorge through which the Podkumok flows , there is a cliff called the Ring . 
It is a naturally formed gate , rising upon a lofty hill , and through it the setting sun throws its last flaming glance upon the world . 
A numerous cavalcade set off thither to gaze at the sunset through the rock-window . 
To tell the truth , not one of them was thinking about the sun . 
I rode beside Princess Mary . 
On the way home , we had to ford the Podkumok . 
Mountain streams , even the smallest , are dangerous ; especially so , because the bottom is a perfect kaleidoscope : it changes every day owing to the pressure of the current ; where yesterday there was a rock , to-day there is a cavity . 
I took Princess Mary 's horse by the bridle and led it into the water , which came no higher than its knees . 
We began to move slowly in a slanting direction against the current . 
It is a well-known fact that , in crossing rapid streamlets , you should never look at the water , because , if you do , your head begins to whirl directly . 
I forgot to warn Princess Mary of that . 
We had reached the middle and were right in the vortex , when suddenly she reeled in her saddle . 
`` I feel ill ! '' 
she said in a faint voice . 
I bent over to her rapidly and threw my arm around her supple waist . 
`` Look up ! '' 
I whispered . 
`` It is nothing ; just be brave ! 
I am with you . '' 
She grew better ; she was about to disengage herself from my arm , but I clasped her tender , soft figure in a still closer embrace ; my cheek almost touched hers , from which was wafted flame . 
`` What are you doing to me ? 
... Oh , Heaven ! '' 
... I paid no attention to her alarm and confusion , and my lips touched her tender cheek . 
She shuddered , but said nothing . 
We were riding behind the others : nobody saw us . 
When we made our way out on the bank , the horses were all put to the trot . 
Princess Mary kept hers back ; I remained beside her . 
It was evident that my silence was making her uneasy , but I swore to myself that I would not speak a single word -- out of curiosity . 
I wanted to see how she would extricate herself from that embarrassing position . 
`` Either you despise me , or you love me very much ! '' 
she said at length , and there were tears in her voice . 
`` Perhaps you want to laugh at me , to excite my soul and then to abandon me ... That would be so base , so vile , that the mere supposition ... Oh , no ! '' 
she added , in a voice of tender trustfulness ; `` there is nothing in me which would preclude respect ; is it not so ? 
Your presumptuous action ... I must , I must forgive you for it , because I permitted it ... Answer , speak , I want to hear your voice ! '' 
... There was such womanly impatience in her last words that , involuntarily , I smiled ; happily it was beginning to grow dusk ... I made no answer . 
`` You are silent ! '' 
she continued ; `` you wish , perhaps , that I should be the first to tell you that I love you . '' 
... I remained silent . 
`` Is that what you wish ? '' 
she continued , turning rapidly towards me ... . 
There was something terrible in the determination of her glance and voice . 
`` Why ? '' 
I answered , shrugging my shoulders . 
She struck her horse with her riding-whip and set off at full gallop along the narrow , dangerous road . 
It all happened so quickly that I was scarcely able to overtake her , and then only by the time she had joined the rest of the company . 
All the way home she was continually talking and laughing . 
There was something feverish in her movements ; not once did she look in my direction . 
Everybody observed her unusual gaiety . 
Princess Ligovski rejoiced inwardly as she looked at her daughter . 
However , the latter simply has a fit of nerves : she will spend a sleepless night , and will weep . 
This thought affords me measureless delight : there are moments when I understand the Vampire ... And yet I am reputed to be a good fellow , and I strive to earn that designation ! 
On dismounting , the ladies went into Princess Ligovski 's house . 
I was excited , and I galloped to the mountains in order to dispel the thoughts which had thronged into my head . 
The dewy evening breathed an intoxicating coolness . 
The moon was rising from behind the dark summits . 
Each step of my unshod horse resounded hollowly in the silence of the gorges . 
I watered the horse at the waterfall , and then , after greedily inhaling once or twice the fresh air of the southern night . 
I set off on my way back . 
I rode through the village . 
The lights in the windows were beginning to go out ; the sentries on the fortress-rampart and the Cossacks in the surrounding pickets were calling out in drawling tones to one another . 
In one of the village houses , built at the edge of a ravine , I noticed an extraordinary illumination . 
At times , discordant murmurs and shouting could be heard , proving that a military carouse was in full swing . 
I dismounted and crept up to the window . 
The shutter had not been made fast , and I could see the banqueters and catch what they were saying . 
They were talking about me . 
The captain of dragoons , flushed with wine , struck the table with his fist , demanding attention . 
`` Gentlemen ! '' 
he said , `` this wo n't do ! 
Pechorin must be taught a lesson ! 
These Petersburg fledglings always carry their heads high until they get a slap in the face ! 
He thinks that because he always wears clean gloves and polished boots he is the only one who has ever lived in society . 
And what a haughty smile ! 
All the same , I am convinced that he is a coward -- yes , a coward ! '' 
`` I think so too , '' said Grushnitski . 
`` He is fond of getting himself out of trouble by pretending to be only having a joke . 
I once gave him such a talking to that anyone else in his place would have cut me to pieces on the spot . 
But Pechorin turned it all to the ridiculous side . 
I , of course , did not call him out because that was his business , but he did not care to have anything more to do with it . '' 
`` Grushnitski is angry with him for having captured Princess Mary from him , '' somebody said . 
`` That 's a new idea ! 
It is true I did run after Princess Mary a little , but I left off at once because I do not want to get married ; and it is against my rules to compromise a girl . '' 
`` Yes , I assure you that he is a coward of the first water , I mean Pechorin , not Grushnitski -- but Grushnitski is a fine fellow , and , besides , he is my true friend ! '' 
the captain of dragoons went on . 
`` Gentlemen ! 
Nobody here stands up for him ? 
Nobody ? 
So much the better ! 
Would you like to put his courage to the test ? 
It would be amusing '' ... `` We would ; but how ? '' 
`` Listen here , then : Grushnitski in particular is angry with him -- therefore to Grushnitski falls the chief part . 
He will pick a quarrel over some silly trifle or other , and will challenge Pechorin to a duel ... Wait a bit ; here is where the joke comes in ... He will challenge him to a duel ; very well ! 
The whole proceeding -- challenge , preparations , conditions -- will be as solemn and awe-inspiring as possible -- I will see to that . 
I will be your second , my poor friend ! 
Very well ! 
Only here is the rub ; we will put no bullets in the pistols . 
I can answer for it that Pechorin will turn coward -- I will place them six paces apart , devil take it ! 
Are you agreed , gentlemen ? '' 
`` Splendid idea ! 
... Agreed ! 
... And why not ? '' 
... came from all sides . 
`` And you , Grushnitski ? '' 
Tremblingly I awaited Grushnitski 's answer . 
I was filled with cold rage at the thought that , but for an accident , I might have made myself the laughing-stock of those fools . 
If Grushnitski had not agreed , I should have thrown myself upon his neck ; but , after an interval of silence , he rose from his place , extended his hand to the captain , and said very gravely : `` Very well , I agree ! '' 
It would be difficult to describe the enthusiasm of that honourable company . 
I returned home , agitated by two different feelings . 
The first was sorrow . 
`` Why do they all hate me ? '' 
I thought -- `` why ? 
Have I affronted anyone ? 
No . 
Can it be that I am one of those men the mere sight of whom is enough to create animosity ? '' 
And I felt a venomous rage gradually filling my soul . 
`` Have a care , Mr. Grushnitski ! '' 
I said , walking up and down the room : `` I am not to be jested with like this ! 
You may pay dearly for the approbation of your foolish comrades . 
I am not your toy ! '' 
... I got no sleep that night . 
By daybreak I was as yellow as an orange . 
In the morning I met Princess Mary at the well . 
`` You are ill ? '' 
she said , looking intently at me . 
`` I did not sleep last night . '' 
`` Nor I either ... I was accusing you ... perhaps groundlessly . 
But explain yourself , I can forgive you everything '' ... `` Everything ? '' 
... `` Everything ... only speak the truth ... and be quick ... You see , I have been thinking a good deal , trying to explain , to justify , your behaviour . 
Perhaps you are afraid of opposition on the part of my relations ... that will not matter . 
When they learn '' ... Her voice shook . 
`` I will win them over by entreaties . 
Or , is it your own position ? 
... But you know that I can sacrifice everything for the sake of the man I love ... Oh , answer quickly -- have pity ... You do not despise me -- do you ? '' 
She seized my hand . 
Princess Ligovski was walking in front of us with Vera 's husband , and had not seen anything ; but we might have been observed by some of the invalids who were strolling about -- the most inquisitive gossips of all inquisitive folk -- and I rapidly disengaged my hand from her passionate pressure .
