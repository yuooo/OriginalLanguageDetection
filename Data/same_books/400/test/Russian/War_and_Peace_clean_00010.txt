`` No , I tell you . '' 
And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow . 
`` Where have you put it , Wostov ? '' 
`` Under the lower pillow . '' 
`` It 's not there . '' 
Denisov threw both pillows on the floor . 
The purse was not there . 
`` That 's a miwacle . '' 
`` Wait , have n't you dropped it ? '' 
said Rostov , picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them . 
He pulled off the quilt and shook it . 
The purse was not there . 
`` Dear me , can I have forgotten ? 
No , I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure , '' said Rostov . 
`` I put it just here . 
Where is it ? '' 
he asked , turning to Lavrushka . 
`` I have n't been in the room . 
It must be where you put it . '' 
`` But it is n't ? 
... '' `` You 're always like that ; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it . 
Feel in your pockets . '' 
`` No , if I had n't thought of it being a treasure , '' said Rostov , `` but I remember putting it there . '' 
Lavrushka turned all the bedding over , looked under the bed and under the table , searched everywhere , and stood still in the middle of the room . 
Denisov silently watched Lavrushka 's movements , and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denisov glanced at Rostov . 
`` Wostov , you 've not been playing schoolboy twicks ... '' Rostov felt Denisov 's gaze fixed on him , raised his eyes , and instantly dropped them again . 
All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes . 
He could not draw breath . 
`` And there has n't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves . 
It must be here somewhere , '' said Lavrushka . 
`` Now then , you devil 's puppet , look alive and hunt for it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture . 
`` If the purse is n't found I 'll flog you , I 'll flog you all . '' 
Rostov , his eyes avoiding Denisov , began buttoning his coat , buckled on his saber , and put on his cap . 
`` I must have that purse , I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall . 
`` Denisov , let him alone , I know who has taken it , '' said Rostov , going toward the door without raising his eyes . 
Denisov paused , thought a moment , and , evidently understanding what Rostov hinted at , seized his arm . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he cried , and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords . 
`` You are mad , I tell you . 
I wo n't allow it . 
The purse is here ! 
I 'll flay this scoundwel alive , and it will be found . '' 
`` I know who has taken it , '' repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice , and went to the door . 
`` And I tell you , do n't you dahe to do it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , rushing at the cadet to restrain him . 
But Rostov pulled away his arm and , with as much anger as though Denisov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face . 
`` Do you understand what you 're saying ? '' 
he said in a trembling voice . 
`` There was no one else in the room except myself . 
So that if it is not so , then ... '' He could not finish , and ran out of the room . 
`` Ah , may the devil take you and evewybody , '' were the last words Rostov heard . 
Rostov went to Telyanin 's quarters . 
`` The master is not in , he 's gone to headquarters , '' said Telyanin 's orderly . 
`` Has something happened ? '' 
he added , surprised at the cadet 's troubled face . 
`` No , nothing . '' 
`` You 've only just missed him , '' said the orderly . 
The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck , and Rostov , without returning home , took a horse and rode there . 
There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented . 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin 's horse at the porch . 
In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine . 
`` Ah , you 've come here too , young man ! '' 
he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows . 
`` Yes , '' said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word ; and he sat down at the nearest table . 
Both were silent . 
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room . 
No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant . 
When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and , drawing its rings aside with his small , white , turned-up fingers , drew out a gold imperial , and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter . 
`` Please be quick , '' he said . 
The coin was a new one . 
Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin . 
`` Allow me to look at your purse , '' he said in a low , almost inaudible , voice . 
With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised , Telyanin handed him the purse . 
`` Yes , it 's a nice purse . 
Yes , yes , '' he said , growing suddenly pale , and added , `` Look at it , young man . '' 
Rostov took the purse in his hand , examined it and the money in it , and looked at Telyanin . 
The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry . 
`` If we get to Vienna I 'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there 's nowhere to spend it , '' said he . 
`` Well , let me have it , young man , I 'm going . '' 
Rostov did not speak . 
`` And you ? 
Are you going to have lunch too ? 
They feed you quite decently here , '' continued Telyanin . 
`` Now then , let me have it . '' 
He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse . 
Rostov let go of it . 
Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches , with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open , as if to say , `` Yes , yes , I am putting my purse in my pocket and that 's quite simple and is no one else 's business . '' 
`` Well , young man ? '' 
he said with a sigh , and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostov 's eyes . 
Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin 's eyes to Rostov 's and back , and back again and again in an instant . 
`` Come here , '' said Rostov , catching hold of Telyanin 's arm and almost dragging him to the window . 
`` That money is Denisov 's ; you took it ... '' he whispered just above Telyanin 's ear . 
`` What ? 
What ? 
How dare you ? 
What ? '' 
said Telyanin . 
But these words came like a piteous , despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon . 
As soon as Rostov heard them , an enormous load of doubt fell from him . 
He was glad , and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him , but the task he had begun had to be completed . 
`` Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine , '' muttered Telyanin , taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room . 
`` We must have an explanation ... '' `` I know it and shall prove it , '' said Rostov . 
`` I. . . '' 
Every muscle of Telyanin 's pale , terrified face began to quiver , his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rostov 's face , and his sobs were audible . 
`` Count ! 
... Do n't ruin a young fellow ... here is this wretched money , take it ... '' He threw it on the table . 
`` I have an old father and mother ! 
... '' Rostov took the money , avoiding Telyanin 's eyes , and went out of the room without a word . 
But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps . 
`` O God , '' he said with tears in his eyes , `` how could you do it ? '' 
`` Count ... '' said Telyanin drawing nearer to him . 
`` Do n't touch me , '' said Rostov , drawing back . 
`` If you need it , take the money , '' and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn . 
That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron 's officers in Denisov 's quarters . 
`` And I tell you , Rostov , that you must apologize to the colonel ! '' 
said a tall , grizzly-haired staff captain , with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features , to Rostov who was crimson with excitement . 
The staff captain , Kirsten , had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission . 
`` I will allow no one to call me a liar ! '' 
cried Rostov . 
`` He told me I lied , and I told him he lied . 
And there it rests . 
He may keep me on duty every day , or may place me under arrest , but no one can make me apologize , because if he , as commander of this regiment , thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction , then ... '' `` You just wait a moment , my dear fellow , and listen , '' interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass , calmly stroking his long mustache . 
`` You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen ... '' `` I 'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers . 
Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them , but I am not a diplomatist . 
That 's why I joined the hussars , thinking that here one would not need finesse ; and he tells me that I am lying -- so let him give me satisfaction ... '' `` That 's all right . 
No one thinks you a coward , but that 's not the point . 
Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander ? '' 
Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation , evidently with no wish to take part in it . 
He answered the staff captain 's question by a disapproving shake of his head . 
`` You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers , '' continued the staff captain , `` and Bogdanich '' -LRB- the colonel was called Bogdanich -RRB- `` shuts you up . '' 
`` He did not shut me up , he said I was telling an untruth . '' 
`` Well , have it so , and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize . '' 
`` Not on any account ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov . 
`` I did not expect this of you , '' said the staff captain seriously and severely . 
`` You do n't wish to apologize , but , man , it 's not only to him but to the whole regiment -- all of us -- you 're to blame all round . 
The case is this : you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice ; but no , you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers . 
Now what was the colonel to do ? 
Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment ? 
Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel ? 
Is that how you look at it ? 
We do n't see it like that . 
And Bogdanich was a brick : he told you you were saying what was not true . 
It 's not pleasant , but what 's to be done , my dear fellow ? 
You landed yourself in it . 
And now , when one wants to smooth the thing over , some conceit prevents your apologizing , and you wish to make the whole affair public . 
You are offended at being put on duty a bit , but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer ? 
Whatever Bogdanich may be , anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel ! 
You 're quick at taking offense , but you do n't mind disgracing the whole regiment ! '' 
The staff captain 's voice began to tremble . 
`` You have been in the regiment next to no time , my lad , you 're here today and tomorrow you 'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said ` There are thieves among the Pavlograd officers ! ' 
But it 's not all the same to us ! 
Am I not right , Denisov ? 
It 's not the same ! '' 
Denisov remained silent and did not move , but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostov . 
`` You value your own pride and do n't wish to apologize , '' continued the staff captain , `` but we old fellows , who have grown up in and , God willing , are going to die in the regiment , we prize the honor of the regiment , and Bogdanich knows it . 
Oh , we do prize it , old fellow ! 
And all this is not right , it 's not right ! 
You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth . 
It 's not right ! '' 
And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov . 
`` That 's twue , devil take it ! '' 
shouted Denisov , jumping up . 
`` Now then , Wostov , now then ! '' 
Rostov , growing red and pale alternately , looked first at one officer and then at the other . 
`` No , gentlemen , no ... you must n't think ... I quite understand . 
You 're wrong to think that of me ... I. . . 
for me ... for the honor of the regiment I 'd ... Ah well , I 'll show that in action , and for me the honor of the flag ... Well , never mind , it 's true I 'm to blame , to blame all round . 
Well , what else do you want ? 
... '' `` Come , that 's right , Count ! '' 
cried the staff captain , turning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand . 
`` I tell you , '' shouted Denisov , `` he 's a fine fellow . '' 
`` That 's better , Count , '' said the staff captain , beginning to address Rostov by his title , as if in recognition of his confession . 
`` Go and apologize , your excellency . 
Yes , go ! '' 
`` Gentlemen , I 'll do anything . 
No one shall hear a word from me , '' said Rostov in an imploring voice , `` but I ca n't apologize , by God I ca n't , do what you will ! 
How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness ? '' 
Denisov began to laugh . 
`` It 'll be worse for you . 
Bogdanich is vindictive and you 'll pay for your obstinacy , '' said Kirsten . 
`` No , on my word it 's not obstinacy ! 
I ca n't describe the feeling . 
I ca n't ... '' `` Well , it 's as you like , '' said the staff captain . 
`` And what has become of that scoundrel ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He has weported himself sick , he 's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow , '' muttered Denisov . 
`` It is an illness , there 's no other way of explaining it , '' said the staff captain . 
`` Illness or not , he 'd better not cwoss my path . 
I 'd kill him ! '' 
shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone . 
Just then Zherkov entered the room . 
`` What brings you here ? '' 
cried the officers turning to the newcomer . 
`` We 're to go into action , gentlemen ! 
Mack has surrendered with his whole army . '' 
`` It 's not true ! '' 
`` I 've seen him myself ! '' 
`` What ? 
Saw the real Mack ? 
With hands and feet ? '' 
`` Into action ! 
Into action ! 
Bring him a bottle for such news ! 
But how did you come here ? '' 
`` I 've been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil , Mack . 
An Austrian general complained of me . 
I congratulated him on Mack 's arrival ... What 's the matter , Rostov ? 
You look as if you 'd just come out of a hot bath . '' 
`` Oh , my dear fellow , we 're in such a stew here these last two days . '' 
The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherkov . 
They were under orders to advance next day . 
`` We 're going into action , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Well , thank God ! 
We 've been sitting here too long ! '' 
Kutuzov fell back toward Vienna , destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn -LRB- at Braunau -RRB- and Traun -LRB- near Linz -RRB- . 
On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns . 
At midday the Russian baggage train , the artillery , and columns of troops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge . 
It was a warm , rainy , autumnal day . 
The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain , and then , suddenly spread out in the sunlight , far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished . 
Down below , the little town could be seen with its white , red-roofed houses , its cathedral , and its bridge , on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops . 
At the bend of the Danube , vessels , an island , and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible , and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests , with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges . 
The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest , and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy 's horse patrols could be discerned . 
Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer , scanning the country through his fieldglass . 
A little behind them Nesvitski , who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander-in-chief , was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage . 
A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask , and Nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel . 
The officers gladly gathered round him , some on their knees , some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass . 
`` Yes , the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool . 
It 's a fine place ! 
Why are you not eating anything , gentlemen ? '' 
Nesvitski was saying . 
`` Thank you very much , Prince , '' answered one of the officers , pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance . 
`` It 's a lovely place ! 
We passed close to the park and saw two deer ... and what a splendid house ! '' 
`` Look , Prince , '' said another , who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy , and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside -- `` See , our infantrymen have already got there . 
Look there in the meadow behind the village , three of them are dragging something . 
They 'll ransack that castle , '' he remarked with evident approval . 
`` So they will , '' said Nesvitski . 
`` No , but what I should like , '' added he , munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth , `` would be to slip in over there . '' 
He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery , and his eyes narrowed and gleamed . 
`` That would be fine , gentlemen ! '' 
The officers laughed . 
`` Just to flutter the nuns a bit . 
They say there are Italian girls among them . 
On my word I 'd give five years of my life for it ! '' 
`` They must be feeling dull , too , '' said one of the bolder officers , laughing . 
Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general , who looked through his field glass . 
`` Yes , so it is , so it is , '' said the general angrily , lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders , `` so it is ! 
They 'll be fired on at the crossing . 
And why are they dawdling there ? '' 
On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye , and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose . 
Then came the distant report of a shot , and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing . 
Nesvitski rose , puffing , and went up to the general , smiling . 
`` Would not your excellency like a little refreshment ? '' 
he said . 
`` It 's a bad business , '' said the general without answering him , `` our men have been wasting time . '' 
`` Had n't I better ride over , your excellency ? '' 
asked Nesvitski . 
`` Yes , please do , '' answered the general , and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail : `` and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered ; and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected . '' 
`` Very good , '' answered Nesvitski . 
He called the Cossack with his horse , told him to put away the knapsack and flask , and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle . 
`` I 'll really call in on the nuns , '' he said to the officers who watched him smilingly , and he rode off by the winding path down the hill . 
`` Now then , let 's see how far it will carry , Captain . 
Just try ! '' 
said the general , turning to an artillery officer . 
`` Have a little fun to pass the time . '' 
`` Crew , to your guns ! '' 
commanded the officer . 
In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading . 
`` One ! '' 
came the command . 
Number one jumped briskly aside . 
The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar , and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy , a little smoke showing the spot where it burst . 
The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound . 
Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below , as plainly visible as if but a stone 's throw away , and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off . 
At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds , and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression . 
Two of the enemy 's shots had already flown across the bridge , where there was a crush . 
Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski , who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings . 
He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles . 
Each time Prince Nesvitski tried to move on , soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings , and all he could do was to smile . 
`` What a fine fellow you are , friend ! '' 
said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon , who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses . 
`` What a fellow ! 
You ca n't wait a moment ! 
Do n't you see the general wants to pass ? '' 
But the convoyman took no notice of the word `` general '' and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way . 
`` Hi there , boys ! 
Keep to the left ! 
Wait a bit . '' 
But the soldiers , crowded together shoulder to shoulder , their bayonets interlocking , moved over the bridge in a dense mass . 
Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw the rapid , noisy little waves of the Enns , which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along . 
Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers , shoulder straps , covered shakos , knapsacks , bayonets , long muskets , and , under the shakos , faces with broad cheekbones , sunken cheeks , and listless tired expressions , and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge . 
Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men , like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns , an officer , in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men , squeezed his way along ; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river , an hussar on foot , an orderly , or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry ; and sometimes like a log floating down the river , an officers ' or company 's baggage wagon , piled high , leather covered , and hemmed in on all sides , moved across the bridge . 
`` It 's as if a dam had burst , '' said the Cossack hopelessly . 
`` Are there many more of you to come ? '' 
`` A million all but one ! '' 
replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat , with a wink , and passed on followed by another , an old man . 
`` If he '' -LRB- he meant the enemy -RRB- `` begins popping at the bridge now , '' said the old soldier dismally to a comrade , `` you 'll forget to scratch yourself . '' 
That soldier passed on , and after him came another sitting on a cart . 
`` Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to ? '' 
said an orderly , running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it . 
And he also passed on with the wagon . 
Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking . 
`` And then , old fellow , he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun ... '' a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily , with a wide swing of his arm . 
`` Yes , the ham was just delicious ... '' answered another with a loud laugh . 
And they , too , passed on , so that Nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth , or what the ham had to do with it . 
`` Bah ! 
How they scurry . 
He just sends a ball and they think they 'll all be killed , '' a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully . 
`` As it flies past me , Daddy , the ball I mean , '' said a young soldier with an enormous mouth , hardly refraining from laughing , `` I felt like dying of fright . 
I did , ` pon my word , I got that frightened ! '' 
said he , as if bragging of having been frightened . 
That one also passed . 
Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before . 
It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German , and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects . 
A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind . 
A woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman , and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds . 
Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission . 
The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women , and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers ' remarks related to the two young ones . 
Every face bore almost the same smile , expressing unseemly thoughts about the women . 
`` Just see , the German sausage is making tracks , too ! '' 
`` Sell me the missis , '' said another soldier , addressing the German , who , angry and frightened , strode energetically along with downcast eyes . 
`` See how smart she 's made herself ! 
Oh , the devils ! '' 
`` There , Fedotov , you should be quartered on them ! '' 
`` I have seen as much before now , mate ! '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple , also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl . 
The German closed his eyes , signifying that he did not understand . 
`` Take it if you like , '' said the officer , giving the girl an apple . 
The girl smiled and took it . 
Nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed . 
When they had gone by , the same stream of soldiers followed , with the same kind of talk , and at last all stopped . 
As often happens , the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge , and the whole crowd had to wait . 
`` And why are they stopping ? 
There 's no proper order ! '' 
said the soldiers . 
`` Where are you shoving to ? 
Devil take you ! 
Ca n't you wait ? 
It 'll be worse if he fires the bridge . 
See , here 's an officer jammed in too '' -- different voices were saying in the crowd , as the men looked at one another , and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge . 
Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge , Nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him , of something swiftly approaching ... something big , that splashed into the water . 
`` Just see where it carries to ! '' 
a soldier near by said sternly , looking round at the sound . 
`` Encouraging us to get along quicker , '' said another uneasily . 
The crowd moved on again . 
Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball . 
`` Hey , Cossack , my horse ! '' 
he said . 
`` Now , then , you there ! 
get out of the way ! 
Make way ! '' 
With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse , and shouting continually he moved on . 
The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him , but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg , and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind . 
`` Nesvitski , Nesvitski ! 
you numskull ! '' 
came a hoarse voice from behind him . 
Nesvitski looked round and saw , some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry , Vaska Denisov , red and shaggy , with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder . 
`` Tell these devils , these fiends , to let me pass ! '' 
shouted Denisov evidently in a fit of rage , his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face . 
`` Ah , Vaska ! '' 
joyfully replied Nesvitski . 
`` What 's up with you ? '' 
`` The squadwon ca n't pass , '' shouted Vaska Denisov , showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab , which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it , and snorted , spurting white foam from his bit , tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs , and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him . 
`` What is this ? 
They 're like sheep ! 
Just like sheep ! 
Out of the way ! 
... Let us pass ! 
... Stop there , you devil with the cart ! 
I 'll hack you with my saber ! '' 
he shouted , actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it . 
The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces , and Denisov joined Nesvitski . 
`` How 's it you 're not drunk today ? '' 
said Nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him . 
`` They do n't even give one time to dwink ! '' 
answered Vaska Denisov . 
`` They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day . 
If they mean to fight , let 's fight . 
But the devil knows what this is . '' 
`` What a dandy you are today ! '' 
said Nesvitski , looking at Denisov 's new cloak and saddlecloth . 
Denisov smiled , took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume , and put it to Nesvitski 's nose . 
`` Of course . 
I 'm going into action ! 
I 've shaved , bwushed my teeth , and scented myself . '' 
The imposing figure of Nesvitski followed by his Cossack , and the determination of Denisov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically , had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry . 
Beside the bridge Nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order , and having done this he rode back . 
Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge . 
Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground , eager to rejoin its fellows , he watched his squadron draw nearer . 
Then the clang of hoofs , as of several horses galloping , resounded on the planks of the bridge , and the squadron , officers in front and men four abreast , spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it . 
The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will , estrangement , and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean , smart hussars who moved past them in regular order . 
`` Smart lads ! 
Only fit for a fair ! '' 
said one .
