Arkady was at his ease with Katya , Madame Odintsov with Bazarov , and thus it usually came to pass that the two couples , after being a little while together , went off on their separate ways , especially during the walks . 
Katya adored nature , and Arkady loved it , though he did not dare to acknowledge it ; Madame Odintsov was , like Bazarov , rather indifferent to the beauties of nature . 
The almost continual separation of the two friends was not without its consequences ; the relations between them began to change . 
Bazarov gave up talking to Arkady about Madame Odintsov , gave up even abusing her ` aristocratic ways ' ; Katya , it is true , he praised as before , and only advised him to restrain her sentimental tendencies , but his praises were hurried , his advice dry , and in general he talked less to Arkady than before ... he seemed to avoid him , seemed ill at ease with him . 
Arkady observed it all , but he kept his observations to himself . 
The real cause of all this ` newness ' was the feeling inspired in Bazarov by Madame Odintsov , a feeling which tortured and maddened him , and which he would at once have denied , with scornful laughter and cynical abuse , if any one had ever so remotely hinted at the possibility of what was taking place in him . 
Bazarov had a great love for women and for feminine beauty ; but love in the ideal , or , as he expressed it , romantic sense , he called lunacy , unpardonable imbecility ; he regarded chivalrous sentiments as something of the nature of deformity or disease , and had more than once expressed his wonder that Toggenburg and all the minnesingers and troubadours had not been put into a lunatic asylum . 
` If a woman takes your fancy , ' he used to say , ` try and gain your end ; but if you ca n't -- well , turn your back on her -- there are lots of good fish in the sea . ' 
Madame Odintsov had taken his fancy ; the rumours about her , the freedom and independence of her ideas , her unmistakable liking for him , all seemed to be in his favour , but he soon saw that with her he would not ` gain his ends , ' and to turn his back on her he found , to his own bewilderment , beyond his power . 
His blood was on fire directly if he merely thought of her ; he could easily have mastered his blood , but something else was taking root in him , something he had never admitted , at which he had always jeered , at which all his pride revolted . 
In his conversations with Anna Sergyevna he expressed more strongly than ever his calm contempt for everything idealistic ; but when he was alone , with indignation he recognised idealism in himself . 
Then he would set off to the forest and walk with long strides about it , smashing the twigs that came in his way , and cursing under his breath both her and himself ; or he would get into the hay-loft in the barn , and , obstinately closing his eyes , try to force himself to sleep , in which , of course , he did not always succeed . 
Suddenly his fancy would bring before him those chaste hands twining one day about his neck , those proud lips responding to his kisses , those intellectual eyes dwelling with tenderness -- yes , with tenderness -- on his , and his head went round , and he forgot himself for an instant , till indignation boiled up in him again . 
He caught himself in all sorts of ` shameful ' thoughts , as though he were driven on by a devil mocking him . 
Sometimes he fancied that there was a change taking place in Madame Odintsov too ; that there were signs in the expression of her face of something special ; that , perhaps ... but at that point he would stamp , or grind his teeth , and clench his fists . 
Meanwhile Bazarov was not altogether mistaken . 
He had struck Madame Odintsov 's imagination ; he interested her , she thought a great deal about him . 
In his absence , she was not dull , she was not impatient for his coming , but she always grew more lively on his appearance ; she liked to be left alone with him , and she liked talking to him , even when he irritated her or offended her taste , her refined habits . 
She was , as it were , eager at once to sound him and to analyse herself . 
One day walking in the garden with her , he suddenly announced , in a surly voice , that he intended going to his father 's place very soon ... . 
She turned white , as though something had given her a pang , and such a pang , that she wondered and pondered long after , what could be the meaning of it . 
Bazarov had spoken of his departure with no idea of putting her to the test , of seeing what would come of it ; he never ` fabricated . ' 
On the morning of that day he had an interview with his father 's bailiff , who had taken care of him when he was a child , Timofeitch . 
This Timofeitch , a little old man of much experience and astuteness , with faded yellow hair , a weather-beaten red face , and tiny tear-drops in his shrunken eyes , unexpectedly appeared before Bazarov , in his shortish overcoat of stout greyish-blue cloth , girt with a strip of leather , and in tarred boots . 
` Hullo , old man ; how are you ? ' 
cried Bazarov . 
` How do you do , Yevgeny Vassilyitch ? ' 
began the little old man , and he smiled with delight , so that his whole face was all at once covered with wrinkles . 
` What have you come for ? 
They sent for me , eh ? ' 
` Upon my word , sir , how could we ? ' 
mumbled Timofeitch . 
-LRB- He remembered the strict injunctions he had received from his master on starting . -RRB- 
` We were sent to the town on business , and we 'd heard news of your honour , so here we turned off on our way , that 's to say -- to have a look at your honour ... as if we could think of disturbing you ! ' 
` Come , do n't tell lies ! ' 
Bazarov cut him short . 
` Is this the road to the town , do you mean to tell me ? ' 
Timofeitch hesitated , and made no answer . 
` Is my father well ? ' 
` Thank God , yes . ' 
` And my mother ? ' 
` Anna Vlasyevna too , glory be to God . ' 
` They are expecting me , I suppose ? ' 
The little old man held his tiny head on one side . 
` Ah , Yevgeny Vassilyitch , it makes one 's heart ache to see them ; it does really . ' 
` Come , all right , all right ! 
shut up ! 
Tell them I 'm coming soon . ' 
` Yes , sir , ' answered Timofeitch , with a sigh . 
As he went out of the house , he pulled his cap down on his head with both hands , clambered into a wretched-looking racing droshky , and went off at a trot , but not in the direction of the town . 
On the evening of the same day , Madame Odintsov was sitting in her own room with Bazarov , while Arkady walked up and down the hall listening to Katya 's playing . 
The princess had gone upstairs to her own room ; she could not bear guests as a rule , and ` especially this new riff-raff lot , ' as she called them . 
In the common rooms she only sulked ; but she made up for it in her own room by breaking out into such abuse before her maid that the cap danced on her head , wig and all . 
Madame Odintsov was well aware of all this . 
` How is it you are proposing to leave us ? ' 
she began ; ` how about your promise ? ' 
Bazarov started . 
` What promise ? ' 
` Have you forgotten ? 
You meant to give me some lessons in chemistry . ' 
` It ca n't be helped ! 
My father expects me ; I ca n't loiter any longer . 
However , you can read Pelouse et Frémy , Notions générales de Chimie ; it 's a good book , and clearly written . 
You will find everything you need in it . ' 
` But do you remember ; you assured me a book can not take the place of ... I 've forgotten how you put it , but you know what I mean ... do you remember ? ' 
` It ca n't be helped ! ' 
repeated Bazarov . 
` Why go away ? ' 
said Madame Odintsov , dropping her voice . 
He glanced at her . 
Her head had fallen on to the back of her easy-chair , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were folded on her bosom . 
She seemed paler in the light of the single lamp covered with a perforated paper shade . 
An ample white gown hid her completely in its soft folds ; even the tips of her feet , also crossed , were hardly seen . 
` And why stay ? ' 
answered Bazarov . 
Madame Odintsov turned her head slightly . 
` You ask why . 
Have you not enjoyed yourself with me ? 
Or do you suppose you will not be missed here ? ' ' 
I am sure of it . ' 
Madame Odintsov was silent a minute . 
` You are wrong in thinking that . 
But I do n't believe you . 
You could not say that seriously . ' 
Bazarov still sat immovable . 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch , why do n't you speak ? ' 
` Why , what am I to say to you ? 
People are not generally worth being missed , and I less than most . ' 
` Why so ? ' 
` I 'm a practical , uninteresting person . 
I do n't know how to talk . ' 
` You are fishing , Yevgeny Vassilyitch . ' 
` That 's not a habit of mine . 
Do n't you know yourself that I 've nothing in common with the elegant side of life , the side you prize so much ? ' 
Madame Odintsov bit the corner of her handkerchief . 
` You may think what you like , but I shall be dull when you go away . ' 
` Arkady will remain , ' remarked Bazarov . 
Madame Odintsov shrugged her shoulders slightly . ' 
I shall be dull , ' she repeated . 
` Really ? 
In any case you will not feel dull for long . ' 
` What makes you suppose that ? ' 
` Because you told me yourself that you are only dull when your regular routine is broken in upon . 
You have ordered your existence with such unimpeachable regularity that there can be no place in it for dulness or sadness ... for any unpleasant emotions . ' 
` And do you consider I am so unimpeachable ... that 's to say , that I have ordered my life with such regularity ? ' ' 
I should think so . 
Here 's an example ; in a few minutes it will strike ten , and I know beforehand that you will drive me away . ' 
` No ; I 'm not going to drive you away , Yevgeny Vassilyitch . 
You may stay . 
Open that window ... . 
I feel half-stifled . ' 
Bazarov got up and gave a push to the window . 
It flew up with a loud crash ... . 
He had not expected it to open so easily ; besides , his hands were shaking . 
The soft , dark night looked in to the room with its almost black sky , its faintly rustling trees , and the fresh fragrance of the pure open air . 
` Draw the blind and sit down , ' said Madame Odintsov ; ' I want to have a talk with you before you go away . 
Tell me something about yourself ; you never talk about yourself . ' ' 
I try to talk to you upon improving subjects , Anna Sergyevna . ' 
` You are very modest ... . 
But I should like to know something about you , about your family , about your father , for whom you are forsaking us . ' 
` Why is she talking like that ? ' 
thought Bazarov . 
` All that 's not in the least interesting , ' he uttered aloud , ` especially for you ; we are obscure people ... ' ` And you regard me as an aristocrat ? ' 
Bazarov lifted his eyes to Madame Odintsov . 
` Yes , ' he said , with exaggerated sharpness . 
She smiled . ' 
I see you know me very little , though you do maintain that all people are alike , and it 's not worth while to study them . 
I will tell you my life some time or other ... but first you tell me yours . ' ' 
I know you very little , ' repeated Bazarov . 
` Perhaps you are right ; perhaps , really , every one is a riddle . 
You , for instance ; you avoid society , you are oppressed by it , and you have invited two students to stay with you . 
What makes you , with your intellect , with your beauty , live in the country ? ' 
` What ? 
What was it you said ? ' 
Madame Odintsov interposed eagerly . 
` With my ... beauty ? ' 
Bazarov scowled . 
` Never mind that , ' he muttered ; ' I meant to say that I do n't exactly understand why you have settled in the country ? ' 
` You do n't understand it ... . 
But you explain it to yourself in some way ? ' 
` Yes ... I assume that you remain continually in the same place because you indulge yourself , because you are very fond of comfort and ease , and very indifferent to everything else . ' 
Madame Odintsov smiled again . 
` You would absolutely refuse to believe that I am capable of being carried away by anything ? ' 
Bazarov glanced at her from under his brows . 
` By curiosity , perhaps ; but not otherwise . ' 
` Really ? 
Well , now I understand why we are such friends ; you are just like me , you see . ' 
` We are such friends ... ' Bazarov articulated in a choked voice . 
` Yes ! 
... Why , I 'd forgotten you wanted to go away . ' 
Bazarov got up . 
The lamp burnt dimly in the middle of the dark , luxurious , isolated room ; from time to time the blind was shaken , and there flowed in the freshness of the insidious night ; there was heard its mysterious whisperings . 
Madame Odintsov did not move in a single limb ; but she was gradually possessed by concealed emotion . 
It communicated itself to Bazarov . 
He was suddenly conscious that he was alone with a young and lovely woman ... ` Where are you going ? ' 
she said slowly . 
He answered nothing , and sank into a chair . 
` And so you consider me a placid , pampered , spoiled creature , ' she went on in the same voice , never taking her eyes off the window . 
` While I know so much about myself , that I am unhappy . ' 
` You unhappy ? 
What for ? 
Surely you ca n't attach any importance to idle gossip ? ' 
Madame Odintsov frowned . 
It annoyed her that he had given such a meaning to her words . 
` Such gossip does not affect me , Yevgeny Vassilyitch , and I am too proud to allow it to disturb me . 
I am unhappy because ... I have no desires , no passion for life . 
You look at me incredulously ; you think that 's said by an `` aristocrat , '' who is all in lace , and sitting in a velvet armchair . 
I do n't conceal the fact : I love what you call comfort , and at the same time I have little desire to live . 
Explain that contradiction as best you can . 
But all that 's romanticism in your eyes . ' 
Bazarov shook his head . 
` You are in good health , independent , rich ; what more would you have ? 
What do you want ? ' 
` What do I want , ' echoed Madame Odintsov , and she sighed , ' I am very tired , I am old , I feel as if I have had a very long life . 
Yes , I am old , ' she added , softly drawing the ends of her lace over her bare arms . 
Her eyes met Bazarov 's eyes , and she faintly blushed . 
` Behind me I have already so many memories : my life in Petersburg , wealth , then poverty , then my father 's death , marriage , then the inevitable tour in due order ... . 
So many memories , and nothing to remember , and before me , before me -- a long , long road , and no goal ... . 
I have no wish to go on . ' 
` Are you so disillusioned ? ' 
queried Bazarov . 
` No , but I am dissatisfied , ' Madame Odintsov replied , dwelling on each syllable . ' 
I think if I could interest myself strongly in something ... ' ` You want to fall in love , ' Bazarov interrupted her , ` and you ca n't love ; that 's where your unhappiness lies . ' 
Madame Odintsov began to examine the sleeve of her lace . 
` Is it true I ca n't love ? ' 
she said . ' 
I should say not ! 
Only I was wrong in calling that an unhappiness . 
On the contrary , any one 's more to be pitied when such a mischance befalls him . ' 
` Mischance , what ? ' 
` Falling in love . ' 
` And how do you come to know that ? ' 
` By hearsay , ' answered Bazarov angrily . 
` You 're flirting , ' he thought ; ` you 're bored , and teasing me for want of something to do , while I ... ' His heart really seemed as though it were being torn to pieces . 
` Besides , you are perhaps too exacting , ' he said , bending his whole frame forward and playing with the fringe of the chair . 
` Perhaps . 
My idea is everything or nothing . 
A life for a life . 
Take mine , give up thine , and that without regret or turning back . 
Or else better have nothing . ' 
` Well ? ' 
observed Bazarov ; ` that 's fair terms , and I 'm surprised that so far you ... have not found what you wanted . ' 
` And do you think it would be easy to give oneself up wholly to anything whatever ? ' 
` Not easy , if you begin reflecting , waiting and attaching value to yourself , prizing yourself , I mean ; but to give oneself up without reflection is very easy . ' 
` How can one help prizing oneself ? 
If I am of no value , who could need my devotion ? ' 
` That 's not my affair ; that 's the other 's business to discover what is my value . 
The chief thing is to be able to devote oneself . ' 
Madame Odintsov bent forward from the back of her chair . 
` You speak , ' she began , ` as though you had experienced all that . ' 
` It happened to come up , Anna Sergyevna ; all that , as you know , is not in my line . ' 
` But you could devote yourself ? ' ' 
I do n't know . 
I should n't like to boast . ' 
Madame Odintsov said nothing , and Bazarov was mute . 
The sounds of the piano floated up to them from the drawing-room . 
` How is it Katya is playing so late ? ' 
observed Madame Odintsov . 
Bazarov got up . 
` Yes , it is really late now ; it 's time for you to go to bed . ' 
` Wait a little ; why are you in a hurry ? 
... I want to say one word to you . ' 
` What is it ? ' 
` Wait a little , ' whispered Madame Odintsov . 
Her eyes rested on Bazarov ; it seemed as though she were examining him attentively . 
He walked across the room , then suddenly went up to her , hurriedly said ` Good-bye , ' squeezed her hand so that she almost screamed , and was gone . 
She raised her crushed fingers to her lips , breathed on them , and suddenly , impulsively getting up from her low chair , she moved with rapid steps towards the door , as though she wished to bring Bazarov back ... . 
A maid came into the room with a decanter on a silver tray . 
Madame Odintsov stood still , told her she could go , and sat down again , and again sank into thought . 
Her hair slipped loose and fell in a dark coil down her shoulders . 
Long after the lamp was still burning in Anna Sergyevna 's room , and for long she stayed without moving , only from time to time chafing her hands , which ached a little from the cold of the night . 
Bazarov went back two hours later to his bed-room with his boots wet with dew , dishevelled and ill-humoured . 
He found Arkady at the writing-table with a book in his hands , his coat buttoned up to the throat . 
` You 're not in bed yet ? ' 
he said , in a tone , it seemed , of annoyance . 
` You stopped a long while with Anna Sergyevna this evening , ' remarked Arkady , not answering him . 
` Yes , I stopped with her all the while you were playing the piano with Katya Sergyevna . ' ' 
I did not play ... ' Arkady began , and he stopped . 
He felt the tears were coming into his eyes , and he did not like to cry before his sarcastic friend . 
The following morning when Madame Odintsov came down to morning tea , Bazarov sat a long while bending over his cup , then suddenly he glanced up at her ... . 
She turned to him as though he had struck her a blow , and he fancied that her face was a little paler since the night before . 
She quickly went off to her own room , and did not appear till lunch . 
It rained from early morning ; there was no possibility of going for a walk . 
The whole company assembled in the drawing-room . 
Arkady took up the new number of a journal and began reading it aloud . 
The princess , as was her habit , tried to express her amazement in her face , as though he were doing something improper , then glared angrily at him ; but he paid no attention to her . 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch ' said Anna Sergyevna , ` come to my room ... . 
I want to ask you ... . 
You mentioned a textbook yesterday ... ' She got up and went to the door . 
The princess looked round with an expression that seemed to say , ` Look at me ; see how shocked I am ! ' 
and again glared at Arkady ; but he raised his voice , and exchanging glances with Katya , near whom he was sitting , he went on reading . 
Madame Odintsov went with rapid steps to her study . 
Bazarov followed her quickly , not raising his eyes , and only with his ears catching the delicate swish and rustle of her silk gown gliding before him . 
Madame Odintsov sank into the same easy-chair in which she had sat the previous evening , and Bazarov took up the same position as before . 
` What was the name of that book ? ' 
she began , after a brief silence . 
` Pelouse et Frémy , Notions générales , ' answered Bazarov . ' 
I might though recommend you also Ganot , Traité élémentaire de physique éxpérimentale . 
In that book the illustrations are clearer , and in general it 's a text-book . ' 
Madame Odintsov stretched out her hand . 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch , I beg your pardon , but I did n't invite you in here to discuss text-books . 
I wanted to continue our conversation of last night . 
You went away so suddenly ... . 
It will not bore you ... ' ' I am at your service , Anna Sergyevna . 
But what were we talking about last night ? ' 
Madame Odintsov flung a sidelong glance at Bazarov . 
` We were talking of happiness , I believe . 
I told you about myself . 
By the way , I mentioned the word `` happiness . '' 
Tell me why it is that even when we are enjoying music , for instance , or a fine evening , or a conversation with sympathetic people , it all seems an intimation of some measureless happiness existing apart somewhere rather than actual happiness -- such , I mean , as we ourselves are in possession of ? 
Why is it ? 
Or perhaps you have no feeling like that ? ' 
` You know the saying , `` Happiness is where we are not , '' ' replied Bazarov ; ` besides , you told me yesterday you are discontented . 
I certainly never have such ideas come into my head . ' 
` Perhaps they seem ridiculous to you ? ' 
` No ; but they do n't come into my head . ' 
` Really ? 
Do you know , I should very much like to know what you do think about ? ' 
` What ? 
I do n't understand . ' 
` Listen ; I have long wanted to speak openly to you . 
There 's no need to tell you -- you are conscious of it yourself -- that you are not an ordinary man ; you are still young -- all life is before you . 
What are you preparing yourself for ? 
What future is awaiting you ? 
I mean to say -- what object do you want to attain ? 
What are you going forward to ? 
What is in your heart ? 
in short , who are you ? 
What are you ? ' 
` You surprise me , Anna Sergyevna . 
You are aware that I am studying natural science , and who I ... ' ` Well , who are you ? ' ' 
I have explained to you already that I am going to be a district doctor . ' 
Anna Sergyevna made a movement of impatience . 
` What do you say that for ? 
You do n't believe it yourself . 
Arkady might answer me in that way , but not you . ' 
` Why , in what is Arkady ... ' ` Stop ! 
Is it possible you could content yourself with such a humble career , and are n't you always maintaining yourself that you do n't believe in medicine ? 
You -- with your ambition -- a district doctor ! 
You answer me like that to put me off , because you have no confidence in me . 
But , do you know , Yevgeny Vassilyitch , that I could understand you ; I have been poor myself , and ambitious , like you ; I have been perhaps through the same trials as you . ' 
` That is all very well , Anna Sergyevna , but you must pardon me for ... I am not in the habit of talking freely about myself at any time as a rule , and between you and me there is such a gulf ... ' ` What sort of gulf ? 
You mean to tell me again that I am an aristocrat ? 
No more of that , Yevgeny Vassilyitch ; I thought I had proved to you ... ' ` And even apart from that , ' broke in Bazarov , ` what could induce one to talk and think about the future , which for the most part does not depend on us ? 
If a chance turns up of doing something -- so much the better ; and if it does n't turn up -- at least one will be glad one did n't gossip idly about it beforehand . ' 
` You call a friendly conversation idle gossip ? 
... Or perhaps you consider me as a woman unworthy of your confidence ? 
I know you despise us all . ' ' 
I do n't despise you , Anna Sergyevna , and you know that . ' 
` No , I do n't know anything ... but let us suppose so . 
I understand your disinclination to talk of your future career ; but as to what is taking place within you now ... ' ` Taking place ! ' 
repeated Bazarov , ` as though I were some sort of government or society ! 
In any case , it is utterly uninteresting ; and besides , can a man always speak of everything that `` takes place '' in him ? ' 
` Why , I do n't see why you ca n't speak freely of everything you have in your heart . ' 
` Can you ? ' 
asked Bazarov . 
` Yes , ' answered Anna Sergyevna , after a brief hesitation . 
Bazarov bowed his head . 
` You are more fortunate than I am . ' 
Anna Sergyevna looked at him questioningly . 
` As you please , ' she went on , ` but still something tells me that we have not come together for nothing ; that we shall be great friends . 
I am sure this -- what should I say , constraint , reticence in you will vanish at last . ' 
` So you have noticed reticence ... as you expressed it ... constraint ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
Bazarov got up and went to the window . 
` And would you like to know the reason of this reticence ? 
Would you like to know what is passing within me ? ' 
` Yes , ' repeated Madame Odintsov , with a sort of dread she did not at the time understand . 
` And you will not be angry ? ' 
` No . ' 
` No ? ' 
Bazarov was standing with his back to her . 
` Let me tell you then that I love you like a fool , like a madman ... . 
There , you 've forced it out of me . ' 
Madame Odintsov held both hands out before her ; but Bazarov was leaning with his forehead pressed against the window pane . 
He breathed hard ; his whole body was visibly trembling . 
But it was not the tremor of youthful timidity , not the sweet alarm of the first declaration that possessed him ; it was passion struggling in him , strong and painful -- passion not unlike hatred , and perhaps akin to it ... . 
Madame Odintsov felt both afraid and sorry for him . 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch ! ' 
she said , and there was the ring of unconscious tenderness in her voice . 
He turned quickly , flung a searching look on her , and snatching both her hands , he drew her suddenly to his breast . 
She did not at once free herself from his embrace , but an instant later , she was standing far away in a corner , and looking from there at Bazarov . 
He rushed at her ... ` You have misunderstood me , ' she whispered hurriedly , in alarm . 
It seemed if he had made another step she would have screamed ... . 
Bazarov bit his lips , and went out . 
Half-an-hour after , a maid gave Anna Sergyevna a note from Bazarov ; it consisted simply of one line : ` Am I to go to-day , or can I stop till to-morrow ? ' 
` Why should you go ? 
I did not understand you -- you did not understand me , ' Anna Sergyevna answered him , but to herself she thought : ' I did not understand myself either . ' 
She did not show herself till dinner-time , and kept walking to and fro in her room , stopping sometimes at the window , sometimes at the looking-glass , and slowly rubbing her handkerchief over her neck , on which she still seemed to feel a burning spot . 
She asked herself what had induced her to ` force ' Bazarov 's words , his confidence , and whether she had suspected nothing ... ' I am to blame , ' she decided aloud , ` but I could not have foreseen this . ' 
She fell to musing , and blushed crimson , remembering Bazarov 's almost animal face when he had rushed at her ... ` Oh ? ' 
she uttered suddenly aloud , and she stopped short and shook back her curls ... . 
She caught sight of herself in the glass ; her head thrown back , with a mysterious smile on the half-closed , half-opened eyes and lips , told her , it seemed , in a flash something at which she herself was confused ... ` No , ' she made up her mind at last . 
` God knows what it would lead to ; he could n't be played with ; peace is anyway the best thing in the world . ' 
Her peace of mind was not shaken ; but she felt gloomy , and even shed a few tears once though she could not have said why -- certainly not for the insult done her . 
She did not feel insulted ; she was more inclined to feel guilty . 
Under the influence of various vague emotions , the sense of life passing by , the desire of novelty , she had forced herself to go up to a certain point , forced herself to look behind herself , and had seen behind her not even an abyss , but what was empty ... or revolting . 
Great as was Madame Odintsov 's self-control , and superior as she was to every kind of prejudice , she felt awkward when she went into the dining-room to dinner . 
The meal went off fairly successfully , however . 
Porfiry Platonovitch made his appearance and told various anecdotes ; he had just come back from the town . 
Among other things , he informed them that the governor had ordered his secretaries on special commissions to wear spurs , in case he might send them off anywhere for greater speed on horseback . 
Arkady talked in an undertone to Katya , and diplomatically attended to the princess 's wants . 
Bazarov maintained a grim and obstinate silence . 
Madame Odintsov looked at him twice , not stealthily , but straight in the face , which was bilious and forbidding , with downcast eyes , and contemptuous determination stamped on every feature , and thought : ` No ... no ... no . ' 
... After dinner , she went with the whole company into the garden , and seeing that Bazarov wanted to speak to her , she took a few steps to one side and stopped . 
He went up to her , but even then did not raise his eyes , and said hoarsely -- ' I have to apologise to you , Anna Sergyevna . 
You must be in a fury with me . ' 
` No , I 'm not angry with you , Yevgeny Vassilyitch , ' answered Madame Odintsov ; ` but I am sorry . ' 
` So much the worse . 
Any way , I 'm sufficiently punished . 
My position , you will certainly agree , is most foolish . 
You wrote to me , `` Why go away ? '' 
But I can not stay , and do n't wish to . 
To-morrow I shall be gone . ' 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch , why are you ... ' ` Why am I going away ? ' 
` No ; I did n't mean to say that . ' 
` There 's no recalling the past , Anna Sergyevna ... and this was bound to come about sooner or later . 
Consequently I must go . 
I can only conceive of one condition upon which I could remain ; but that condition will never be . 
Excuse my impertinence , but you do n't love me , and you never will love me , I suppose ? ' 
Bazarov 's eyes glittered for an instant under their dark brows . 
Anna Sergyevna did not answer him . 
` I 'm afraid of this man , ' flashed through her brain . 
` Good-bye , then , ' said Bazarov , as though he guessed her thought , and he went back into the house . 
Anna Sergyevna walked slowly after him , and calling Katya to her , she took her arm . 
She did not leave her side till quite evening . 
She did not play cards , and was constantly laughing , which did not at all accord with her pale and perplexed face . 
Arkady was bewildered , and looked on at her as all young people look on -- that 's to say , he was constantly asking himself , ` What is the meaning of that ? ' 
Bazarov shut himself up in his room ; he came back to tea , however . 
Anna Sergyevna longed to say some friendly word to him , but she did not know how to address him ... . 
An unexpected incident relieved her from her embarrassment ; a steward announced the arrival of Sitnikov . 
It is difficult to do justice in words to the strange figure cut by the young apostle of progress as he fluttered into the room . 
Though , with his characteristic impudence , he had made up his mind to go into the country to visit a woman whom he hardly knew , who had never invited him ; but with whom , according to information he had gathered , such talented and intimate friends were staying , he was nevertheless trembling to the marrow of his bones ; and instead of bringing out the apologies and compliments he had learned by heart beforehand , he muttered some absurdity about Evdoksya Kukshin having sent him to inquire after Anna Sergyevna 's health , and Arkady Nikolaevitch 's too , having always spoken to him in the highest terms ... . 
At this point he faltered and lost his presence of mind so completely that he sat down on his own hat . 
However , since no one turned him out , and Anna Sergyevna even presented him to her aunt and her sister , he soon recovered himself and began to chatter volubly . 
The introduction of the commonplace is often an advantage in life ; it relieves over-strained tension , and sobers too self-confident or self-sacrificing emotions by recalling its close kinship with them . 
With Sitnikov 's appearance everything became somehow duller and simpler ; they all even ate a more solid supper , and retired to bed half-an-hour earlier than usual . ' 
I might now repeat to you , ' said Arkady , as he lay down in bed , to Bazarov , who was also undressing , what you once said to me , ` Why are you so melancholy ? 
One would think you had fulfilled some sacred duty . ' 
For some time past a sort of pretence of free-and-easy banter had sprung up between the two young men , which is always an unmistakable sign of secret displeasure or unexpressed suspicions .
