` Not like the other females . ' 
After waiting till the end of the quadrille , Sitnikov led Arkady up to Madame Odintsov ; but he hardly seemed to be intimately acquainted with her ; he was embarrassed in his sentences , while she looked at him in some surprise . 
But her face assumed an expression of pleasure when she heard Arkady 's surname . 
She asked him whether he was not the son of Nikolai Petrovitch . 
` Yes . ' ' 
I have seen your father twice , and have heard a great deal about him , ' she went on ; ' I am glad to make your acquaintance . ' 
At that instant some adjutant flew up to her and begged for a quadrille . 
She consented . 
` Do you dance then ? ' 
asked Arkady respectfully . 
` Yes , I dance . 
Why do you suppose I do n't dance ? 
Do you think I am too old ? ' 
` Really , how could I possibly ... . 
But in that case , let me ask you for a mazurka . ' 
Madame Odintsov smiled graciously . 
` Certainly , ' she said , and she looked at Arkady not exactly with an air of superiority , but as married sisters look at very young brothers . 
Madame Odintsov was a little older than Arkady -- she was twenty-nine -- but in her presence he felt himself a schoolboy , a little student , so that the difference in age between them seemed of more consequence . 
Matvy Ilyitch approached her with a majestic air and ingratiating speeches . 
Arkady moved away , but he still watched her ; he could not take his eyes off her even during the quadrille . 
She talked with equal ease to her partner and to the grand official , softly turned her head and eyes , and twice laughed softly . 
Her nose -- like almost all Russian noses -- was a little thick ; and her complexion was not perfectly clear ; Arkady made up his mind , for all that , that he had never before met such an attractive woman . 
He could not get the sound of her voice out of his ears ; the very folds of her dress seemed to hang upon her differently from all the rest -- more gracefully and amply -- and her movements were distinguished by a peculiar smoothness and naturalness . 
Arkady felt some timidity in his heart when at the first sounds of the mazurka he began to sit it out beside his partner ; he had prepared to enter into a conversation with her , but he only passed his hand through his hair , and could not find a single word to say . 
But his timidity and agitation did not last long ; Madame Odintsov 's tranquillity gained upon him too ; before a quarter of an hour had passed he was telling her freely about his father , his uncle , his life in Petersburg and in the country . 
Madame Odintsov listened to him with courteous sympathy , slightly opening and closing her fan ; his talk was broken off when partners came for her ; Sitnikov , among others , twice asked her . 
She came back , sat down again , took up her fan , and her bosom did not even heave more rapidly , while Arkady fell to chattering again , filled through and through by the happiness of being near her , talking to her , looking at her eyes , her lovely brow , all her sweet , dignified , clever face . 
She said little , but her words showed a knowledge of life ; from some of her observations Arkady gathered that this young woman had already felt and thought much ... ` Who is that you were standing with ? ' 
she asked him , ` when Mr. Sitnikov brought you to me ? ' 
` Did you notice him ? ' 
Arkady asked in his turn . 
` He has a splendid face , has n't he ? 
That 's Bazarov , my friend . ' 
Arkady fell to discussing ` his friend . ' 
He spoke of him in such detail , and with such enthusiasm , that Madame Odintsov turned towards him and looked attentively at him . 
Meanwhile , the mazurka was drawing to a close . 
Arkady felt sorry to part from his partner ; he had spent nearly an hour so happily with her ! 
He had , it is true , during the whole time continually felt as though she were condescending to him , as though he ought to be grateful to her ... but young hearts are not weighed down by that feeling . 
The music stopped . ' 
Merci , ' said Madame Odintsov , getting up . 
` You promised to come and see me ; bring your friend with you . 
I shall be very curious to see the man who has the courage to believe in nothing . ' 
The Governor came up to Madame Odintsov , announced that supper was ready , and , with a careworn face , offered her his arm . 
As she went away , she turned to give a last smile and bow to Arkady . 
He bowed low , looked after her -LRB- how graceful her figure seemed to him , draped in the greyish lustre of the black silk ! -RRB- 
, and thinking , ` This minute she has forgotten my existence , ' was conscious of an exquisite humility in his soul . 
` Well ? ' 
Bazarov questioned him , directly he had gone back to him in the corner . 
` Did you have a good time ? 
A gentleman has just been talking to me about that lady ; he said , `` She 's -- oh , fie ! 
fie ! '' 
but I fancy the fellow was a fool . 
What do you think , what is she ? 
-- oh , fie ! 
fie ! ' ' 
I do n't quite understand that definition , ' answered Arkady . 
` Oh , my ! 
What innocence ! ' 
` In that case , I do n't understand the gentleman you quote . 
Madame Odintsov is very sweet , no doubt , but she behaves so coldly and severely , that ... ' ` Still waters ... you know ! ' 
put in Bazarov . 
` That 's just what gives it piquancy . 
You like ices , I expect ? ' 
` Perhaps , ' muttered Arkady . ' 
I ca n't give an opinion about that . 
She wishes to make your acquaintance , and has asked me to bring you to see her . ' ' 
I can imagine how you 've described me ! 
But you did very well . 
Take me . 
Whatever she may be -- whether she 's simply a provincial lioness , or `` advanced '' after Kukshina 's fashion -- any way she 's got a pair of shoulders such as I 've not set eyes on for a long while . ' 
Arkady was wounded by Bazarov 's cynicism , but -- as often happens -- he reproached his friend not precisely for what he did not like in him ... ` Why are you unwilling to allow freethinking in women ? ' 
he said in a low voice . 
` Because , my boy , as far as my observations go , the only freethinkers among women are frights . ' 
The conversation was cut short at this point . 
Both the young men went away immediately after supper . 
They were pursued by a nervously malicious , but somewhat faint-hearted laugh from Madame Kukshin ; her vanity had been deeply wounded by neither of them having paid any attention to her . 
She stayed later than any one at the ball , and at four o'clock in the morning she was dancing a polka-mazurka with Sitnikov in the Parisian style . 
This edifying spectacle was the final event of the Governor 's ball . 
` Let 's see what species of mammalia this specimen belongs to , ' Bazarov said to Arkady the following day , as they mounted the staircase of the hotel in which Madame Odintsov was staying . ' 
I scent out something wrong here . ' 
` I 'm surprised at you ! ' 
cried Arkady . 
` What ? 
You , you , Bazarov , clinging to the narrow morality , which ... ' ` What a funny fellow you are ! ' 
Bazarov cut him short , carelessly . 
` Do n't you know that `` something wrong '' means `` something right '' in my dialect and for me ? 
It 's an advantage for me , of course . 
Did n't you tell me yourself this morning that she made a strange marriage , though , to my mind , to marry a rich old man is by no means a strange thing to do , but , on the contrary , very sensible . 
I do n't believe the gossip of the town ; but I should like to think , as our cultivated Governor says , that it 's well-grounded . ' 
Arkady made no answer , and knocked at the door of the apartments . 
A young servant in livery , conducted the two friends in to a large room , badly furnished , like all rooms in Russian hotels , but filled with flowers . 
Soon Madame Odintsov herself appeared in a simple morning dress . 
She seemed still younger by the light of the spring sunshine . 
Arkady presented Bazarov , and noticed with secret amazement that he seemed embarrassed , while Madame Odintsov remained perfectly tranquil , as she had been the previous day . 
Bazarov himself was conscious of being embarrassed , and was irritated by it . 
` Here 's a go ! 
-- frightened of a petticoat ! ' 
he thought , and lolling , quite like Sitnikov , in an easy-chair , he began talking with an exaggerated appearance of ease , while Madame Odintsov kept her clear eyes fixed on him . 
Anna Sergyevna Odintsov was the daughter of Sergay Nikolaevitch Loktev , notorious for his personal beauty , his speculations , and his gambling propensities , who after cutting a figure and making a sensation for fifteen years in Petersburg and Moscow , finished by ruining himself completely at cards , and was forced to retire to the country , where , however , he soon after died , leaving a very small property to his two daughters -- Anna , a girl of twenty , and Katya , a child of twelve . 
Their mother , who came of an impoverished line of princes -- the H -- s -- had died at Petersburg when her husband was in his heydey . 
Anna 's position after her father 's death was very difficult . 
The brilliant education she had received in Petersburg had not fitted her for putting up with the cares of domestic life and economy , -- for an obscure existence in the country . 
She knew positively no one in the whole neighbourhood , and there was no one she could consult . 
Her father had tried to avoid all contact with the neighbours ; he despised them in his way , and they despised him in theirs . 
She did not lose her head , however , and promptly sent for a sister of her mother 's Princess Avdotya Stepanovna H -- , a spiteful and arrogant old lady , who , on installing herself in her niece 's house , appropriated all the best rooms for her own use , scolded and grumbled from morning till night , and would not go a walk even in the garden unattended by her one serf , a surly footman in a threadbare pea-green livery with light blue trimming and a three-cornered hat . 
Anna put up patiently with all her aunt 's whims , gradually set to work on her sister 's education , and was , it seemed , already getting reconciled to the idea of wasting her life in the wilds ... . 
But destiny had decreed another fate for her . 
She chanced to be seen by Odintsov , a very wealthy man of forty-six , an eccentric hypochondriac , stout , heavy , and sour , but not stupid , and not ill-natured ; he fell in love with her , and offered her his hand . 
She consented to become his wife , and he lived six years with her , and on his death settled all his property upon her . 
Anna Sergyevna remained in the country for nearly a year after his death ; then she went abroad with her sister , but only stopped in Germany ; she got tired of it , and came back to live at her favourite Nikolskoe , which was nearly thirty miles from the town of X -- . 
There she had a magnificent , splendidly furnished house and a beautiful garden , with conservatories ; her late husband had spared no expense to gratify his fancies . 
Anna Sergyevna went very rarely to the town , generally only on business , and even then she did not stay long . 
She was not liked in the province ; there had been a fearful outcry at her marriage with Odintsov , all sorts of fictions were told about her ; it was asserted that she had helped her father in his cardsharping tricks , and even that she had gone abroad for excellent reasons , that it had been necessary to conceal the lamentable consequences ... ` You understand ? ' 
the indignant gossips would wind up . 
` She has gone through the fire , ' was said of her ; to which a noted provincial wit usually added : ` And through all the other elements ? ' 
All this talk reached her ; but she turned a deaf ear to it ; there was much independence and a good deal of determination in her character . 
Madame Odintsov sat leaning back in her easy-chair , and listened with folded hands to Bazarov . 
He , contrary to his habit , was talking a good deal , and obviously trying to interest her -- again a surprise for Arkady . 
He could not make up his mind whether Bazarov was attaining his object . 
It was difficult to conjecture from Anna Sergyevna 's face what impression was being made on her ; it retained the same expression , gracious and refined ; her beautiful eyes were lighted up by attention , but by quiet attention . 
Bazarov 's bad manners had impressed her unpleasantly for the first minutes of the visit like a bad smell or a discordant sound ; but she saw at once that he was nervous , and that even flattered her . 
Nothing was repulsive to her but vulgarity , and no one could have accused Bazarov of vulgarity . 
Arkady was fated to meet with surprises that day . 
He had expected that Bazarov would talk to a clever woman like Madame Odintsov about his opinions and his views ; she had herself expressed a desire to listen to the man ` who dares to have no belief in anything ' ; but , instead of that , Bazarov talked about medicine , about homoeopathy , and about botany . 
It turned out that Madame Odintsov had not wasted her time in solitude ; she had read a good many excellent books , and spoke herself in excellent Russian . 
She turned the conversation upon music ; but noticing that Bazarov did not appreciate art , she quietly brought it back to botany , even though Arkady was just launching into a discourse upon the significance of national melodies . 
Madame Odintsov treated him as though he were a younger brother ; she seemed to appreciate his good-nature and youthful simplicity -- and that was all . 
For over three hours , a lively conversation was kept up , ranging freely over various subjects . 
The friends at last got up and began to take leave . 
Anna Sergyevna looked cordially at them , held out her beautiful , white hand to both , and , after a moment 's thought , said with a doubtful but delightful smile . 
` If you are not afraid of being dull , gentlemen , come and see me at Nikolskoe . ' 
` Oh , Anna Sergyevna , ' cried Arkady , ' I shall think it the greatness happiness ... ' ` And you , Monsieur Bazarov ? ' 
Bazarov only bowed , and a last surprise was in store for Arkady ; he noticed that his friend was blushing . 
` Well ? ' 
he said to him in the street ; ` are you still of the same opinion -- that she 's ... ' ` Who can tell ? 
See how correct she is ! ' 
retorted Bazarov ; and after a brief pause he added , ` She 's a perfect grand-duchess , a royal personage . 
She only needs a train on behind , and a crown on her head . ' 
` Our grand-duchesses do n't talk Russian like that , ' remarked Arkady . 
` She 's seen ups and downs , my dear boy ; she 's known what it is to be hard up ! ' 
` Any way , she 's charming , ' observed Arkady . 
` What a magnificent body ! ' 
pursued Bazarov . 
` Should n't I like to see it on the dissecting-table . ' 
` Hush , for mercy 's sake , Yevgeny ! 
that 's beyond everything . ' 
` Well , do n't get angry , you baby . 
I meant it 's first-rate . 
We must go to stay with her . ' 
` When ? ' 
` Well , why not the day after to-morrow . 
What is there to do here ? 
Drink champagne with Kukshina . 
Listen to your cousin , the Liberal dignitary ? 
... Let 's be off the day after to-morrow . 
By the way , too -- my father 's little place is not far from there . 
This Nikolskoe 's on the S -- road , is n't it ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
` Optime , why hesitate ? 
leave that to fools and prigs ! 
I say , what a splendid body ! ' 
Three days later the two friends were driving along the road to Nikolskoe . 
The day was bright , and not too hot , and the sleek posting-horses trotted smartly along , switching their tied and plaited tails . 
Arkady looked at the road , and not knowing why , he smiled . 
` Congratulate me , ' cried Bazarov suddenly , ` to-day 's the 22nd of June , my guardian angel 's day . 
Let 's see how he will watch over me . 
To-day they expect me home , ' he added , dropping his voice ... ` Well , they can go on expecting ... . 
What does it matter ! ' 
The country-house in which Anna Sergyevna lived stood on an exposed hill at no great distance from a yellow stone church with a green roof , white columns , and a fresco over the principal entrance representing the ` Resurrection of Christ ' in the ` Italian ' style . 
Sprawling in the foreground of the picture was a swarthy warrior in a helmet , specially conspicuous for his rotund contours . 
Behind the church a long village stretched in two rows , with chimneys peeping out here and there above the thatched roofs . 
The manor-house was built in the same style as the church , the style known among us as that of Alexander ; the house too was painted yellow , and had a green roof , and white columns , and a pediment with an escutcheon on it . 
The architect had designed both buildings with the approval of the deceased Odintsov , who could not endure -- as he expressed it -- idle and arbitrary innovations . 
The house was enclosed on both sides by the dark trees of an old garden ; an avenue of lopped pines led up to the entrance . 
Our friends were met in the hall by two tall footmen in livery ; one of them at once ran for the steward . 
The steward , a stout man in a black dress coat , promptly appeared and led the visitors by a staircase covered with rugs to a special room , in which two bedsteads were already prepared for them with all necessaries for the toilet . 
It was clear that order reigned supreme in the house ; everything was clean , everywhere there was a peculiar delicate fragrance , just as there is in the reception rooms of ministers . 
` Anna Sergyevna asks you to come to her in half-an-hour , ' the steward announced ; ` will there be orders to give meanwhile ? ' 
` No orders , ' answered Bazarov ; ` perhaps you will be so good as to trouble yourself to bring me a glass of vodka . ' 
` Yes , sir , ' said the steward , looking in some perplexity , and he withdrew , his boots creaking as he walked . 
` What grand genre ! ' 
remarked Bazarov . 
` That 's what it 's called in your set , is n't it ? 
She 's a grand-duchess , and that 's all about it . ' ' 
A nice grand-duchess , ' retorted Arkady , ` at the very first meeting she invited such great aristocrats as you and me to stay with her . ' 
` Especially me , a future doctor , and a doctor 's son , and a village sexton 's grandson ... . 
You know , I suppose , I 'm the grandson of a sexton ? 
Like the great Speransky , ' added Bazarov after a brief pause , contracting his lips . 
` At any rate she likes to be comfortable ; oh , does n't she , this lady ! 
Ought n't we to put on evening dress ? ' 
Arkady only shrugged his shoulders ... but he too was conscious of a little nervousness . 
Half-an-hour later Bazarov and Arkady went together into the drawing-room . 
It was a large lofty room , furnished rather luxuriously but without particularly good taste . 
Heavy expensive furniture stood in the ordinary stiff arrangement along the walls , which were covered with cinnamon-coloured paper with gold flowers on it ; Odintsov had ordered the furniture from Moscow through a friend and agent of his , a spirit merchant . 
Over a sofa in the centre of one wall hung a portrait of a faded light-haired man -- and it seemed to look with displeasure at the visitors . 
` It must be the late lamented , ' Bazarov whispered to Arkady , and turning up his nose , he added , ` Had n't we better bolt ... ? ' 
But at that instant the lady of the house entered . 
She wore a light barège dress ; her hair smoothly combed back behind her ears gave a girlish expression to her pure and fresh face . 
` Thank you for keeping your promise , ' she began . 
` You must stay a little while with me ; it 's really not bad here . 
I will introduce you to my sister ; she plays the piano well . 
That is a matter of indifference to you , Monsieur Bazarov ; but you , I think , Monsieur Kirsanov , are fond of music . 
Besides my sister I have an old aunt living with me , and one of our neighbours comes in sometimes to play cards ; that makes up all our circle . 
And now let us sit down . ' 
Madame Odintsov delivered all this little speech with peculiar precision , as though she had learned it by heart ; then she turned to Arkady . 
It appeared that her mother had known Arkady 's mother , and had even been her confidante in her love for Nikolai Petrovitch . 
Arkady began talking with great warmth of his dead mother ; while Bazarov fell to turning over albums . 
` What a tame cat I 'm getting ! ' 
he was thinking to himself . 
A beautiful greyhound with a blue collar on , ran into the drawing-room , tapping on the floor with his paws , and after him entered a girl of eighteen , black-haired and dark-skinned , with a rather round but pleasing face , and small dark eyes . 
In her hands she held a basket filled with flowers . 
` This is my Katya , ' said Madame Odintsov , indicating her with a motion of her head . 
Katya made a slight curtsey , placed herself beside her sister , and began picking out flowers . 
The greyhound , whose name was Fifi , went up to both of the visitors , in turn wagging his tail , and thrusting his cold nose into their hands . 
` Did you pick all that yourself ? ' 
asked Madame Odintsov . 
` Yes , ' answered Katya . 
` Is auntie coming to tea ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
When Katya spoke , she had a very charming smile , sweet , timid , and candid , and looked up from under her eyebrows with a sort of humorous severity . 
Everything about her was still young and undeveloped ; the voice , and the bloom on her whole face , and the rosy hands , with white palms , and the rather narrow shoulders ... . 
She was constantly blushing and getting out of breath . 
Madame Odintsov turned to Bazarov . 
` You are looking at pictures from politeness , Yevgeny Vassilyitch , ' she began . 
That does not interest you . 
You had better come nearer to us , and let us have a discussion about something . ' 
Bazarov went closer . 
` What subject have you decided upon for discussion ? ' 
he said . 
` What you like . 
I warn you , I am dreadfully argumentative . ' 
` You ? ' 
` Yes . 
That seems to surprise you . 
Why ? ' 
` Because , as far as I can judge , you have a calm , cool character , and one must be impulsive to be argumentative . ' 
` How can you have had time to understand me so soon ? 
In the first place , I am impatient and obstinate -- you should ask Katya ; and secondly , I am very easily carried away . ' 
Bazarov looked at Anna Sergyevna . 
` Perhaps ; you must know best . 
And so you are inclined for a discussion -- by all means . 
I was looking through the views of the Saxon mountains in your album , and you remarked that that could n't interest me . 
You said so , because you suppose me to have no feeling for art , and as a fact I have n't any ; but these views might be interesting to me from a geological standpoint , for the formation of the mountains , for instance . ' 
` Excuse me ; but as a geologist , you would sooner have recourse to a book , to a special work on the subject , and not to a drawing . ' 
` The drawing shows me at a glance what would be spread over ten pages in a book . ' 
Anna Sergyevna was silent for a little . 
` And so you have n't the least artistic feeling ? ' 
she observed , putting her elbow on the table , and by that very action bringing her face nearer to Bazarov . 
` How can you get on without it ? ' 
` Why , what is it wanted for , may I ask ? ' 
` Well , at least to enable one to study and understand men . ' 
Bazarov smiled . 
` In the first place , experience of life does that ; and in the second , I assure you , studying separate individuals is not worth the trouble . 
All people are like one another , in soul as in body ; each of us has brain , spleen , heart , and lungs made alike ; and the so-called moral qualities are the same in all ; the slight variations are of no importance . 
A single human specimen is sufficient to judge of all by . 
People are like trees in a forest ; no botanist would think of studying each individual birch-tree . ' 
Katya , who was arranging the flowers , one at a time in a leisurely fashion , lifted her eyes to Bazarov with a puzzled look , and meeting his rapid and careless glance , she crimsoned up to her ears . 
Anna Sergyevna shook her head . 
` The trees in a forest , ' she repeated . 
` Then according to you there is no difference between the stupid and the clever person , between the good-natured and ill-natured ? ' 
` No , there is a difference , just as between the sick and the healthy . 
The lungs of a consumptive patient are not in the same condition as yours and mine , though they are made on the same plan . 
We know approximately what physical diseases come from ; moral diseases come from bad education , from all the nonsense people 's heads are stuffed with from childhood up , from the defective state of society ; in short , reform society , and there will be no diseases . ' 
Bazarov said all this with an air , as though he were all the while thinking to himself , ` Believe me or not , as you like , it 's all one to me ! ' 
He slowly passed his fingers over his whiskers , while his eyes strayed about the room . 
` And you conclude , ' observed Anna Sergyevna , ` that when society is reformed , there will be no stupid nor wicked people ? ' 
` At any rate , in a proper organisation of society , it will be absolutely the same whether a man is stupid or clever , wicked or good . ' 
` Yes , I understand ; they will all have the same spleen . ' 
` Precisely so , madam . ' 
Madame Odintsov turned to Arkady . 
` And what is your opinion , Arkady Nikolaevitch ? ' ' 
I agree with Yevgeny , ' he answered . 
Katya looked up at him from under her eyelids . 
` You amaze me , gentlemen , ' commented Madame Odintsov , ` but we will have more talk together . 
But now I hear my aunt coming to tea ; we must spare her . ' 
Anna Sergyevna 's aunt , Princess H -- , a thin little woman with a pinched-up face , drawn together like a fist , and staring ill-natured-looking eyes under a grey front , came in , and , scarcely bowing to the guests , she dropped into a wide velvet covered arm-chair , upon which no one but herself was privileged to sit . 
Katya put a footstool under her feet ; the old lady did not thank her , did not even look at her , only her hands shook under the yellow shawl , which almost covered her feeble body . 
The Princess liked yellow ; her cap , too , had bright yellow ribbons . 
` How have you slept , aunt ? ' 
inquired Madame Odintsov , raising her voice . 
` That dog in here again , ' the old lady muttered in reply , and noticing Fifi was making two hesitating steps in her direction , she cried , ` Ss -- ss ! ' 
Katya called Fifi and opened the door for him . 
Fifi rushed out delighted , in the expectation of being taken out for a walk ; but when he was left alone outside the door , he began scratching and whining . 
The princess scowled . 
Katya was about to go out ... ' I expect tea is ready , ' said Madame Odintsov . 
` Come gentlemen ; aunt , will you go in to tea ? ' 
The princess got up from her chair without speaking and led the way out of the drawing-room . 
They all followed her in to the dining-room . 
A little page in livery drew back , with a scraping sound , from the table , an arm-chair covered with cushions , devoted to the princess 's use ; she sank into it ; Katya in pouring out the tea handed her first a cup emblazoned with a heraldic crest . 
The old lady put some honey in her cup -LRB- she considered it both sinful and extravagant to drink tea with sugar in it , though she never spent a farthing herself on anything -RRB- , and suddenly asked in a hoarse voice , ` And what does Prince Ivan write ? ' 
No one made her any reply . 
Bazarov and Arkady soon guessed that they paid no attention to her though they treated her respectfully . 
` Because of her grand family , ' thought Bazarov ... . 
After tea , Anna Sergyevna suggested they should go out for a walk ; but it began to rain a little , and the whole party , with the exception of the princess , returned to the drawing-room . 
The neighbour , the devoted card-player , arrived ; his name was Porfiry Platonitch , a stoutish , greyish man with short , spindly legs , very polite and ready to be amused . 
Anna Sergyevna , who still talked principally with Bazarov , asked him whether he 'd like to try a contest with them in the old-fashioned way at preference ? 
Bazarov assented , saying ` that he ought to prepare himself beforehand for the duties awaiting him as a country doctor . ' 
` You must be careful , ' observed Anna Sergyevna ; ` Porfiry Platonitch and I will beat you . 
And you , Katya , ' she added , ` play something to Arkady Nikolaevitch ; he is fond of music , and we can listen , too . ' 
Katya went unwillingly to the piano ; and Arkady , though he certainly was fond of music , unwillingly followed her ; it seemed to him that Madame Odintsov was sending him away , and already , like every young man at his age , he felt a vague and oppressive emotion surging up in his heart , like the forebodings of love . 
Katya raised the top of the piano , and not looking at Arkady , she said in a low voice -- ` What am I to play you ? ' 
` What you like , ' answered Arkady indifferently . 
` What sort of music do you like best ? ' 
repeated Katya , without changing her attitude . 
` Classical , ' Arkady answered in the same tone of voice . 
` Do you like Mozart ? ' 
` Yes , I like Mozart . ' 
Katya pulled out Mozart 's Sonata-Fantasia in C minor . 
She played very well , though rather over correctly and precisely . 
She sat upright and immovable , her eyes fixed on the notes , and her lips tightly compressed , only at the end of the sonata her face glowed , her hair came loose , and a little lock fell on to her dark brow . 
Arkady was particularly struck by the last part of the sonata , the part in which , in the midst of the bewitching gaiety of the careless melody , the pangs of such mournful , almost tragic suffering , suddenly break in ... . 
But the ideas stirred in him by Mozart 's music had no reference to Katya . 
Looking at her , he simply thought , ` Well , that young lady does n't play badly , and she 's not bad-looking either . ' 
When she had finished the sonata , Katya without taking her hands from the keys , asked , ` Is that enough ? ' 
Arkady declared that he could not venture to trouble her again , and began talking to her about Mozart ; he asked her whether she had chosen that sonata herself , or some one had recommended it to her . 
But Katya answered him in monosyllables ; she withdrew into herself , went back into her shell . 
When this happened to her , she did not very quickly come out again ; her face even assumed at such times an obstinate , almost stupid expression . 
She was not exactly shy , but diffident , and rather overawed by her sister , who had educated her , and who had no suspicion of the fact . 
Arkady was reduced at last to calling Fifi to him , and with an affable smile patting him on the head to give himself an appearance of being at home . 
Katya set to work again upon her flowers . 
Bazarov meanwhile was losing and losing . 
Anna Sergyevna played cards in masterly fashion ; Porfiry Platonitch , too , could hold his own in the game . 
Bazarov lost a sum which , though trifling in itself , was not altogether pleasant for him . 
At supper Anna Sergyevna again turned the conversation on botany . 
` We will go for a walk to-morrow morning , ' she said to him ; ' I want you to teach me the Latin names of the wild flowers and their species . ' 
` What use are the Latin names to you ? ' 
asked Bazarov . 
` Order is needed in everything , ' she answered . 
` What an exquisite woman Anna Sergyevna is ! ' 
cried Arkady , when he was alone with his friend in the room assigned to them . 
` Yes , ' answered Bazarov , ' a female with brains . 
Yes , and she 's seen life too . ' 
` In what sense do you mean that , Yevgeny Vassilyitch ? ' 
` In a good sense , a good sense , my dear friend , Arkady Nikolaevitch ! 
I 'm convinced she manages her estate capitally too . 
But what 's splendid is not her , but her sister . ' 
` What , that little dark thing ? ' 
` Yes , that little dark thing . 
She now is fresh and untouched , and shy and silent , and anything you like . 
She 's worth educating and developing . 
You might make something fine out of her ; but the other 's -- a stale loaf . ' 
Arkady made no reply to Bazarov , and each of them got into bed with rather singular thoughts in his head . 
Anna Sergyevna , too , thought of her guests that evening . 
She liked Bazarov for the absence of gallantry in him , and even for his sharply defined views . 
She found in him something new , which she had not chanced to meet before , and she was curious . 
Anna Sergyevna was a rather strange creature . 
Having no prejudices of any kind , having no strong convictions even , she never gave way or went out of her way for anything . 
She had seen many things very clearly ; she had been interested in many things , but nothing had completely satisfied her ; indeed , she hardly desired complete satisfaction . 
Her intellect was at the same time inquiring and indifferent ; her doubts were never soothed to forgetfulness , and they never grew strong enough to distract her . 
Had she not been rich and independent , she would perhaps have thrown herself into the struggle , and have known passion . 
But life was easy for her , though she was bored at times , and she went on passing day after day with deliberation , never in a hurry , placid , and only rarely disturbed . 
Dreams sometimes danced in rainbow colours before her eyes even , but she breathed more freely when they died away , and did not regret them . 
Her imagination indeed overstepped the limits of what is reckoned permissible by conventional morality ; but even then her blood flowed as quietly as ever in her fascinatingly graceful , tranquil body . 
Sometimes coming out of her fragrant bath all warm and enervated , she would fall to musing on the nothingness of life , the sorrow , the labour , the malice of it ... . 
Her soul would be filled with sudden daring , and would flow with generous ardour , but a draught would blow from a half-closed window , and Anna Sergyevna would shrink into herself , and feel plaintive and almost angry , and there was only one thing she cared for at that instant -- to get away from that horrid draught . 
Like all women who have not succeeded in loving , she wanted something , without herself knowing what . 
Strictly speaking , she wanted nothing ; but it seemed to her that she wanted everything . 
She could hardly endure the late Odintsov -LRB- she had married him from prudential motives , though probably she would not have consented to become his wife if she had not considered him a good sort of man -RRB- , and had conceived a secret repugnance for all men , whom she could only figure to herself as slovenly , heavy , drowsy , and feebly importunate creatures . 
Once , somewhere abroad , she had met a handsome young Swede , with a chivalrous expression , with honest blue eyes under an open brow ; he had made a powerful impression on her , but it had not prevented her from going back to Russia . ' 
A strange man this doctor ! ' 
she thought as she lay in her luxurious bed on lace pillows under a light silk coverlet ... . 
Anna Sergyevna had inherited from her father a little of his inclination for splendour . 
She had fondly loved her sinful but good-natured father , and he had idolised her , used to joke with her in a friendly way as though she were an equal , and to confide in her fully , to ask her advice . 
Her mother she scarcely remembered . 
` This doctor is a strange man ! ' 
she repeated to herself . 
She stretched , smiled , clasped her hands behind her head , then ran her eyes over two pages of a stupid French novel , dropped the book -- and fell asleep , all pure and cold , in her pure and fragrant linen . 
The following morning Anna Sergyevna went off botanising with Bazarov directly after lunch , and returned just before dinner ; Arkady did not go off anywhere , and spent about an hour with Katya . 
He was not bored with her ; she offered of herself to repeat the sonata of the day before ; but when Madame Odintsov came back at last , when he caught sight of her , he felt an instantaneous pang at his heart . 
She came through the garden with a rather tired step ; her cheeks were glowing and her eyes shining more brightly than usual under her round straw hat . 
She was twirling in her fingers the thin stalk of a wildflower , a light mantle had slipped down to her elbows , and the wide gray ribbons of her hat were clinging to her bosom . 
Bazarov walked behind her , self-confident and careless as usual , but the expression of his face , cheerful and even friendly as it was , did not please Arkady . 
Muttering between his teeth , ` Good-morning ! ' 
Bazarov went away to his room , while Madame Odintsov shook Arkady 's hand abstractedly , and also walked past him . 
` Good-morning ! ' 
thought Arkady ... ` As though we had not seen each other already to-day ! ' 
Time , it is well known , sometimes flies like a bird , sometimes crawls like a worm ; but man is wont to be particularly happy when he does not even notice whether it passes quickly or slowly . 
It was in that way Arkady and Bazarov spent a fortnight at Madame Odintsov 's . 
The good order she had established in her house and in her life partly contributed to this result . 
She adhered strictly to this order herself , and forced others to submit to it . 
Everything during the day was done at a fixed time . 
In the morning , precisely at eight o'clock , all the party assembled for tea ; from morning-tea till lunch-time every one did what he pleased , the hostess herself was engaged with her bailiff -LRB- the estate was on the rent-system -RRB- , her steward , and her head housekeeper . 
Before dinner the party met again for conversation or reading ; the evening was devoted to walking , cards , and music ; at half-past ten Anna Sergyevna retired to her own room , gave her orders for the following day , and went to bed . 
Bazarov did not like this measured , somewhat ostentatious punctuality in daily life , ` like moving along rails , ' he pronounced it to be ; the footmen in livery , the decorous stewards , offended his democratic sentiments . 
He declared that if one went so far , one might as well dine in the English style at once -- in tail-coats and white ties . 
He once spoke plainly upon the subject to Anna Sergyevna . 
Her attitude was such that no one hesitated to speak his mind freely before her . 
She heard him out ; and then her comment was , ` From your point of view , you are right -- and perhaps , in that respect , I am too much of a lady ; but there 's no living in the country without order , one would be devoured by ennui , ' and she continued to go her own way . 
Bazarov grumbled , but the very reason life was so easy for him and Arkady at Madame Odintsov 's was that everything in the house ` moved on rails . ' 
For all that , a change had taken place in both the young men since the first days of their stay at Nikolskoe . 
Bazarov , in whom Anna Sergyevna was obviously interested , though she seldom agreed with him , began to show signs of an unrest , unprecedented in him ; he was easily put out of temper , and unwilling to talk , he looked irritated , and could not sit still in one place , just as though he were possessed by some secret longing ; while Arkady , who had made up his mind conclusively that he was in love with Madame Odintsov , had begun to yield to a gentle melancholy . 
This melancholy did not , however , prevent him from becoming friendly with Katya ; it even impelled him to get into friendly , affectionate terms with her . ' 
She does not appreciate me ? 
So be it ! 
... But here is a good creature , who does not repulse me , ' he thought , and his heart again knew the sweetness of magnanimous emotions . 
Katya vaguely realised that he was seeking a sort of consolation in her company , and did not deny him or herself the innocent pleasure of a half-shy , half-confidential friendship . 
They did not talk to each other in Anna Sergyevna 's presence ; Katya always shrank into herself under her sister 's sharp eyes ; while Arkady , as befits a man in love , could pay attention to nothing else when near the object of his passion ; but he was happy with Katya alone . 
He was conscious that he did not possess the power to interest Madame Odintsov ; he was shy and at a loss when he was left alone with her , and she did not know what to say to him , he was too young for her . 
With Katya , on the other hand , Arkady felt at home ; he treated her condescendingly , encouraged her to express the impressions made on her by music , reading novels , verses , and other such trifles , without noticing or realising that these trifles were what interested him too . 
Katya , on her side , did not try to drive away melancholy .
