Let me give Mitya a swing . ' 
And Nikolai Petrovitch began tossing him almost up to the ceiling , to the huge delight of the baby , and to the considerable uneasiness of the mother , who every time he flew up stretched her arms up towards his little bare legs . 
Pavel Petrovitch went back to his artistic study , with its walls covered with handsome bluish-grey hangings , with weapons hanging upon a variegated Persian rug nailed to the wall ; with walnut furniture , upholstered in dark green velveteen , with a renaissance bookcase of old black oak , with bronze statuettes on the magnificent writing-table , with an open hearth . 
He threw himself on the sofa , clasped his hands behind his head , and remained without moving , looking with a face almost of despair at the ceiling . 
Whether he wanted to hide from the very walls that which was reflected in his face , or for some other reason , he got up , drew the heavy window curtains , and again threw himself on the sofa . 
On the same day Bazarov made acquaintance with Fenitchka . 
He was walking with Arkady in the garden , and explaining to him why some of the trees , especially the oaks , had not done well . 
` You ought to have planted silver poplars here by preference , and spruce firs , and perhaps limes , giving them some loam . 
The arbour there has done well , ' he added , ` because it 's acacia and lilac ; they 're accommodating good fellows , those trees , they do n't want much care . 
But there 's some one in here . ' 
In the arbour was sitting Fenitchka , with Dunyasha and Mitya . 
Bazarov stood still , while Arkady nodded to Fenitchka like an old friend . 
` Who 's that ? ' 
Bazarov asked him directly they had passed by . 
` What a pretty girl ! ' 
` Whom are you speaking of ? ' 
` You know ; only one of them was pretty . ' 
Arkady , not without embarrassment , explained to him briefly who Fenitchka was . 
` Aha ! ' 
commented Bazarov ; ` your father 's got good taste , one can see . 
I like him , your father , ay , ay ! 
He 's a jolly fellow . 
We must make friends though , ' he added , and turned back towards the arbour . 
` Yevgeny ! ' 
Arkady cried after him in dismay ; ` mind what you are about , for mercy 's sake . ' 
` Do n't worry yourself , ' said Bazarov ; ' I know how to behave myself -- I 'm not a booby . ' 
Going up to Fenitchka , he took off his cap . 
` Allow me to introduce myself , ' he began , with a polite bow . 
` I 'm a harmless person , and a friend of Arkady Nikolaevitch 's . ' 
Fenitchka got up from the garden seat and looked at him without speaking . 
` What a splendid baby ! ' 
continued Bazarov ; ` do n't be uneasy , my praises have never brought ill-luck yet . 
Why is it his cheeks are so flushed ? 
Is he cutting his teeth ? ' 
` Yes , ' said Fenitchka ; ` he has cut four teeth already , and now the gums are swollen again . ' 
` Show me , and do n't be afraid , I 'm a doctor . ' 
Bazarov took the baby up in his arms , and to the great astonishment both of Fenitchka and Dunyasha the child made no resistance , and was not frightened . ' 
I see , I see ... . 
It 's nothing , everything 's as it should be ; he will have a good set of teeth . 
If anything goes wrong , tell me . 
And are you quite well yourself ? ' 
` Quite , thank God . ' 
` Thank God , indeed -- that 's the great thing . 
And you ? ' 
he added , turning to Dunyasha . 
Dunyasha , a girl very prim in the master 's house , and a romp outside the gates , only giggled in answer . 
` Well , that 's all right . 
Here 's your gallant fellow . ' 
Fenitchka received the baby in her arms . 
` How good he was with you ! ' 
she commented in an undertone . 
` Children are always good with me . ' 
answered Bazarov ; ' I have a way with them . ' 
` Children know who loves them , ' remarked Dunyasha . 
` Yes , they certainly do , ' Fenitchka said . 
` Why , Mitya will not go to some people for anything . ' 
` Will he come to me ? ' 
asked Arkady , who , after standing in the distance for some time , had gone up to the arbour . 
He tried to entice Mitya to come to him , but Mitya threw his head back and screamed , to Fenitchka 's great confusion . 
` Another day , when he 's had time to get used to me , ' said Arkady indulgently , and the two friends walked away . 
` What 's her name ? ' 
asked Bazarov . 
` Fenitchka ... Fedosya , ' answered Arkady . 
` And her father 's name ? 
One must know that too . ' 
` Nikolaevna . ' ' 
Bene . 
What I like in her is that she 's not too embarrassed . 
Some people , I suppose , would think ill of her for it . 
What nonsense ! 
What is there to embarrass her ? 
She 's a mother -- she 's all right . ' 
` She 's all right , ' observed Arkady , -- ` but my father . ' 
` And he 's right too , ' put in Bazarov . 
` Well , no , I do n't think so . ' ' 
I suppose an extra heir 's not to your liking ? ' ' 
I wonder you 're not ashamed to attribute such ideas to me ! ' 
retorted Arkady hotly ; ' I do n't consider my father wrong from that point of view ; I think he ought to marry her . ' 
` Hoity-toity ! ' 
responded Bazarov tranquilly . 
` What magnanimous fellows we are ! 
You still attach significance to marriage ; I did not expect that of you . ' 
The friends walked a few paces in silence . ' 
I have looked at all your father 's establishment , ' Bazarov began again . 
` The cattle are inferior , the horses are broken down ; the buildings are n't up to much , and the workmen look confirmed loafers ; while the superintendent is either a fool , or a knave , I have n't quite found out which yet . ' 
` You are rather hard on everything to-day , Yevgeny Vassilyevitch . ' 
` And the dear good peasants are taking your father in to a dead certainty . 
You know the Russian proverb , `` The Russian peasant will cheat God Himself . '' ' ' 
I begin to agree with my uncle , ' remarked Arkady ; ` you certainly have a poor opinion of Russians . ' 
` As though that mattered ! 
The only good point in a Russian is his having the lowest possible opinion of himself . 
What does matter is that two and two make four , and the rest is all foolery . ' 
` And is nature foolery ? ' 
said Arkady , looking pensively at the bright-coloured fields in the distance , in the beautiful soft light of the sun , which was not yet high up in the sky . 
` Nature , too , is foolery in the sense you understand it . 
Nature 's not a temple , but a workshop , and man 's the workman in it . ' 
At that instant , the long drawn notes of a violoncello floated out to them from the house . 
Some one was playing Schubert 's Expectation with much feeling , though with an untrained hand , and the melody flowed with honey sweetness through the air . 
` What 's that ? ' 
cried Bazarov in amazement . 
` It 's my father . ' 
` Your father plays the violoncello ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
` And how old is your father ? ' 
` Forty-four . ' 
Bazarov suddenly burst into a roar of laughter . 
` What are you laughing at ? ' 
` Upon my word , a man of forty-four , a paterfamilias in this out-of-the-way district , playing on the violoncello ! ' 
Bazarov went on laughing ; but much as he revered his master , this time Arkady did not even smile . 
About a fortnight passed by . 
Life at Maryino went on its accustomed course , while Arkady was lazy and enjoyed himself , and Bazarov worked . 
Every one in the house had grown used to him , to his careless manners , and his curt and abrupt speeches . 
Fenitchka , in particular , was so far at home with him that one night she sent to wake him up ; Mitya had had convulsions ; and he had gone , and , half joking , half-yawning as usual , he stayed two hours with her and relieved the child . 
On the other hand Pavel Petrovitch had grown to detest Bazarov with all the strength of his soul ; he regarded him as stuck-up , impudent , cynical , and vulgar ; he suspected that Bazarov had no respect for him , that he had all but a contempt for him -- him , Pavel Kirsanov ! 
Nikolai Petrovitch was rather afraid of the young ` nihilist , ' and was doubtful whether his influence over Arkady was for the good ; but he was glad to listen to him , and was glad to be present at his scientific and chemical experiments . 
Bazarov had brought with him a microscope , and busied himself for hours together with it . 
The servants , too , took to him , though he made fun of them ; they felt , all the same , that he was one of themselves , not a master . 
Dunyasha was always ready to giggle with him , and used to cast significant and stealthy glances at him when she skipped by like a rabbit ; Piotr , a man vain and stupid to the last degree , for ever wearing an affected frown on his brow , a man whose whole merit consisted in the fact that he looked civil , could spell out a page of reading , and was diligent in brushing his coat -- even he smirked and brightened up directly Bazarov paid him any attention ; the boys on the farm simply ran after the ` doctor ' like puppies . 
The old man Prokofitch was the only one who did not like him ; he handed him the dishes at table with a surly face , called him a ` butcher ' and ` an upstart , ' and declared that with his great whiskers he looked like a pig in a stye . 
Prokofitch in his own way was quite as much of an aristocrat as Pavel Petrovitch . 
The best days of the year had come -- the first days of June . 
The weather kept splendidly fine ; in the distance , it is true , the cholera was threatening , but the inhabitants of that province had had time to get used to its visits . 
Bazarov used to get up very early and go out for two or three miles , not for a walk -- he could n't bear walking without an object -- but to collect specimens of plants and insects . 
Sometimes he took Arkady with him . 
On the way home an argument usually sprang up , and Arkady was usually vanquished in it , though he said more than his companion . 
One day they had lingered rather late ; Nikolai Petrovitch went to meet them in the garden , and as he reached the arbour he suddenly heard the quick steps and voices of the two young men . 
They were walking on the other side of the arbour , and could not see him . 
` You do n't know my father well enough , ' said Arkady . 
` Your father 's a nice chap , ' said Bazarov , ` but he 's behind the times ; his day is done . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch listened intently ... . 
Arkady made no answer . 
The man whose day was done remained two minutes motionless , and stole slowly home . 
` The day before yesterday I saw him reading Pushkin , ' Bazarov was continuing meanwhile . 
` Explain to him , please , that that 's no earthly use . 
He 's not a boy , you know ; it 's time to throw up that rubbish . 
And what an idea to be a romantic at this time of day ! 
Give him something sensible to read . ' 
` What ought I to give him ? ' 
asked Arkady . 
` Oh , I think Büchner 's Stoff und Kraft to begin with . ' ' 
I think so too , ' observed Arkady approving , ' Stoff und Kraft is written in popular language ... ' ` So it seems , ' Nikolai Petrovitch said the same day after dinner to his brother , as he sat in his study , ` you and I are behind the times , our day 's over . 
Well , well . 
Perhaps Bazarov is right ; but one thing I confess , makes me feel sore ; I did so hope , precisely now , to get on to such close intimate terms with Arkady , and it turns out I 'm left behind , and he has gone forward , and we ca n't understand one another . ' 
` How has he gone forward ? 
And in what way is he so superior to us already ? ' 
cried Pavel Petrovitch impatiently . 
` It 's that high and mighty gentleman , that nihilist , who 's knocked all that into his head . 
I hate that doctor fellow ; in my opinion , he 's simply a quack ; I 'm convinced , for all his tadpoles , he 's not got very far even in medicine . ' 
` No , brother , you must n't say that ; Bazarov is clever , and knows his subject . ' 
` And his conceit 's something revolting , ' Pavel Petrovitch broke in again . 
` Yes , ' observed Nikolai Petrovitch , ` he is conceited . 
But there 's no doing without that , it seems ; only that 's what I did not take into account . 
I thought I was doing everything to keep up with the times ; I have started a model farm ; I have done well by the peasants , so that I am positively called a `` Red Radical '' all over the province ; I read , I study , I try in every way to keep abreast with the requirements of the day -- and they say my day 's over . 
And , brother , I begin to think that it is . ' 
` Why so ? ' 
` I 'll tell you why . 
This morning I was sitting reading Pushkin ... . 
I remember , it happened to be The Gipsies ... all of a sudden Arkady came up to me , and , without speaking , with such a kindly compassion on his face , as gently as if I were a baby , took the book away from me , and laid another before me -- a German book ... smiled , and went away , carrying Pushkin off with him . ' 
` Upon my word ! 
What book did he give you ? ' 
` This one here . ' 
And Nikolai Petrovitch pulled the famous treatise of Büchner , in the ninth edition , out of his coat-tail pocket . 
Pavel Petrovitch turned it over in his hands . 
` Hm ! ' 
he growled . 
` Arkady Nikolaevitch is taking your education in hand . 
Well , did you try reading it ? ' 
` Yes , I tried it . ' 
` Well , what did you think of it ? ' 
` Either I 'm stupid , or it 's all -- nonsense . 
I must be stupid , I suppose . ' 
` Have n't you forgotten your German ? ' 
queried Pavel Petrovitch . 
` Oh , I understand the German . ' 
Pavel Petrovitch again turned the book over in his hands , and glanced from under his brows at his brother . 
Both were silent . 
` Oh , by the way , ' began Nikolai Petrovitch , obviously wishing to change the subject , ` I 've got a letter from Kolyazin . ' 
` Matvy Ilyitch ? ' 
` Yes . 
He has come to -- to inspect the province . 
He 's quite a bigwig now ; and writes to me that , as a relation , he should like to see us again , and invites you and me and Arkady to the town . ' 
` Are you going ? ' 
asked Pavel Petrovitch . 
` No ; are you ? ' 
` No , I sha n't go either . 
Much object there would be in dragging oneself over forty miles on a wild-goose chase . 
Mathieu wants to show himself in all his glory . 
Damn him ! 
he will have the whole province doing him homage ; he can get on without the likes of us . 
A grand dignity , indeed , a privy councillor ! 
If I had stayed in the service , if I had drudged on in official harness , I should have been a general-adjutant by now . 
Besides , you and I are behind the times , you know . ' 
` Yes , brother ; it 's time , it seems , to order a coffin and cross one 's arms on ones breast , ' remarked Nikolai Petrovitch , with a sigh . 
` Well , I 'm not going to give in quite so soon , ' muttered his brother . 
` I 've got a tussle with that doctor fellow before me , I feel sure of that . ' 
A tussle came off that same day at evening tea . 
Pavel Petrovitch came into the drawing-room , all ready for the fray , irritable and determined . 
He was only waiting for an excuse to fall upon the enemy ; but for a long while an excuse did not present itself . 
As a rule , Bazarov said little in the presence of the ` old Kirsanovs ' -LRB- that was how he spoke of the brothers -RRB- , and that evening he felt out of humour , and drank off cup after cup of tea without a word . 
Pavel Petrovitch was all aflame with impatience ; his wishes were fulfilled at last . 
The conversation turned on one of the neighbouring landowners . 
` Rotten aristocratic snob , ' observed Bazarov indifferently . 
He had met him in Petersburg . 
` Allow me to ask you , ' began Pavel Petrovitch , and his lips were trembling , ` according to your ideas , have the words `` rotten '' and `` aristocrat '' the same meaning ? ' ' 
I said `` aristocratic snob , '' ' replied Bazarov , lazily swallowing a sip of tea . 
` Precisely so ; but I imagine you have the same opinion of aristocrats as of aristocratic snobs . 
I think it my duty to inform you that I do not share that opinion . 
I venture to assert that every one knows me for a man of liberal ideas and devoted to progress ; but , exactly for that reason , I respect aristocrats -- real aristocrats . 
Kindly remember , sir ' -LRB- at these words Bazarov lifted his eyes and looked at Pavel Petrovitch -RRB- , ` kindly remember , sir , ' he repeated , with acrimony -- ` the English aristocracy . 
They do not abate one iota of their rights , and for that reason they respect the rights of others ; they demand the performance of what is due to them , and for that reason they perform their own duties . 
The aristocracy has given freedom to England , and maintains it for her . ' 
` We 've heard that story a good many times , ' replied Bazarov ; ` but what are you trying to prove by that ? ' ' 
I am tryin ' to prove by that , sir ' -LRB- when Pavel Petrovitch was angry he intentionally clipped his words in this way , though , of course , he knew very well that such forms are not strictly grammatical . 
In this fashionable whim could be discerned a survival of the habits of the times of Alexander . 
The exquisites of those days , on the rare occasions when they spoke their own language , made use of such slipshod forms ; as much as to say , ` We , of course , are born Russians , at the same time we are great swells , who are at liberty to neglect the rules of scholars ' -RRB- ; ' I am tryin ' to prove by that , sir , that without the sense of personal dignity , without self-respect -- and these two sentiments are well developed in the aristocrat -- there is no secure foundation for the social ... bien public ... the social fabric . 
Personal character , sir -- that is the chief thing ; a man 's personal character must be firm as a rock , since everything is built on it . 
I am very well aware , for instance , that you are pleased to consider my habits , my dress , my refinements , in fact , ridiculous ; but all that proceeds from a sense of self-respect , from a sense of duty -- yes , indeed , of duty . 
I live in the country , in the wilds , but I will not lower myself . 
I respect the dignity of man in myself . ' 
` Let me ask you , Pavel Petrovitch , ' commented Bazarov ; ` you respect yourself , and sit with your hands folded ; what sort of benefit does that do to the bien public ? 
If you did n't respect yourself , you 'd do just the same . ' 
Pavel Petrovitch turned white . 
` That 's a different question . 
It 's absolutely unnecessary for me to explain to you now why I sit with folded hands , as you are pleased to express yourself . 
I wish only to tell you that aristocracy is a principle , and in our days none but immoral or silly people can live without principles . 
I said that to Arkady the day after he came home , and I repeat it now . 
Is n't it so , Nikolai ? ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch nodded his head . 
` Aristocracy , Liberalism , progress , principles , ' Bazarov was saying meanwhile ; ` if you think of it , what a lot of foreign ... and useless words ! 
To a Russian they 're good for nothing . ' 
` What is good for something according to you ? 
If we listen to you , we shall find ourselves outside humanity , outside its laws . 
Come -- the logic of history demands ... ' ` But what 's that logic to us ? 
We call get on without that too . ' 
` How do you mean ? ' 
` Why , this . 
You do n't need logic , I hope , to put a bit of bread in your mouth when you 're hungry . 
What 's the object of these abstractions to us ? ' 
Pavel Petrovitch raised his hands in horror . ' 
I do n't understand you , after that . 
You insult the Russian people . 
I do n't understand how it 's possible not to acknowledge principles , rules ! 
By virtue of what do you act then ? ' 
` I 've told you already , uncle , that we do n't accept any authorities , ' put in Arkady . 
` We act by virtue of what we recognise as beneficial , ' observed Bazarov . 
` At the present time , negation is the most beneficial of all -- and we deny -- ' ` Everything ? ' 
` Everything ! ' 
` What ? 
not only art and poetry ... but even ... horrible to say ... ' ` Everything , ' repeated Bazarov , with indescribable composure . 
Pavel Petrovitch stared at him . 
He had not expected this ; while Arkady fairly blushed with delight . 
` Allow me , though , ' began Nikolai Petrovitch . 
` You deny everything ; or , speaking more precisely , you destroy everything ... . 
But one must construct too , you know . ' 
` That 's not our business now ... . 
The ground wants clearing first . ' 
` The present condition of the people requires it , ' added Arkady , with dignity ; ` we are bound to carry out these requirements , we have no right to yield to the satisfaction of our personal egoism . ' 
This last phrase obviously displeased Bazarov ; there was a flavour of philosophy , that is to say , romanticism about it , for Bazarov called philosophy , too , romanticism , but he did not think it necessary to correct his young disciple . 
` No , no ! ' 
cried Pavel Petrovitch , with sudden energy . 
` I 'm not willing to believe that you , young men , know the Russian people really , that you are the representatives of their requirements , their efforts ! 
No ; the Russian people is not what you imagine it . 
Tradition it holds sacred ; it is a patriarchal people ; it can not live without faith ... ' ` I 'm not going to dispute that , ' Bazarov interrupted . 
` I 'm even ready to agree that in that you 're right . ' 
` But if I am right ... ' ` And , all the same , that proves nothing . ' 
` It just proves nothing , ' repeated Arkady , with the confidence of a practised chess-player , who has foreseen an apparently dangerous move on the part of his adversary , and so is not at all taken aback by it . 
` How does it prove nothing ? ' 
muttered Pavel Petrovitch , astounded . 
` You must be going against the people then ? ' 
` And what if we are ? ' 
shouted Bazarov . 
` The people imagine that , when it thunders , the prophet Ilya 's riding across the sky in his chariot . 
What then ? 
Are we to agree with them ? 
Besides , the people 's Russian ; but am I not Russian too ? ' 
` No , you are not Russian , after all you have just been saying ! 
I ca n't acknowledge you as Russian . ' 
` My grandfather ploughed the land , ' answered Bazarov with haughty pride . 
` Ask any one of your peasants which of us -- you or me -- he 'd more readily acknowledge as a fellow-countryman . 
You do n't even know how to talk to them . ' 
` While you talk to him and despise him at the same time . ' 
` Well , suppose he deserves contempt . 
You find fault with my attitude , but how do you know that I have got it by chance , that it 's not a product of that very national spirit , in the name of which you wage war on it ? ' 
` What an idea ! 
Much use in nihilists ! ' 
` Whether they 're of use or not , is not for us to decide . 
Why , even you suppose you 're not a useless person . ' 
` Gentlemen , gentlemen , no personalities , please ! ' 
cried Nikolai Petrovitch , getting up . 
Pavel Petrovitch smiled , and laying his hand on his brother 's shoulder , forced him to sit down again . 
` Do n't be uneasy , ' he said ; ' I shall not forget myself , just through that sense of dignity which is made fun of so mercilessly by our friend -- our friend , the doctor . 
Let me ask , ' he resumed , turning again to Bazarov ; ` you suppose , possibly , that your doctrine is a novelty ? 
That is quite a mistake . 
The materialism you advocate has been more than once in vogue already , and has always proved insufficient ... ' ' A foreign word again ! ' 
broke in Bazarov . 
He was beginning to feel vicious , and his face assumed a peculiar coarse coppery hue . 
` In the first place , we advocate nothing ; that 's not our way . ' 
` What do you do , then ? ' 
` I 'll tell you what we do . 
Not long ago we used to say that our officials took bribes , that we had no roads , no commerce , no real justice ... ' ` Oh , I see , you are reformers -- that 's what that 's called , I fancy . 
I too should agree to many of your reforms , but ... ' ` Then we suspected that talk , perpetual talk , and nothing but talk , about our social diseases , was not worth while , that it all led to nothing but superficiality and pedantry ; we saw that our leading men , so-called advanced people and reformers , are no good ; that we busy ourselves over foolery , talk rubbish about art , unconscious creativeness , parliamentarism , trial by jury , and the deuce knows what all ; while , all the while , it 's a question of getting bread to eat , while we 're stifling under the grossest superstition , while all our enterprises come to grief , simply because there are n't honest men enough to carry them on , while the very emancipation our Government 's busy upon will hardly come to any good , because peasants are glad to rob even themselves to get drunk at the gin-shop . ' 
` Yes , ' interposed Pavel Petrovitch , ` yes ; you were convinced of all this , and decided not to undertake anything seriously , yourselves . ' 
` We decided not to undertake anything , ' repeated Bazarov grimly . 
He suddenly felt vexed with himself for having , without reason , been so expansive before this gentleman . 
` But to confine yourselves to abuse ? ' 
` To confine ourselves to abuse . ' 
` And that is called nihilism ? ' 
` And that 's called nihilism , ' Bazarov repeated again , this time with peculiar rudeness . 
Pavel Petrovitch puckered up his face a little . 
` So that 's it ! ' 
he observed in a strangely composed voice . 
` Nihilism is to cure all our woes , and you , you are our heroes and saviours . 
But why do you abuse others , those reformers even ? 
Do n't you do as much talking as every one else ? ' 
` Whatever faults we have , we do not err in that way , ' Bazarov muttered between his teeth . 
` What , then ? 
Do you act , or what ? 
Are you preparing for action ? ' 
Bazarov made no answer . 
Something like a tremor passed over Pavel Petrovitch , but he at once regained control of himself . 
` Hm ! 
... Action , destruction ... ' he went on . 
` But how destroy without even knowing why ? ' 
` We shall destroy , because we are a force , ' observed Arkady . 
Pavel Petrovitch looked at his nephew and laughed . 
` Yes , a force is not to be called to account , ' said Arkady , drawing himself up . 
` Unhappy boy ! ' 
wailed Pavel Petrovitch , he was positively incapable of maintaining his firm demeanour any longer . 
` If you could only realise what it is you are doing for your country . 
No ; it 's enough to try the patience of an angel ! 
Force ! 
There 's force in the savage Kalmuck , in the Mongolian ; but what is it to us ? 
What is precious to us is civilisation ; yes , yes , sir , its fruits are precious to us . 
And do n't tell me those fruits are worthless ; the poorest dauber , un barbouilleur , the man who plays dance music for five farthings an evening , is of more use than you , because they are the representatives of civilisation , and not of brute Mongolian force ! 
You fancy yourselves advanced people , and all the while you are only fit for the Kalmuck 's hovel ! 
Force ! 
And recollect , you forcible gentlemen , that you 're only four men and a half , and the others are millions , who wo n't let you trample their sacred traditions under foot , who will crush you and walk over you ! ' 
` If we 're crushed , serve us right , ' observed Bazarov . 
` But that 's an open question . 
We are not so few as you suppose . ' 
` What ? 
You seriously suppose you will come to terms with a whole people ? ' 
` All Moscow was burnt down , you know , by a farthing dip , ' answered Bazarov . 
` Yes , yes . 
First a pride almost Satanic , then ridicule -- that , that 's what it is attracts the young , that 's what gains an ascendancy over the inexperienced hearts of boys ! 
Here 's one of them sitting beside you , ready to worship the ground under your feet . 
Look at him ! 
-LRB- Arkady turned away and frowned . -RRB- 
And this plague has spread far already . 
I have been told that in Rome our artists never set foot in the Vatican . 
Raphael they regard as almost a fool , because , if you please , he 's an authority ; while they 're all the while most disgustingly sterile and unsuccessful , men whose imagination does not soar beyond ` Girls at a Fountain , ' however they try ! 
And the girls even out of drawing . 
They are fine fellows to your mind , are they not ? ' 
` To my mind , ' retorted Bazarov , ` Raphael 's not worth a brass farthing ; and they 're no better than he . ' 
` Bravo ! 
bravo ! 
Listen , Arkady ... that 's how young men of to-day ought to express themselves ! 
And if you come to think of it , how could they fail to follow you ! 
In old days , young men had to study ; they did n't want to be called dunces , so they had to work hard whether they liked it or not . 
But now , they need only say , `` Everything in the world is foolery ! '' 
and the trick 's done . 
Young men are delighted . 
And , to be sure , they were simply geese before , and now they have suddenly turned nihilists . ' 
` Your praiseworthy sense of personal dignity has given way , ' remarked Bazarov phlegmatically , while Arkady was hot all over , and his eyes were flashing . 
` Our argument has gone too far ; it 's better to cut it short , I think . 
I shall be quite ready to agree with you , ' he added , getting up , ` when you bring forward a single institution in our present mode of life , in family or in social life , which does not call for complete and unqualified destruction . ' ' 
I will bring forward millions of such institutions , ' cried Pavel Petrovitch -- ` millions ! 
Well -- the Mir , for instance . ' 
A cold smile curved Bazarov 's lips . 
` Well , as regards the Mir , ' he commented ; ` you had better talk to your brother . 
He has seen by now , I should fancy , what sort of thing the Mir is in fact -- its common guarantee , its sobriety , and other features of the kind . ' 
` The family , then , the family as it exists among our peasants ! ' 
cried Pavel Petrovitch . 
` And that subject , too , I imagine , it will be better for yourselves not to go into in detail . 
Do n't you realise all the advantages of the head of the family choosing his daughters-in-law ? 
Take my advice , Pavel Petrovitch , allow yourself two days to think about it ; you 're not likely to find anything on the spot . 
Go through all our classes , and think well over each , while I and Arkady will ... ' ` Will go on turning everything into ridicule , ' broke in Pavel Petrovitch . 
` No , will go on dissecting frogs . 
Come , Arkady ; good-bye for the present , gentlemen ! ' 
The two friends walked off . 
The brothers were left alone , and at first they only looked at one another . 
` So that , ' began Pavel Petrovitch , ` so that 's what our young men of this generation are ! 
They are like that -- our successors ! ' 
` Our successors ! ' 
repeated Nikolai Petrovitch , with a dejected smile . 
He had been sitting on thorns , all through the argument , and had done nothing but glance stealthily , with a sore heart , at Arkady . 
` Do you know what I was reminded of , brother ? 
I once had a dispute with our poor mother ; she stormed , and would n't listen to me . 
At last I said to her , `` Of course , you ca n't understand me ; we belong , '' I said , `` to two different generations . '' 
She was dreadfully offended , while I thought , `` There 's no help for it . 
It 's a bitter pill , but she has to swallow it . '' 
You see , now , our turn has come , and our successors can say to us , `` You are not of our generation ; swallow your pill . '' ' 
` You are beyond everything in your generosity and modesty , ' replied Pavel Petrovitch . 
` I 'm convinced , on the contrary , that you and I are far more in the right than these young gentlemen , though we do perhaps express ourselves in old-fashioned language , vieilli , and have not the same insolent conceit ... . 
And the swagger of the young men nowadays ! 
You ask one , `` Do you take red wine or white ? '' 
`` It is my custom to prefer red ! '' 
he answers in a deep bass , with a face as solemn as if the whole universe had its eyes on him at that instant ... ' ` Do you care for any more tea ? ' 
asked Fenitchka , putting her head in at the door ; she had not been able to make up her mind to come into the drawing-room while there was the sound of voices in dispute there . 
` No , you can tell them to take the samovar , ' answered Nikolai Petrovitch , and he got up to meet her .
