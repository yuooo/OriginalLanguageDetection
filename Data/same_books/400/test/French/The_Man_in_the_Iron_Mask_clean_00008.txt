Philippe made his appearance from the alcove , as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the bed . 
`` M. d'Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions , it seems , '' he said . 
`` Ah ! 
-- you recognized M. d'Artagnan , then ? '' 
`` Before you called him by his name , even . '' 
`` He is your captain of musketeers . '' 
`` He is very devoted to me , '' replied Philippe , laying a stress upon the personal pronoun . 
`` As faithful as a dog ; but he bites sometimes . 
If D'Artagnan does not recognize you before the other has disappeared , rely upon D'Artagnan to the end of the world ; for in that case , if he has seen nothing , he will keep his fidelity . 
If he sees , when it is too late , he is a Gascon , and will never admit that he has been deceived . '' 
`` I thought so . 
What are we to do , now ? '' 
`` Sit in this folding-chair . 
I am going to push aside a portion of the flooring ; you will look through the opening , which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king 's apartment . 
Can you see ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Philippe , starting as at the sight of an enemy ; `` I see the king ! '' 
`` What is he doing ? '' 
`` He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him . '' 
`` M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` No , no ; wait a moment -- '' `` Look at the notes and the portraits , my prince . '' 
`` The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert . '' 
`` Colbert sit down in the king 's presence ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis . 
`` It is impossible . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring . 
`` Yes , '' he said . 
`` Colbert himself . 
Oh , monseigneur ! 
what can we be going to hear -- and what can result from this intimacy ? '' 
`` Nothing good for M. Fouquet , at all events . '' 
The prince did not deceive himself . 
We have seen that Louis XIV . 
had sent for Colbert , and Colbert had arrived . 
The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done ; it was true the king was alone with his subject . 
`` Colbert , '' said he , `` sit down . '' 
The intendant , overcome with delight , for he feared he was about to be dismissed , refused this unprecedented honor . 
`` Does he accept ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` No , he remains standing . '' 
`` Let us listen , then . '' 
And the future king and the future pope listened eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet , ready to crush them when they liked . 
`` Colbert , '' said the king , `` you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day . '' 
`` I know it , sire . '' 
`` Very good ; I like that answer . 
Yes , you knew it , and there was courage in the doing of it . '' 
`` I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty , but I risked , also , the concealment of your best interests . '' 
`` What ! 
you were afraid of something on my account ? '' 
`` I was , sire , even if it were nothing more than an indigestion , '' said Colbert ; `` for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one of to-day , unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living . '' 
Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon the king ; and Louis XIV. , who was the vainest and the most fastidiously delicate man in his kingdom , forgave Colbert the joke . 
`` The truth is , '' he said , `` that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal . 
Tell me , Colbert , where does he get all the money required for this enormous expenditure , -- can you tell ? '' 
`` Yes , I do know , sire . '' 
`` Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty ? '' 
`` Easily ; and to the utmost farthing . '' 
`` I know you are very exact . '' 
`` Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of finances . '' 
`` But all are not so . '' 
`` I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , therefore , is rich -- very rich , and I suppose every man knows he is so . '' 
`` Every one , sire ; the living as well as the dead . '' 
`` What does that mean , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
`` The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet 's wealth , -- they admire and applaud the result produced ; but the dead , wiser and better informed than we are , know how that wealth was obtained -- and they rise up in accusation . '' 
`` So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other . '' 
`` The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it . '' 
`` You have something to say to me more confidentially , I perceive ; do not be afraid , we are quite alone . '' 
`` I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience , and under the protection of your majesty , '' said Colbert , bowing . 
`` If the dead , therefore , were to speak -- '' `` They do speak sometimes , sire , -- read . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
murmured Aramis , in the prince 's ear , who , close beside him , listened without losing a syllable , `` since you are placed here , monseigneur , in order to learn your vocation of a king , listen to a piece of infamy -- of a nature truly royal . 
You are about to be a witness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes . 
Listen attentively , -- you will find your advantage in it . '' 
The prince redoubled his attention , and saw Louis XIV . 
take from Colbert 's hands a letter the latter held out to him . 
`` The late cardinal 's handwriting , '' said the king . 
`` Your majesty has an excellent memory , '' replied Colbert , bowing ; `` it is an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize handwritings at the first glance . '' 
The king read Mazarin 's letter , and , as its contents are already known to the reader , in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and Aramis , nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again . 
`` I do not quite understand , '' said the king , greatly interested . 
`` Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the public accounts . '' 
`` I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Thirteen millions . 
A tolerably good sum . '' 
`` Yes . 
Well , these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of the account . 
That is what I do not very well understand . 
How was this deficit possible ? '' 
`` Possible I do not say ; but there is no doubt about fact that it is really so . '' 
`` You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts ? '' 
`` I do not say so , but the registry does . '' 
`` And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and the name of the person with whom it was deposited ? '' 
`` As your majesty can judge for yourself . '' 
`` Yes ; and the result is , then , that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the thirteen millions . '' 
`` That results from the accounts , certainly , sire . '' 
`` Well , and , consequently -- '' `` Well , sire , in that case , inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back the thirteen millions , he must have appropriated them to his own purpose ; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little more as much expense , and make four times as great a display , as your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau , where we only spent three millions altogether , if you remember . '' 
For a blunderer , the souvenir he had evoked was a rather skillfully contrived piece of baseness ; for by the remembrance of his own fete he , for the first time , perceived its inferiority compared with that of Fouquet . 
Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him at Fontainebleau , and , as a good financier , returned it with the best possible interest . 
Having once disposed the king 's mind in this artful way , Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him . 
He felt that such was the case , for the king , too , had again sunk into a dull and gloomy state . 
Colbert awaited the first words from the king 's lips with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of observation . 
`` Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
said the king , after a few moments ' reflection . 
`` No , sire , I do not know . '' 
`` Well , then , the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions , if it can be proved -- '' `` But it is so already . '' 
`` I mean if it were to be declared and certified , M. Colbert . '' 
`` I think it will be to-morrow , if your majesty -- '' `` Were we not under M. Fouquet 's roof , you were going to say , perhaps , '' replied the king , with something of nobility in his demeanor . 
`` The king is in his own palace wherever he may be -- especially in houses which the royal money has constructed . '' 
`` I think , '' said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis , `` that the architect who planned this dome ought , anticipating the use it could be put to at a future opportunity , so to have contrived that it might be made to fall upon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert . '' 
`` I think so too , '' replied Aramis ; `` but M. Colbert is so very near the king at this moment . '' 
`` That is true , and that would open the succession . '' 
`` Of which your younger brother would reap all the advantage , monseigneur . 
But stay , let us keep quiet , and go on listening . '' 
`` We shall not have long to listen , '' said the young prince . 
`` Why not , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Because , if I were king , I should make no further reply . '' 
`` And what would you do ? '' 
`` I should wait until to-morrow morning to give myself time for reflection . '' 
Louis XIV . 
at last raised his eyes , and finding Colbert attentively waiting for his next remarks , said , hastily , changing the conversation , `` M. Colbert , I perceive it is getting very late , and I shall now retire to bed . 
By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind . '' 
`` Very good , sire , '' returned Colbert , greatly incensed , although he restrained himself in the presence of the king . 
The king made a gesture of adieu , and Colbert withdrew with a respectful bow . 
`` My attendants ! '' 
cried the king ; and , as they entered the apartment , Philippe was about to quit his post of observation . 
`` A moment longer , '' said Aramis to him , with his accustomed gentleness of manner ; `` what has just now taken place is only a detail , and to-morrow we shall have no occasion to think anything more about it ; but the ceremony of the king 's retiring to rest , the etiquette observed in addressing the king , that indeed is of the greatest importance . 
Learn , sire , and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night . 
Look ! 
look ! '' 
History will tell us , or rather history has told us , of the various events of the following day , of the splendid fetes given by the surintendant to his sovereign . 
Nothing but amusement and delight was allowed to prevail throughout the whole of the following day ; there was a promenade , a banquet , a comedy to be acted , and a comedy , too , in which , to his great amazement , Porthos recognized `` M. Coquelin de Voliere '' as one of the actors , in the piece called `` Les Facheux . '' 
Full of preoccupation , however , from the scene of the previous evening , and hardly recovered from the effects of the poison which Colbert had then administered to him , the king , during the whole of the day , so brilliant in its effects , so full of unexpected and startling novelties , in which all the wonders of the `` Arabian Night 's Entertainments '' seemed to be reproduced for his especial amusement -- the king , we say , showed himself cold , reserved , and taciturn . 
Nothing could smooth the frowns upon his face ; every one who observed him noticed that a deep feeling of resentment , of remote origin , increased by slow degrees , as the source becomes a river , thanks to the thousand threads of water that increase its body , was keenly alive in the depths of the king 's heart . 
Towards the middle of the day only did he begin to resume a little serenity of manner , and by that time he had , in all probability , made up his mind . 
Aramis , who followed him step by step in his thoughts , as in his walk , concluded that the event he was expecting would not be long before it was announced . 
This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the bishop of Vannes , and had he received for every annoyance which he inflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis , he could not have done better . 
During the whole of the day the king , who , in all probability , wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which disturbed his mind , seemed to seek La Valliere 's society as actively as he seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet . 
The evening came . 
The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park until after cards in the evening . 
In the interval between supper and the promenade , cards and dice were introduced . 
The king won a thousand pistoles , and , having won them , put them in his pocket , and then rose , saying , `` And now , gentlemen , to the park . '' 
He found the ladies of the court were already there . 
The king , we have before observed , had won a thousand pistoles , and had put them in his pocket ; but M. Fouquet had somehow contrived to lose ten thousand , so that among the courtiers there was still left a hundred and ninety thousand francs ' profit to divide , a circumstance which made the countenances of the courtiers and the officers of the king 's household the most joyous countenances in the world . 
It was not the same , however , with the king 's face ; for , notwithstanding his success at play , to which he was by no means insensible , there still remained a slight shade of dissatisfaction . 
Colbert was waiting for or upon him at the corner of one of the avenues ; he was most probably waiting there in consequence of a rendezvous which had been given him by the king , as Louis XIV. , who had avoided him , or who had seemed to avoid him , suddenly made him a sign , and they then struck into the depths of the park together . 
But La Valliere , too , had observed the king 's gloomy aspect and kindling glances ; she had remarked this -- and as nothing which lay hidden or smoldering in his heart was hidden from the gaze of her affection , she understood that this repressed wrath menaced some one ; she prepared to withstand the current of his vengeance , and intercede like an angel of mercy . 
Overcome by sadness , nervously agitated , deeply distressed at having been so long separated from her lover , disturbed at the sight of the emotion she had divined , she accordingly presented herself to the king with an embarrassed aspect , which in his then disposition of mind the king interpreted unfavorably . 
Then , as they were alone -- nearly alone , inasmuch as Colbert , as soon as he perceived the young girl approaching , had stopped and drawn back a dozen paces -- the king advanced towards La Valliere and took her by the hand . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he said to her , `` should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you were indisposed ? 
for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some secret cause of uneasiness , and your eyes are filled with tears . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sire , if I be indeed so , and if my eyes are indeed full of tears , I am sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty . '' 
`` My sadness ? 
You are mistaken , mademoiselle ; no , it is not sadness I experience . '' 
`` What is it , then , sire ? '' 
`` Humiliation . '' 
`` Humiliation ? 
oh ! 
sire , what a word for you to use ! '' 
`` I mean , mademoiselle , that wherever I may happen to be , no one else ought to be the master . 
Well , then , look round you on every side , and judge whether I am not eclipsed -- I , the king of France -- before the monarch of these wide domains . 
Oh ! '' 
he continued , clenching his hands and teeth , `` when I think that this king -- '' `` Well , sire ? '' 
said Louise , terrified . '' 
-- That this king is a faithless , unworthy servant , who grows proud and self-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me , and which he has stolen . 
And therefore I am about to change this impudent minister 's fete into sorrow and mourning , of which the nymph of Vaux , as the poets say , shall not soon lose the remembrance . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your majesty -- '' `` Well , mademoiselle , are you about to take M. Fouquet 's part ? '' 
said Louis , impatiently . 
`` No , sire ; I will only ask whether you are well informed . 
Your majesty has more than once learned the value of accusations made at court . '' 
Louis XIV . 
made a sign for Colbert to approach . 
`` Speak , Monsieur Colbert , '' said the young prince , `` for I almost believe that Mademoiselle de la Valliere has need of your assistance before she can put any faith in the king 's word . 
Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done ; and you , mademoiselle , will perhaps have the kindness to listen . 
It will not be long . '' 
Why did Louis XIV . 
insist upon it in such a manner ? 
A very simple reason -- his heart was not at rest , his mind was not thoroughly convinced ; he imagined there lay some dark , hidden , tortuous intrigue behind these thirteen millions of francs ; and he wished that the pure heart of La Valliere , which had revolted at the idea of theft or robbery , should approve -- even were it only by a single word -- the resolution he had taken , and which , nevertheless , he hesitated before carrying into execution . 
`` Speak , monsieur , '' said La Valliere to Colbert , who had advanced ; `` speak , since the king wishes me to listen to you . 
Tell me , what is the crime with which M. Fouquet is charged ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
not very heinous , mademoiselle , '' he returned , `` a mere abuse of confidence . '' 
`` Speak , speak , Colbert ; and when you have related it , leave us , and go and inform M. d'Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him . '' 
`` M. d'Artagnan , sire ! '' 
exclaimed La Valliere ; `` but why send for M. d'Artagnan ? 
I entreat you to tell me . '' '' 
Pardieu ! 
in order to arrest this haughty , arrogant Titan who , true to his menace , threatens to scale my heaven . '' 
`` Arrest M. Fouquet , do you say ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
does that surprise you ? '' 
`` In his own house ! '' 
`` Why not ? 
If he be guilty , he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere else . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign . '' 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , it seems as if you were defending this traitor . '' 
Colbert began to chuckle silently . 
The king turned round at the sound of this suppressed mirth . 
`` Sire , '' said La Valliere , `` it is not M. Fouquet I am defending ; it is yourself . '' 
`` Me ! 
you are defending me ? '' 
`` Sire , you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order . '' 
`` Dishonor myself ! '' 
murmured the king , turning pale with anger . 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , you show a strange persistence in what you say . '' 
`` If I do , sire , my only motive is that of serving your majesty , '' replied the noble-hearted girl : `` for that I would risk , I would sacrifice my very life , without the least reserve . '' 
Colbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain . 
La Valliere , that timid , gentle lamb , turned round upon him , and with a glance like lightning imposed silence upon him . 
`` Monsieur , '' she said , `` when the king acts well , whether , in doing so , he does either myself or those who belong to me an injury , I have nothing to say ; but were the king to confer a benefit either upon me or mine , and if he acted badly , I should tell him so . '' 
`` But it appears to me , mademoiselle , '' Colbert ventured to say , `` that I too love the king . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , we both love him , but each in a different manner , '' replied La Valliere , with such an accent that the heart of the young king was powerfully affected by it . 
`` I love him so deeply , that the whole world is aware of it ; so purely , that the king himself does not doubt my affection . 
He is my king and my master ; I am the least of all his servants . 
But whoso touches his honor assails my life . 
Therefore , I repeat , that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet under his own roof . '' 
Colbert hung down his head , for he felt that the king had abandoned him . 
However , as he bent his head , he murmured , `` Mademoiselle , I have only one word to say . '' 
`` Do not say it , then , monsieur ; for I would not listen to it . 
Besides , what could you have to tell me ? 
That M. Fouquet has been guilty of certain crimes ? 
I believe he has , because the king has said so ; and , from the moment the king said , ' I think so , ' I have no occasion for other lips to say , ' I affirm it . ' 
But , were M. Fouquet the vilest of men , I should say aloud , 'M . 
Fouquet 's person is sacred to the king because he is the guest of M. Fouquet . 
Were his house a den of thieves , were Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers , his home is sacred , his palace is inviolable , since his wife is living in it ; and that is an asylum which even executioners would not dare to violate . ' '' 
La Valliere paused , and was silent . 
In spite of himself the king could not but admire her ; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her voice ; by the nobleness of the cause she advocated . 
Colbert yielded , overcome by the inequality of the struggle . 
At last the king breathed again more freely , shook his head , and held out his hand to La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he said , gently , `` why do you decide against me ? 
Do you know what this wretched fellow will do , if I give him time to breathe again ? '' 
`` Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp ? '' 
`` Should he escape , and take to flight ? '' 
exclaimed Colbert . 
`` Well , monsieur , it will always remain on record , to the king 's eternal honor , that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee ; and the more guilty he may have been , the greater will the king 's honor and glory appear , compared with such unnecessary misery and shame . '' 
Louis kissed La Valliere 's hand , as he knelt before her . 
`` I am lost , '' thought Colbert ; then suddenly his face brightened up again . 
`` Oh ! 
no , no , aha , old fox ! 
-- not yet , '' he said to himself . 
And while the king , protected from observation by the thick covert of an enormous lime , pressed La Valliere to his breast , with all the ardor of ineffable affection , Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his pocket-book and drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter , somewhat yellow , perhaps , but one that must have been most precious , since the intendant smiled as he looked at it ; he then bent a look , full of hatred , upon the charming group which the young girl and the king formed together -- a group revealed but for a moment , as the light of the approaching torches shone upon it . 
Louis noticed the light reflected upon La Valliere 's white dress . 
`` Leave me , Louise , '' he said , `` for some one is coming . '' 
`` Mademoiselle , mademoiselle , some one is coming , '' cried Colbert , to expedite the young girl 's departure . 
Louise disappeared rapidly among the trees ; and then , as the king , who had been on his knees before the young girl , was rising from his humble posture , Colbert exclaimed , `` Ah ! 
Mademoiselle de la Valliere has let something fall . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
inquired the king . 
`` A paper -- a letter -- something white ; look there , sire . '' 
The king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter , crumpling it in his hand , as he did so ; and at the same moment the torches arrived , inundating the blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as day . 
The torches we have just referred to , the eager attention every one displayed , and the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet , arrived in time to suspend the effect of a resolution which La Valliere had already considerably shaken in Louis XIV . 
's heart . 
He looked at Fouquet with a feeling almost of gratitude for having given La Valliere an opportunity of showing herself so generously disposed , so powerful in the influence she exercised over his heart . 
The moment of the last and greatest display had arrived . 
Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king towards the chateau , when a mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux , with a prodigious uproar , pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on every side , and illumining the remotest corners of the gardens . 
The fireworks began . 
Colbert , at twenty paces from the king , who was surrounded and feted by the owner of Vaux , seemed , by the obstinate persistence of his gloomy thoughts , to do his utmost to recall Louis 's attention , which the magnificence of the spectacle was already , in his opinion , too easily diverting . 
Suddenly , just as Louis was on the point of holding it out to Fouquet , he perceived in his hand the paper which , as he believed , La Valliere had dropped at his feet as she hurried away . 
The still stronger magnet of love drew the young prince 's attention towards the souvenir of his idol ; and , by the brilliant light , which increased momentarily in beauty , and drew from the neighboring villages loud cheers of admiration , the king read the letter , which he supposed was a loving and tender epistle La Valliere had destined for him . 
But as he read it , a death-like pallor stole over his face , and an expression of deep-seated wrath , illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed so brightly , soaringly around the scene , produced a terrible spectacle , which every one would have shuddered at , could they only have read into his heart , now torn by the most stormy and most bitter passions . 
There was no truce for him now , influenced as he was by jealousy and mad passion . 
From the very moment when the dark truth was revealed to him , every gentler feeling seemed to disappear ; pity , kindness of consideration , the religion of hospitality , all were forgotten . 
In the bitter pang which wrung his heart , he , still too weak to hide his sufferings , was almost on the point of uttering a cry of alarm , and calling his guards to gather round him . 
This letter which Colbert had thrown down at the king 's feet , the reader has doubtlessly guessed , was the same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau , after the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Valliere 's heart . 
Fouquet saw the king 's pallor , and was far from guessing the evil ; Colbert saw the king 's anger , and rejoiced inwardly at the approach of the storm . 
Fouquet 's voice drew the young prince from his wrathful reverie . 
`` What is the matter , sire ? '' 
inquired the superintendent , with an expression of graceful interest . 
Louis made a violent effort over himself , as he replied , `` Nothing . '' 
`` I am afraid your majesty is suffering ? '' 
`` I am suffering , and have already told you so , monsieur ; but it is nothing . '' 
And the king , without waiting for the termination of the fireworks , turned towards the chateau . 
Fouquet accompanied him , and the whole court followed , leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own amusement . 
The superintendent endeavored again to question Louis XIV. , but did not succeed in obtaining a reply . 
He imagined there had been some misunderstanding between Louis and La Valliere in the park , which had resulted in a slight quarrel ; and that the king , who was not ordinarily sulky by disposition , but completely absorbed by his passion for La Valliere , had taken a dislike to every one because his mistress had shown herself offended with him . 
This idea was sufficient to console him ; he had even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king , when the latter wished him good night . 
This , however , was not all the king had to submit to ; he was obliged to undergo the usual ceremony , which on that evening was marked by close adherence to the strictest etiquette . 
The next day was the one fixed for the departure ; it was but proper that the guests should thank their host , and show him a little attention in return for the expenditure of his twelve millions . 
The only remark , approaching to amiability , which the king could find to say to M. Fouquet , as he took leave of him , were in these words , `` M. Fouquet , you shall hear from me . 
Be good enough to desire M. d'Artagnan to come here . '' 
But the blood of Louis XIV. , who had so profoundly dissimulated his feelings , boiled in his veins ; and he was perfectly willing to order M. Fouquet to be put an end to with the same readiness , indeed , as his predecessor had caused the assassination of le Marechal d'Ancre ; and so he disguised the terrible resolution he had formed beneath one of those royal smiles which , like lightning-flashes , indicated coups d'etat . 
Fouquet took the king 's hand and kissed it ; Louis shuddered throughout his whole frame , but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his hand with his lips . 
Five minutes afterwards , D'Artagnan , to whom the royal order had been communicated , entered Louis XIV . 
's apartment . 
Aramis and Philippe were in theirs , still eagerly attentive , and still listening with all their ears . 
The king did not even give the captain of the musketeers time to approach his armchair , but ran forward to meet him . 
`` Take care , '' he exclaimed , `` that no one enters here . '' 
`` Very good , sire , '' replied the captain , whose glance had for a long time past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance . 
He gave the necessary order at the door ; but , returning to the king , he said , `` Is there something fresh the matter , your majesty ? '' 
`` How many men have you here ? '' 
inquired the king , without making any other reply to the question addressed to him . 
`` What for , sire ? '' 
`` How many men have you , I say ? '' 
repeated the king , stamping upon the ground with his foot . 
`` I have the musketeers . '' 
`` Well ; and what others ? '' 
`` Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss . '' 
`` How many men will be required to -- '' `` To do what , sire ? '' 
replied the musketeer , opening his large , calm eyes . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan fell back a step . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet ! '' 
he burst forth . 
`` Are you going to tell me that it is impossible ? '' 
exclaimed the king , in tones of cold , vindictive passion . 
`` I never say that anything is impossible , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the quick . 
`` Very well ; do it , then . '' 
D'Artagnan turned on his heel , and made his way towards the door ; it was but a short distance , and he cleared it in half a dozen paces ; when he reached it he suddenly paused , and said , `` Your majesty will forgive me , but , in order to effect this arrest , I should like written directions . '' 
`` For what purpose -- and since when has the king 's word been insufficient for you ? '' 
`` Because the word of a king , when it springs from a feeling of anger , may possibly change when the feeling changes . '' 
`` A truce to set phrases , monsieur ; you have another thought besides that ? '' 
`` Oh , I , at least , have certain thoughts and ideas , which , unfortunately , others have not , '' D'Artagnan replied , impertinently . 
The king , in the tempest of his wrath , hesitated , and drew back in the face of D'Artagnan 's frank courage , just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider . 
`` What is your thought ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan : `` you cause a man to be arrested when you are still under his roof ; and passion is alone the cause of that . 
When your anger shall have passed , you will regret what you have done ; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature . 
If that , however , should fail to be a reparation , it will at least show us that the king was wrong to lose his temper . '' 
`` Wrong to lose his temper ! '' 
cried the king , in a loud , passionate voice . 
`` Did not my father , my grandfathers , too , before me , lose their temper at times , in Heaven 's name ? '' 
`` The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their temper except when under the protection of their own palace . '' 
`` The king is master wherever he may be . '' 
`` That is a flattering , complimentary phrase which can not proceed from any one but M. Colbert ; but it happens not to be the truth . 
The king is at home in every man 's house when he has driven its owner out of it . '' 
The king bit his lips , but said nothing . 
`` Can it be possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan ; `` here is a man who is positively ruining himself in order to please you , and you wish to have him arrested ! 
Mordioux ! 
Sire , if my name was Fouquet , and people treated me in that manner , I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of fireworks and other things , and I would set fire to them , and send myself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky . 
But it is all the same ; it is your wish , and it shall be done . '' 
`` Go , '' said the king ; `` but have you men enough ? '' 
`` Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me ? 
Arrest M. Fouquet ! 
why , that is so easy that a very child might do it ! 
It is like drinking a glass of wormwood ; one makes an ugly face , and that is all . '' 
`` If he defends himself ? '' 
`` He ! 
it is not at all likely . 
Defend himself when such extreme harshness as you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr ! 
Nay , I am sure that if he has a million of francs left , which I very much doubt , he would be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination as this . 
But what does that matter ? 
it shall be done at once . '' 
`` Stay , '' said the king ; `` do not make his arrest a public affair . '' 
`` That will be more difficult . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of a thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him , and say , ` In the king 's name , I arrest you . ' 
But to go up to him , to turn him first one way and then another , to drive him up into one of the corners of the chess-board , in such a way that he can not escape ; to take him away from his guests , and keep him a prisoner for you , without one of them , alas ! 
having heard anything about it ; that , indeed , is a genuine difficulty , the greatest of all , in truth ; and I hardly see how it is to be done . '' 
`` You had better say it is impossible , and you will have finished much sooner . 
Heaven help me , but I seem to be surrounded by people who prevent me doing what I wish . '' 
`` I do not prevent your doing anything . 
Have you indeed decided ? '' 
`` Take care of M. Fouquet , until I shall have made up my mind by to-morrow morning . '' 
`` That shall be done , sire . '' 
`` And return , when I rise in the morning , for further orders ; and now leave me to myself . '' 
`` You do not even want M. Colbert , then ? '' 
said the musketeer , firing his last shot as he was leaving the room . 
The king started . 
With his whole mind fixed on the thought of revenge , he had forgotten the cause and substance of the offense . 
`` No , no one , '' he said ; `` no one here ! 
Leave me . '' 
D'Artagnan quitted the room . 
The king closed the door with his own hands , and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace , like a wounded bull in an arena , trailing from his horn the colored streamers and the iron darts . 
At last he began to take comfort in the expression of his violent feelings . 
`` Miserable wretch that he is ! 
not only does he squander my finances , but with his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries , friends , generals , artists , and all , and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most attached . 
This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took his part ! 
Gratitude ! 
and who can tell whether it was not a stronger feeling -- love itself ? '' 
He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest reflections . 
`` A satyr ! '' 
he thought , with that abhorrent hate with which young men regard those more advanced in life , who still think of love . 
`` A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one , who lavishes his gold and jewels in every direction , and who retains his staff of painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses in the costume of goddesses . '' 
The king trembled with passion as he continued , `` He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs to me ! 
He destroys everything that is mine . 
He will be my death at last , I know . 
That man is too much for me ; he is my mortal enemy , but he shall forthwith fall ! 
I hate him -- I hate him -- I hate him ! '' 
and as he pronounced these words , he struck the arm of the chair in which he was sitting violently , over and over again , and then rose like one in an epileptic fit . 
`` To-morrow ! 
to-morrow ! 
oh , happy day ! '' 
he murmured , `` when the sun rises , no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess but me . 
That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject ruin my anger shall have wrought , they will be forced to confess at last and at least that I am indeed greater than he . '' 
The king , who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer , knocked over with a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside , and in the very bitterness of anger , almost weeping , and half-suffocated , he threw himself on his bed , dressed as he was , and bit the sheets in his extremity of passion , trying to find repose of body at least there . 
The bed creaked beneath his weight , and with the exception of a few broken sounds , emerging , or , one might say , exploding , from his overburdened chest , absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus . 
The ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and at the perusal of Fouquet 's letter to La Valliere by degrees subsided into a feeling of pain and extreme weariness . 
Youth , invigorated by health and lightness of spirits , requiring soon that what it loses should be immediately restored -- youth knows not those endless , sleepless nights which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly feeding on Prometheus . 
In cases where the man of middle life , in his acquired strength of will and purpose , and the old , in their state of natural exhaustion , find incessant augmentation of their bitter sorrow , a young man , surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune , weakens himself in sighs , and groans , and tears , directly struggling with his grief , and is thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with whom he is engaged . 
Once overthrown , his struggles cease . 
Louis could not hold out more than a few minutes , at the end of which he had ceased to clench his hands , and scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible objects of his hatred ; he soon ceased to attack with his violent imprecations not M. Fouquet alone , but even La Valliere herself ; from fury he subsided into despair , and from despair to prostration . 
After he had thrown himself for a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his bed , his nerveless arms fell quietly down ; his head lay languidly on his pillow ; his limbs , exhausted with excessive emotion , still trembled occasionally , agitated by muscular contractions ; while from his breast faint and infrequent sighs still issued . 
Morpheus , the tutelary deity of the apartment , towards whom Louis raised his eyes , wearied by his anger and reconciled by his tears , showered down upon him the sleep-inducing poppies with which his hands are ever filled ; so presently the monarch closed his eyes and fell asleep . 
Then it seemed to him , as it often happens in that first sleep , so light and gentle , which raises the body above the couch , and the soul above the earth -- it seemed to him , we say , as if the god Morpheus , painted on the ceiling , looked at him with eyes resembling human eyes ; that something shone brightly , and moved to and fro in the dome above the sleeper ; that the crowd of terrible dreams which thronged together in his brain , and which were interrupted for a moment , half revealed a human face , with a hand resting against the mouth , and in an attitude of deep and absorbed meditation . 
And strange enough , too , this man bore so wonderful a resemblance to the king himself , that Louis fancied he was looking at his own face reflected in a mirror ; with the exception , however , that the face was saddened by a feeling of the profoundest pity . 
Then it seemed to him as if the dome gradually retired , escaping from his gaze , and that the figures and attributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance became more and more remote . 
A gentle , easy movement , as regular as that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves , had succeeded to the immovableness of the bed . 
Doubtless the king was dreaming , and in this dream the crown of gold , which fastened the curtains together , seemed to recede from his vision , just as the dome , to which it remained suspended , had done , so that the winged genius which , with both its hand , supported the crown , seemed , though vainly so , to call upon the king , who was fast disappearing from it . 
The bed still sunk . 
Louis , with his eyes open , could not resist the deception of this cruel hallucination .
