The Indian had begun already , by often irritating him , and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter , to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature , this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle . 
Happily , however , for Mr. Fogg , the animal 's instruction in this direction had not gone far , and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness . 
Kiouni -- this was the name of the beast -- could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time , and , in default of any other means of conveyance , Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him . 
But elephants are far from cheap in India , where they are becoming scarce , the males , which alone are suitable for circus shows , are much sought , especially as but few of them are domesticated . 
When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni , he refused point-blank . 
Mr. Fogg persisted , offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad . 
Refused . 
Twenty pounds ? 
Refused also . 
Forty pounds ? 
Still refused . 
Passepartout jumped at each advance ; but the Indian declined to be tempted . 
Yet the offer was an alluring one , for , supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad , his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling . 
Phileas Fogg , without getting in the least flurried , then proposed to purchase the animal outright , and at first offered a thousand pounds for him . 
The Indian , perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain , still refused . 
Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . 
Returning to the Indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain . 
Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds . 
Passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense . 
At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded . 
`` What a price , good heavens ! '' 
cried Passepartout , `` for an elephant . '' 
It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy . 
A young Parsee , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which Mr. Fogg accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal . 
The elephant was led out and equipped . 
The Parsee , who was an accomplished elephant driver , covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth , and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs . 
Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag , a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals . 
Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad , which the brigadier gratefully accepted , as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast . 
Provisions were purchased at Kholby , and , while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side , Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them . 
The Parsee perched himself on the elephant 's neck , and at nine o'clock they set out from the village , the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut . 
In order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built . 
This line , owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains , did not pursue a straight course . 
The Parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them , were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant , spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee ; but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm , talking little , and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other . 
As for Passepartout , who was mounted on the beast 's back , and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along , he was very careful , in accordance with his master 's advice , to keep his tongue from between his teeth , as it would otherwise have been bitten off short . 
The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant 's neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board ; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in Kiouni 's trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot . 
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which Kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . 
Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . 
`` Why , he 's made of iron ! '' 
exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on Kiouni . 
`` Of forged iron , '' replied Passepartout , as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast . 
At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure . 
The country soon presented a very savage aspect . 
Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests ; then vast , dry plains , dotted with scanty shrubs , and sown with great blocks of syenite . 
All this portion of Bundelcund , which is little frequented by travellers , is inhabited by a fanatical population , hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith . 
The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory , which is subjected to the influence of rajahs , whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses . 
The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians , who , when they perceived the elephant striding across-country , made angry and threatening motions . 
The Parsee avoided them as much as possible . 
Few animals were observed on the route ; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter . 
In the midst of his gaiety , however , one thought troubled the worthy servant . 
What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad ? 
Would he carry him on with him ? 
Impossible ! 
The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive . 
Would he sell him , or set him free ? 
The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration . 
Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him , Passepartout , a present of Kiouni , he would be very much embarrassed ; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time . 
The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined bungalow . 
They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad . 
The night was cold . 
The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . 
The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . 
The guide watched Kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . 
Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . 
Sir Francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . 
Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . 
As for Mr. Fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row . 
The journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening . 
In that case , Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . 
Kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the Vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger , on the Cani , one of the branches of the Ganges . 
The guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . 
Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east . 
They stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated . 
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles ; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods . 
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters , and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished , when the elephant , becoming restless , suddenly stopped . 
It was then four o'clock . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
asked Sir Francis , putting out his head . 
`` I do n't know , officer , '' replied the Parsee , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches . 
The murmur soon became more distinct ; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments . 
Passepartout was all eyes and ears . 
Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word . 
The Parsee jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket . 
He soon returned , saying : `` A procession of Brahmins is coming this way . 
We must prevent their seeing us , if possible . '' 
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . 
He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed . 
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer , and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals . 
The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees , a hundred paces away ; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches . 
First came the priests , with mitres on their heads , and clothed in long lace robes . 
They were surrounded by men , women , and children , who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm , interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals ; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels , the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other . 
Upon the car , which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus , stood a hideous statue with four arms , the body coloured a dull red , with haggard eyes , dishevelled hair , protruding tongue , and lips tinted with betel . 
It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant . 
Sir Francis , recognising the statue , whispered , `` The goddess Kali ; the goddess of love and death . '' 
`` Of death , perhaps , '' muttered back Passepartout , `` but of love -- that ugly old hag ? 
Never ! '' 
The Parsee made a motion to keep silence . 
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great Indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut . 
Some Brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . 
This woman was young , and as fair as a European . 
Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form . 
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin . 
It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince . 
Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments ; these closed the procession . 
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , `` A suttee . '' 
The Parsee nodded , and put his finger to his lips . 
The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood . 
The songs gradually died away ; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again . 
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked : `` What is a suttee ? '' 
`` A suttee , '' returned the general , `` is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one . 
The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day . '' 
`` Oh , the scoundrels ! '' 
cried Passepartout , who could not repress his indignation . 
`` And the corpse ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` Is that of the prince , her husband , '' said the guide ; `` an independent rajah of Bundelcund . '' 
`` Is it possible , '' resumed Phileas Fogg , his voice betraying not the least emotion , `` that these barbarous customs still exist in India , and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them ? '' 
`` These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India , '' replied Sir Francis ; `` but we have no power over these savage territories , and especially here in Bundelcund . 
The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage . '' 
`` The poor wretch ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , `` to be burned alive ! '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Sir Francis , `` burned alive . 
And , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . 
They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . 
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . 
Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it . 
Several years ago , when I was living at Bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . 
The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose . '' 
While Sir Francis was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said : `` The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund . '' 
`` But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance , '' observed Sir Francis . 
`` That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium . '' 
`` But where are they taking her ? '' 
`` To the pagoda of Pillaji , two miles from here ; she will pass the night there . '' 
`` And the sacrifice will take place -- '' `` To-morrow , at the first light of dawn . '' 
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck . 
Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , Mr. Fogg stopped him , and , turning to Sir Francis Cromarty , said , `` Suppose we save this woman . '' 
`` Save the woman , Mr. Fogg ! '' 
`` I have yet twelve hours to spare ; I can devote them to that . '' 
`` Why , you are a man of heart ! '' 
`` Sometimes , '' replied Phileas Fogg , quietly ; `` when I have the time . '' 
The project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable . 
Mr. Fogg was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour . 
But he did not hesitate , and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally . 
As for Passepartout , he was ready for anything that might be proposed . 
His master 's idea charmed him ; he perceived a heart , a soul , under that icy exterior . 
He began to love Phileas Fogg . 
There remained the guide : what course would he adopt ? 
Would he not take part with the Indians ? 
In default of his assistance , it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality . 
Sir Francis frankly put the question to him . 
`` Officers , '' replied the guide , `` I am a Parsee , and this woman is a Parsee . 
Command me as you will . '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
said Mr. Fogg . 
`` However , '' resumed the guide , `` it is certain , not only that we shall risk our lives , but horrible tortures , if we are taken . '' 
`` That is foreseen , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` I think we must wait till night before acting . '' 
`` I think so , '' said the guide . 
The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant . 
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an European . 
Her name was Aouda . 
Left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape . 
The Parsee 's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design . 
It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible . 
They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly . 
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim . 
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned . 
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ? 
This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves ; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night , and not when , at break of day , the victim was led to her funeral pyre . 
Then no human intervention could save her . 
As soon as night fell , about six o'clock , they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda . 
The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing ; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp , and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself . 
The Parsee , leading the others , noiselessly crept through the wood , and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream , whence , by the light of the rosin torches , they perceived a pyre of wood , on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah , which was to be burned with his wife . 
The pagoda , whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk , stood a hundred steps away . 
`` Come ! '' 
whispered the guide . 
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush , followed by his companions ; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches . 
Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade , which was lit up by the torches . 
The ground was covered by groups of the Indians , motionless in their drunken sleep ; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead . 
Men , women , and children lay together . 
In the background , among the trees , the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly . 
Much to the guide 's disappointment , the guards of the rajah , lighted by torches , were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres ; probably the priests , too , were watching within . 
The Parsee , now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple , advanced no farther , but led his companions back again . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction . 
They stopped , and engaged in a whispered colloquy . 
`` It is only eight now , '' said the brigadier , `` and these guards may also go to sleep . '' 
`` It is not impossible , '' returned the Parsee . 
They lay down at the foot of a tree , and waited . 
The time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda . 
They waited till midnight ; but no change took place among the guards , and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on . 
The other plan must be carried out ; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made . 
It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door . 
After a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others . 
They took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear . 
They reached the walls about half-past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors . 
The night was dark . 
The moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness . 
It was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives . 
Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty ; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily . 
They set noiselessly to work , and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . 
They were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . 
Passepartout and the guide stopped . 
Had they been heard ? 
Was the alarm being given ? 
Common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis . 
They again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . 
But , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise . 
It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work . 
They could not now reach the victim ; how , then , could they save her ? 
Sir Francis shook his fists , Passepartout was beside himself , and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage . 
The tranquil Fogg waited , without betraying any emotion . 
`` We have nothing to do but to go away , '' whispered Sir Francis . 
`` Nothing but to go away , '' echoed the guide . 
`` Stop , '' said Fogg . 
`` I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon . '' 
`` But what can you hope to do ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` In a few hours it will be daylight , and -- '' `` The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment . '' 
Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg 's eyes . 
What was this cool Englishman thinking of ? 
Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice , and boldly snatch her from her executioners ? 
This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool . 
Sir Francis consented , however , to remain to the end of this terrible drama . 
The guide led them to the rear of the glade , where they were able to observe the sleeping groups . 
Meanwhile Passepartout , who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree , was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash , and which was now firmly lodged in his brain . 
He had commenced by saying to himself , `` What folly ! '' 
and then he repeated , `` Why not , after all ? 
It 's a chance , -- perhaps the only one ; and with such sots ! '' 
Thinking thus , he slipped , with the suppleness of a serpent , to the lowest branches , the ends of which bent almost to the ground . 
The hours passed , and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day , though it was not yet light . 
This was the moment . 
The slumbering multitude became animated , the tambourines sounded , songs and cries arose ; the hour of the sacrifice had come . 
The doors of the pagoda swung open , and a bright light escaped from its interior , in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim . 
She seemed , having shaken off the stupor of intoxication , to be striving to escape from her executioner . 
Sir Francis 's heart throbbed ; and , convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg 's hand , found in it an open knife . 
Just at this moment the crowd began to move . 
The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp , and passed among the fakirs , who escorted her with their wild , religious cries . 
Phileas Fogg and his companions , mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd , followed ; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream , and stopped fifty paces from the pyre , upon which still lay the rajah 's corpse . 
In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim , quite senseless , stretched out beside her husband 's body . 
Then a torch was brought , and the wood , heavily soaked with oil , instantly took fire . 
At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg , who , in an instant of mad generosity , was about to rush upon the pyre . 
But he had quickly pushed them aside , when the whole scene suddenly changed . 
A cry of terror arose . 
The whole multitude prostrated themselves , terror-stricken , on the ground . 
The old rajah was not dead , then , since he rose of a sudden , like a spectre , took up his wife in his arms , and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke , which only heightened his ghostly appearance . 
Fakirs and soldiers and priests , seized with instant terror , lay there , with their faces on the ground , not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy . 
The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her , and which she did not seem in the least to burden . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect , the Parsee bowed his head , and Passepartout was , no doubt , scarcely less stupefied . 
The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg , and , in an abrupt tone , said , `` Let us be off ! '' 
It was Passepartout himself , who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and , profiting by the still overhanging darkness , had delivered the young woman from death ! 
It was Passepartout who , playing his part with a happy audacity , had passed through the crowd amid the general terror . 
A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace . 
But the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg 's hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered . 
The old rajah 's body , indeed , now appeared upon the burning pyre ; and the priests , recovered from their terror , perceived that an abduction had taken place . 
They hastened into the forest , followed by the soldiers , who fired a volley after the fugitives ; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them , and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows . 
The rash exploit had been accomplished ; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success . 
Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow 's hand , and his master said , `` Well done ! '' 
which , from him , was high commendation ; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg . 
As for him , he had only been struck with a `` queer '' idea ; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he , Passepartout , the ex-gymnast , ex-sergeant fireman , had been the spouse of a charming woman , a venerable , embalmed rajah ! 
As for the young Indian woman , she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing , and now , wrapped up in a travelling-blanket , was reposing in one of the howdahs . 
The elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain . 
They made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration . 
The guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off . 
Sir Francis , who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp , reassured his companions on her account . 
But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate . 
He told Phileas Fogg that , should Aouda remain in India , she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners . 
These fanatics were scattered throughout the county , and would , despite the English police , recover their victim at Madras , Bombay , or Calcutta . 
She would only be safe by quitting India for ever . 
Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter . 
The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours . 
Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day , October 25th , at noon , for Hong Kong . 
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station , whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet , a dress , shawl , and some furs ; for which his master gave him unlimited credit . 
Passepartout started off forthwith , and found himself in the streets of Allahabad , that is , the City of God , one of the most venerated in India , being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers , Ganges and Jumna , the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula . 
The Ganges , according to the legends of the Ramayana , rises in heaven , whence , owing to Brahma 's agency , it descends to the earth . 
Passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city . 
It was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison ; its commerce has dwindled away , and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street . 
At last he came upon an elderly , crusty Jew , who sold second-hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter-skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds . 
He then returned triumphantly to the station . 
The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression . 
When the poet-king , Ucaf Uddaul , celebrates the charms of the queen of Ahmehnagara , he speaks thus : `` Her shining tresses , divided in two parts , encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks , brilliant in their glow and freshness . 
Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes . 
Her teeth , fine , equal , and white , glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower 's half-enveloped breast . 
Her delicately formed ears , her vermilion hands , her little feet , curved and tender as the lotus-bud , glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon , the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda . 
Her narrow and supple waist , which a hand may clasp around , sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom , where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures ; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma , the immortal sculptor . '' 
It is enough to say , without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda , that she was a charming woman , in all the European acceptation of the phrase . 
She spoke English with great purity , and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up . 
The train was about to start from Allahabad , and Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished Passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion . 
He had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance . 
Kiouni , also , must be disposed of . 
What should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ? 
Phileas Fogg had already determined this question . 
`` Parsee , '' said he to the guide , `` you have been serviceable and devoted . 
I have paid for your service , but not for your devotion . 
Would you like to have this elephant ? 
He is yours . '' 
The guide 's eyes glistened . 
`` Your honour is giving me a fortune ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Take him , guide , '' returned Mr. Fogg , `` and I shall still be your debtor . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout . 
`` Take him , friend . 
Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast . '' 
And , going up to the elephant , he gave him several lumps of sugar , saying , `` Here , Kiouni , here , here . '' 
The elephant grunted out his satisfaction , and , clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk , lifted him as high as his head . 
Passepartout , not in the least alarmed , caressed the animal , which replaced him gently on the ground . 
Soon after , Phileas Fogg , Sir Francis Cromarty , and Passepartout , installed in a carriage with Aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards Benares . 
It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours . 
During the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses . 
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage , on the railway , dressed in European habiliments , and with travellers who were quite strangers to her ! 
Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor , and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed , dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her , and recounting the happy sequel of the venture , the result of Passepartout 's rash idea . 
Mr. Fogg said nothing ; while Passepartout , abashed , kept repeating that `` it was n't worth telling . '' 
Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers , rather with tears than words ; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips . 
Then , as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice , and recalled the dangers which still menaced her , she shuddered with terror . 
Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda 's mind , and offered , in order to reassure her , to escort her to Hong Kong , where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up -- an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted . 
She had , it seems , a Parsee relation , who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong , which is wholly an English city , though on an island on the Chinese coast . 
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares . 
The Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi , which , like Mahomet 's tomb , was once suspended between heaven and earth ; though the Benares of to-day , which the Orientalists call the Athens of India , stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth , Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts , giving an aspect of desolation to the place , as the train entered it . 
Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty 's destination , the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city . 
He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg , wishing him all success , and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion . 
Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand . 
The parting of Aouda , who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis , betrayed more warmth ; and , as for Passepartout , he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general . 
The railway , on leaving Benares , passed for a while along the valley of the Ganges . 
Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar , with its mountains clothed in verdure , its fields of barley , wheat , and corn , its jungles peopled with green alligators , its neat villages , and its still thickly-leaved forests . 
Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river , and groups of Indians , despite the advanced season and chilly air , were performing solemnly their pious ablutions . 
These were fervent Brahmins , the bitterest foes of Buddhism , their deities being Vishnu , the solar god , Shiva , the divine impersonation of natural forces , and Brahma , the supreme ruler of priests and legislators . 
What would these divinities think of India , anglicised as it is to-day , with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges , frightening the gulls which float upon its surface , the turtles swarming along its banks , and the faithful dwelling upon its borders ? 
The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash , save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view ; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie , twenty miles south-westward from Benares , the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar ; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories ; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis , rising on the left bank of the Ganges ; the fortified town of Buxar , or Patna , a large manufacturing and trading-place , where is held the principal opium market of India ; or Monghir , a more than European town , for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham , with its iron foundries , edgetool factories , and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward . 
Night came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of Bengal , Golconda ruined Gour , Murshedabad , the ancient capital , Burdwan , Hugly , and the French town of Chandernagor , where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness . 
Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning , and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon ; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him . 
According to his journal , he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October , and that was the exact date of his actual arrival . 
He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time . 
The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost , as has been seen , in the journey across India . 
But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them . 
The train entered the station , and Passepartout jumping out first , was followed by Mr. Fogg , who assisted his fair companion to descend . 
Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer , in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage . 
He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground . 
Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him , and said , `` Mr. Phileas Fogg ? '' 
`` I am he . '' 
`` Is this man your servant ? '' 
added the policeman , pointing to Passepartout . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Be so good , both of you , as to follow me . '' 
Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever . 
The policeman was a representative of the law , and law is sacred to an Englishman . 
Passepartout tried to reason about the matter , but the policeman tapped him with his stick , and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey . 
`` May this young lady go with us ? '' 
asked he . 
`` She may , '' replied the policeman . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four-wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . 
No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . 
They first passed through the `` black town , '' with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the `` European town , '' which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth . 
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion . 
The policeman having requested his prisoners -- for so , truly , they might be called -- to descend , conducted them into a room with barred windows , and said : `` You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight . '' 
He then retired , and closed the door . 
`` Why , we are prisoners ! '' 
exclaimed Passepartout , falling into a chair . 
Aouda , with an emotion she tried to conceal , said to Mr. Fogg : `` Sir , you must leave me to my fate ! 
It is on my account that you receive this treatment , it is for having saved me ! '' 
Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible . 
It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee . 
The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge . 
There was some mistake . 
Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon Aouda , but would escort her to Hong Kong . 
`` But the steamer leaves at noon ! '' 
observed Passepartout , nervously . 
`` We shall be on board by noon , '' replied his master , placidly . 
It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself , `` Parbleu that 's certain ! 
Before noon we shall be on board . '' 
But he was by no means reassured . 
At half-past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall . 
It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment . 
Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk . 
Immediately after , Judge Obadiah , a fat , round man , followed by the clerk , entered . 
He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail , and put it hurriedly on his head . 
`` The first case , '' said he . 
Then , putting his hand to his head , he exclaimed , `` Heh ! 
This is not my wig ! '' 
`` No , your worship , '' returned the clerk , `` it is mine . '' 
`` My dear Mr. Oysterpuff , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk 's wig ? '' 
The wigs were exchanged . 
Passepartout was getting nervous , for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity . 
`` The first case , '' repeated Judge Obadiah . 
`` Phileas Fogg ? '' 
demanded Oysterpuff . 
`` I am here , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` Passepartout ? '' 
`` Present , '' responded Passepartout . 
`` Good , '' said the judge . 
`` You have been looked for , prisoners , for two days on the trains from Bombay . '' 
`` But of what are we accused ? '' 
asked Passepartout , impatiently . 
`` You are about to be informed . '' 
`` I am an English subject , sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` and I have the right -- '' `` Have you been ill-treated ? '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Very well ; let the complainants come in . '' 
A door was swung open by order of the judge , and three Indian priests entered . 
`` That 's it , '' muttered Passepartout ; `` these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady . ''
