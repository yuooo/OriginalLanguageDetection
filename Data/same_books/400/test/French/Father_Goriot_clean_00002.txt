The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening . 
This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819 . 
A few days later , after Mme. de Beauseant 's ball , Eugene came in at two o'clock in the morning . 
The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight . 
It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter . 
The spell of a factitious energy was upon him ; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world . 
He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer ; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance , as he had done sometimes on former occasions , after a fete at the Prado , or a ball at the Odeon , splashing his silk stockings thereby , and ruining his pumps . 
It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door ; and Rastignac , coming in at that moment , could go up to his room without making any noise , followed by Christophe , who made a great deal . 
Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers , kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel , and prepared for his night 's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe 's heavy tramp on the stairs . 
Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books . 
He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion , that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . 
And not only so , she was , by right of her fortune , and the name she bore , one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world . 
Thanks to the aunt , thanks to Mme. de Marcillac 's letter of introduction , the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him . 
It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons ; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris , and now all doors were open for him . 
Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly , and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse ; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities , one of those women who are sure to attract a young man 's fancy . 
The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made ; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris . 
Imagine a pair of great dark eyes , a magnificently moulded hand , a shapely foot . 
There was a fiery energy in her movements ; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her `` a thoroughbred , '' `` a pure pedigree , '' these figures of speech have replaced the `` heavenly angel '' and Ossianic nomenclature ; the old mythology of love is extinct , doomed to perish by modern dandyism . 
But for Rastignac , Mme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed . 
He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan , and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille . 
`` Where shall I meet you again , Madame ? '' 
he asked abruptly , and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well . 
`` Oh , everywhere ! '' 
said she , `` in the Bois , at the Bouffons , in my own house . '' 
With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper , he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess , making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him . 
When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant 's , the Countess , whom he took for a great lady , asked him to call at her house , and after her parting smile , Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit . 
He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance , a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period ; the coterie of Maulincourts , Maximes de Trailles , de Marsays , Ronquerolles , Ajuda-Pintos , and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris -- Lady Brandon , the Duchesse de Langeais , the Comtesse de Kergarouet , Mme. de Serizy , the Duchesse de Carigliano , the Comtesse Ferraud , Mme. de Lanty , the Marquise d'Aiglemont , Mme. Firmiani , the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d'Espard , the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus . 
Luckily , therefore , for him , the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau , the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais , a general as simple as a child ; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder . 
Ah , what it is to be young , eager to see the world , greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams , and behold two houses open their doors to you ! 
To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant 's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d'Antin ; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms , conscious that , possessing sufficient good looks , you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart ! 
To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible , and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles . 
He sat there with his thoughts for a while , Law on the one hand , and Poverty on the other , beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull , smouldering fire . 
Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing ? 
who would not have pictured it full of success ? 
His wondering thoughts took wings ; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future ; he was sitting by Mme. de Restaud 's side , when a sort of sigh , like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph , broke the silence of the night . 
It vibrated through the student , who took the sound for a death groan . 
He opened his door noiselessly , went out upon the landing , and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot 's door . 
Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill ; he went over and looked through the keyhole ; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker 's nocturnal industries . 
The table was upturned , and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them ; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape ; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots . '' 
Peste ! 
what a man ! '' 
said Rastignac , as he watched Goriot 's muscular arms ; there was not a sound in the room while the old man , with the aid of the rope , was kneading the silver like dough . 
`` Was he then , indeed , a thief , or a receiver of stolen goods , who affected imbecility and decrepitude , and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely ? '' 
Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions , then he looked again through the keyhole . 
Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope ; he had covered the table with a blanket , and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar , an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity . 
`` Why , he must be as strong as Augustus , King of Poland ! '' 
said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished . 
Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork , tears fell from his eyes , he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver , and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again . 
`` He is mad , '' thought the student . '' 
Poor child ! '' 
Father Goriot said aloud . 
Rastignac , hearing those words , concluded to keep silence ; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor . 
He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears ; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers . 
Eugene listened ; two men there certainly were , he could hear their breathing . 
Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door , no footsteps in the passage . 
Suddenly , too , he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story ; it came from M. Vautrin 's room . 
`` There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house ! '' 
he said to himself . 
He went part of the way downstairs and listened again . 
The rattle of gold reached his ears . 
In another moment the light was put out , and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men , but no sound of a door being opened or shut . 
The two men went downstairs , the faint sounds growing fainter as they went . 
`` Who is there ? '' 
cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window . 
`` I , Mme. Vauquer , '' answered Vautrin 's deep bass voice . 
`` I am coming in . '' 
`` That is odd ! 
Christophe drew the bolts , '' said Eugene , going back to his room . 
`` You have to sit up at night , it seems , if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris . '' 
These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams ; he betook himself to his work , but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot 's suspicious occupation ; Mme. de Restaud 's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future ; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists . 
When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night , the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning . 
Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty . 
The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time ; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather , and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock . 
On this morning it was half-past nine , and Mme. Vauquer still lay abed . 
Christophe was late , Sylvie was late , but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual . 
It was Sylvie 's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders ' breakfast for her own , and to boil the remainder for some time , so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction . 
`` Sylvie , '' said Christophe , as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee , `` M. Vautrin , who is not such a bad sort , all the same , had two people come to see him again last night . 
If madame says anything , mind you say nothing about it . '' 
`` Has he given you something ? '' 
`` He gave me a five-franc piece this month , which is as good as saying , ` Hold your tongue . ' '' 
`` Except him and Mme. Couture , who does n't look twice at every penny , there 's no one in the house that does n't try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year , '' said Sylvie . 
`` And , after all , '' said Christophe , `` what do they give you ? 
A miserable five-franc piece . 
There is Father Goriot , who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past . 
There is that old beggar Poiret , who goes without blacking altogether ; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots . 
Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student , who gives me a couple of francs . 
Two francs will not pay for my brushes , and he sells his old clothes , and gets more for them than they are worth . 
Oh ! 
they 're a shabby lot ! '' 
`` Pooh ! '' 
said Sylvie , sipping her coffee , `` our places are the best in the Quarter , that I know . 
But about that great big chap Vautrin , Christophe ; has any one told you anything about him ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago ; he said to me , ` There 's a gentleman in your place , is n't there ? 
a tall man that dyes his whiskers ? ' 
I told him , ` No , sir ; they are n't dyed . 
A gay fellow like him has n't the time to do it . ' 
And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards , he said , ` Quite right , my boy . 
That is the way to answer them . 
There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known ; it might spoil many a match . ' '' 
`` Well , and for my part , '' said Sylvie , `` a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt . 
Such bosh ! 
There , '' she cried , interrupting herself , `` that 's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace , and not a soul stirring ! '' 
`` Pooh ! 
they are all gone out . 
Mme. Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne . 
Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel , and the student wo n't be back from his lecture till ten o'clock . 
I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs ; Father Goriot knocked up against me , and his parcel was as hard as iron . 
What is the old fellow up to , I wonder ? 
He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them ; they can never let him alone ; but he is a good man , all the same , and worth more than all of them put together . 
He does n't give you much himself , but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips ; they are dressed grandly , too . '' 
`` His daughters , as he calls them , eh ? 
There are a dozen of them . '' 
`` I have never been to more than two -- the two who came here . '' 
`` There is madame moving overhead ; I shall have to go , or she will raise a fine racket . 
Just keep an eye on the milk , Christophe ; do n't let the cat get at it . '' 
Sylvie went up to her mistress ' room . 
`` Sylvie ! 
How is this ? 
It 's nearly ten o'clock , and you let me sleep like a dormouse ! 
Such a thing has never happened before . '' 
`` It 's the fog ; it is that thick , you could cut it with a knife . '' 
`` But how about breakfast ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
the boarders are possessed , I 'm sure . 
They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight . '' 
`` Do speak properly , Sylvie , '' Mme. Vauquer retorted ; `` say a blink of daylight . '' 
`` Ah , well , madame , whichever you please . 
Anyhow , you can have breakfast at ten o'clock . 
La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred . 
There are only those two upstairs , and they are sleeping like the logs they are . '' 
`` But , Sylvie , you put their names together as if -- '' `` As if what ? '' 
said Sylvie , bursting into a guffaw . 
`` The two of them make a pair . '' 
`` It is a strange thing , is n't it , Sylvie , how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door ? '' 
`` Not at all , madame . 
Christophe heard M. Vautrin , and went down and undid the door . 
And here are you imagining that -- ? '' 
`` Give me my bodice , and be quick and get breakfast ready . 
Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes , and you can put the stewed pears on the table , those at five a penny . '' 
A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down , just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk , and begin to lap in all haste . 
`` Mistigris ! '' 
she cried . 
The cat fled , but promptly returned to rub against her ankles . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , you can wheedle , you old hypocrite ! '' 
she said . 
`` Sylvie ! 
Sylvie ! '' 
`` Yes , madame ; what is it ? '' 
`` Just see what the cat has done ! '' 
`` It is all that stupid Christophe 's fault . 
I told him to stop and lay the table . 
What has become of him ? 
Do n't you worry , madame ; Father Goriot shall have it . 
I will fill it up with water , and he wo n't know the difference ; he never notices anything , not even what he eats . '' 
`` I wonder where the old heathen can have gone ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , setting the plates round the table . 
`` Who knows ? 
He is up to all sorts of tricks . '' 
`` I have overslept myself , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` But madame looks as fresh as a rose , all the same . '' 
The door bell rang at that moment , and Vautrin came through the sitting-room , singing loudly : '' 'T is the same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . . 
`` Oh ! 
Mamma Vauquer ! 
good-morning ! '' 
he cried at the sight of his hostess , and he put his arm gaily round her waist . 
`` There ! 
have done -- '' '' ` Impertinence ! ' 
Say it ! '' 
he answered . 
`` Come , say it ! 
Now , is n't that what you really mean ? 
Stop a bit , I will help you to set the table . 
Ah ! 
I am a nice man , am I not ? 
`` For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover ... `` Oh ! 
I have just seen something so funny -- ... . 
led by chance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
asked the widow . 
`` Father Goriot in the goldsmith 's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning . 
They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there , and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum . 
It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that 's not used to the trade . '' 
`` Really ? 
You do n't say so ? '' 
`` Yes . 
One of my friends is expatriating himself ; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer , and was coming back here . 
I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do ; it is a comical affair . 
He came back to this quarter of the world , to the Rue des Gres , and went into a money-lender 's house ; everybody knows him , Gobseck , a stuck-up rascal , that would make dominoes out of his father 's bones , a Turk , a heathen , an old Jew , a Greek ; it would be a difficult matter to rob him , for he puts all his coin into the Bank . '' 
`` Then what was Father Goriot doing there ? '' 
`` Doing ? '' 
said Vautrin . 
`` Nothing ; he was bent on his own undoing . 
He is a simpleton , stupid enough to ruin himself by running after -- '' `` There he is ! '' 
cried Sylvie . 
`` Christophe , '' cried Father Goriot 's voice , `` come upstairs with me . '' 
Christophe went up , and shortly afterwards came down again . 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant . 
`` Out on an errand for M. Goriot . '' 
`` What may that be ? '' 
said Vautrin , pouncing on a letter in Christophe 's hand . '' 
Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud , '' he read . 
`` Where are you going with it ? '' 
he added , as he gave the letter back to Christophe . 
`` To the Rue du Helder . 
I have orders to give this into her hands myself . '' 
`` What is there inside it ? '' 
said Vautrin , holding the letter up to the light . 
`` A banknote ? 
No . '' 
He peered into the envelope . 
`` A receipted account ! '' 
he cried . 
`` My word ! 
't is a gallant old dotard . 
Off with you , old chap , '' he said , bringing down a hand on Christophe 's head , and spinning the man round like a thimble ; `` you will have a famous tip . '' 
By this time the table was set . 
Sylvie was boiling the milk , Mme. Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin , who kept humming to himself : `` The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . '' 
When everything was ready , Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in . 
`` Where have you been this morning , fair lady ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , turning to Mme. Couture . 
`` We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. . 
To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer . 
Poor little thing ! 
She is trembling like a leaf , '' Mme. Couture went on , as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze . 
`` Warm yourself , Victorine , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` It is quite right and proper , mademoiselle , to pray to Heaven to soften your father 's heart , '' said Vautrin , as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl ; `` but that is not enough . 
What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind ; a barbarian that has three millions -LRB- so they say -RRB- , and will not give you a dowry ; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays . '' 
`` Poor child ! '' 
said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` Never mind , my pet , your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself . '' 
Victorine 's eyes filled with tears at the words , and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme. Couture . 
`` If we could only see him ! '' 
said the Commissary-General 's widow ; `` if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife 's last letter ! 
I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post ; he knew my handwriting -- '' '' ` Oh woman , persecuted and injured innocent ! ' '' 
exclaimed Vautrin , breaking in upon her . 
`` So that is how you are , is it ? 
In a few days ' time I will look into your affairs , and it will be all right , you shall see . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sir , '' said Victorine , with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin , who showed no sign of being touched by it , `` if you know of any way of communicating with my father , please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother 's honor are more to me than all the money in the world . 
If you can induce him to relent a little towards me , I will pray to God for you . 
You may be sure of my gratitude -- '' '' The same old story everywhere , '' sang Vautrin , with a satirical intonation . 
At this juncture , Goriot , Mlle. Michonneau , and Poiret came downstairs together ; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast . 
The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning , and took their places at the table ; the clock struck ten , and the student 's footstep was heard outside . 
`` Ah ! 
here you are , M. Eugene , '' said Sylvie ; `` every one is breakfasting at home to-day . '' 
The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers , and sat down beside Goriot . 
`` I have just met with a queer adventure , '' he said , as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton , and cut a slice of bread , which Mme. Vauquer 's eyes gauged as usual . 
`` An adventure ? '' 
queried Poiret . 
`` Well , and what is there to astonish you in that , old boy ? '' 
Vautrin asked of Poiret . 
`` M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing . '' 
Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student . 
`` Tell us about your adventure ! '' 
demanded M. Vautrin . 
`` Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant . 
She has a magnificent house ; the rooms are hung with silk -- in short , it was a splendid affair , and I was as happy as a king -- '' `` Fisher , '' put in Vautrin , interrupting . 
`` What do you mean , sir ? '' 
said Eugene sharply . 
`` I said ` fisher , ' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings . '' 
`` Quite true ; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king , '' said Poiret the ditto-ist , `` because -- '' `` In fact '' -- the law-student cut him short -- `` I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room , a charming countess , the most exquisite creature I have ever seen . 
There was peach blossom in her hair , and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers -- real flowers , that scented the air -- but there ! 
it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance . 
You ought to have seen her ! 
Well , and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock , on foot in the Rue de Gres . 
Oh ! 
how my heart beat ! 
I began to think -- '' `` That she was coming here , '' said Vautrin , with a keen look at the student . 
`` I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck , a money-lender . 
If ever you explore a Parisian woman 's heart , you will find the money-lender first , and the lover afterwards . 
Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud , and she lives in the Rue du Helder . '' 
The student stared hard at Vautrin . 
Father Goriot raised his head at the words , and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment . 
`` Then Christophe was too late , and she must have gone to him ! '' 
cried Goriot , with anguish in his voice . 
`` It is just as I guessed , '' said Vautrin , leaning over to whisper in Mme. Vauquer 's ear . 
Goriot went on with his breakfast , but seemed unconscious of what he was doing . 
He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment . 
`` Who the devil could have told you her name , M. Vautrin ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` Aha ! 
there you are ! '' 
answered Vautrin . 
`` Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well ! 
and why should I not know it too ? '' 
`` M. Goriot ? '' 
the student cried . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the old man . 
`` So she was very beautiful , was she , yesterday night ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
`` Mme. de Restaud . '' 
`` Look at the old wretch , '' said Mme. Vauquer , speaking to Vautrin ; `` how his eyes light up ! '' 
`` Then does he really keep her ? '' 
said Mlle. Michonneau , in a whisper to the student . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , she was tremendously pretty , '' Eugene answered . 
Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes . 
`` If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there , my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball ; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else . 
I was the twelfth on her list , and she danced every quadrille . 
The other women were furious . 
She must have enjoyed herself , if ever creature did ! 
It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail , a galloping horse , or a woman dancing . '' 
`` So the wheel turns , '' said Vautrin ; `` yesterday night at a duchess ' ball , this morning in a money-lender 's office , on the lowest rung of the ladder -- just like a Parisienne ! 
If their husbands can not afford to pay for their frantic extravagance , they will sell themselves . 
Or if they can not do that , they will tear out their mothers ' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor . 
They will turn the world upside down . 
Just a Parisienne through and through ! '' 
Father Goriot 's face , which had shone at the student 's words like the sun on a bright day , clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin 's . 
`` Well , '' said Mme. Vauquer , `` but where is your adventure ? 
Did you speak to her ? 
Did you ask her if she wanted to study law ? '' 
`` She did not see me , '' said Eugene . 
`` But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock ! 
She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning . 
Was n't it queer ? 
There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures . '' 
`` Pshaw ! 
much funnier things than that happen here ! '' 
exclaimed Vautrin . 
Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk , she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make . 
Mme. Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress ; the two ladies went out , and Father Goriot followed their example . 
`` Well , did you see ? '' 
said Mme. Vauquer , addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle . 
`` He is ruining himself for those women , that is plain . '' 
`` Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot , '' cried the student . 
`` Well , and if you do n't , '' broke in Vautrin , `` we are not set on convincing you . 
You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet ; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion -- '' Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words . 
They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper 's horse . 
`` Aha ! '' 
said Vautrin , stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance , `` so we have had our little experiences , have we ? '' 
The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue . 
`` Well , '' he went on , `` when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads , they can not drop it . 
They must drink the water from some particular spring -- it is stagnant as often as not ; but they will sell their wives and families , they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it . 
For some this spring is play , or the stock-exchange , or music , or a collection of pictures or insects ; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like . 
You might offer these last all the women on earth -- they would turn up their noses ; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion . 
It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all , and treats them cruelly ; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear ; but no matter , the fools are never tired of it ; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker 's to give their last five-franc piece to her . 
Father Goriot here is one of that sort . 
He is discreet , so the Countess exploits him -- just the way of the gay world . 
The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else . 
In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal ; but get him on that subject , and his eyes sparkle like diamonds . 
That secret is not difficult to guess . 
He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot , and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck 's in the Rue des Gres . 
And now , mark what follows -- he came back here , and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe , who showed us the address ; there was a receipted bill inside it . 
It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender . 
Father Goriot has financed her handsomely . 
There is no need to tack a tale together ; the thing is self-evident . 
So that shows you , sir student , that all the time your Countess was smiling , dancing , flirting , swaying her peach-flower crowned head , with her gown gathered into her hand , her slippers were pinching her , as they say ; she was thinking of her protested bills , or her lover 's protested bills . '' 
`` You have made me wild to know the truth , '' cried Eugene ; `` I will go to call on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow . '' 
`` Yes , '' echoed Poiret ; `` you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud . '' 
`` And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there , who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered . '' 
Eugene looked disgusted . 
`` Why , then , this Paris of yours is a slough . '' 
`` And an uncommonly queer slough , too , '' replied Vautrin . 
`` The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage -- you are a respectable person ; you go afoot and are splashed -- you are a scoundrel . 
You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else , and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice ; you steal a million , and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue . 
And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice , for the maintenance of law and order ! 
A pretty slate of things it is ! '' 
`` What , '' cried Mme. Vauquer , `` has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish ? '' 
`` There were two turtle-doves on the lid , were there not ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` Yes , that there were . '' 
`` Then , was he fond of it ? '' 
said Eugene . 
`` He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate . 
I happened to see him by accident . '' 
`` It was dear to him as his own life , '' answered the widow . 
`` There ! 
you see how infatuated the old fellow is ! '' 
cried Vautrin . 
`` The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him . '' 
The student went up to his room . 
Vautrin went out , and a few moments later Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them . 
Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau , and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes . 
`` Well , those two are as good as married , '' was the portly Sylvie 's comment . 
`` They are going out together to-day for the first time . 
They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel . '' 
`` Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau 's shawl , then , '' said Mme. Vauquer , laughing ; `` it would flare up like tinder . '' 
At four o'clock that evening , when Goriot came in , he saw , by the light of two smoky lamps , that Victorine 's eyes were red . 
Mme. Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer ; it had been made in vain . 
Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend ; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them . 
`` My dear lady , '' said Mme. Couture , addressing Mme. Vauquer , `` just imagine it ; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down , she was standing the whole time . 
He said to me quite coolly , without putting himself in a passion , that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there ; that the young lady -LRB- he would not call her his daughter -RRB- was injuring her cause by importuning him -LRB- importuning ! 
once a year , the wretch ! -RRB- 
; that as Victorine 's mother had nothing when he married her , Victorine ought not to expect anything from him ; in fact , he said the most cruel things , that made the poor child burst out crying . 
The little thing threw herself at her father 's feet and spoke up bravely ; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother 's sake ; that she would obey him without a murmur , but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother 's farewell letter . 
She took it up and gave it to him , saying the most beautiful things in the world , most beautifully expressed ; I do not know where she learned them ; God must have put them into her head , for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk . 
And what do you think the monster was doing all the time ? 
Cutting his nails ! 
He took the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears , and flung it on to the chimney-piece . 
` That is all right , ' he said . 
He held out his hands to raise his daughter , but she covered them with kisses , and he drew them away again . 
Scandalous , is n't it ? 
And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister . '' 
`` What inhuman wretches they must be ! '' 
said Father Goriot . 
`` And then they both went out of the room , '' Mme. Couture went on , without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker 's exclamation ; `` father and son bowed to me , and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business !
