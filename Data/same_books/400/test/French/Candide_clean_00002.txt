It appeared to me a very strange kind of ceremony ; but thus one judges of things when one has not seen the world . 
I afterwards learnt that it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds . 
This is the practice established from time immemorial , among civilised nations that scour the seas . 
I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta never fail to make this search when they take any Turkish prisoners of either sex . 
It is a law of nations from which they never deviate . 
`` I need not tell you how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco . 
You may easily imagine all we had to suffer on board the pirate vessel . 
My mother was still very handsome ; our maids of honour , and even our waiting women , had more charms than are to be found in all Africa . 
As for myself , I was ravishing , was exquisite , grace itself , and I was a virgin ! 
I did not remain so long ; this flower , which had been reserved for the handsome Prince of Massa Carara , was plucked by the corsair captain . 
He was an abominable negro , and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honour . 
Certainly the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been very strong to go through all that we experienced until our arrival at Morocco . 
But let us pass on ; these are such common things as not to be worth mentioning . 
`` Morocco swam in blood when we arrived . 
Fifty sons of the Emperor Muley-Ismael had each their adherents ; this produced fifty civil wars , of blacks against blacks , and blacks against tawnies , and tawnies against tawnies , and mulattoes against mulattoes . 
In short it was a continual carnage throughout the empire . 
`` No sooner were we landed , than the blacks of a contrary faction to that of my captain attempted to rob him of his booty . 
Next to jewels and gold we were the most valuable things he had . 
I was witness to such a battle as you have never seen in your European climates . 
The northern nations have not that heat in their blood , nor that raging lust for women , so common in Africa . 
It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your veins ; but it is vitriol , it is fire which runs in those of the inhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries . 
They fought with the fury of the lions , tigers , and serpents of the country , to see who should have us . 
A Moor seized my mother by the right arm , while my captain 's lieutenant held her by the left ; a Moorish soldier had hold of her by one leg , and one of our corsairs held her by the other . 
Thus almost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men . 
My captain concealed me behind him ; and with his drawn scimitar cut and slashed every one that opposed his fury . 
At length I saw all our Italian women , and my mother herself , torn , mangled , massacred , by the monsters who disputed over them . 
The slaves , my companions , those who had taken them , soldiers , sailors , blacks , whites , mulattoes , and at last my captain , all were killed , and I remained dying on a heap of dead . 
Such scenes as this were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues -- and yet they never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet . 
`` With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered bodies , and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring rivulet , where I fell , oppressed with fright , fatigue , horror , despair , and hunger . 
Immediately after , my senses , overpowered , gave themselves up to sleep , which was yet more swooning than repose . 
I was in this state of weakness and insensibility , between life and death , when I felt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body . 
I opened my eyes , and saw a white man , of good countenance , who sighed , and who said between his teeth : ' O che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni ! ' '' 
`` Astonished and delighted to hear my native language , and no less surprised at what this man said , I made answer that there were much greater misfortunes than that of which he complained . 
I told him in a few words of the horrors which I had endured , and fainted a second time . 
He carried me to a neighbouring house , put me to bed , gave me food , waited upon me , consoled me , flattered me ; he told me that he had never seen any one so beautiful as I , and that he never so much regretted the loss of what it was impossible to recover . '' ' 
I was born at Naples , ' said he , ` there they geld two or three thousand children every year ; some die of the operation , others acquire a voice more beautiful than that of women , and others are raised to offices of state . 
This operation was performed on me with great success and I was chapel musician to madam , the Princess of Palestrina . ' '' 
` To my mother ! ' 
cried I. '' ` Your mother ! ' 
cried he , weeping . 
` What ! 
can you be that young princess whom I brought up until the age of six years , and who promised so early to be as beautiful as you ? ' '' 
` It is I , indeed ; but my mother lies four hundred yards hence , torn in quarters , under a heap of dead bodies . ' 
`` I told him all my adventures , and he made me acquainted with his ; telling me that he had been sent to the Emperor of Morocco by a Christian power , to conclude a treaty with that prince , in consequence of which he was to be furnished with military stores and ships to help to demolish the commerce of other Christian Governments . '' 
` My mission is done , ' said this honest eunuch ; ' I go to embark for Ceuta , and will take you to Italy . 
Ma che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni ! ' 
`` I thanked him with tears of commiseration ; and instead of taking me to Italy he conducted me to Algiers , where he sold me to the Dey . 
Scarcely was I sold , than the plague which had made the tour of Africa , Asia , and Europe , broke out with great malignancy in Algiers . 
You have seen earthquakes ; but pray , miss , have you ever had the plague ? '' 
`` Never , '' answered Cunegonde . 
`` If you had , '' said the old woman , `` you would acknowledge that it is far more terrible than an earthquake . 
It is common in Africa , and I caught it . 
Imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a Pope , only fifteen years old , who , in less than three months , had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery , had been ravished almost every day , had beheld her mother drawn in quarters , had experienced famine and war , and was dying of the plague in Algiers . 
I did not die , however , but my eunuch , and the Dey , and almost the whole seraglio of Algiers perished . 
`` As soon as the first fury of this terrible pestilence was over , a sale was made of the Dey 's slaves ; I was purchased by a merchant , and carried to Tunis ; this man sold me to another merchant , who sold me again to another at Tripoli ; from Tripoli I was sold to Alexandria , from Alexandria to Smyrna , and from Smyrna to Constantinople . 
At length I became the property of an Aga of the Janissaries , who was soon ordered away to the defence of Azof , then besieged by the Russians . 
`` The Aga , who was a very gallant man , took his whole seraglio with him , and lodged us in a small fort on the Palus Méotides , guarded by two black eunuchs and twenty soldiers . 
The Turks killed prodigious numbers of the Russians , but the latter had their revenge . 
Azof was destroyed by fire , the inhabitants put to the sword , neither sex nor age was spared ; until there remained only our little fort , and the enemy wanted to starve us out . 
The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never surrender . 
The extremities of famine to which they were reduced , obliged them to eat our two eunuchs , for fear of violating their oath . 
And at the end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women . 
`` We had a very pious and humane Iman , who preached an excellent sermon , exhorting them not to kill us all at once . '' 
` Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies , ' said he , ` and you 'll fare extremely well ; if you must go to it again , there will be the same entertainment a few days hence ; heaven will accept of so charitable an action , and send you relief . ' 
`` He had great eloquence ; he persuaded them ; we underwent this terrible operation . 
The Iman applied the same balsam to us , as he does to children after circumcision ; and we all nearly died . 
`` Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had furnished them , than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats ; not a Janissary escaped . 
The Russians paid no attention to the condition we were in . 
There are French surgeons in all parts of the world ; one of them who was very clever took us under his care -- he cured us ; and as long as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he made proposals to me . 
He bid us all be of good cheer , telling us that the like had happened in many sieges , and that it was according to the laws of war . 
`` As soon as my companions could walk , they were obliged to set out for Moscow . 
I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his gardener , and gave me twenty lashes a day . 
But this nobleman having in two years ' time been broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils at court , I profited by that event ; I fled . 
I traversed all Russia ; I was a long time an inn-holder 's servant at Riga , the same at Rostock , at Vismar , at Leipzig , at Cassel , at Utrecht , at Leyden , at the Hague , at Rotterdam . 
I waxed old in misery and disgrace , having only one-half of my posteriors , and always remembering I was a Pope 's daughter . 
A hundred times I was upon the point of killing myself ; but still I loved life . 
This ridiculous foible is perhaps one of our most fatal characteristics ; for is there anything more absurd than to wish to carry continually a burden which one can always throw down ? 
to detest existence and yet to cling to one 's existence ? 
in brief , to caress the serpent which devours us , till he has eaten our very heart ? 
`` In the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse , and the numerous inns where I have been servant , I have taken notice of a vast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence , and yet I never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their misery ; three negroes , four Englishmen , and a German professor named Robek . 
I ended by being servant to the Jew , Don Issachar , who placed me near your presence , my fair lady . 
I am determined to share your fate , and have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own . 
I would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes , had you not piqued me a little , and if it were not customary to tell stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time . 
In short , Miss Cunegonde , I have had experience , I know the world ; therefore I advise you to divert yourself , and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story ; and if there be one of them all , that has not cursed his life many a time , that has not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals , I give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea . '' 
The beautiful Cunegonde having heard the old woman 's history , paid her all the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit . 
She likewise accepted her proposal , and engaged all the passengers , one after the other , to relate their adventures ; and then both she and Candide allowed that the old woman was in the right . 
`` It is a great pity , '' said Candide , `` that the sage Pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an auto-da-fé ; he would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth and sea , and I should be able , with due respect , to make a few objections . '' 
While each passenger was recounting his story , the ship made her way . 
They landed at Buenos Ayres . 
Cunegonde , Captain Candide , and the old woman , waited on the Governor , Don Fernando d'Ibaraa , y Figueora , y Mascarenes , y Lampourdos , y Souza . 
This nobleman had a stateliness becoming a person who bore so many names . 
He spoke to men with so noble a disdain , carried his nose so loftily , raised his voice so unmercifully , assumed so imperious an air , and stalked with such intolerable pride , that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to give him a good drubbing . 
Cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful he had ever met . 
The first thing he did was to ask whether she was not the captain 's wife . 
The manner in which he asked the question alarmed Candide ; he durst not say she was his wife , because indeed she was not ; neither durst he say she was his sister , because it was not so ; and although this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the ancients , and although it could be useful to the moderns , his soul was too pure to betray the truth . 
`` Miss Cunegonde , '' said he , `` is to do me the honour to marry me , and we beseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage . '' 
Don Fernando d'Ibaraa , y Figueora , y Mascarenes , y Lampourdos , y Souza , turning up his moustachios , smiled mockingly , and ordered Captain Candide to go and review his company . 
Candide obeyed , and the Governor remained alone with Miss Cunegonde . 
He declared his passion , protesting he would marry her the next day in the face of the church , or otherwise , just as should be agreeable to herself . 
Cunegonde asked a quarter of an hour to consider of it , to consult the old woman , and to take her resolution . 
The old woman spoke thus to Cunegonde : `` Miss , you have seventy-two quarterings , and not a farthing ; it is now in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in South America , who has very beautiful moustachios . 
Is it for you to pique yourself upon inviolable fidelity ? 
You have been ravished by Bulgarians ; a Jew and an Inquisitor have enjoyed your favours . 
Misfortune gives sufficient excuse . 
I own , that if I were in your place , I should have no scruple in marrying the Governor and in making the fortune of Captain Candide . '' 
While the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave , a small ship entered the port on board of which were an Alcalde and his alguazils , and this was what had happened . 
As the old woman had shrewdly guessed , it was a Grey Friar who stole Cunegonde 's money and jewels in the town of Badajos , when she and Candide were escaping . 
The Friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller ; the jeweller knew them to be the Grand Inquisitor 's . 
The Friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them . 
He described the persons , and the route they had taken . 
The flight of Cunegonde and Candide was already known . 
They were traced to Cadiz . 
A vessel was immediately sent in pursuit of them . 
The vessel was already in the port of Buenos Ayres . 
The report spread that the Alcalde was going to land , and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the Grand Inquisitor . 
The prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done . 
`` You can not run away , '' said she to Cunegonde , `` and you have nothing to fear , for it was not you that killed my lord ; besides the Governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated ; therefore stay . '' 
She then ran immediately to Candide . 
`` Fly , '' said she , `` or in an hour you will be burnt . '' 
There was not a moment to lose ; but how could he part from Cunegonde , and where could he flee for shelter ? 
Candide had brought such a valet with him from Cadiz , as one often meets with on the coasts of Spain and in the American colonies . 
He was a quarter Spaniard , born of a mongrel in Tucuman ; he had been singing-boy , sacristan , sailor , monk , pedlar , soldier , and lackey . 
His name was Cacambo , and he loved his master , because his master was a very good man . 
He quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses . 
`` Come , master , let us follow the old woman 's advice ; let us start , and run without looking behind us . '' 
Candide shed tears . 
`` Oh ! 
my dear Cunegonde ! 
must I leave you just at a time when the Governor was going to sanction our nuptials ? 
Cunegonde , brought to such a distance what will become of you ? '' 
`` She will do as well as she can , '' said Cacambo ; `` the women are never at a loss , God provides for them , let us run . '' 
`` Whither art thou carrying me ? 
Where shall we go ? 
What shall we do without Cunegonde ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` By St. James of Compostella , '' said Cacambo , `` you were going to fight against the Jesuits ; let us go to fight for them ; I know the road well , I 'll conduct you to their kingdom , where they will be charmed to have a captain that understands the Bulgarian exercise . 
You 'll make a prodigious fortune ; if we can not find our account in one world we shall in another . 
It is a great pleasure to see and do new things . '' 
`` You have before been in Paraguay , then ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` Ay , sure , '' answered Cacambo , `` I was servant in the College of the Assumption , and am acquainted with the government of the good Fathers as well as I am with the streets of Cadiz . 
It is an admirable government . 
The kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter , and divided into thirty provinces ; there the Fathers possess all , and the people nothing ; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice . 
For my part I see nothing so divine as the Fathers who here make war upon the kings of Spain and Portugal , and in Europe confess those kings ; who here kill Spaniards , and in Madrid send them to heaven ; this delights me , let us push forward . 
You are going to be the happiest of mortals . 
What pleasure will it be to those Fathers to hear that a captain who knows the Bulgarian exercise has come to them ! '' 
As soon as they reached the first barrier , Cacambo told the advanced guard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the Commandant . 
Notice was given to the main guard , and immediately a Paraguayan officer ran and laid himself at the feet of the Commandant , to impart this news to him . 
Candide and Cacambo were disarmed , and their two Andalusian horses seized . 
The strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers ; the Commandant was at the further end , with the three-cornered cap on his head , his gown tucked up , a sword by his side , and a spontoon in his hand . 
He beckoned , and straightway the new-comers were encompassed by four-and-twenty soldiers . 
A sergeant told them they must wait , that the Commandant could not speak to them , and that the reverend Father Provincial does not suffer any Spaniard to open his mouth but in his presence , or to stay above three hours in the province . 
`` And where is the reverend Father Provincial ? '' 
said Cacambo . 
`` He is upon the parade just after celebrating mass , '' answered the sergeant , `` and you can not kiss his spurs till three hours hence . '' 
`` However , '' said Cacambo , `` the captain is not a Spaniard , but a German , he is ready to perish with hunger as well as myself ; can not we have something for breakfast , while we wait for his reverence ? '' 
The sergeant went immediately to acquaint the Commandant with what he had heard . 
`` God be praised ! '' 
said the reverend Commandant , `` since he is a German , I may speak to him ; take him to my arbour . '' 
Candide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house , ornamented with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble , and with trellises , enclosing parraquets , humming-birds , fly-birds , guinea-hens , and all other rare birds . 
An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold ; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden dishes , in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun , the reverend Father Commandant retired to his arbour . 
He was a very handsome young man , with a full face , white skin but high in colour ; he had an arched eyebrow , a lively eye , red ears , vermilion lips , a bold air , but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard nor a Jesuit . 
They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo , and also the two Andalusian horses ; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by the arbour , having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a surprise . 
Candide first kissed the hem of the Commandant 's robe , then they sat down to table . 
`` You are , then , a German ? '' 
said the Jesuit to him in that language . 
`` Yes , reverend Father , '' answered Candide . 
As they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great amazement , and with such an emotion as they could not conceal . 
`` And from what part of Germany do you come ? '' 
said the Jesuit . 
`` I am from the dirty province of Westphalia , '' answered Candide ; `` I was born in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Heavens ! 
is it possible ? '' 
cried the Commandant . 
`` What a miracle ! '' 
cried Candide . 
`` Is it really you ? '' 
said the Commandant . 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
said Candide . 
They drew back ; they embraced ; they shed rivulets of tears . 
`` What , is it you , reverend Father ? 
You , the brother of the fair Cunegonde ! 
You , that was slain by the Bulgarians ! 
You , the Baron 's son ! 
You , a Jesuit in Paraguay ! 
I must confess this is a strange world that we live in . 
Oh , Pangloss ! 
Pangloss ! 
how glad you would be if you had not been hanged ! '' 
The Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans , who served them with liquors in goblets of rock-crystal . 
He thanked God and St. Ignatius a thousand times ; he clasped Candide in his arms ; and their faces were all bathed with tears . 
`` You will be more surprised , more affected , and transported , '' said Candide , `` when I tell you that Cunegonde , your sister , whom you believe to have been ripped open , is in perfect health . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` In your neighbourhood , with the Governor of Buenos Ayres ; and I was going to fight against you . '' 
Every word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder to wonder . 
Their souls fluttered on their tongues , listened in their ears , and sparkled in their eyes . 
As they were Germans , they sat a good while at table , waiting for the reverend Father Provincial , and the Commandant spoke to his dear Candide as follows . 
`` I shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day , on which I saw my father and mother killed , and my sister ravished . 
When the Bulgarians retired , my dear sister could not be found ; but my mother , my father , and myself , with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had been slain , were put in a hearse , to be conveyed for interment to a chapel belonging to the Jesuits , within two leagues of our family seat . 
A Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water ; it was horribly salt ; a few drops of it fell into my eyes ; the father perceived that my eyelids stirred a little ; he put his hand upon my heart and felt it beat . 
I received assistance , and at the end of three weeks I recovered . 
You know , my dear Candide , I was very pretty ; but I grew much prettier , and the reverend Father Didrie , Superior of that House , conceived the tenderest friendship for me ; he gave me the habit of the order , some years after I was sent to Rome . 
The Father-General needed new levies of young German-Jesuits . 
The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish Jesuits as possible ; they prefer those of other nations as being more subordinate to their commands . 
I was judged fit by the reverend Father-General to go and work in this vineyard . 
We set out -- a Pole , a Tyrolese , and myself . 
Upon my arrival I was honoured with a sub-deaconship and a lieutenancy . 
I am to-day colonel and priest . 
We shall give a warm reception to the King of Spain 's troops ; I will answer for it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten . 
Providence sends you here to assist us . 
But is it , indeed , true that my dear sister Cunegonde is in the neighbourhood , with the Governor of Buenos Ayres ? '' 
Candide assured him on oath that nothing was more true , and their tears began afresh . 
The Baron could not refrain from embracing Candide ; he called him his brother , his saviour . 
`` Ah ! 
perhaps , '' said he , `` we shall together , my dear Candide , enter the town as conquerors , and recover my sister Cunegonde . '' 
`` That is all I want , '' said Candide , `` for I intended to marry her , and I still hope to do so . '' 
`` You insolent ! '' 
replied the Baron , `` would you have the impudence to marry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings ! 
I find thou hast the most consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design ! '' 
Candide , petrified at this speech , made answer : `` Reverend Father , all the quarterings in the world signify nothing ; I rescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and of an Inquisitor ; she has great obligations to me , she wishes to marry me ; Master Pangloss always told me that all men are equal , and certainly I will marry her . '' 
`` We shall see that , thou scoundrel ! '' 
said the Jesuit Baron de Thunder-ten-Tronckh , and that instant struck him across the face with the flat of his sword . 
Candide in an instant drew his rapier , and plunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit 's belly ; but in pulling it out reeking hot , he burst into tears . 
`` Good God ! '' 
said he , `` I have killed my old master , my friend , my brother-in-law ! 
I am the best-natured creature in the world , and yet I have already killed three men , and of these three two were priests . '' 
Cacambo , who stood sentry by the door of the arbour , ran to him . 
`` We have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we can , '' said his master to him , `` without doubt some one will soon enter the arbour , and we must die sword in hand . '' 
Cacambo , who had been in a great many scrapes in his lifetime , did not lose his head ; he took the Baron 's Jesuit habit , put it on Candide , gave him the square cap , and made him mount on horseback . 
All this was done in the twinkling of an eye . 
`` Let us gallop fast , master , everybody will take you for a Jesuit , going to give directions to your men , and we shall have passed the frontiers before they will be able to overtake us . '' 
He flew as he spoke these words , crying out aloud in Spanish : `` Make way , make way , for the reverend Father Colonel . '' 
Candide and his valet had got beyond the barrier , before it was known in the camp that the German Jesuit was dead . 
The wary Cacambo had taken care to fill his wallet with bread , chocolate , bacon , fruit , and a few bottles of wine . 
With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an unknown country , where they perceived no beaten track . 
At length they came to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills . 
Here our two adventurers fed their horses . 
Cacambo proposed to his master to take some food , and he set him an example . 
`` How can you ask me to eat ham , '' said Candide , `` after killing the Baron 's son , and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde ? 
What will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far from her in remorse and despair ? 
And what will the Journal of Trevoux say ? '' 
While he was thus lamenting his fate , he went on eating . 
The sun went down . 
The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be uttered by women . 
They did not know whether they were cries of pain or joy ; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm which every little thing inspires in an unknown country . 
The noise was made by two naked girls , who tripped along the mead , while two monkeys were pursuing them and biting their buttocks . 
Candide was moved with pity ; he had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service , and he was so clever at it , that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching a leaf of the tree . 
He took up his double-barrelled Spanish fusil , let it off , and killed the two monkeys . 
`` God be praised ! 
My dear Cacambo , I have rescued those two poor creatures from a most perilous situation . 
If I have committed a sin in killing an Inquisitor and a Jesuit , I have made ample amends by saving the lives of these girls . 
Perhaps they are young ladies of family ; and this adventure may procure us great advantages in this country . '' 
He was continuing , but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly embracing the monkeys , bathing their bodies in tears , and rending the air with the most dismal lamentations . 
`` Little did I expect to see such good-nature , '' said he at length to Cacambo ; who made answer : `` Master , you have done a fine thing now ; you have slain the sweethearts of those two young ladies . '' 
`` The sweethearts ! 
Is it possible ? 
You are jesting , Cacambo , I can never believe it ! '' 
`` Dear master , '' replied Cacambo ; `` you are surprised at everything . 
Why should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies ; they are a fourth part human , as I am a fourth part Spaniard . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
replied Candide , `` I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say , that formerly such accidents used to happen ; that these mixtures were productive of Centaurs , Fauns , and Satyrs ; and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters , but I looked upon the whole as fabulous . '' 
`` You ought now to be convinced , '' said Cacambo , `` that it is the truth , and you see what use is made of those creatures , by persons that have not had a proper education ; all I fear is that those ladies will play us some ugly trick . '' 
These sound reflections induced Candide to leave the meadow and to plunge into a wood . 
He supped there with Cacambo ; and after cursing the Portuguese inquisitor , the Governor of Buenos Ayres , and the Baron , they fell asleep on moss . 
On awaking they felt that they could not move ; for during the night the Oreillons , who inhabited that country , and to whom the ladies had denounced them , had bound them with cords made of the bark of trees . 
They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons , armed with bows and arrows , with clubs and flint hatchets . 
Some were making a large cauldron boil , others were preparing spits , and all cried : `` A Jesuit ! 
a Jesuit ! 
we shall be revenged , we shall have excellent cheer , let us eat the Jesuit , let us eat him up ! '' 
`` I told you , my dear master , '' cried Cacambo sadly , `` that those two girls would play us some ugly trick . '' 
Candide seeing the cauldron and the spits , cried : `` We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled . 
Ah ! 
what would Master Pangloss say , were he to see how pure nature is formed ? 
Everything is right , may be , but I declare it is very hard to have lost Miss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons . '' 
Cacambo never lost his head . 
`` Do not despair , '' said he to the disconsolate Candide , `` I understand a little of the jargon of these people , I will speak to them . '' 
`` Be sure , '' said Candide , `` to represent to them how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men , and how very un-Christian . '' 
`` Gentlemen , '' said Cacambo , `` you reckon you are to-day going to feast upon a Jesuit . 
It is all very well , nothing is more unjust than thus to treat your enemies . 
Indeed , the law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbour , and such is the practice all over the world . 
If we do not accustom ourselves to eating them , it is because we have better fare . 
But you have not the same resources as we ; certainly it is much better to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits of your victory . 
But , gentlemen , surely you would not choose to eat your friends . 
You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit , and he is your defender . 
It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast . 
As for myself , I was born in your country ; this gentleman is my master , and , far from being a Jesuit , he has just killed one , whose spoils he wears ; and thence comes your mistake . 
To convince you of the truth of what I say , take his habit and carry it to the first barrier of the Jesuit kingdom , and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a Jesuit officer . 
It will not take you long , and you can always eat us if you find that I have lied to you . 
But I have told you the truth . 
You are too well acquainted with the principles of public law , humanity , and justice not to pardon us . '' 
The Oreillons found this speech very reasonable . 
They deputed two of their principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of the matter ; these executed their commission like men of sense , and soon returned with good news . 
The Oreillons untied their prisoners , showed them all sorts of civilities , offered them girls , gave them refreshment , and reconducted them to the confines of their territories , proclaiming with great joy : `` He is no Jesuit ! 
He is no Jesuit ! '' 
Candide could not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance . 
`` What people ! '' 
said he ; `` what men ! 
what manners ! 
If I had not been so lucky as to run Miss Cunegonde 's brother through the body , I should have been devoured without redemption . 
But , after all , pure nature is good , since these people , instead of feasting upon my flesh , have shown me a thousand civilities , when then I was not a Jesuit . '' 
`` You see , '' said Cacambo to Candide , as soon as they had reached the frontiers of the Oreillons , `` that this hemisphere is not better than the others , take my word for it ; let us go back to Europe by the shortest way . '' 
`` How go back ? '' 
said Candide , `` and where shall we go ? 
to my own country ? 
The Bulgarians and the Abares are slaying all ; to Portugal ? 
there I shall be burnt ; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted . 
But how can I resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear Cunegonde resides ? '' 
`` Let us turn towards Cayenne , '' said Cacambo , `` there we shall find Frenchmen , who wander all over the world ; they may assist us ; God will perhaps have pity on us . '' 
It was not easy to get to Cayenne ; they knew vaguely in which direction to go , but rivers , precipices , robbers , savages , obstructed them all the way . 
Their horses died of fatigue . 
Their provisions were consumed ; they fed a whole month upon wild fruits , and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with cocoa trees , which sustained their lives and their hopes . 
Cacambo , who was as good a counsellor as the old woman , said to Candide : `` We are able to hold out no longer ; we have walked enough . 
I see an empty canoe near the river-side ; let us fill it with cocoanuts , throw ourselves into it , and go with the current ; a river always leads to some inhabited spot . 
If we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find new things . '' 
`` With all my heart , '' said Candide , `` let us recommend ourselves to Providence . '' 
They rowed a few leagues , between banks , in some places flowery , in others barren ; in some parts smooth , in others rugged . 
The stream ever widened , and at length lost itself under an arch of frightful rocks which reached to the sky . 
The two travellers had the courage to commit themselves to the current . 
The river , suddenly contracting at this place , whirled them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity . 
At the end of four-and-twenty hours they saw daylight again , but their canoe was dashed to pieces against the rocks . 
For a league they had to creep from rock to rock , until at length they discovered an extensive plain , bounded by inaccessible mountains . 
The country was cultivated as much for pleasure as for necessity . 
On all sides the useful was also the beautiful . 
The roads were covered , or rather adorned , with carriages of a glittering form and substance , in which were men and women of surprising beauty , drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness the finest coursers of Andalusia , Tetuan , and Mequinez . 
`` Here , however , is a country , '' said Candide , `` which is better than Westphalia . '' 
He stepped out with Cacambo towards the first village which he saw . 
Some children dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts . 
Our travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on . 
The quoits were large round pieces , yellow , red , and green , which cast a singular lustre ! 
The travellers picked a few of them off the ground ; this was of gold , that of emeralds , the other of rubies -- the least of them would have been the greatest ornament on the Mogul 's throne . 
`` Without doubt , '' said Cacambo , `` these children must be the king 's sons that are playing at quoits ! '' 
The village schoolmaster appeared at this moment and called them to school . 
`` There , '' said Candide , `` is the preceptor of the royal family . '' 
The little truants immediately quitted their game , leaving the quoits on the ground with all their other playthings . 
Candide gathered them up , ran to the master , and presented them to him in a most humble manner , giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgotten their gold and jewels . 
The schoolmaster , smiling , flung them upon the ground ; then , looking at Candide with a good deal of surprise , went about his business . 
The travellers , however , took care to gather up the gold , the rubies , and the emeralds . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
cried Candide . 
`` The king 's children in this country must be well brought up , since they are taught to despise gold and precious stones . '' 
Cacambo was as much surprised as Candide . 
At length they drew near the first house in the village . 
It was built like an European palace . 
A crowd of people pressed about the door , and there were still more in the house . 
They heard most agreeable music , and were aware of a delicious odour of cooking . 
Cacambo went up to the door and heard they were talking Peruvian ; it was his mother tongue , for it is well known that Cacambo was born in Tucuman , in a village where no other language was spoken . 
`` I will be your interpreter here , '' said he to Candide ; `` let us go in , it is a public-house . '' 
Immediately two waiters and two girls , dressed in cloth of gold , and their hair tied up with ribbons , invited them to sit down to table with the landlord . 
They served four dishes of soup , each garnished with two young parrots ; a boiled condor which weighed two hundred pounds ; two roasted monkeys , of excellent flavour ; three hundred humming-birds in one dish , and six hundred fly-birds in another ; exquisite ragouts ; delicious pastries ; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of rock-crystal . 
The waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn from the sugar-cane . 
Most of the company were chapmen and waggoners , all extremely polite ; they asked Cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection , and answered his in the most obliging manner . 
As soon as dinner was over , Cacambo believed as well as Candide that they might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked up . 
The landlord and landlady shouted with laughter and held their sides . 
When the fit was over : `` Gentlemen , '' said the landlord , `` it is plain you are strangers , and such guests we are not accustomed to see ; pardon us therefore for laughing when you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your reckoning . 
You doubtless have not the money of the country ; but it is not necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house . 
All hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the government . 
You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor village ; but everywhere else , you will be received as you deserve . '' 
Cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to Candide , who was as greatly astonished to hear it . 
`` What sort of a country then is this , '' said they to one another ; `` a country unknown to all the rest of the world , and where nature is of a kind so different from ours ? 
It is probably the country where all is well ; for there absolutely must be one such place . 
And , whatever Master Pangloss might say , I often found that things went very ill in Westphalia . '' 
Cacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord , who made answer : `` I am very ignorant , but not the worse on that account . 
However , we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court who is the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom . '' 
At once he took Cacambo to the old man . 
Candide acted now only a second character , and accompanied his valet . 
They entered a very plain house , for the door was only of silver , and the ceilings were only of gold , but wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest . 
The antechamber , indeed , was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds , but the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great simplicity . 
The old man received the strangers on his sofa , which was stuffed with humming-birds ' feathers , and ordered his servants to present them with liqueurs in diamond goblets ; after which he satisfied their curiosity in the following terms : `` I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old , and I learnt of my late father , Master of the Horse to the King , the amazing revolutions of Peru , of which he had been an eyewitness . 
The kingdom we now inhabit is the ancient country of the Incas , who quitted it very imprudently to conquer another part of the world , and were at length destroyed by the Spaniards . 
`` More wise by far were the princes of their family , who remained in their native country ; and they ordained , with the consent of the whole nation , that none of the inhabitants should ever be permitted to quit this little kingdom ; and this has preserved our innocence and happiness . 
The Spaniards have had a confused notion of this country , and have called it El Dorado ; and an Englishman , whose name was Sir Walter Raleigh , came very near it about a hundred years ago ; but being surrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices , we have hitherto been sheltered from the rapaciousness of European nations , who have an inconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land , for the sake of which they would murder us to the last man . '' 
The conversation was long : it turned chiefly on their form of government , their manners , their women , their public entertainments , and the arts . 
At length Candide , having always had a taste for metaphysics , made Cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that country . 
The old man reddened a little . 
`` How then , '' said he , `` can you doubt it ? 
Do you take us for ungrateful wretches ? '' 
Cacambo humbly asked , `` What was the religion in El Dorado ? '' 
The old man reddened again . 
`` Can there be two religions ? '' 
said he . 
`` We have , I believe , the religion of all the world : we worship God night and morning . '' 
`` Do you worship but one God ? '' 
said Cacambo , who still acted as interpreter in representing Candide 's doubts . 
`` Surely , '' said the old man , `` there are not two , nor three , nor four . 
I must confess the people from your side of the world ask very extraordinary questions . '' 
Candide was not yet tired of interrogating the good old man ; he wanted to know in what manner they prayed to God in El Dorado . 
`` We do not pray to Him , '' said the worthy sage ; `` we have nothing to ask of Him ; He has given us all we need , and we return Him thanks without ceasing . '' 
Candide having a curiosity to see the priests asked where they were . 
The good old man smiled . 
`` My friend , '' said he , `` we are all priests . 
The King and all the heads of families sing solemn canticles of thanksgiving every morning , accompanied by five or six thousand musicians . '' 
`` What ! 
have you no monks who teach , who dispute , who govern , who cabal , and who burn people that are not of their opinion ? '' 
`` We must be mad , indeed , if that were the case , '' said the old man ; `` here we are all of one opinion , and we know not what you mean by monks . '' 
During this whole discourse Candide was in raptures , and he said to himself : `` This is vastly different from Westphalia and the Baron 's castle . 
Had our friend Pangloss seen El Dorado he would no longer have said that the castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was the finest upon earth . 
It is evident that one must travel . '' 
After this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep to be got ready , and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers to Court .
