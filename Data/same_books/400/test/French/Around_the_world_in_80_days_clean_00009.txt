But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . 
The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . 
Sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead . 
The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared ; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour . 
It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless . 
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg 's departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed . 
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed . 
In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain . 
In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season . 
Passepartout said nothing ; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam . 
On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to Mr. Fogg , and began to speak earnestly with him . 
Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy . 
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying . 
He finally managed to catch a few words , and was sure he heard his master say , `` You are certain of what you tell me ? '' 
`` Certain , sir , '' replied the engineer . 
`` You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux , we have n't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool . '' 
`` I will consider , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
Passepartout understood it all ; he was seized with mortal anxiety . 
The coal was giving out ! 
`` Ah , if my master can get over that , '' muttered he , `` he 'll be a famous man ! '' 
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard . 
`` Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ? '' 
`` Of course . '' 
`` Ass ! '' 
replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel . 
Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend ; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained . 
And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt ? 
It was difficult to imagine . 
Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , `` Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted . '' 
A few moments after , the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke . 
The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on ; but on the 18th , the engineer , as he had predicted , announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day . 
`` Do not let the fires go down , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` Keep them up to the last . 
Let the valves be filled . '' 
Towards noon Phileas Fogg , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy . 
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger . 
He went to the poop , saying to himself , `` He will be like a madman ! '' 
In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck . 
The bomb was Captain Speedy . 
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
were the first words his anger permitted him to utter . 
Had the poor man been an apoplectic , he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
he repeated , with purple face . 
`` Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool , '' replied Mr. Fogg , with imperturbable calmness . 
`` Pirate ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy . 
`` I have sent for you , sir -- '' `` Pickaroon ! '' '' 
-- sir , '' continued Mr. Fogg , `` to ask you to sell me your vessel . '' 
`` No ! 
By all the devils , no ! '' 
`` But I shall be obliged to burn her . '' 
`` Burn the Henrietta ! '' 
`` Yes ; at least the upper part of her . 
The coal has given out . '' 
`` Burn my vessel ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy , who could scarcely pronounce the words . 
`` A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars ! '' 
`` Here are sixty thousand , '' replied Phileas Fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills . 
This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy . 
An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars . 
The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger . 
The Henrietta was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain . 
The bomb would not go off after all . 
Mr. Fogg had taken away the match . 
`` And I shall still have the iron hull , '' said the captain in a softer tone . 
`` The iron hull and the engine . 
Is it agreed ? '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
And Andrew Speedy , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket . 
During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit . 
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft ! 
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank . 
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr. Fogg said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir . 
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December . 
I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool -- '' `` And I did well ! '' 
cried Andrew Speedy ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! '' 
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , Captain -- '' `` Fogg . '' 
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the Yankee about you . '' 
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr. Fogg said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? '' 
`` Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts -- all the wood , that is . '' 
`` Very well . 
Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . '' 
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed . 
On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires . 
Passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . 
There was a perfect rage for demolition . 
The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk . 
But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light . 
By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown . 
Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London ; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool , with all steam on . 
And the steam was about to give out altogether ! 
`` Sir , '' said Captain Speedy , who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg 's project , `` I really commiserate you . 
Everything is against you . 
We are only opposite Queenstown . '' 
`` Ah , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` is that place where we see the lights Queenstown ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Can we enter the harbour ? '' 
`` Not under three hours . 
Only at high tide . '' 
`` Stay , '' replied Mr. Fogg calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune . 
Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails . 
These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start ; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats , and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers . 
Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way . 
Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening . 
The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning , it then being high tide ; and Phileas Fogg , after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for . 
The party went on shore at once . 
Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot ; but he did not . 
Why ? 
What struggle was going on within him ? 
Had he changed his mind about `` his man '' ? 
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ? 
He did not , however , abandon Mr. Fogg . 
They all got upon the train , which was just ready to start , at half-past one ; at dawn of day they were in Dublin ; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which , disdaining to rise upon the waves , invariably cut through them . 
Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay , at twenty minutes before twelve , 21st December . 
He was only six hours distant from London . 
But at this moment Fix came up , put his hand upon Mr. Fogg 's shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , `` You are really Phileas Fogg ? '' 
`` I am . '' 
`` I arrest you in the Queen 's name ! '' 
Phileas Fogg was in prison . 
He had been shut up in the Custom House , and he was to be transferred to London the next day . 
Passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen . 
Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand . 
Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber . 
The young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly . 
As for Fix , he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty , whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not . 
The thought then struck Passepartout , that he was the cause of this new misfortune ! 
Had he not concealed Fix 's errand from his master ? 
When Fix revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told Mr. Fogg ? 
If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake ; at least , Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil . 
Passepartout wept till he was blind , and felt like blowing his brains out . 
Aouda and he had remained , despite the cold , under the portico of the Custom House . 
Neither wished to leave the place ; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again . 
That gentleman was really ruined , and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end . 
This arrest was fatal . 
Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December , he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club , that is , nine hours and a quarter ; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours . 
If anyone , at this moment , had entered the Custom House , he would have found Mr. Fogg seated , motionless , calm , and without apparent anger , upon a wooden bench . 
He was not , it is true , resigned ; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion . 
Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages , all the more terrible because contained , and which only burst forth , with an irresistible force , at the last moment ? 
No one could tell . 
There he sat , calmly waiting -- for what ? 
Did he still cherish hope ? 
Did he still believe , now that the door of this prison was closed upon him , that he would succeed ? 
However that may have been , Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table , and observed its advancing hands . 
Not a word escaped his lips , but his look was singularly set and stern . 
The situation , in any event , was a terrible one , and might be thus stated : if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined ; if he was a knave , he was caught . 
Did escape occur to him ? 
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ? 
Did he think of escaping from it ? 
Possibly ; for once he walked slowly around the room . 
But the door was locked , and the window heavily barred with iron rods . 
He sat down again , and drew his journal from his pocket . 
On the line where these words were written , `` 21st December , Saturday , Liverpool , '' he added , `` 80th day , 11.40 a.m. , '' and waited . 
The Custom House clock struck one . 
Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast . 
Two hours ! 
Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train , he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before nine , p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled . 
At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside , then a hasty opening of doors . 
Passepartout 's voice was audible , and immediately after that of Fix . 
Phileas Fogg 's eyes brightened for an instant . 
The door swung open , and he saw Passepartout , Aouda , and Fix , who hurried towards him . 
Fix was out of breath , and his hair was in disorder . 
He could not speak . 
`` Sir , '' he stammered , `` sir -- forgive me -- most -- unfortunate resemblance -- robber arrested three days ago -- you are free ! '' 
Phileas Fogg was free ! 
He walked to the detective , looked him steadily in the face , and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life , or which he ever would make , drew back his arms , and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down . 
`` Well hit ! '' 
cried Passepartout , `` Parbleu ! 
that 's what you might call a good application of English fists ! '' 
Fix , who found himself on the floor , did not utter a word . 
He had only received his deserts . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout left the Custom House without delay , got into a cab , and in a few moments descended at the station . 
Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for London . 
It was forty minutes past two . 
The express train had left thirty-five minutes before . 
Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train . 
There were several rapid locomotives on hand ; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock . 
At that hour Phileas Fogg , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards London with Aouda and his faithful servant . 
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout . 
But there were forced delays , and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine . 
Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes . 
He had lost the wager ! 
The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day , if they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home . 
His doors and windows were still closed , no appearance of change was visible . 
After leaving the station , Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions , and quietly went to his domicile . 
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity . 
Ruined ! 
And by the blundering of the detective ! 
After having steadily traversed that long journey , overcome a hundred obstacles , braved many dangers , and still found time to do some good on his way , to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen , and against which he was unarmed ; it was terrible ! 
But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him . 
There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings , and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club . 
So great had been the expense of his tour that , even had he won , it would not have enriched him ; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself , being a man who rather laid wagers for honour 's sake than for the stake proposed . 
But this wager totally ruined him . 
Mr. Fogg 's course , however , was fully decided upon ; he knew what remained for him to do . 
A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda , who was overwhelmed with grief at her protector 's misfortune . 
From the words which Mr. Fogg dropped , she saw that he was meditating some serious project . 
Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing . 
First of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days . 
He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear . 
The night passed . 
Mr. Fogg went to bed , but did he sleep ? 
Aouda did not once close her eyes . 
Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his master 's door . 
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get Aouda 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself . 
He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights . 
In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment 's conversation with the young lady . 
Passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them . 
He looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him . 
His heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster . 
Yes ! 
if he had warned Mr. Fogg , and had betrayed Fix 's projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to Liverpool , and then -- Passepartout could hold in no longer . 
`` My master ! 
Mr. Fogg ! '' 
he cried , `` why do you not curse me ? 
It was my fault that -- '' `` I blame no one , '' returned Phileas Fogg , with perfect calmness . 
`` Go ! '' 
Passepartout left the room , and went to find Aouda , to whom he delivered his master 's message . 
`` Madam , '' he added , `` I can do nothing myself -- nothing ! 
I have no influence over my master ; but you , perhaps -- '' `` What influence could I have ? '' 
replied Aouda . 
`` Mr. Fogg is influenced by no one . 
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ? 
Has he ever read my heart ? 
My friend , he must not be left alone an instant ! 
You say he is going to speak with me this evening ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in England . '' 
`` We shall see , '' replied Aouda , becoming suddenly pensive . 
Throughout this day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- the house in Saville Row was as if uninhabited , and Phileas Fogg , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven . 
Why should he present himself at the Reform ? 
His friends no longer expected him there . 
As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before -LRB- Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine -RRB- , he had lost his wager . 
It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds ; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands , and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit . 
Mr. Fogg , therefore , had no reason for going out , and so he remained at home . 
He shut himself up in his room , and busied himself putting his affairs in order . 
Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs . 
The hours were long for him . 
He listened at his master 's door , and looked through the keyhole , as if he had a perfect right so to do , and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment . 
Sometimes he thought of Fix , but no longer in anger . 
Fix , like all the world , had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg , and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him ; while he , Passepartout ... . 
This thought haunted him , and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly . 
Finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at Aouda 's door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman . 
Aouda was still pensive . 
About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda would receive him , and in a few moments he found himself alone with her . 
Phileas Fogg took a chair , and sat down near the fireplace , opposite Aouda . 
No emotion was visible on his face . 
Fogg returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away ; there was the same calm , the same impassibility . 
He sat several minutes without speaking ; then , bending his eyes on Aouda , `` Madam , '' said he , `` will you pardon me for bringing you to England ? '' 
`` I , Mr. Fogg ! '' 
replied Aouda , checking the pulsations of her heart . 
`` Please let me finish , '' returned Mr. Fogg . 
`` When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal ; then your existence would have been free and happy . 
But now I am ruined . '' 
`` I know it , Mr. Fogg , '' replied Aouda ; `` and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows ? 
-- for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? '' 
`` Madam , you could not remain in India , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . '' 
`` So , Mr. Fogg , '' resumed Aouda , `` not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me . 
Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service . '' 
`` But what will become of you , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` As for me , madam , '' replied the gentleman , coldly , `` I have need of nothing . '' 
`` But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ? '' 
`` As I am in the habit of doing . '' 
`` At least , '' said Aouda , `` want should not overtake a man like you . 
Your friends -- '' `` I have no friends , madam . '' 
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . '' 
`` I pity you , then , Mr. Fogg , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs . 
They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience . '' 
`` They say so , madam . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' said Aouda , rising and seizing his hand , `` do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ? 
Will you have me for your wife ? '' 
Mr. Fogg , at this , rose in his turn . 
There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips . 
Aouda looked into his face . 
The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him . 
He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look . 
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! '' 
he said , simply . 
`` Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Aouda , pressing his hand to her heart . 
Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately . 
Mr. Fogg still held Aouda 's hand in his own ; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith . 
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson , of Marylebone parish , that evening . 
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile , and said , `` Never too late . '' 
It was five minutes past eight . 
`` Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ? '' 
`` For to-morrow , Monday , '' said Mr. Fogg , turning to Aouda . 
`` Yes ; for to-morrow , Monday , '' she replied . 
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him . 
It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber , a certain James Strand , had been arrested , on the 17th day of December , at Edinburgh . 
Three days before , Phileas Fogg had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police ; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world . 
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made . 
Phileas Fogg 's name was once more at a premium on ` Change . 
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense . 
Would Phileas Fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes ! 
Where was he at this moment ? 
The 17th of December , the day of James Strand 's arrest , was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg 's departure , and no news of him had been received . 
Was he dead ? 
Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ? 
And would he appear on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon ? 
The anxiety in which , for three days , London society existed , can not be described . 
Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg . 
Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening . 
No news . 
The police were ignorant what had become of the detective , Fix , who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent . 
Bets increased , nevertheless , in number and value . 
Phileas Fogg , like a racehorse , was drawing near his last turning-point . 
The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour . 
A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the Reform Club . 
Circulation was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on . 
The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch . 
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club . 
John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , the bankers , Andrew Stuart , the engineer , Gauthier Ralph , the director of the Bank of England , and Thomas Flanagan , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously . 
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , Andrew Stuart got up , saying , `` Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired . '' 
`` What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool ? '' 
asked Thomas Flanagan . 
`` At twenty-three minutes past seven , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve . '' 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' resumed Andrew Stuart , `` if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train , he would have got here by this time . 
We can , therefore , regard the bet as won . '' 
`` Wait ; do n't let us be too hasty , '' replied Samuel Fallentin . 
`` You know that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric . 
His punctuality is well known ; he never arrives too soon , or too late ; and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute . '' 
`` Why , '' said Andrew Stuart nervously , `` if I should see him , I should not believe it was he . '' 
`` The fact is , '' resumed Thomas Flanagan , `` Mr. Fogg 's project was absurdly foolish . 
Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur ; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour . '' 
`` Observe , too , '' added John Sullivan , `` that we have received no intelligence from him , though there are telegraphic lines all along his route . '' 
`` He has lost , gentleman , '' said Andrew Stuart , `` he has a hundred times lost ! 
You know , besides , that the China the only steamer he could have taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday . 
I have seen a list of the passengers , and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among them . 
Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him , he can scarcely have reached America . 
I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand . '' 
`` It is clear , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and we have nothing to do but to present Mr. Fogg 's cheque at Barings to-morrow . '' 
At this moment , the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine . 
`` Five minutes more , '' said Andrew Stuart . 
The five gentlemen looked at each other . 
Their anxiety was becoming intense ; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to Mr. Fallentin 's proposal of a rubber . 
`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said Andrew Stuart , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . '' 
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine . 
The players took up their cards , but could not keep their eyes off the clock . 
Certainly , however secure they felt , minutes had never seemed so long to them ! 
`` Seventeen minutes to nine , '' said Thomas Flanagan , as he cut the cards which Ralph handed to him . 
Then there was a moment of silence . 
The great saloon was perfectly quiet ; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard , with now and then a shrill cry . 
The pendulum beat the seconds , which each player eagerly counted , as he listened , with mathematical regularity . 
`` Sixteen minutes to nine ! '' 
said John Sullivan , in a voice which betrayed his emotion . 
One minute more , and the wager would be won . 
Andrew Stuart and his partners suspended their game . 
They left their cards , and counted the seconds . 
At the fortieth second , nothing . 
At the fiftieth , still nothing . 
At the fifty-fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls . 
The players rose from their seats . 
At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened ; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg appeared , followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors , and in his calm voice , said , `` Here I am , gentlemen ! '' 
Yes ; Phileas Fogg in person . 
The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening -- about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in London -- Passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriage ceremony , which was to take place the next day . 
Passepartout went on his errand enchanted . 
He soon reached the clergyman 's house , but found him not at home . 
Passepartout waited a good twenty minutes , and when he left the reverend gentleman , it was thirty-five minutes past eight . 
But in what a state he was ! 
With his hair in disorder , and without his hat , he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before , overturning passers-by , rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout . 
In three minutes he was in Saville Row again , and staggered back into Mr. Fogg 's room . 
He could not speak . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` My master ! '' 
gasped Passepartout -- `` marriage -- impossible -- '' `` Impossible ? '' 
`` Impossible -- for to-morrow . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because to-morrow -- is Sunday ! '' 
`` Monday , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` No -- to-day is Saturday . '' 
`` Saturday ? 
Impossible ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , yes , yes ! '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` You have made a mistake of one day ! 
We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time ; but there are only ten minutes left ! '' 
Passepartout had seized his master by the collar , and was dragging him along with irresistible force . 
Phileas Fogg , thus kidnapped , without having time to think , left his house , jumped into a cab , promised a hundred pounds to the cabman , and , having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages , reached the Reform Club . 
The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon . 
Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days ! 
Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds ! 
How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day ? 
How came he to think that he had arrived in London on Saturday , the twenty-first day of December , when it was really Friday , the twentieth , the seventy-ninth day only from his departure ? 
The cause of the error is very simple . 
Phileas Fogg had , without suspecting it , gained one day on his journey , and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward ; he would , on the contrary , have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction , that is , westward . 
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . 
There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty-four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . 
In other words , while Phileas Fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times . 
This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday , and not Sunday , as Mr. Fogg thought . 
And Passepartout 's famous family watch , which had always kept London time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes ! 
Phileas Fogg , then , had won the twenty thousand pounds ; but , as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way , the pecuniary gain was small . 
His object was , however , to be victorious , and not to win money . 
He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix , against whom he cherished no grudge . 
He deducted , however , from Passepartout 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity . 
That evening , Mr. Fogg , as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever , said to Aouda : `` Is our marriage still agreeable to you ? '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' replied she , `` it is for me to ask that question . 
You were ruined , but now you are rich again . ''
