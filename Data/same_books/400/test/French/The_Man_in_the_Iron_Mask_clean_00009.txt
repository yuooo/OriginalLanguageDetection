At last , as the light of the royal chamber faded away into darkness and gloom , something cold , gloomy , and inexplicable in its nature seemed to infect the air . 
No paintings , nor gold , nor velvet hangings , were visible any longer , nothing but walls of a dull gray color , which the increasing gloom made darker every moment . 
And yet the bed still continued to descend , and after a minute , which seemed in its duration almost an age to the king , it reached a stratum of air , black and chill as death , and then it stopped . 
The king could no longer see the light in his room , except as from the bottom of a well we can see the light of day . 
`` I am under the influence of some atrocious dream , '' he thought . 
`` It is time to awaken from it . 
Come ! 
let me wake . '' 
Every one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys ; there is hardly a person who , in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is suffocating , has not said to himself , by the help of that light which still burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished , `` It is nothing but a dream , after all . '' 
This was precisely what Louis XIV . 
said to himself ; but when he said , `` Come , come ! 
wake up , '' he perceived that not only was he already awake , but still more , that he had his eyes open also . 
And then he looked all round him . 
On his right hand and on his left two armed men stood in stolid silence , each wrapped in a huge cloak , and the face covered with a mask ; one of them held a small lamp in his hand , whose glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king could look upon . 
Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream still lasted , and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was to move his arms or to say something aloud ; he darted from his bed , and found himself upon the damp , moist ground . 
Then , addressing himself to the man who held the lamp in his hand , he said : `` What is this , monsieur , and what is the meaning of this jest ? '' 
`` It is no jest , '' replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the lantern . 
`` Do you belong to M. Fouquet ? '' 
inquired the king , greatly astonished at his situation . 
`` It matters very little to whom we belong , '' said the phantom ; `` we are your masters now , that is sufficient . '' 
The king , more impatient than intimidated , turned to the other masked figure . 
`` If this is a comedy , '' he said , `` you will tell M. Fouquet that I find it unseemly and improper , and that I command it should cease . '' 
The second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a man of huge stature and vast circumference . 
He held himself erect and motionless as any block of marble . 
`` Well ! '' 
added the king , stamping his foot , `` you do not answer ! '' 
`` We do not answer you , my good monsieur , '' said the giant , in a stentorian voice , `` because there is nothing to say . '' 
`` At least , tell me what you want , '' exclaimed Louis , folding his arms with a passionate gesture . 
`` You will know by and by , '' replied the man who held the lamp . 
`` In the meantime tell me where I am . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Louis looked all round him ; but by the light of the lamp which the masked figure raised for the purpose , he could perceive nothing but the damp walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the snail . 
`` Oh -- oh ! 
-- a dungeon , '' cried the king . 
`` No , a subterranean passage . '' 
`` Which leads -- ? '' 
`` Will you be good enough to follow us ? '' 
`` I shall not stir from hence ! '' 
cried the king . 
`` If you are obstinate , my dear young friend , '' replied the taller of the two , `` I will lift you up in my arms , and roll you up in your own cloak , and if you should happen to be stifled , why -- so much the worse for you . '' 
As he said this , he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which Milo of Crotona would have envied him the possession , on the day when he had that unhappy idea of rending his last oak . 
The king dreaded violence , for he could well believe that the two men into whose power he had fallen had not gone so far with any idea of drawing back , and that they would consequently be ready to proceed to extremities , if necessary . 
He shook his head and said : `` It seems I have fallen into the hands of a couple of assassins . 
Move on , then . '' 
Neither of the men answered a word to this remark . 
The one who carried the lantern walked first , the king followed him , while the second masked figure closed the procession . 
In this manner they passed along a winding gallery of some length , with as many staircases leading out of it as are to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe 's creation . 
All these windings and turnings , during which the king heard the sound of running water over his head , ended at last in a long corridor closed by an iron door . 
The figure with the lamp opened the door with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle , where , during the whole of the brief journey , the king had heard them rattle . 
As soon as the door was opened and admitted the air , Louis recognized the balmy odors that trees exhale in hot summer nights . 
He paused , hesitatingly , for a moment or two ; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him out of the subterranean passage . 
`` Another blow , '' said the king , turning towards the one who had just had the audacity to touch his sovereign ; `` what do you intend to do with the king of France ? '' 
`` Try to forget that word , '' replied the man with the lamp , in a tone which as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of Minos . 
`` You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just made use of , '' said the giant , as he extinguished the lamp his companion handed to him ; `` but the king is too kind-hearted . '' 
Louis , at that threat , made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if he meditated flight ; but the giant 's hand was in a moment placed on his shoulder , and fixed him motionless where he stood . 
`` But tell me , at least , where we are going , '' said the king . 
`` Come , '' replied the former of the two men , with a kind of respect in his manner , and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be in waiting . 
The carriage was completely concealed amid the trees . 
Two horses , with their feet fettered , were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of a large oak . 
`` Get in , '' said the same man , opening the carriage-door and letting down the step . 
The king obeyed , seated himself at the back of the carriage , the padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and his guide . 
As for the giant , he cut the fastenings by which the horses were bound , harnessed them himself , and mounted on the box of the carriage , which was unoccupied . 
The carriage set off immediately at a quick trot , turned into the road to Paris , and in the forest of Senart found a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the first horses had been , and without a postilion . 
The man on the box changed the horses , and continued to follow the road towards Paris with the same rapidity , so that they entered the city about three o'clock in the morning . 
They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , and , after having called out to the sentinel , `` By the king 's order , '' the driver conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile , looking out upon the courtyard , called La Cour du Gouvernement . 
There the horses drew up , reeking with sweat , at the flight of steps , and a sergeant of the guard ran forward . 
`` Go and wake the governor , '' said the coachman in a voice of thunder . 
With the exception of this voice , which might have been heard at the entrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , everything remained as calm in the carriage as in the prison . 
Ten minutes afterwards , M. de Baisemeaux appeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door . 
`` What is the matter now ? '' 
he asked ; `` and whom have you brought me there ? '' 
The man with the lantern opened the carriage-door , and said two or three words to the one who acted as driver , who immediately got down from his seat , took up a short musket which he kept under his feet , and placed its muzzle on his prisoner 's chest . 
`` And fire at once if he speaks ! '' 
added aloud the man who alighted from the carriage . 
`` Very good , '' replied his companion , without another remark . 
With this recommendation , the person who had accompanied the king in the carriage ascended the flight of steps , at the top of which the governor was awaiting him . 
`` Monsieur d'Herblay ! '' 
said the latter . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Let us go into your room . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
what brings you here at this hour ? '' 
`` A mistake , my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' Aramis replied , quietly . 
`` It appears that you were quite right the other day . '' 
`` What about ? '' 
inquired the governor . 
`` About the order of release , my dear friend . '' 
`` Tell me what you mean , monsieur -- no , monseigneur , '' said the governor , almost suffocated by surprise and terror . 
`` It is a very simple affair : you remember , dear M. de Baisemeaux , that an order of release was sent to you . '' 
`` Yes , for Marchiali . '' 
`` Very good ! 
we both thought that it was for Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you will recollect , however , that I would not credit it , but that you compelled me to believe it . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Baisemeaux , my good fellow , what a word to make use of ! 
-- strongly recommended , that was all . '' 
`` Strongly recommended , yes ; strongly recommended to give him up to you ; and that you carried him off with you in your carriage . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , it was a mistake ; it was discovered at the ministry , so that I now bring you an order from the king to set at liberty Seldon , -- that poor Seldon fellow , you know . '' 
`` Seldon ! 
are you sure this time ? '' 
`` Well , read it yourself , '' added Aramis , handing him the order . 
`` Why , '' said Baisemeaux , `` this order is the very same that has already passed through my hands . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening . 
Parbleu ! 
I recognize it by the blot of ink . '' 
`` I do not know whether it is that ; but all I know is , that I bring it for you . '' 
`` But then , what about the other ? '' 
`` What other ? '' 
`` Marchiali . '' 
`` I have got him here with me . '' 
`` But that is not enough for me . 
I require a new order to take him back again . '' 
`` Do n't talk such nonsense , my dear Baisemeaux ; you talk like a child ! 
Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali ? '' 
Baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out . 
Aramis seized hold of it , coolly tore it in four pieces , held them to the lamp , and burnt them . 
`` Good heavens ! 
what are you doing ? '' 
exclaimed Baisemeaux , in an extremity of terror . 
`` Look at your position quietly , my good governor , '' said Aramis , with imperturbable self-possession , `` and you will see how very simple the whole affair is . 
You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali 's release . '' 
`` I am a lost man ! '' 
`` Far from it , my good fellow , since I have brought Marchiali back to you , and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , completely overcome by terror . 
`` Plain enough , you see ; and you will go and shut him up immediately . '' 
`` I should think so , indeed . '' 
`` And you will hand over this Seldon to me , whose liberation is authorized by this order . 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` I -- I -- '' `` You do understand , I see , '' said Aramis . 
`` Very good . '' 
Baisemeaux clapped his hands together . 
`` But why , at all events , after having taken Marchiali away from me , do you bring him back again ? '' 
cried the unhappy governor , in a paroxysm of terror , and completely dumbfounded . 
`` For a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis -- `` for so devoted a servant , I have no secrets ; '' and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux 's ear , as he said , in a low tone of voice , `` you know the resemblance between that unfortunate fellow , and -- '' `` And the king ? 
-- yes ! '' 
`` Very good ; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to persist -- Can you guess what ? '' 
`` How is it likely I should guess ? '' 
`` To persist in saying that he was king of France ; to dress himself up in clothes like those of the king ; and then pretend to assume that he was the king himself . '' 
`` Gracious heavens ! '' 
`` That is the reason why I have brought him back again , my dear friend . 
He is mad and lets every one see how mad he is . '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` That is very simple ; let no one hold any communication with him . 
You understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king 's ears , the king , who had pitied his terrible affliction , and saw that all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude , became perfectly furious ; so that , now -- and remember this very distinctly , dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , for it concerns you most closely -- so that there is now , I repeat , sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself . 
You understand , Baisemeaux , sentence of death ! '' 
`` You need not ask me whether I understand . '' 
`` And now , let us go down , and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon again , unless you prefer he should come up here . '' 
`` What would be the good of that ? '' 
`` It would be better , perhaps , to enter his name in the prison-book at once ! '' 
`` Of course , certainly ; not a doubt of it . '' 
`` In that case , have him up . '' 
Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung , as a warning to every one to retire , in order to avoid meeting a prisoner , about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery . 
Then , when the passages were free , he went to take the prisoner from the carriage , at whose breast Porthos , faithful to the directions which had been given him , still kept his musket leveled . 
`` Ah ! 
is that you , miserable wretch ? '' 
cried the governor , as soon as he perceived the king . 
`` Very good , very good . '' 
And immediately , making the king get out of the carriage , he led him , still accompanied by Porthos , who had not taken off his mask , and Aramis , who again resumed his , up the stairs , to the second Bertaudiere , and opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had bemoaned his existence . 
The king entered the cell without pronouncing a single word : he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily . 
Baisemeaux shut the door upon him , turned the key twice in the lock , and then returned to Aramis . 
`` It is quite true , '' he said , in a low tone , `` that he bears a striking resemblance to the king ; but less so than you said . '' 
`` So that , '' said Aramis , `` you would not have been deceived by the substitution of the one for the other ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` You are a most valuable fellow , Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and now , set Seldon free . '' 
`` Oh , yes . 
I was going to forget that . 
I will go and give orders at once . '' 
`` Bah ! 
to-morrow will be time enough . '' 
`` To-morrow ! 
-- oh , no . 
This very minute . '' 
`` Well ; go off to your affairs , I will go away to mine . 
But it is quite understood , is it not ? '' 
`` What ` is quite understood ' ? '' 
`` That no one is to enter the prisoner 's cell , expect with an order from the king ; an order which I will myself bring . '' 
`` Quite so . 
Adieu , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis returned to his companion . 
`` Now , Porthos , my good fellow , back again to Vaux , and as fast as possible . '' 
`` A man is light and easy enough , when he has faithfully served his king ; and , in serving him , saved his country , '' said Porthos . 
`` The horses will be as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven . 
So let us be off . '' 
And the carriage , lightened of a prisoner , who might well be -- as he in fact was -- very heavy in the sight of Aramis , passed across the drawbridge of the Bastile , which was raised again immediately behind it . 
Pain , anguish , and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed . 
We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man 's capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him ; for that , indeed , would not be true , since Heaven permits the existence of death , which is , sometimes , the only refuge open to those who are too closely pressed -- too bitterly afflicted , as far as the body is concerned . 
Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded ; in other words , the weak suffer more , where the trial is the same , than the strong . 
And what are the elementary principles , we may ask , that compose human strength ? 
Is it not -- more than anything else -- exercise , habit , experience ? 
We shall not even take the trouble to demonstrate this , for it is an axiom in morals , as in physics . 
When the young king , stupefied and crushed in every sense and feeling , found himself led to a cell in the Bastile , he fancied death itself is but a sleep ; that it , too , has its dreams as well ; that the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux ; that death had resulted from the occurrence ; and that , still carrying out his dream , the king , Louis XIV. , now no longer living , was dreaming one of those horrors , impossible to realize in life , which is termed dethronement , imprisonment , and insult towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power . 
To be present at -- an actual witness , too -- of this bitterness of death ; to float , indecisively , in an incomprehensible mystery , between resemblance and reality ; to hear everything , to see everything , without interfering in a single detail of agonizing suffering , was -- so the king thought within himself -- a torture far more terrible , since it might last forever . 
`` Is this what is termed eternity -- hell ? '' 
he murmured , at the moment the door was closed upon him , which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands . 
He did not even look round him ; and in the room , leaning with his back against the wall , he allowed himself to be carried away by the terrible supposition that he was already dead , as he closed his eyes , in order to avoid looking upon something even worse still . 
`` How can I have died ? '' 
he said to himself , sick with terror . 
`` The bed might have been let down by some artificial means ? 
But no ! 
I do not remember to have felt a bruise , nor any shock either . 
Would they not rather have poisoned me at my meals , or with the fumes of wax , as they did my ancestress , Jeanne d'Albret ? '' 
Suddenly , the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis 's shoulders . 
`` I have seen , '' he said , `` my father lying dead upon his funeral couch , in his regal robes . 
That pale face , so calm and worn ; those hands , once so skillful , lying nerveless by his side ; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death ; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams . 
And yet , how numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse -- him whom so many others had preceded , hurried away by him into eternal death ! 
No , that king was still the king : he was enthroned still upon that funeral couch , as upon a velvet armchair ; he had not abdicated one title of his majesty . 
God , who had not punished him , can not , will not punish me , who have done nothing . '' 
A strange sound attracted the young man 's attention . 
He looked round him , and saw on the mantel-shelf , just below an enormous crucifix , coarsely painted in fresco on the wall , a rat of enormous size engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread , but fixing all the time , an intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell . 
The king could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust : he moved back towards the door , uttering a loud cry ; and as if he but needed this cry , which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously , to recognize himself , Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his natural senses . 
`` A prisoner ! '' 
he cried . 
`` I -- I , a prisoner ! '' 
He looked round him for a bell to summon some one to him . 
`` There are no bells in the Bastile , '' he said , `` and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned . 
In what way can I have been made a prisoner ? 
It must have been owing to a conspiracy of M. Fouquet . 
I have been drawn to Vaux , as to a snare . 
M. Fouquet can not be acting alone in this affair . 
His agent -- That voice that I but just now heard was M. d'Herblay 's ; I recognized it . 
Colbert was right , then . 
But what is Fouquet 's object ? 
To reign in my place and stead ? 
-- Impossible . 
Yet who knows ! '' 
thought the king , relapsing into gloom again . 
`` Perhaps my brother , the Duc d'Orleans , is doing that which my uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father . 
But the queen ? 
-- My mother , too ? 
And La Valliere ? 
Oh ! 
La Valliere , she will have been abandoned to Madame . 
Dear , dear girl ! 
Yes , it is -- it must be so . 
They have shut her up as they have me . 
We are separated forever ! '' 
And at this idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of tears and sobs and groans . 
`` There is a governor in this place , '' the king continued , in a fury of passion ; `` I will speak to him , I will summon him to me . '' 
He called -- no voice replied to his . 
He seized hold of his chair , and hurled it against the massive oaken door . 
The wood resounded against the door , and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the staircase ; but from a human creature , none . 
This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was held at the Bastile . 
Therefore , when his first fit of anger had passed away , having remarked a barred window through which there passed a stream of light , lozenge-shaped , which must be , he knew , the bright orb of approaching day , Louis began to call out , at first gently enough , then louder and louder still ; but no one replied . 
Twenty other attempts which he made , one after another , obtained no other or better success . 
His blood began to boil within him , and mount to his head . 
His nature was such , that , accustomed to command , he trembled at the idea of disobedience . 
The prisoner broke the chair , which was too heavy for him to lift , and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the door . 
He struck so loudly , and so repeatedly , that the perspiration soon began to pour down his face . 
The sound became tremendous and continuous ; certain stifled , smothered cries replied in different directions . 
This sound produced a strange effect upon the king . 
He paused to listen ; it was the voice of the prisoners , formerly his victims , now his companions . 
The voices ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings and the massive walls , and rose in accusations against the author of this noise , as doubtless their sighs and tears accused , in whispered tones , the author of their captivity . 
After having deprived so many people of their liberty , the king came among them to rob them of their rest . 
This idea almost drove him mad ; it redoubled his strength , or rather his will , bent upon obtaining some information , or a conclusion to the affair . 
With a portion of the broken chair he recommenced the noise . 
At the end of an hour , Louis heard something in the corridor , behind the door of his cell , and a violent blow , which was returned upon the door itself , made him cease his own . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
said a rude , brutal voice . 
`` What is the matter with you this morning ? '' 
`` This morning ! '' 
thought the king ; but he said aloud , politely , `` Monsieur , are you the governor of the Bastile ? '' 
`` My good fellow , your head is out of sorts , '' replied the voice ; `` but that is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance . 
Be quiet ; mordioux ! '' 
`` Are you the governor ? '' 
the king inquired again . 
He heard a door on the corridor close ; the jailer had just left , not condescending to reply a single word . 
When the king had assured himself of his departure , his fury knew no longer any bounds . 
As agile as a tiger , he leaped from the table to the window , and struck the iron bars with all his might . 
He broke a pane of glass , the pieces of which fell clanking into the courtyard below . 
He shouted with increasing hoarseness , `` The governor , the governor ! '' 
This excess lasted fully an hour , during which time he was in a burning fever . 
With his hair in disorder and matted on his forehead , his dress torn and covered with dust and plaster , his linen in shreds , the king never rested until his strength was utterly exhausted , and it was not until then that he clearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls , the impenetrable nature of the cement , invincible to every influence but that of time , and that he possessed no other weapon but despair . 
He leaned his forehead against the door , and let the feverish throbbings of his heart calm by degrees ; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation would have made it burst . 
`` A moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will be brought to me . 
I shall then see some one , I shall speak to him , and get an answer . '' 
And the king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the prisoners was served at the Bastile ; he was ignorant even of this detail . 
The feeling of remorse at this remembrance smote him like the thrust of a dagger , that he should have lived for five and twenty years a king , and in the enjoyment of every happiness , without having bestowed a moment 's thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived of their liberty . 
The king blushed for very shame . 
He felt that Heaven , in permitting this fearful humiliation , did no more than render to the man the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many others . 
Nothing could be more efficacious for reawakening his mind to religious influences than the prostration of his heart and mind and soul beneath the feeling of such acute wretchedness . 
But Louis dared not even kneel in prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial . 
`` Heaven is right , '' he said ; `` Heaven acts wisely . 
It would be cowardly to pray to Heaven for that which I have so often refused my own fellow-creatures . '' 
He had reached this stage of his reflections , that is , of his agony of mind , when a similar noise was again heard behind his door , followed this time by the sound of the key in the lock , and of the bolts being withdrawn from their staples . 
The king bounded forward to be nearer to the person who was about to enter , but , suddenly reflecting that it was a movement unworthy of a sovereign , he paused , assumed a noble and calm expression , which for him was easy enough , and waited with his back turned towards the window , in order , to some extent , to conceal his agitation from the eyes of the person who was about to enter . 
It was only a jailer with a basket of provisions . 
The king looked at the man with restless anxiety , and waited until he spoke . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the latter , `` you have broken your chair . 
I said you had done so ! 
Why , you have gone quite mad . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said the king , `` be careful what you say ; it will be a very serious affair for you . '' 
The jailer placed the basket on the table , and looked at his prisoner steadily . 
`` What do you say ? '' 
he said . 
`` Desire the governor to come to me , '' added the king , in accents full of calm and dignity . 
`` Come , my boy , '' said the turnkey , `` you have always been very quiet and reasonable , but you are getting vicious , it seems , and I wish you to know it in time . 
You have broken your chair , and made a great disturbance ; that is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one of the lower dungeons . 
Promise me not to begin over again , and I will not say a word about it to the governor . '' 
`` I wish to see the governor , '' replied the king , still governing his passions . 
`` He will send you off to one of the dungeons , I tell you ; so take care . '' 
`` I insist upon it , do you hear ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! 
your eyes are becoming wild again . 
Very good ! 
I shall take away your knife . '' 
And the jailer did what he said , quitted the prisoner , and closed the door , leaving the king more astounded , more wretched , more isolated than ever . 
It was useless , though he tried it , to make the same noise again on his door , and equally useless that he threw the plates and dishes out of the window ; not a single sound was heard in recognition . 
Two hours afterwards he could not be recognized as a king , a gentleman , a man , a human being ; he might rather be called a madman , tearing the door with his nails , trying to tear up the flooring of his cell , and uttering such wild and fearful cries that the old Bastile seemed to tremble to its very foundations for having revolted against its master . 
As for the governor , the jailer did not even think of disturbing him ; the turnkeys and the sentinels had reported the occurrence to him , but what was the good of it ? 
Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison ? 
and were not the walls still stronger ? 
M. de Baisemeaux , thoroughly impressed with what Aramis had told him , and in perfect conformity with the king 's order , hoped only that one thing might happen ; namely , that the madman Marchiali might be mad enough to hang himself to the canopy of his bed , or to one of the bars of the window . 
In fact , the prisoner was anything but a profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux , and became more annoying than agreeable to him . 
These complications of Seldon and Marchiali -- the complications first of setting at liberty and then imprisoning again , the complications arising from the strong likeness in question -- had at last found a very proper denouement . 
Baisemeaux even thought he had remarked that D'Herblay himself was not altogether dissatisfied with the result . 
`` And then , really , '' said Baisemeaux to his next in command , `` an ordinary prisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner ; he suffers quite enough , indeed , to induce one to hope , charitably enough , that his death may not be far distant . 
With still greater reason , accordingly , when the prisoner has gone mad , and might bite and make a terrible disturbance in the Bastile ; why , in such a case , it is not simply an act of mere charity to wish him dead ; it would be almost a good and even commendable action , quietly to have him put out of his misery . '' 
And the good-natured governor thereupon sat down to his late breakfast . 
D'Artagnan , still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just had with the king , could not resist asking himself if he were really in possession of his senses , if he were really and truly at Vaux ; if he , D'Artagnan , were really the captain of the musketeers , and M. Fouquet the owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV . 
was at that moment partaking of his hospitality . 
These reflections were not those of a drunken man , although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux , and the surintendant 's wines had met with a distinguished reception at the fete . 
The Gascon , however , was a man of calm self-possession ; and no sooner did he touch his bright steel blade , than he knew how to adopt morally the cold , keen weapon as his guide of action . 
`` Well , '' he said , as he quitted the royal apartment , `` I seem now to be mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the minister ; it will be written , that M. d'Artagnan , a younger son of a Gascon family , placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet , the surintendant of the finances of France . 
My descendants , if I have any , will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest will confer , just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with regard to the estates of the poor Marechal d'Ancre . 
But the thing is , how best to execute the king 's directions in a proper manner . 
Any man would know how to say to M. Fouquet , ` Your sword , monsieur . ' 
But it is not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without others knowing anything about it . 
How am I to manage , then , so that M. le surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace ; that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him ; that after having been steeped to his lips , as it were , in all the perfumes and incense of Ahasuerus , he is transferred to the gallows of Haman ; in other words , of Enguerrand de Marigny ? '' 
And at this reflection , D'Artagnan 's brow became clouded with perplexity . 
The musketeer had certain scruples on the matter , it must be admitted . 
To deliver up to death -LRB- for not a doubt existed that Louis hated Fouquet mortally -RRB- the man who had just shown himself so delightful and charming a host in every way , was a real insult to one 's conscience . 
`` It almost seems , '' said D'Artagnan to himself , `` that if I am not a poor , mean , miserable fellow , I should let M. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him . 
Yet , if I betray my master 's secret , I shall be a false-hearted , treacherous knave , a traitor , too , a crime provided for and punishable by military laws -- so much so , indeed , that twenty times , in former days when wars were rife , I have seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing , in but a small degree , what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a great scale now . 
No , I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought to get out of this difficulty with more skill than that . 
And now , let us admit that I do possess a little readiness of invention ; it is not at all certain , though , for , after having for forty years absorbed so large a quantity , I shall be lucky if there were to be a pistole 's - worth left . '' 
D'Artagnan buried his head in his hands , tore at his mustache in sheer vexation , and added , `` What can be the reason of M. Fouquet 's disgrace ? 
There seem to be three good ones : the first , because M. Colbert does n't like him ; the second , because he wished to fall in love with Mademoiselle de la Valliere ; and lastly , because the king likes M. Colbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
Oh ! 
he is lost ! 
But shall I put my foot on his neck , I , of all men , when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks ? 
For shame ! 
If he be dangerous , I will lay him low enough ; if , however , he be only persecuted , I will look on . 
I have come to such a decisive determination , that neither king nor living man shall change my mind . 
If Athos were here , he would do as I have done . 
Therefore , instead of going , in cold blood , up to M. Fouquet , and arresting him off-hand and shutting him up altogether , I will try and conduct myself like a man who understands what good manners are . 
People will talk about it , of course ; but they shall talk well of it , I am determined . '' 
And D'Artagnan , drawing by a gesture peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his shoulder , went straight off to M. Fouquet , who , after he had taken leave of his guests , was preparing to retire for the night and to sleep tranquilly after the triumphs of the day . 
The air was still perfumed , or infected , whichever way it may be considered , with the odors of the torches and the fireworks . 
The wax-lights were dying away in their sockets , the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands , the groups of dancers and courtiers were separating in the salons . 
Surrounded by his friends , who complimented him and received his flattering remarks in return , the surintendant half-closed his wearied eyes . 
He longed for rest and quiet ; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped up for him for so many days past ; it might almost have been said that he seemed bowed beneath the weight of the new debts which he had incurred for the purpose of giving the greatest possible honor to this fete . 
Fouquet had just retired to his room , still smiling , but more than half-asleep . 
He could listen to nothing more , he could hardly keep his eyes open ; his bed seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible attraction for him . 
The god Morpheus , the presiding deity of the dome painted by Lebrun , had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms , and showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the house . 
Fouquet , almost entirely alone , was being assisted by his valet de chambre to undress , when M. d'Artagnan appeared at the entrance of the room . 
D'Artagnan had never been able to succeed in making himself common at the court ; and notwithstanding he was seen everywhere and on all occasions , he never failed to produce an effect wherever and whenever he made his appearance . 
Such is the happy privilege of certain natures , which in that respect resemble either thunder or lightning ; every one recognizes them ; but their appearance never fails to arouse surprise and astonishment , and whenever they occur , the impression is always left that the last was the most conspicuous or most important . 
`` What ! 
M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
said Fouquet , who had already taken his right arm out of the sleeve of his doublet . 
`` At your service , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` Come in , my dear M. d'Artagnan . '' 
`` Thank you . '' 
`` Have you come to criticise the fete ? 
You are ingenious enough in your criticisms , I know . '' 
`` By no means . '' 
`` Are not your men looked after properly ? '' 
`` In every way . '' 
`` You are not comfortably lodged , perhaps ? '' 
`` Nothing could be better . '' 
`` In that case , I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed , and I must not fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering kindness . '' 
These words were as much as to say , `` My dear D'Artagnan , pray go to bed , since you have a bed to lie down on , and let me do the same . '' 
D'Artagnan did not seem to understand it . 
`` Are you going to bed already ? '' 
he said to the superintendent . 
`` Yes ; have you anything to say to me ? '' 
`` Nothing , monsieur , nothing at all . 
You sleep in this room , then ? '' 
`` Yes ; as you see . '' 
`` You have given a most charming fete to the king . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
beautiful ! '' 
`` Is the king pleased ? '' 
`` Enchanted . '' 
`` Did he desire you to say as much to me ? '' 
`` He would not choose so unworthy a messenger , monseigneur . '' 
`` You do not do yourself justice , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` Is that your bed , there ? '' 
`` Yes ; but why do you ask ? 
Are you not satisfied with your own ? '' 
`` My I speak frankly to you ? '' 
`` Most assuredly . '' 
`` Well , then , I am not . '' 
Fouquet started ; and then replied , `` Will you take my room , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? ''
