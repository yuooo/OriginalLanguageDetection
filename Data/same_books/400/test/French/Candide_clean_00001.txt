In a castle of Westphalia , belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh , lived a youth , whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners . 
His countenance was a true picture of his soul . 
He combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit , which was the reason , I apprehend , of his being called Candide . 
The old servants of the family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron 's sister , by a good , honest gentleman of the neighborhood , whom that young lady would never marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one quarterings , the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through the injuries of time . 
The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia , for his castle had not only a gate , but windows . 
His great hall , even , was hung with tapestry . 
All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at need ; his grooms were his huntsmen ; and the curate of the village was his grand almoner . 
They called him `` My Lord , '' and laughed at all his stories . 
The Baron 's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds , and was therefore a person of great consideration , and she did the honours of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect . 
Her daughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of age , fresh-coloured , comely , plump , and desirable . 
The Baron 's son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his father . 
The Preceptor Pangloss was the oracle of the family , and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character . 
Pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology . 
He proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause , and that , in this best of all possible worlds , the Baron 's castle was the most magnificent of castles , and his lady the best of all possible Baronesses . 
`` It is demonstrable , '' said he , `` that things can not be otherwise than as they are ; for all being created for an end , all is necessarily for the best end . 
Observe , that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles -- thus we have spectacles . 
Legs are visibly designed for stockings -- and we have stockings . 
Stones were made to be hewn , and to construct castles -- therefore my lord has a magnificent castle ; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged . 
Pigs were made to be eaten -- therefore we eat pork all the year round . 
Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing , they should have said all is for the best . '' 
Candide listened attentively and believed innocently ; for he thought Miss Cunegonde extremely beautiful , though he never had the courage to tell her so . 
He concluded that after the happiness of being born of Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh , the second degree of happiness was to be Miss Cunegonde , the third that of seeing her every day , and the fourth that of hearing Master Pangloss , the greatest philosopher of the whole province , and consequently of the whole world . 
One day Cunegonde , while walking near the castle , in a little wood which they called a park , saw between the bushes , Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother 's chamber-maid , a little brown wench , very pretty and very docile . 
As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences , she breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness ; she clearly perceived the force of the Doctor 's reasons , the effects , and the causes ; she turned back greatly flurried , quite pensive , and filled with the desire to be learned ; dreaming that she might well be a sufficient reason for young Candide , and he for her . 
She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed ; Candide blushed also ; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone , and Candide spoke to her without knowing what he said . 
The next day after dinner , as they went from table , Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen ; Cunegonde let fall her handkerchief , Candide picked it up , she took him innocently by the hand , the youth as innocently kissed the young lady 's hand with particular vivacity , sensibility , and grace ; their lips met , their eyes sparkled , their knees trembled , their hands strayed . 
Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this cause and effect chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside ; Cunegonde fainted away ; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness , as soon as she came to herself ; and all was consternation in this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles . 
Candide , driven from terrestrial paradise , walked a long while without knowing where , weeping , raising his eyes to heaven , turning them often towards the most magnificent of castles which imprisoned the purest of noble young ladies . 
He lay down to sleep without supper , in the middle of a field between two furrows . 
The snow fell in large flakes . 
Next day Candide , all benumbed , dragged himself towards the neighbouring town which was called Waldberghofftrarbk-dikdorff , having no money , dying of hunger and fatigue , he stopped sorrowfully at the door of an inn . 
Two men dressed in blue observed him . 
`` Comrade , '' said one , `` here is a well-built young fellow , and of proper height . '' 
They went up to Candide and very civilly invited him to dinner . 
`` Gentlemen , '' replied Candide , with a most engaging modesty , `` you do me great honour , but I have not wherewithal to pay my share . '' 
`` Oh , sir , '' said one of the blues to him , `` people of your appearance and of your merit never pay anything : are you not five feet five inches high ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , that is my height , '' answered he , making a low bow . 
`` Come , sir , seat yourself ; not only will we pay your reckoning , but we will never suffer such a man as you to want money ; men are only born to assist one another . '' 
`` You are right , '' said Candide ; `` this is what I was always taught by Mr. Pangloss , and I see plainly that all is for the best . '' 
They begged of him to accept a few crowns . 
He took them , and wished to give them his note ; they refused ; they seated themselves at table . 
`` Love you not deeply ? '' 
`` Oh yes , '' answered he ; `` I deeply love Miss Cunegonde . '' 
`` No , '' said one of the gentlemen , `` we ask you if you do not deeply love the King of the Bulgarians ? '' 
`` Not at all , '' said he ; `` for I have never seen him . '' 
`` What ! 
he is the best of kings , and we must drink his health . '' 
`` Oh ! 
very willingly , gentlemen , '' and he drank . 
`` That is enough , '' they tell him . 
`` Now you are the help , the support , the defender , the hero of the Bulgarians . 
Your fortune is made , and your glory is assured . '' 
Instantly they fettered him , and carried him away to the regiment . 
There he was made to wheel about to the right , and to the left , to draw his rammer , to return his rammer , to present , to fire , to march , and they gave him thirty blows with a cudgel . 
The next day he did his exercise a little less badly , and he received but twenty blows . 
The day following they gave him only ten , and he was regarded by his comrades as a prodigy . 
Candide , all stupefied , could not yet very well realise how he was a hero . 
He resolved one fine day in spring to go for a walk , marching straight before him , believing that it was a privilege of the human as well as of the animal species to make use of their legs as they pleased . 
He had advanced two leagues when he was overtaken by four others , heroes of six feet , who bound him and carried him to a dungeon . 
He was asked which he would like the best , to be whipped six-and-thirty times through all the regiment , or to receive at once twelve balls of lead in his brain . 
He vainly said that human will is free , and that he chose neither the one nor the other . 
He was forced to make a choice ; he determined , in virtue of that gift of God called liberty , to run the gauntlet six-and-thirty times . 
He bore this twice . 
The regiment was composed of two thousand men ; that composed for him four thousand strokes , which laid bare all his muscles and nerves , from the nape of his neck quite down to his rump . 
As they were going to proceed to a third whipping , Candide , able to bear no more , begged as a favour that they would be so good as to shoot him . 
He obtained this favour ; they bandaged his eyes , and bade him kneel down . 
The King of the Bulgarians passed at this moment and ascertained the nature of the crime . 
As he had great talent , he understood from all that he learnt of Candide that he was a young metaphysician , extremely ignorant of the things of this world , and he accorded him his pardon with a clemency which will bring him praise in all the journals , and throughout all ages . 
An able surgeon cured Candide in three weeks by means of emollients taught by Dioscorides . 
He had already a little skin , and was able to march when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abares . 
There was never anything so gallant , so spruce , so brilliant , and so well disposed as the two armies . 
Trumpets , fifes , hautboys , drums , and cannon made music such as Hell itself had never heard . 
The cannons first of all laid flat about six thousand men on each side ; the muskets swept away from this best of worlds nine or ten thousand ruffians who infested its surface . 
The bayonet was also a sufficient reason for the death of several thousands . 
The whole might amount to thirty thousand souls . 
Candide , who trembled like a philosopher , hid himself as well as he could during this heroic butchery . 
At length , while the two kings were causing Te Deum to be sung each in his own camp , Candide resolved to go and reason elsewhere on effects and causes . 
He passed over heaps of dead and dying , and first reached a neighbouring village ; it was in cinders , it was an Abare village which the Bulgarians had burnt according to the laws of war . 
Here , old men covered with wounds , beheld their wives , hugging their children to their bloody breasts , massacred before their faces ; there , their daughters , disembowelled and breathing their last after having satisfied the natural wants of Bulgarian heroes ; while others , half burnt in the flames , begged to be despatched . 
The earth was strewed with brains , arms , and legs . 
Candide fled quickly to another village ; it belonged to the Bulgarians ; and the Abarian heroes had treated it in the same way . 
Candide , walking always over palpitating limbs or across ruins , arrived at last beyond the seat of war , with a few provisions in his knapsack , and Miss Cunegonde always in his heart . 
His provisions failed him when he arrived in Holland ; but having heard that everybody was rich in that country , and that they were Christians , he did not doubt but he should meet with the same treatment from them as he had met with in the Baron 's castle , before Miss Cunegonde 's bright eyes were the cause of his expulsion thence . 
He asked alms of several grave-looking people , who all answered him , that if he continued to follow this trade they would confine him to the house of correction , where he should be taught to get a living . 
The next he addressed was a man who had been haranguing a large assembly for a whole hour on the subject of charity . 
But the orator , looking askew , said : `` What are you doing here ? 
Are you for the good cause ? '' 
`` There can be no effect without a cause , '' modestly answered Candide ; `` the whole is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best . 
It was necessary for me to have been banished from the presence of Miss Cunegonde , to have afterwards run the gauntlet , and now it is necessary I should beg my bread until I learn to earn it ; all this can not be otherwise . '' 
`` My friend , '' said the orator to him , `` do you believe the Pope to be Anti-Christ ? '' 
`` I have not heard it , '' answered Candide ; `` but whether he be , or whether he be not , I want bread . '' 
`` Thou dost not deserve to eat , '' said the other . 
`` Begone , rogue ; begone , wretch ; do not come near me again . '' 
The orator 's wife , putting her head out of the window , and spying a man that doubted whether the Pope was Anti-Christ , poured over him a full ... . 
Oh , heavens ! 
to what excess does religious zeal carry the ladies . 
A man who had never been christened , a good Anabaptist , named James , beheld the cruel and ignominious treatment shown to one of his brethren , an unfeathered biped with a rational soul , he took him home , cleaned him , gave him bread and beer , presented him with two florins , and even wished to teach him the manufacture of Persian stuffs which they make in Holland . 
Candide , almost prostrating himself before him , cried : `` Master Pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world , for I am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his lady . '' 
The next day , as he took a walk , he met a beggar all covered with scabs , his eyes diseased , the end of his nose eaten away , his mouth distorted , his teeth black , choking in his throat , tormented with a violent cough , and spitting out a tooth at each effort . 
Candide , yet more moved with compassion than with horror , gave to this shocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest Anabaptist James . 
The spectre looked at him very earnestly , dropped a few tears , and fell upon his neck . 
Candide recoiled in disgust . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said one wretch to the other , `` do you no longer know your dear Pangloss ? '' 
`` What do I hear ? 
You , my dear master ! 
you in this terrible plight ! 
What misfortune has happened to you ? 
Why are you no longer in the most magnificent of castles ? 
What has become of Miss Cunegonde , the pearl of girls , and nature 's masterpiece ? '' 
`` I am so weak that I can not stand , '' said Pangloss . 
Upon which Candide carried him to the Anabaptist 's stable , and gave him a crust of bread . 
As soon as Pangloss had refreshed himself a little : `` Well , '' said Candide , `` Cunegonde ? '' 
`` She is dead , '' replied the other . 
Candide fainted at this word ; his friend recalled his senses with a little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable . 
Candide reopened his eyes . 
`` Cunegonde is dead ! 
Ah , best of worlds , where art thou ? 
But of what illness did she die ? 
Was it not for grief , upon seeing her father kick me out of his magnificent castle ? '' 
`` No , '' said Pangloss , `` she was ripped open by the Bulgarian soldiers , after having been violated by many ; they broke the Baron 's head for attempting to defend her ; my lady , her mother , was cut in pieces ; my poor pupil was served just in the same manner as his sister ; and as for the castle , they have not left one stone upon another , not a barn , nor a sheep , nor a duck , nor a tree ; but we have had our revenge , for the Abares have done the very same thing to a neighbouring barony , which belonged to a Bulgarian lord . '' 
At this discourse Candide fainted again ; but coming to himself , and having said all that it became him to say , inquired into the cause and effect , as well as into the sufficient reason that had reduced Pangloss to so miserable a plight . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the other , `` it was love ; love , the comfort of the human species , the preserver of the universe , the soul of all sensible beings , love , tender love . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Candide , `` I know this love , that sovereign of hearts , that soul of our souls ; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty kicks on the backside . 
How could this beautiful cause produce in you an effect so abominable ? '' 
Pangloss made answer in these terms : `` Oh , my dear Candide , you remember Paquette , that pretty wench who waited on our noble Baroness ; in her arms I tasted the delights of paradise , which produced in me those hell torments with which you see me devoured ; she was infected with them , she is perhaps dead of them . 
This present Paquette received of a learned Grey Friar , who had traced it to its source ; he had had it of an old countess , who had received it from a cavalry captain , who owed it to a marchioness , who took it from a page , who had received it from a Jesuit , who when a novice had it in a direct line from one of the companions of Christopher Columbus . 
For my part I shall give it to nobody , I am dying . '' 
`` Oh , Pangloss ! '' 
cried Candide , `` what a strange genealogy ! 
Is not the Devil the original stock of it ? '' 
`` Not at all , '' replied this great man , `` it was a thing unavoidable , a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds ; for if Columbus had not in an island of America caught this disease , which contaminates the source of life , frequently even hinders generation , and which is evidently opposed to the great end of nature , we should have neither chocolate nor cochineal . 
We are also to observe that upon our continent , this distemper is like religious controversy , confined to a particular spot . 
The Turks , the Indians , the Persians , the Chinese , the Siamese , the Japanese , know nothing of it ; but there is a sufficient reason for believing that they will know it in their turn in a few centuries . 
In the meantime , it has made marvellous progress among us , especially in those great armies composed of honest well-disciplined hirelings , who decide the destiny of states ; for we may safely affirm that when an army of thirty thousand men fights another of an equal number , there are about twenty thousand of them p-x-d on each side . '' 
`` Well , this is wonderful ! '' 
said Candide , `` but you must get cured . '' 
`` Alas ! 
how can I ? '' 
said Pangloss , `` I have not a farthing , my friend , and all over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister , without paying , or somebody paying for you . '' 
These last words determined Candide ; he went and flung himself at the feet of the charitable Anabaptist James , and gave him so touching a picture of the state to which his friend was reduced , that the good man did not scruple to take Dr. Pangloss into his house , and had him cured at his expense . 
In the cure Pangloss lost only an eye and an ear . 
He wrote well , and knew arithmetic perfectly . 
The Anabaptist James made him his bookkeeper . 
At the end of two months , being obliged to go to Lisbon about some mercantile affairs , he took the two philosophers with him in his ship . 
Pangloss explained to him how everything was so constituted that it could not be better . 
James was not of this opinion . 
`` It is more likely , '' said he , `` mankind have a little corrupted nature , for they were not born wolves , and they have become wolves ; God has given them neither cannon of four-and-twenty pounders , nor bayonets ; and yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another . 
Into this account I might throw not only bankrupts , but Justice which seizes on the effects of bankrupts to cheat the creditors . '' 
`` All this was indispensable , '' replied the one-eyed doctor , `` for private misfortunes make the general good , so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good . '' 
While he reasoned , the sky darkened , the winds blew from the four quarters , and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of Lisbon . 
Half dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship produces , one-half of the passengers were not even sensible of the danger . 
The other half shrieked and prayed . 
The sheets were rent , the masts broken , the vessel gaped . 
Work who would , no one heard , no one commanded . 
The Anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand ; when a brutish sailor struck him roughly and laid him sprawling ; but with the violence of the blow he himself tumbled head foremost overboard , and stuck upon a piece of the broken mast . 
Honest James ran to his assistance , hauled him up , and from the effort he made was precipitated into the sea in sight of the sailor , who left him to perish , without deigning to look at him . 
Candide drew near and saw his benefactor , who rose above the water one moment and was then swallowed up for ever . 
He was just going to jump after him , but was prevented by the philosopher Pangloss , who demonstrated to him that the Bay of Lisbon had been made on purpose for the Anabaptist to be drowned . 
While he was proving this à priori , the ship foundered ; all perished except Pangloss , Candide , and that brutal sailor who had drowned the good Anabaptist . 
The villain swam safely to the shore , while Pangloss and Candide were borne thither upon a plank . 
As soon as they recovered themselves a little they walked toward Lisbon . 
They had some money left , with which they hoped to save themselves from starving , after they had escaped drowning . 
Scarcely had they reached the city , lamenting the death of their benefactor , when they felt the earth tremble under their feet . 
The sea swelled and foamed in the harbour , and beat to pieces the vessels riding at anchor . 
Whirlwinds of fire and ashes covered the streets and public places ; houses fell , roofs were flung upon the pavements , and the pavements were scattered . 
Thirty thousand inhabitants of all ages and sexes were crushed under the ruins . 
The sailor , whistling and swearing , said there was booty to be gained here . 
`` What can be the sufficient reason of this phenomenon ? '' 
said Pangloss . 
`` This is the Last Day ! '' 
cried Candide . 
The sailor ran among the ruins , facing death to find money ; finding it , he took it , got drunk , and having slept himself sober , purchased the favours of the first good-natured wench whom he met on the ruins of the destroyed houses , and in the midst of the dying and the dead . 
Pangloss pulled him by the sleeve . 
`` My friend , '' said he , `` this is not right . 
You sin against the universal reason ; you choose your time badly . '' 
`` S'blood and fury ! '' 
answered the other ; `` I am a sailor and born at Batavia . 
Four times have I trampled upon the crucifix in four voyages to Japan ; a fig for thy universal reason . '' 
Some falling stones had wounded Candide . 
He lay stretched in the street covered with rubbish . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said he to Pangloss , `` get me a little wine and oil ; I am dying . '' 
`` This concussion of the earth is no new thing , '' answered Pangloss . 
`` The city of Lima , in America , experienced the same convulsions last year ; the same cause , the same effects ; there is certainly a train of sulphur under ground from Lima to Lisbon . '' 
`` Nothing more probable , '' said Candide ; `` but for the love of God a little oil and wine . '' 
`` How , probable ? '' 
replied the philosopher . 
`` I maintain that the point is capable of being demonstrated . '' 
Candide fainted away , and Pangloss fetched him some water from a neighbouring fountain . 
The following day they rummaged among the ruins and found provisions , with which they repaired their exhausted strength . 
After this they joined with others in relieving those inhabitants who had escaped death . 
Some , whom they had succoured , gave them as good a dinner as they could in such disastrous circumstances ; true , the repast was mournful , and the company moistened their bread with tears ; but Pangloss consoled them , assuring them that things could not be otherwise . 
`` For , '' said he , `` all that is is for the best . 
If there is a volcano at Lisbon it can not be elsewhere . 
It is impossible that things should be other than they are ; for everything is right . '' 
A little man dressed in black , Familiar of the Inquisition , who sat by him , politely took up his word and said : `` Apparently , then , sir , you do not believe in original sin ; for if all is for the best there has then been neither Fall nor punishment . '' 
`` I humbly ask your Excellency 's pardon , '' answered Pangloss , still more politely ; `` for the Fall and curse of man necessarily entered into the system of the best of worlds . '' 
`` Sir , '' said the Familiar , `` you do not then believe in liberty ? '' 
`` Your Excellency will excuse me , '' said Pangloss ; `` liberty is consistent with absolute necessity , for it was necessary we should be free ; for , in short , the determinate will -- '' Pangloss was in the middle of his sentence , when the Familiar beckoned to his footman , who gave him a glass of wine from Porto or Opporto . 
After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon , the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautiful auto-da-fé ; for it had been decided by the University of Coimbra , that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire , and with great ceremony , is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking . 
In consequence hereof , they had seized on a Biscayner , convicted of having married his godmother , and on two Portuguese , for rejecting the bacon which larded a chicken they were eating ; after dinner , they came and secured Dr. Pangloss , and his disciple Candide , the one for speaking his mind , the other for having listened with an air of approbation . 
They were conducted to separate apartments , extremely cold , as they were never incommoded by the sun . 
Eight days after they were dressed in san-benitos and their heads ornamented with paper mitres . 
The mitre and san-benito belonging to Candide were painted with reversed flames and with devils that had neither tails nor claws ; but Pangloss 's devils had claws and tails and the flames were upright . 
They marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic sermon , followed by fine church music . 
Candide was whipped in cadence while they were singing ; the Biscayner , and the two men who had refused to eat bacon , were burnt ; and Pangloss was hanged , though that was not the custom . 
The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion . 
Candide , terrified , amazed , desperate , all bloody , all palpitating , said to himself : `` If this is the best of possible worlds , what then are the others ? 
Well , if I had been only whipped I could put up with it , for I experienced that among the Bulgarians ; but oh , my dear Pangloss ! 
thou greatest of philosophers , that I should have seen you hanged , without knowing for what ! 
Oh , my dear Anabaptist , thou best of men , that thou should ` st have been drowned in the very harbour ! 
Oh , Miss Cunegonde , thou pearl of girls ! 
that thou should ` st have had thy belly ripped open ! '' 
Thus he was musing , scarce able to stand , preached at , whipped , absolved , and blessed , when an old woman accosted him saying : `` My son , take courage and follow me . '' 
Candide did not take courage , but followed the old woman to a decayed house , where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores , showed him a very neat little bed , with a suit of clothes hanging up , and left him something to eat and drink . 
`` Eat , drink , sleep , '' said she , `` and may our lady of Atocha , the great St. Anthony of Padua , and the great St. James of Compostella , receive you under their protection . 
I shall be back to-morrow . '' 
Candide , amazed at all he had suffered and still more with the charity of the old woman , wished to kiss her hand . 
`` It is not my hand you must kiss , '' said the old woman ; `` I shall be back to-morrow . 
Anoint yourself with the pomatum , eat and sleep . '' 
Candide , notwithstanding so many disasters , ate and slept . 
The next morning the old woman brought him his breakfast , looked at his back , and rubbed it herself with another ointment : in like manner she brought him his dinner ; and at night she returned with his supper . 
The day following she went through the very same ceremonies . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
said Candide ; `` who has inspired you with so much goodness ? 
What return can I make you ? '' 
The good woman made no answer ; she returned in the evening , but brought no supper . 
`` Come with me , '' she said , `` and say nothing . '' 
She took him by the arm , and walked with him about a quarter of a mile into the country ; they arrived at a lonely house , surrounded with gardens and canals . 
The old woman knocked at a little door , it opened , she led Candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly furnished . 
She left him on a brocaded sofa , shut the door and went away . 
Candide thought himself in a dream ; indeed , that he had been dreaming unluckily all his life , and that the present moment was the only agreeable part of it all . 
The old woman returned very soon , supporting with difficulty a trembling woman of a majestic figure , brilliant with jewels , and covered with a veil . 
`` Take off that veil , '' said the old woman to Candide . 
The young man approaches , he raises the veil with a timid hand . 
Oh ! 
what a moment ! 
what surprise ! 
he believes he beholds Miss Cunegonde ? 
he really sees her ! 
it is herself ! 
His strength fails him , he can not utter a word , but drops at her feet . 
Cunegonde falls upon the sofa . 
The old woman supplies a smelling bottle ; they come to themselves and recover their speech . 
As they began with broken accents , with questions and answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs , with tears , and cries . 
The old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them to themselves . 
`` What , is it you ? '' 
said Candide , `` you live ? 
I find you again in Portugal ? 
then you have not been ravished ? 
then they did not rip open your belly as Doctor Pangloss informed me ? '' 
`` Yes , they did , '' said the beautiful Cunegonde ; `` but those two accidents are not always mortal . '' 
`` But were your father and mother killed ? '' 
`` It is but too true , '' answered Cunegonde , in tears . 
`` And your brother ? '' 
`` My brother also was killed . '' 
`` And why are you in Portugal ? 
and how did you know of my being here ? 
and by what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house ? '' 
`` I will tell you all that , '' replied the lady , `` but first of all let me know your history , since the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks which you received . '' 
Candide respectfully obeyed her , and though he was still in a surprise , though his voice was feeble and trembling , though his back still pained him , yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation . 
Cunegonde lifted up her eyes to heaven ; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good Anabaptist and of Pangloss ; after which she spoke as follows to Candide , who did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes . 
`` I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians to our delightful castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh ; they slew my father and brother , and cut my mother in pieces . 
A tall Bulgarian , six feet high , perceiving that I had fainted away at this sight , began to ravish me ; this made me recover ; I regained my senses , I cried , I struggled , I bit , I scratched , I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian 's eyes -- not knowing that what happened at my father 's house was the usual practice of war . 
The brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger , and the mark is still upon me . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I hope I shall see it , '' said honest Candide . 
`` You shall , '' said Cunegonde , `` but let us continue . '' 
`` Do so , '' replied Candide . 
Thus she resumed the thread of her story : `` A Bulgarian captain came in , saw me all bleeding , and the soldier not in the least disconcerted . 
The captain flew into a passion at the disrespectful behaviour of the brute , and slew him on my body . 
He ordered my wounds to be dressed , and took me to his quarters as a prisoner of war . 
I washed the few shirts that he had , I did his cooking ; he thought me very pretty -- he avowed it ; on the other hand , I must own he had a good shape , and a soft and white skin ; but he had little or no mind or philosophy , and you might see plainly that he had never been instructed by Doctor Pangloss . 
In three months time , having lost all his money , and being grown tired of my company , he sold me to a Jew , named Don Issachar , who traded to Holland and Portugal , and had a strong passion for women . 
This Jew was much attached to my person , but could not triumph over it ; I resisted him better than the Bulgarian soldier . 
A modest woman may be ravished once , but her virtue is strengthened by it . 
In order to render me more tractable , he brought me to this country house . 
Hitherto I had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of Thunder-ten-Tronckh Castle ; but I found I was mistaken . 
`` The Grand Inquisitor , seeing me one day at Mass , stared long at me , and sent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters . 
I was conducted to his palace , where I acquainted him with the history of my family , and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank to belong to an Israelite . 
A proposal was then made to Don Issachar that he should resign me to my lord . 
Don Issachar , being the court banker , and a man of credit , would hear nothing of it . 
The Inquisitor threatened him with an auto-da-fé . 
At last my Jew , intimidated , concluded a bargain , by which the house and myself should belong to both in common ; the Jew should have for himself Monday , Wednesday , and Saturday , and the Inquisitor should have the rest of the week . 
It is now six months since this agreement was made . 
Quarrels have not been wanting , for they could not decide whether the night from Saturday to Sunday belonged to the old law or to the new . 
For my part , I have so far held out against both , and I verily believe that this is the reason why I am still beloved . 
`` At length , to avert the scourge of earthquakes , and to intimidate Don Issachar , my Lord Inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an auto-da-fé . 
He did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony . 
I had a very good seat , and the ladies were served with refreshments between Mass and the execution . 
I was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two Jews , and of the honest Biscayner who had married his godmother ; but what was my surprise , my fright , my trouble , when I saw in a san-benito and mitre a figure which resembled that of Pangloss ! 
I rubbed my eyes , I looked at him attentively , I saw him hung ; I fainted . 
Scarcely had I recovered my senses than I saw you stripped , stark naked , and this was the height of my horror , consternation , grief , and despair . 
I tell you , truthfully , that your skin is yet whiter and of a more perfect colour than that of my Bulgarian captain . 
This spectacle redoubled all the feelings which overwhelmed and devoured me . 
I screamed out , and would have said , ` Stop , barbarians ! ' 
but my voice failed me , and my cries would have been useless after you had been severely whipped . 
How is it possible , said I , that the beloved Candide and the wise Pangloss should both be at Lisbon , the one to receive a hundred lashes , and the other to be hanged by the Grand Inquisitor , of whom I am the well-beloved ? 
Pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he said that everything in the world is for the best . 
`` Agitated , lost , sometimes beside myself , and sometimes ready to die of weakness , my mind was filled with the massacre of my father , mother , and brother , with the insolence of the ugly Bulgarian soldier , with the stab that he gave me , with my servitude under the Bulgarian captain , with my hideous Don Issachar , with my abominable Inquisitor , with the execution of Doctor Pangloss , with the grand Miserere to which they whipped you , and especially with the kiss I gave you behind the screen the day that I had last seen you . 
I praised God for bringing you back to me after so many trials , and I charged my old woman to take care of you , and to conduct you hither as soon as possible . 
She has executed her commission perfectly well ; I have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again , of hearing you , of speaking with you . 
But you must be hungry , for myself , I am famished ; let us have supper . '' 
They both sat down to table , and , when supper was over , they placed themselves once more on the sofa ; where they were when Signor Don Issachar arrived . 
It was the Jewish Sabbath , and Issachar had come to enjoy his rights , and to explain his tender love . 
This Issachar was the most choleric Hebrew that had ever been seen in Israel since the Captivity in Babylon . 
`` What ! '' 
said he , `` thou bitch of a Galilean , was not the Inquisitor enough for thee ? 
Must this rascal also share with me ? '' 
In saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him ; and not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon Candide : but our honest Westphalian had received a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit of clothes . 
He drew his rapier , despite his gentleness , and laid the Israelite stone dead upon the cushions at Cunegonde 's feet . 
`` Holy Virgin ! '' 
cried she , `` what will become of us ? 
A man killed in my apartment ! 
If the officers of justice come , we are lost ! '' 
`` Had not Pangloss been hanged , '' said Candide , `` he would give us good counsel in this emergency , for he was a profound philosopher . 
Failing him let us consult the old woman . '' 
She was very prudent and commenced to give her opinion when suddenly another little door opened . 
It was an hour after midnight , it was the beginning of Sunday . 
This day belonged to my lord the Inquisitor . 
He entered , and saw the whipped Candide , sword in hand , a dead man upon the floor , Cunegonde aghast , and the old woman giving counsel . 
At this moment , the following is what passed in the soul of Candide , and how he reasoned : If this holy man call in assistance , he will surely have me burnt ; and Cunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner ; he was the cause of my being cruelly whipped ; he is my rival ; and , as I have now begun to kill , I will kill away , for there is no time to hesitate . 
This reasoning was clear and instantaneous ; so that without giving time to the Inquisitor to recover from his surprise , he pierced him through and through , and cast him beside the Jew . 
`` Yet again ! '' 
said Cunegonde , `` now there is no mercy for us , we are excommunicated , our last hour has come . 
How could you do it ? 
you , naturally so gentle , to slay a Jew and a prelate in two minutes ! '' 
`` My beautiful young lady , '' responded Candide , `` when one is a lover , jealous and whipped by the Inquisition , one stops at nothing . '' 
The old woman then put in her word , saying : `` There are three Andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and saddles , let the brave Candide get them ready ; madame has money , jewels ; let us therefore mount quickly on horseback , though I can sit only on one buttock ; let us set out for Cadiz , it is the finest weather in the world , and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night . '' 
Immediately Candide saddled the three horses , and Cunegonde , the old woman and he , travelled thirty miles at a stretch . 
While they were journeying , the Holy Brotherhood entered the house ; my lord the Inquisitor was interred in a handsome church , and Issachar 's body was thrown upon a dunghill . 
Candide , Cunegonde , and the old woman , had now reached the little town of Avacena in the midst of the mountains of the Sierra Morena , and were speaking as follows in a public inn . 
`` Who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels ? '' 
said Cunegonde , all bathed in tears . 
`` How shall we live ? 
What shall we do ? 
Where find Inquisitors or Jews who will give me more ? '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the old woman , `` I have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend Grey Friar , who stayed last night in the same inn with us at Badajos . 
God preserve me from judging rashly , but he came into our room twice , and he set out upon his journey long before us . '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Candide , `` dear Pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world are common to all men , and that each has an equal right to them . 
But according to these principles the Grey Friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey . 
Have you nothing at all left , my dear Cunegonde ? '' 
`` Not a farthing , '' said she . 
`` What then must we do ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` Sell one of the horses , '' replied the old woman . 
`` I will ride behind Miss Cunegonde , though I can hold myself only on one buttock , and we shall reach Cadiz . '' 
In the same inn there was a Benedictine prior who bought the horse for a cheap price . 
Candide , Cunegonde , and the old woman , having passed through Lucena , Chillas , and Lebrixa , arrived at length at Cadiz . 
A fleet was there getting ready , and troops assembling to bring to reason the reverend Jesuit Fathers of Paraguay , accused of having made one of the native tribes in the neighborhood of San Sacrament revolt against the Kings of Spain and Portugal . 
Candide having been in the Bulgarian service , performed the military exercise before the general of this little army with so graceful an address , with so intrepid an air , and with such agility and expedition , that he was given the command of a company of foot . 
Now , he was a captain ! 
He set sail with Miss Cunegonde , the old woman , two valets , and the two Andalusian horses , which had belonged to the grand Inquisitor of Portugal . 
During their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor Pangloss . 
`` We are going into another world , '' said Candide ; `` and surely it must be there that all is for the best . 
For I must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy . '' 
`` I love you with all my heart , '' said Cunegonde ; `` but my soul is still full of fright at that which I have seen and experienced . '' 
`` All will be well , '' replied Candide ; `` the sea of this new world is already better than our European sea ; it is calmer , the winds more regular . 
It is certainly the New World which is the best of all possible worlds . '' 
`` God grant it , '' said Cunegonde ; `` but I have been so horribly unhappy there that my heart is almost closed to hope . '' 
`` You complain , '' said the old woman ; `` alas ! 
you have not known such misfortunes as mine . '' 
Cunegonde almost broke out laughing , finding the good woman very amusing , for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Cunegonde , `` my good mother , unless you have been ravished by two Bulgarians , have received two deep wounds in your belly , have had two castles demolished , have had two mothers cut to pieces before your eyes , and two of your lovers whipped at an auto-da-fé , I do not conceive how you could be more unfortunate than I. Add that I was born a baroness of seventy-two quarterings -- and have been a cook ! '' 
`` Miss , '' replied the old woman , `` you do not know my birth ; and were I to show you my backside , you would not talk in that manner , but would suspend your judgment . '' 
This speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of Cunegonde and Candide , the old woman spoke to them as follows . 
`` I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids ; neither did my nose always touch my chin ; nor was I always a servant . 
I am the daughter of Pope Urban X , and of the Princess of Palestrina . 
Until the age of fourteen I was brought up in a palace , to which all the castles of your German barons would scarcely have served for stables ; and one of my robes was worth more than all the magnificence of Westphalia . 
As I grew up I improved in beauty , wit , and every graceful accomplishment , in the midst of pleasures , hopes , and respectful homage . 
Already I inspired love . 
My throat was formed , and such a throat ! 
white , firm , and shaped like that of the Venus of Medici ; and what eyes ! 
what eyelids ! 
what black eyebrows ! 
such flames darted from my dark pupils that they eclipsed the scintillation of the stars -- as I was told by the poets in our part of the world . 
My waiting women , when dressing and undressing me , used to fall into an ecstasy , whether they viewed me before or behind ; how glad would the gentlemen have been to perform that office for them ! 
`` I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara . 
Such a prince ! 
as handsome as myself , sweet-tempered , agreeable , brilliantly witty , and sparkling with love . 
I loved him as one loves for the first time -- with idolatry , with transport . 
The nuptials were prepared . 
There was surprising pomp and magnificence ; there were fêtes , carousals , continual opera bouffe ; and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise , though not one of them was passable . 
I was just upon the point of reaching the summit of bliss , when an old marchioness who had been mistress to the Prince , my husband , invited him to drink chocolate with her . 
He died in less than two hours of most terrible convulsions . 
But this is only a bagatelle . 
My mother , in despair , and scarcely less afflicted than myself , determined to absent herself for some time from so fatal a place . 
She had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of Gaeta . 
We embarked on board a galley of the country which was gilded like the great altar of St. Peter 's at Rome . 
A Sallee corsair swooped down and boarded us . 
Our men defended themselves like the Pope 's soldiers ; they flung themselves upon their knees , and threw down their arms , begging of the corsair an absolution in articulo mortis . 
`` Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys ; my mother , our maids of honour , and myself were all served in the same manner . 
It is amazing with what expedition those gentry undress people . 
But what surprised me most was , that they thrust their fingers into the part of our bodies which the generality of women suffer no other instrument but -- pipes to enter .
