`` I believe , '' I continued , `` that you enjoy having a man wholly in your power , torturing him -- '' `` No , no , '' she exclaimed quickly , `` or perhaps -- . '' 
She pondered . 
`` I do n't understand myself any longer , '' she continued , `` but I have a confession to make to you . 
You have corrupted my imagination and inflamed my blood . 
I am beginning to like the things you speak of . 
The enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour , a Catherine the Second , and all the other selfish , frivolous , cruel women , carries me away and takes hold of my soul . 
It urges me on to become like those women , who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during their lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves . 
`` You will end by making of me a despot in miniature , a domestic Pompadour . '' 
`` Well then , '' I said in agitation , `` if all this is inherent in you , give way to this trend of your nature . 
Nothing half-way . 
If you ca n't be a true and loyal wife to me , be a demon . '' 
I was nervous from loss of sleep , and the proximity of the beautiful woman affected me like a fever . 
I no longer recall what I said , but I remember that I kissed her feet , and finally raised her foot and put my neck under it . 
She withdrew it quickly , and rose almost angrily . 
`` If you love me , Severin , '' she said quickly , and her voice sounded sharp and commanding , `` never speak to me of those things again . 
Understand , never ! 
Otherwise I might really -- '' She smiled and sat down again . 
`` I am entirely serious , '' I exclaimed , half-raving . 
`` I adore you so infinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you , for the sake of spending my whole life near you . '' 
`` Severin , once more I warn you . '' 
`` Your warning is vain . 
Do with me what you will , as long as you do n't drive me away . '' 
`` Severin , '' replied Wanda , `` I am a frivolous young woman ; it is dangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power . 
You will end by actually becoming a plaything to me . 
Who will give warrant that I shall not abuse your insane desire ? '' 
`` Your own nobility of character . '' 
`` Power makes people over-bearing . '' 
`` Be it , '' I cried , `` tread me underfoot . '' 
Wanda threw her arms around my neck , looked into my eyes , and shook her head . 
`` I am afraid I ca n't , but I will try , for your sake , for I love you Severin , as I have loved no other man . '' 
To-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl , and I had to go shopping with her . 
She looked at whips , long whips with a short handle , the kind that are used on dogs . 
`` Are these satisfactory ? '' 
said the shopkeeper . 
`` No , they are much too small , '' replied Wanda , with a side-glance at me . 
`` I need a large -- '' `` For a bull-dog , I suppose ? '' 
opined the merchant . 
`` Yes , '' she exclaimed , `` of the kind that are used in Russia for intractable slaves . '' 
She looked further and finally selected a whip , at whose sight I felt a strange creeping sensation . 
`` Now good-by , Severin , '' she said . 
`` I have some other purchases to make , but you ca n't go along . '' 
I left her and took a walk . 
On the way back I saw Wanda coming out at a furrier 's . 
She beckoned me . 
`` Consider it well , '' she began in good spirits , `` I have never made a secret of how deeply your serious , dreamy character has fascinated me . 
The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power , actually lying enraptured at my feet , of course , stimulates me -- but will this attraction last ? 
Woman loves a man ; she maltreats a slave , and ends by kicking him aside . '' 
`` Very well then , kick me aside , '' I replied , `` when you are tired of me . 
I want to be your slave . '' 
`` Dangerous forces lie within me , '' said Wanda , after we had gone a few steps further . 
`` You awaken them , and not to your advantage . 
You know how to paint pleasure , cruelty , arrogance in glowing colors . 
What would you say should I try my hand at them , and make you the first object of my experiments . 
I would be like Dionysius who had the inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox . 
`` Perhaps I am a female Dionysius ? '' 
`` Be it , '' I exclaimed , `` and my dreams will be fulfilled . 
I am yours for good or evil , choose . 
The destiny that lies concealed within my breast drives me on -- demoniacally -- relentlessly . '' 
`` My Beloved , I do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow , and not until evening the day after tomorrow , and then as my slave . 
Your mistress Wanda . '' 
`` As my slave '' was underlined . 
I read the note which I received early in the morning a second time . 
Then I had a donkey saddled , an animal symbolic of learned professors , and rode into the mountains . 
I wanted to numb my desire , my yearning , with the magnificent scenery of the Carpathians . 
I am back , tired , hungry , thirsty , and more in love than ever . 
I quickly change my clothes , and a few moments later knock at her door . 
`` Come in ! '' 
I enter . 
She is standing in the center of the room , dressed in a gown of white satin which floods down her body like light . 
Over it she wears a scarlet kazabaika , richly edged with ermine . 
Upon her powdered , snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds . 
She stands with her arms folded across her breast , and with her brows contracted . 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I run toward her , and am about to throw my arm about her to kiss her . 
She retreats a step , measuring me from top to bottom . 
`` Slave ! '' 
`` Mistress ! '' 
I kneel down , and kiss the hem of her garment . 
`` That is as it should be . '' 
`` Oh , how beautiful you are . '' 
`` Do I please you ? '' 
She stepped before the mirror , and looked at herself with proud satisfaction . 
`` I shall become mad ! '' 
Her lower lip twitched derisively , and she looked at me mockingly from behind half-closed lids . 
`` Give me the whip . '' 
I looked about the room . 
`` No , '' she exclaimed , `` stay as you are , kneeling . '' 
She went over to the fire-place , took the whip from the mantle-piece , and , watching me with a smile , let it hiss through the air ; then she slowly rolled up the sleeve of her fur-jacket . 
`` Marvellous woman ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` Silence , slave ! '' 
She suddenly scowled , looked savage , and struck me with the whip . 
A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me , and pityingly bent down to me . 
`` Did I hurt you ? '' 
she asked , half-shyly , half-timidly . 
`` No , '' I replied , `` and even if you had , pains that come through you are a joy . 
Strike again , if it gives you pleasure . '' 
`` But it does n't give me pleasure . '' 
Again I was seized with that strange intoxication . 
`` Whip me , '' I begged , `` whip me without mercy . '' 
Wanda swung the whip , and hit me twice . 
`` Are you satisfied now ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Seriously , no ? '' 
`` Whip me , I beg you , it is a joy to me . '' 
`` Yes , because you know very well that it is n't serious , '' she replied , `` because I have n't the heart to hurt you . 
This brutal game goes against my grain . 
Were I really the woman who beats her slaves you would be horrified . '' 
`` No , Wanda , '' I replied , `` I love you more than myself ; I am devoted to you for death and life . 
In all seriousness , you can do with me whatever you will , whatever your caprice suggests . '' 
`` Severin ! '' 
`` Tread me underfoot ! '' 
I exclaimed , and flung myself face to the floor before her . 
`` I hate all this play-acting , '' said Wanda impatiently . 
`` Well , then maltreat me seriously . '' 
An uncanny pause . 
`` Severin , I warn you for the last time , '' began Wanda . 
`` If you love me , be cruel towards me , '' I pleaded with upraised eyes . 
`` If I love you , '' repeated Wanda . 
`` Very well ! '' 
She stepped back and looked at me with a sombre smile . 
`` Be then my slave , and know what it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman . '' 
And at the same moment she gave me a kick . 
`` How do you like that , slave ? '' 
Then she flourished the whip . 
`` Get up ! '' 
I was about to rise . 
`` Not that way , '' she commanded , `` on your knees . '' 
I obeyed , and she began to apply the lash . 
The blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms . 
Each one cut into my flesh and burned there , but the pains enraptured me . 
They came from her whom I adored , and for whom I was ready at any hour to lay down my life . 
She stopped . 
`` I am beginning to enjoy it , '' she said , `` but enough for to-day . 
I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far your strength goes . 
I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and writhe beneath my whip , and in hearing your groans and wails ; I want to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy , until you lose your senses . 
You have awakened dangerous elements in my being . 
But now get up . '' 
I seized her hand to press it to my lips . 
`` What impudence . '' 
She shoved me away with her foot . 
`` Out of my sight , slave ! '' 
After having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams , I awoke . 
Dawn was just beginning to break . 
How much of what was hovering in my memory was true ; what had I actually experienced and what had I dreamed ? 
That I had been whipped was certain . 
I can still feel each blow , and count the burning red stripes on my body . 
And she whipped me . 
Now I know everything . 
My dream has become truth . 
How does it make me feel ? 
Am I disappointed in the realization of my dream ? 
No , I am merely somewhat tired , but her cruelty has enraptured me . 
Oh , how I love her , adore her ! 
All this can not express in the remotest way my feeling for her , my complete devotion to her . 
What happiness to be her slave ! 
She calls to me from her balcony . 
I hurry upstairs . 
She is standing on the threshold , holding out her hand in friendly fashion . 
`` I am ashamed of myself , '' she says , while I embrace her , and she hides her head against my breast . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday , '' she said with quivering voice , `` I have fulfilled your mad wish , now let us be reasonable and happy and love each other , and in a year I will be your wife . '' 
`` My mistress , '' I exclaimed , `` and I your slave ! '' 
`` Not another word of slavery , cruelty , or the whip , '' interrupted Wanda . 
`` I shall not grant you any of those favors , none except wearing my fur-jacket ; come and help me into it . '' 
The little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his bolt struck midnight . 
I rose , and wanted to leave . 
Wanda said nothing , but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman . 
She began to kiss me anew , and this silent language was so comprehensible , so convincing -- And it told me more than I dared to understand . 
A languid abandonment pervaded Wanda 's entire being . 
What a voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed eyes , in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the white powder , in the red and white satin which crackled about her with every movement , in the swelling ermine of the kazabaika in which she carelessly nestled . 
`` Please , '' I stammered , `` but you will be angry with me . '' 
`` Do with me what you will , '' she whispered . 
`` Well , then whip me , or I shall go mad . '' 
`` Have n't I forbidden you , '' said Wanda sternly , `` but you are incorrigible . '' 
`` Oh , I am so terribly in love . '' 
I had sunken on my knees , and was burying my glowing face in her lap . 
`` I really believe , '' said Wanda thoughtfully , `` that your madness is nothing but a demonic , unsatisfied sensuality . 
Our unnatural way of life must generate such illnesses . 
Were you less virtuous , you would be completely sane . '' 
`` Well then , make me sane , '' I murmured . 
My hands were running through her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur , which rose and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom , and drove all my senses into confusion . 
And I kissed her . 
No , she kissed me savagely , pitilessly , as if she wanted to slay me with her kisses . 
I was as in a delirium , and had long since lost my reason , but now I , too , was breathless . 
I sought to free myself . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Wanda . 
`` I am suffering agonies . '' 
`` You are suffering -- '' she broke out into a loud amused laughter . 
`` You laugh ! '' 
I moaned , `` have you no idea -- '' She was serious all of a sudden . 
She raised my head in her hands , and with a violent gesture drew me to her breast . 
`` Wanda , '' I stammered . 
`` Of course , you enjoy suffering , '' she said , and laughed again , `` but wait , I 'll bring you to your senses . '' 
`` No , I will no longer ask , '' I exclaimed , `` whether you want to belong to me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication . 
I want to drain my happiness to the full . 
You are mine now , and I would rather lose you than never to have had you . '' 
`` Now you are sensible , '' she said . 
She kissed me again with her murderous lips . 
I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and her naked breast surged against mine . 
Then my senses left me -- The first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping from my hand , and she asked apathetically : `` Did you scratch me ? '' 
`` No , I believe , I have bitten you . '' 
It is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as soon as a new person enters . 
We spent marvellous days together ; we visited the mountains and lakes , we read together , and I completed Wanda 's portrait . 
And how we loved one another , how beautiful her smiling face was ! 
Then a friend of hers arrived , a divorced woman somewhat older , more experienced , and less scrupulous than Wanda . 
Her influence is already making itself felt in every direction . 
Wanda wrinkles her brows , and displays a certain impatience with me . 
Has she ceased loving me ? 
For almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us . 
Her friend lives with her , and we are never alone . 
A circle of men surrounds the young women . 
With my seriousness and melancholy I am playing an absurd role as lover . 
Wanda treats me like a stranger . 
To-day , while out walking , she staid behind with me . 
I saw that this was done intentionally , and I rejoiced . 
But what did she tell me ? 
`` My friend does n't understand how I can love you . 
She does n't think you either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise . 
She is telling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous life in the capital , hinting at the advantages to which I could lay claim , the large parties which I would find there , and the distinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract . 
But of what use is all this , since it happens that I love you . '' 
For a moment I lost my breath , then I said : `` I have no wish to stand in the way of your happiness , Wanda . 
Do not consider me . '' 
Then I raised my hat , and let her go ahead . 
She looked at me surprised , but did not answer a syllable . 
When by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back , she secretly pressed my hand . 
Her glance was so radiant , so full of promised happiness , that in a moment all the torments of these days were forgotten and all their wounds healed . 
I now am aware again of how much I love her . 
`` My friend has complained about you , '' said Wanda to-day . 
`` Perhaps she feels that I despise her . '' 
`` But why do you despise her , you foolish young man ? '' 
exclaimed Wanda , pulling my ears with both hands . 
`` Because she is a hypocrite , '' I said . 
`` I respect only a woman who is actually virtuous , or who openly lives for pleasure 's sake . '' 
`` Like me , for instance , '' replied Wanda jestingly , `` but you see , child , a woman can only do that in the rarest cases . 
She can neither be as gaily sensual , nor as spiritually free as man ; her state is always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual . 
Her heart desires to enchain man permanently , while she herself is ever subject to the desire for change . 
The result is a conflict , and thus usually against her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality and corrupt her character . '' 
`` Certainly that is true , '' I said . 
`` The transcendental character with which woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception . '' 
`` But the world likewise demands it , '' Wanda interrupted . 
`` Look at this woman . 
She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found a new admirer here . 
She deceives all three and yet is honored by all and respected by the world . '' 
`` I do n't care , '' I exclaimed , `` but she is to leave you alone ; she treats you like an article of commerce . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously . 
`` Every woman has the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions , and much is to be said for giving one 's self without love or pleasure because if you do it in cold blood , you can reap profit to best advantage . '' 
`` Wanda , what are you saying ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
she said , `` and take note of what I am about to say to you . 
Never feel secure with the woman you love , for there are more dangers in woman 's nature than you imagine . 
Women are neither as good as their admirers and defenders maintain , nor as bad as their enemies make them out to be . 
Woman 's character is characterlessness . 
The best woman will momentarily go down into the mire , and the worst unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to shame those that despise her . 
No woman is so good or so bad , but that at any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the most divine , of the filthiest as well as of the purest , thoughts , emotions , and actions . 
In spite of all the advances of civilization , woman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature . 
She has the nature of a savage , who is faithful or faithless , magnanimous or cruel , according to the impulse that dominates at the moment . 
Throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has produced moral character . 
Man even when he is selfish or evil always follows principles , woman never follows anything but impulses . 
Do n't ever forget that , and never feel secure with the woman you love . '' 
Her friend has left . 
At last an evening alone with her again . 
It seems as if Wanda had saved up all the love , which had been kept from her , for this superlative evening ; never had she been so kind , so near , so full of tenderness . 
What happiness to cling to her lips , and to die away in her arms ! 
In a state of relaxation and wholly mine , her head rests against my breast , and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other . 
I can not yet believe , comprehend , that this woman is mine , wholly mine . 
`` She is right on one point , '' Wanda began , without moving , without opening her eyes , as if she were asleep . 
`` Who ? '' 
She remained silent . 
`` Your friend ? '' 
She nodded . 
`` Yes , she is right , you are not a man , you are a dreamer , a charming cavalier , and you certainly would be a priceless slave , but I can not imagine you as husband . '' 
I was frightened . 
`` What is the matter ? 
You are trembling ? '' 
`` I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you , '' I replied . 
`` Are you made less happy now , because of this ? '' 
she replied . 
`` Does it rob you of any of your joys , that I have belonged to another before I did to you , that others after you will possess me , and would you enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you ? '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
`` You see , '' she continued , `` that would be a way out . 
You wo n't ever lose me then . 
I care deeply for you and intellectually we are harmonious , and I should like to live with you always , if in addition to you I might have -- '' `` What an idea , '' I cried . 
`` You fill me with a sort of horror . '' 
`` Do you love me any the less ? '' 
`` On the contrary . '' 
Wanda had raised herself on her left arm . 
`` I believe , '' she said , `` that to hold a man permanently , it is vitally important not to be faithful to him . 
What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved as a hetaira ? '' 
`` There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved woman . 
It is the highest kind of ecstacy . '' 
`` For you , too ? '' 
Wanda asked quickly . 
`` For me , too . '' 
`` And if I should give you that pleasure , '' Wanda exclaimed mockingly . 
`` I shall suffer terrible agonies , but I shall adore you the more , '' I replied . 
`` But you would never deceive me , you would have the daemonic greatness of saying to me : I shall love no one but you , but I shall make happy whoever pleases me . '' 
Wanda shook her head . 
`` I do n't like deception , I am honest , but what man exists who can support the burden of truth . 
Were I say to you : this serene , sensual life , this paganism is my ideal , would you be strong enough to bear it ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
I could endure anything so as not to lose you . 
I feel how little I really mean to you . '' 
`` But Severin -- '' `` But it is so , '' said I , `` and just for that reason -- '' `` For that reason you would -- '' she smiled roguishly -- `` have I guessed it ? '' 
`` Be your slave ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` Be your unrestricted property , without a will of my own , of which you could dispose as you wished , and which would therefore never be a burden to you . 
While you drink life at its fullness , while surrounded by luxury , you enjoy the serene happiness and Olympian love , I want to be your servant , put on and take off your shoes . '' 
`` You really are n't so far from wrong , '' replied Wanda , `` for only as my slave could you endure my loving others . 
Furthermore the freedom of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery . 
It must give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before one and tremble . 
I want a slave , do you hear , Severin ? '' 
`` Am I not your slave ? '' 
`` Then listen to me , '' said Wanda excitedly , seizing my hand . 
`` I want to be yours , as long as I love you . '' 
`` A month ? '' 
`` Perhaps , even two . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` Then you become my slave . '' 
`` And you ? '' 
`` I ? 
Why do you ask ? 
I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my Olympian heights to you , softly , very softly , and secretly . 
`` But what does all this mean , '' said Wanda , resting her head in both hands with her gaze lost in the distance , `` a golden fancy which never can become true . '' 
An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her entire being ; I have never seen her like that . 
`` Why unachievable ? '' 
I began . 
`` Because slavery does n't exist any longer . '' 
`` Then we will go to a country where it still exists , to the Orient , to Turkey , '' I said eagerly . 
`` You would -- Severin -- in all seriousness , '' Wanda replied . 
Her eyes burned . 
`` Yes , in all seriousness , I want to be your slave , '' I continued . 
`` I want your power over me to be sanctified by law ; I want my life to be in your hands , I want nothing that could protect or save me from you . 
Oh , what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent upon your absolute will , your whim , at your beck and call . 
And then what happiness , when at some time you deign to be gracious , and the slave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him . '' 
I knelt down , and leaned my burning forehead against her knee . 
`` You are talking as in a fever , '' said Wanda agitatedly , `` and you really love me so endlessly . '' 
She held me to her breast , and covered me with kisses . 
`` You really want it ? '' 
`` I swear to you now by God and my honor , that I shall be your slave , wherever and whenever you wish it , as soon as you command , '' I exclaimed , hardly master of myself . 
`` And if I take you at your word ? '' 
said Wanda . 
`` Please do ! '' 
`` All this appeals to me , '' she said then . 
`` It is different from anything else -- to know that a man who worships me , and whom I love with all my heart , is so wholly mine , dependent on my will and caprice , my possession and slave , while I -- '' She looked strangely at me . 
`` If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame , '' she continued . 
`` It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already , but you have sworn . '' 
`` And I shall keep my oath . '' 
`` I shall see to that , '' she replied . 
`` I am beginning to enjoy it , and , heaven help me , we wo n't stick to fancies now . 
You shall become my slave , and I -- I shall try to be Venus in Furs . '' 
I thought that at last I knew this woman , understood her , and now I see I have to begin at the very beginning again . 
Only a little while ago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile , and now she tries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness . 
She has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of honor and agree under oath to be her slave , as long as she wishes . 
With her arm around my neck she reads this , unprecedented , incredible document to me . 
The end of each sentence she punctuates with a kiss . 
`` But all the obligations in the contract are on my side , '' I said , teasing her . 
`` Of course , '' she replied with great seriousness , `` you cease to be my lover , and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations towards you . 
You will have to look upon my favors as pure benevolence . 
You no longer have any rights , and no longer can lay claim to any . 
There can be no limit to my power over you . 
Remember , that you wo n't be much better than a dog , or some inanimate object . 
You will be mine , my plaything , which I can break to pieces , whenever I want an hour 's amusement . 
You are nothing , I am everything . 
Do you understand ? '' 
She laughed and kissed me again , and yet a sort of cold shiver ran through me . 
`` Wo n't you allow me a few conditions -- '' I began . 
`` Conditions ? '' 
She contracted her forehead . 
`` Ah ! 
You are afraid already , or perhaps you regret , but it is too late now . 
You have sworn , I have your word of honor . 
But let me hear them . '' 
`` First of all I should like to have it included in our contract , that you will never completely leave me , and then that you will never give me over to the mercies of any of your admirers -- '' `` But Severin , '' exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and with tears in her eyes , `` how can you imagine that I -- and you , a man who loves me so absolutely , who puts himself so entirely in my power -- '' She halted . 
`` No , no ! '' 
I said , covering her hands with kisses . 
`` I do n't fear anything from you that might dishonor me . 
Forgive me the ugly thought . '' 
Wanda smiled happily , leaned her cheek against mine , and seemed to reflect . 
`` You have forgotten something , '' she whispered coquettishly , `` the most important thing ! '' 
`` A condition ? '' 
`` Yes , that I must always wear my furs , '' exclaimed Wanda . 
`` But I promise you I 'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic feeling . 
And I shall be very cruel to you , do you understand ? '' 
`` Shall I sign the contract ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Not yet , '' said Wanda . 
`` I shall first add your conditions , and the actual signing wo n't occur until the proper time and place . '' 
`` In Constantinople ? '' 
`` No . 
I have thought things over . 
What special value would there be in owning a slave where everyone owns slaves . 
What I want is to have a slave , I alone , here in our civilized sober , Philistine world , and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on account of my beauty and personality , not because of law , of property rights , or compulsions . 
This attracts me . 
But at any rate we will go to a country where we are not known and where you can appear before the world as my servant without embarrassment . 
Perhaps to Italy , to Rome or Naples . '' 
We were sitting on Wanda 's ottoman . 
She wore her ermine jacket , her hair was loose and fell like a lion 's mane down her back .
