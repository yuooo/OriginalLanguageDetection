I do n't want to stay in the hotel any longer than I have to . 
It is very embarassing here . 
If I chat with you for more than a minute , people will immediately say : ` The fair Russian is having an affair with her servant , you see , the race of Catherines is n't extinct yet . ' '' 
Half an hour later we went out ; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the Russian cap , and I in my Cracovian costume . 
We created quite a stir . 
I walked about ten paces behind , looking very solemn , but expected momentarily to have to break out into loud laughter . 
There was scarcely a street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear the sign camere ammobiliate . 
Wanda always sent me upstairs , and only when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself ascend . 
By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt . 
We entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable habitation . 
Wanda was already somewhat out of humor . 
Suddenly she said to me : `` Severin , the seriousness with which you play your part is charming , and the restrictions , which we have placed upon each other are really annoying me . 
I ca n't stand it any longer , I do love you , I must kiss you . 
Let 's go into one of the houses . '' 
`` But , my lady -- '' I interposed . 
`` Gregor ? '' 
She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few steps of the dark stair-way ; then she threw her arms about me with passionate tenderness and kissed me . 
`` Oh , Severin , you were very wise . 
You are much more dangerous as slave than I would have imagined ; you are positively irrestible , and I am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again . '' 
`` Do n't you love me any longer then , '' I asked seized by a sudden fright . 
She solemnly shook her head , but kissed me again with her swelling , adorable lips . 
We returned to the hotel . 
Wanda had luncheon , and ordered me also quickly to get something to eat . 
Of course , I was n't served as quickly as she , and so it happened that just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth , the waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture : `` Madame wants you , at once . '' 
I took a rapid and painful leave of my food , and , tired and hungry , hurried toward Wanda , who was already on the street . 
`` I would n't have imagined you could be so cruel , '' I said reproachfully . 
`` With all these , fatiguing duties you do n't even leave me time to eat in peace . '' 
Wanda laughed gaily . 
`` I thought you had finished , '' she said , `` but never mind . 
Man was born to suffer , and you in particular . 
The martyrs did n't have any beefsteaks either . '' 
I followed her resentfully , gnawing at my hunger . 
`` I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city , '' Wanda continued . 
`` It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is shut off and where you can do as you please . 
In such a strange , mad relationship as ours there must be no jarring note . 
I shall rent an entire villa -- and you will be surprised . 
You have my permission now to satisfy your hunger , and look about a bit in Florence . 
I wo n't be home till evening . 
If I need you then , I will have you called . '' 
I looked at the Duomo , the Palazzo Vecchio , the Logia di Lanzi , and then I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno . 
Again and again I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence , whose round cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue , cloudless sky . 
I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide arches the lively waves of the beautiful , yellow river ran , and the green hills which surrounded the city , bearing slender cypresses and extensive buildings , palaces and monasteries . 
It is a different world , this one in which we are -- a gay , sensuous , smiling world . 
The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and somberness of ours . 
It is a long ways off to the last white villas scattered among the pale green of the mountains , and yet there is n't a spot that is n't bright with sunlight . 
The people are less serious than we ; perhaps , they think less , but they all look as though they were happy . 
It is also maintained that death is easier in the South . 
I have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn and love of the senses without torment does exist . 
Wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the winter . 
It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the Arno , opposite the Cascine . 
It is surrounded by an attractive garden with lovely paths , grass plots , and magnificent meadow of camelias . 
It is only two stories high , quadrangular in the Italian fashion . 
An open gallery runs along one side , a sort of loggia with plaster-casts of antique statues ; stone steps lead from it down into the garden . 
From the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin , from which winding stairs lead to my mistress ' bed-chamber . 
Wanda occupies the second story by herself . 
A room on the ground floor has been assigned to me ; it is very attractive , and even has a fireplace . 
I have roamed through the garden . 
On a round hillock I discovered a little temple , but I found its door locked . 
However , there is a chink in the door and when I glue my eye to it , I see the goddess of love on a white pedestal . 
A slight shudder passes over me . 
It seems to me as if she were smiling at me saying : `` Are you there ? 
I have been expecting you . '' 
It is evening . 
An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before my mistress . 
I ascend the wide marble stairs , pass through the anteroom , a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence , and knock at the door of the bedroom . 
I knock very softly for the luxury displayed everywhere intimidates me . 
Consequently no one hears me , and I stand for some time in front of the door . 
I have a feeling as if I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine , and it seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping furs , with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast , and with her little white powdered curls . 
I knocked again . 
Wanda impatiently pulls the door open . 
`` Why so late ? '' 
she asks . 
`` I was standing in front of the door , but you did n't hear me knock , '' I reply timidly . 
She closes the door , and clinging to me , she leads me to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting . 
The entire arrangement of the room is in red damask -- wall-paper , curtains , portieres , hangings of the bed . 
A magnificent painting of Samson and Delilah forms the ceiling . 
Wanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille . 
Her white satin dress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body , leaving her arms and breast bare , and carelessly they nestle amid the dark hair of the great fur of sable , lined with green velvet . 
Her red hair falls down her back as far as the hips , only half held by strings of black pearls . 
`` Venus in Furs , '' I whisper , while she draws me to her breast and threatens to stifle me with her kisses . 
Then I no longer speak and neither do I think ; everything is drowned out in an ocean of unimagined bliss . 
`` Do you still love me ? '' 
she asks , her eye softening in passionate tenderness . 
`` You ask ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` You still remember your oath , '' she continued with an alluring smile , `` now that everything is prepared , everything in readiness , I ask you once more , is it still your serious wish to become my slave ? '' 
`` Am I not ready ? '' 
I asked in surprise . 
`` You have not yet signed the papers . '' 
`` Papers -- what papers ? '' 
`` Oh , I see , you want to give it up , '' she said , `` well then , we will let it go . '' 
`` But Wanda , '' I said , `` you know that nothing gives me greater happiness than to serve you , to be your slave . 
I would give everything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power , even unto death -- '' `` How beautiful you are , '' she whispered , `` when you speak so enthusiastically , so passionately . 
I am more in love with you than ever and you want me to be dominant , stern , and cruel . 
I am afraid , it will be impossible for me to be so . '' 
`` I am not afraid , '' I replied smiling , `` where are the papers ? ' '' 
`` So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power , I have drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have decided to kill yourself . 
In that way I can even kill you , if I so desire . '' 
`` Give them to me . '' 
While I was unfolding the documents and reading them , Wanda got pen and ink . 
She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck , and looked over my shoulder at the paper . 
The first one read : AGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI `` Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced of Mme. Wanda von Dunajew , and renounces all the rights appertaining thereunto ; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a man and nobleman , that hereafter he will be her slave until such time that she herself sets him at liberty again . 
`` As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor , and he is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes , and to obey every one of her commands ; he is always to be submissive to his mistress , and is to consider her every sign of favor as an extraordinary mercy . 
`` Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she deems best , even for the slightest inadvertence or fault , but also is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her or merely for the sake of whiling away the time . 
Should she so desire , she may kill him whenever she wishes ; in short , he is her unrestricted property . 
`` Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty , Severin von Kusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or suffered as her slave , and promises never under any circumstances and in no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation . 
`` Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as often as possible in her furs , especially when she purposes some cruelty toward her slave . '' 
Appended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present day . 
The second document contained only a few words . 
`` Having since many years become weary of existence and its illusions , I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless life . '' 
I was seized with a deep horror when I had finished . 
There was still time , I could still withdraw , but the madness of passion and the sight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder carried me away . 
`` This one you will have to copy , Severin , '' said Wanda , indicating the second document . 
`` It has to be entirely in your own handwriting ; this , of course , is n't necessary in the case of the agreement . '' 
I quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a suicide , and handed them to Wanda . 
She read them , and put them on the table with a smile . 
`` Now have you the courage to sign it ? '' 
she asked with a crafty smile , inclining her head . 
I took the pen . 
`` Let me sign first , '' said Wanda , `` your hand is trembling , are you afraid of the happiness that is to be yours ? '' 
She took the agreement and pen . 
While engaging in my internal struggle , I looked upward for a moment . 
It occurred to me that the painting on the ceiling , like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools , was utterly unhistorical , but this very fact gave it a strange mood which had an almost uncanny effect on me . 
Delilah , an opulent woman with flaming red hair , lay extended , half-disrobed , in a dark fur-cloak , upon a red ottoman , and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and bound by the Philistines . 
Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of a diabolical cruelty ; her eyes , half-closed , met Samson 's , and his with a last look of insane passion cling to hers , for already one of his enemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him . 
`` Now -- '' said Wanda . 
`` Why you are all lost in thought . 
What is the matter with you , everything will remain just as it was , even after you have signed , do n't you know me yet , dear heart ? '' 
I looked at the agreement . 
Her name was written there in bold letters . 
I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic , then I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement . 
`` You are trembling , '' said Wanda calmly , `` shall I help you ? '' 
She gently took hold of my hand , and my name appeared at the bottom of the second paper . 
Wanda looked once more at the two documents , and then locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman . 
`` Now then , give me your passport and money . '' 
I took out my wallet and handed it to her . 
She inspected it , nodded , and put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled before her leaning my head against her breast . 
Suddenly she thrusts me away with her foot , leaps up , and pulls the bell-rope . 
In answer to its sound three young , slender negresses enter ; they are as if carved of ebony , and are dressed from head to foot in red satin ; each one has a rope in her hand . 
Suddenly I realize my position , and am about to rise . 
Wanda stands proudly erect , her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and contemptous eyes is turned toward me . 
She stands before me as mistress , commanding , gives a sign with her hand , and before I really know what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the ground , and have tied me hand and foot . 
As in the case of one about to be executed my arms are bound behind my back , so that I can scarcely move . 
`` Give me the whip , Haydee , '' commands Wanda , with unearthly calm . 
The negress hands it to her mistress , kneeling . 
`` And now take off my heavy furs , '' she continues , `` they impede me . '' 
The negress obeyed . 
`` The jacket there ! '' 
Wanda commanded . 
Haydee quickly brought her the kazabaika , set with ermine , which lay on the bed , and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful movements . 
`` Now tie him to the pillar here ! '' 
The negresses lifted me up , and twisting a heavy rope around my body , tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which supported the top of the wide Italian bed . 
Then they suddenly disappeared , as if the earth had swallowed them . 
Wanda swiftly approached me . 
Her white satin dress flowed behind her in a long train , like silver , like moonlight ; her hair flared like flames against the white fur of her jacket . 
Now she stood in front of me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips , in her right hand she held the whip . 
She uttered an abrupt laugh . 
`` Now play has come to an end between us , '' she said with heartless coldness . 
`` Now we will begin in dead earnest . 
You fool , I laugh at you and despise you ; you who in your insane infatuation have given yourself as a plaything to me , the frivolous and capricious woman . 
You are no longer the man I love , but my slave , at my mercy even unto life and death . 
`` You shall know me ! 
`` First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness , without having done anything to deserve it , so that you may understand what to expect , if you are awkward , disobedient , or refractory . '' 
With a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve , and struck me across the back . 
I winced , for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh . 
`` Well , how do you like that ? '' 
she exclaimed . 
I was silent . 
`` Just wait , you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip , '' she threatened , and simultaneously began to strike me again . 
The blows fell quickly , in rapid succession , with terrific force upon my back , arms , and neck ; I had to grit my teeth not to scream aloud . 
Now she struck me in the face , warm blood ran down , but she laughed , and continued her blows . 
`` It is only now I understand you , '' she exclaimed . 
`` It really is a joy to have some one so completely in one 's power , and a man at that , who loves you -- you do love me ? 
-- No -- Oh ! 
I 'll tear you to shreds yet , and with each blow my pleasure will grow . 
Now , twist like a worm , scream , whine ! 
You will find no mercy in me ! '' 
Finally she seemed tired . 
She tossed the whip aside , stretched out on the ottoman , and rang . 
The negresses entered . 
`` Untie him ! '' 
As they loosened the rope , I fell to the floor like a lump of wood . 
The black women grinned , showing their white teeth . 
`` Untie the rope around his feet . '' 
They did it , but I was unable to rise . 
`` Come over here , Gregor . '' 
I approached the beautiful woman . 
Never did she seem more seductive to me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt . 
`` One step further , '' Wanda commanded . 
`` Now kneel down , and kiss my foot . '' 
She extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin , and I , the supersensual fool , pressed my lips upon it . 
`` Now , you wo n't lay eyes on me for an entire month , Gregor , '' she said seriously . 
`` I want to become a stranger to you , so you will more easily adjust yourself to our new relationship . 
In the meantime you will work in the garden , and await my orders . 
Now , off with you , slave ! '' 
A month has passed with monotonous regularity , heavy work , and a melancholy hunger , hunger for her , who is inflicting all these torments on me . 
I am under the gardener 's orders ; I help him lop the trees and prune the hedges , transplant flowers , turn over the flower beds , sweep the gravel paths ; I share his coarse food and his hard cot ; I rise and go to bed with the chickens . 
Now and then I hear that our mistress is amusing herself , surrounded by admirers . 
Once I heard her gay laughter even down here in the garden . 
I seem awfully stupid to myself . 
Was it the result of my present life , or was I so before ? 
The month is drawing to a close -- the day after to-morrow . 
What will she do with me now , or has she forgotten me , and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day ? 
A written order . 
`` The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service . 
Wanda Dunajew . '' 
With a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the following morning , and enter the bed-room of my divinity . 
It is still filled with a pleasant half darkness . 
`` Is it you , Gregor ? '' 
she asks , while I kneel before the fire-place , building a fire . 
I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice . 
I can not see her herself ; she is invisible behind the curtains of the four-poster bed . 
`` Yes , my mistress , '' I reply . 
`` How late is it ? '' 
`` Past nine o'clock . '' 
`` Breakfast . '' 
I hasten to get it , and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed . 
`` Here is breakfast , my mistress . '' 
Wanda draws back the curtains , and curiously enough at the first glance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair , she seems an absolute stranger , a beautiful woman , but the beloved soft lines are gone . 
This face is hard and has an expression of weariness and satiety . 
Or is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this ? 
She fixes her green eyes upon me , more with curiosity than with menace , perhaps even somewhat pityingly , and lazily pulls the dark sleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder . 
At this moment she is very charming , very maddening , and I feel my blood rising to my head and heart . 
The tray in my hands begins to sway . 
She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on the toilet-table . 
`` You are awkward , slave , '' she says furrowing her brow . 
I lower my looks to the ground , and hold the tray as steadily as possible . 
She eats her breakfast , yawns , and stretches her opulent limbs in the magnificent furs . 
She has rung . 
I enter . 
`` Take this letter to Prince Corsini . '' 
I hurry into the city , and hand the letter to the Prince . 
He is a handsome young man with glowing black eyes . 
Consumed with jealousy , I take his answer to her . 
`` What is the matter with you ? '' 
she asks with lurking spitefulness . 
`` You are very pale . '' 
`` Nothing , mistress , I merely walked rather fast . '' 
At luncheon the prince is at her side , and I am condemned to serve both her and him . 
They joke , and I am , as if non-existent , for both . 
For a brief moment I see black ; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into his glass , and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown . 
`` How awkward , '' Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face . 
The prince laughed , and she also , but I felt the blood rising to my face . 
After luncheon she drove in the Cascine . 
She has a little carriage with a handsome , brown English horse , and holds the reins herself . 
I sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts , and nods with a smile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her . 
As I help her out of the carriage , she leans lightly on my arm ; the contact runs through me like an electric shock . 
She is a wonderful woman , and I love her more than ever . 
For dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women . 
I serve , but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth . 
A slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures . 
It makes you understand very quickly , especially when the instruction is by the way of a small woman 's hand . 
After dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater . 
As she descends the stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and with a diadem of white roses on her hair , she is literally stunning . 
I open the carriage-door , and help her in . 
In front of the theater I leap from the driver 's seat , and in alighting she leaned on my arm , which trembled under the sweet burden . 
I open the door of her box , and then wait in the vestibule . 
The performance lasts four hours ; she receives visits from her cavaliers , the while I grit my teeth with rage . 
It is way beyond midnight when my mistress 's bell sounds for the last time . 
`` Fire ! '' 
she orders abruptly , and when the fire-place crackles , `` Tea ! '' 
When I return with the samovar , she has already undressed , and with the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee . 
Haydee thereupon leaves . 
`` Hand me the sleeping-furs , '' says Wanda , sleepily stretching her lovely limbs . 
I take them from the arm-chair , and hold them while she slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves . 
She then throws herself down on the cushions of the ottoman . 
`` Take off my shoes , and put on my velvet slippers . '' 
I kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts . 
`` Hurry , hurry ! '' 
Wanda exclaims , `` you are hurting me ! 
just you wait -- I will teach you . '' 
She strikes me with the whip , but now the shoe is off . 
`` Now get out ! '' 
Still a kick -- and then I can go to bed . 
To-night I accompanied her to a soiree . 
In the entrance-hall she ordered me to help her out of her furs ; then with a proud smile , confident of victory , she entered the brilliantly illuminated room . 
I again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts , watching hour after hour run by . 
From time to time the sounds of music reached me , when the door remained open for a moment . 
Several servants tried to start a conversation with me , but soon desisted , since I knew only a few words of Italian . 
Finally I fell asleep , and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a violent attack of jealousy . 
I was condemned to death , and saw myself strapped on the board ; the knife fell , I felt it on my neck , but I was still alive -- Then the executioner slapped my face . 
No , it was n't the executioner ; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully before me demanding her furs . 
I am at her side in a moment , and help her on with it . 
There is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs , and in seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in the precious soft furs , and to lift the flowing hair over the collar . 
When she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her body still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable . 
It is enough to drive one mad . 
Finally a day came when there were neither guests , nor theater , nor other company . 
I breathed a sigh of relief . 
Wanda sat in the gallery , reading , and apparently had no orders for me . 
At dusk when the silvery evening mists fell she withdrew . 
I served her at dinner , she ate by herself , but had not a look , not a syllable for me , not even a slap in the face . 
I actually desire a slap from her hand . 
Tears fill my eyes , and I feel that she has humiliated me so deeply , that she does n't even find it worth while to torture or maltreat me any further . 
Before she goes to bed , her bell calls me . 
`` You will sleep here to-night , I had horrible dreams last night , and am afraid of being alone . 
Take one of the cushions from the ottoman , and lie down on the bearskin at my feet . '' 
Then Wanda put out the lights . 
The only illumination in the room was from a small lamp suspended from the ceiling . 
She herself got into bed . 
`` Do n't stir , so as not to wake me . '' 
I did as she had commanded , but could not fall asleep for a long time . 
I saw the beautiful woman , beautiful as a goddess , lying on her back on the dark sleeping-furs ; her arms beneath her neck , with a flood of red hair over them . 
I heard her magnificent breast rise in deep regular breathing , and whenever she moved ever so slightly . 
I woke up and listened to see whether she needed me . 
But she did not require me . 
No task was required of me ; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp , or a revolver which one places under one 's pillow . 
Am I mad or is she ? 
Does all this arise out of an inventive , wanton woman 's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual fantasies , or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters who take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot , like a worm , human beings , who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs ? 
What have I experienced ? 
When I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed , Wanda suddenly placed her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine . 
`` What beautiful eyes you have , '' she said softly , `` and especially now since you suffer . 
Are you very unhappy ? '' 
I bowed my head , and kept silent . 
`` Severin , do you still love me , '' she suddenly exclaimed passionately , `` can you still love me ? '' 
She drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset , the can and cups fell to the floor , and the coffee ran over the carpet . 
`` Wanda -- my Wanda , '' I cried out and held her passionately against me ; I covered her mouth , face , and breast with kisses . 
`` It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse you treat me , the more frequently you betray me . 
Oh , I shall die of pain and love and jealousy . '' 
`` But I have n't betrayed you , as yet , Severin , '' replied Wanda smiling . 
`` Not ? 
Wanda ! 
Do n't jest so mercilessly with me , '' I cried . 
`` Have n't I myself taken the letter to the Prince -- '' `` Of course , it was an invitation for luncheon . '' 
`` You have , since we have been in Florence -- '' `` I have been absolutely faithful to you , '' replied Wanda , `` I swear it by all that is holy to me . 
All that I have done was merely to fulfill your dream and it was done for your sake . 
`` However , I shall take a lover , otherwise things will be only half accomplished , and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having treated you cruelly enough , my dear beautiful slave ! 
But to-day you shall be Severin again , the only one I love . 
I have n't given away your clothes . 
They are here in the chest . 
Go and dress as you used to in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate . 
Forget everything that has happened since ; oh , you will forget it easily in my arms ; I shall kiss away all your sorrows . '' 
She began to treat me tenderly like a child , to kiss me and caress me . 
Finally she said with a gracious smile , `` Go now and dress , I too will dress . 
Shall I put on my fur-jacket ? 
Oh yes , I know , now run along ! '' 
When I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her white satin dress , and the red kazabaika edged with ermine ; her hair was white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond diadem . 
For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine the Second , but she did not give me much time for reminiscences . 
She drew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful hours . 
She was no longer the stern capricious mistress , she was entirely a fine lady , a tender sweetheart . 
She showed me photographs and books which had just appeared , and talked about them with so much intelligence , clarity , and good taste , that I more than once carried her hand to my lips , enraptured . 
She then had me recite several of Lermontov 's poems , and when I was all afire with enthusiasm , she placed her small hand gently on mine . 
Her expression was soft , and her eyes were filled with tender pleasure . 
`` Are you happy ? '' 
`` Not yet . '' 
She then leaned back on the cushions , and slowly opened her kazabaika . 
But I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine . 
`` You are driving me mad . '' 
I stammered . 
`` Come ! '' 
I was already lying in her arms , and like a serpent she was kissing me with her tongue , when again she whispered , `` Are you happy ? '' 
`` Infinitely ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
She laughed aloud . 
It was an evil , shrill laugh which made cold shivers run down by back . 
`` You used to dream of being the slave , the plaything of a beautiful woman , and now you imagine you are a free human being , a man , my lover-you fool ! 
A sign from me , and you are a slave again . 
Down on your knees ! '' 
I sank down from the ottoman to her feet , but my eye still clung doubtingly on hers . 
`` You ca n't believe it , '' she said , looking at me with her arms folded across her breast . 
`` I am bored , and you will just do to while away a couple of hours of time . 
Do n't look at me that way -- '' She kicked me with her foot . 
`` You are just what I want , a human being , a thing , an animal -- '' She rang . 
The three negresses entered . 
`` Tie his hands behind his back . '' 
I remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this . 
They led me into the garden , down to the little vineyard , which forms the southern boundary . 
Corn had been planted between the espaliers , and here and there a few dead stalks still stood . 
To one side was a plough . 
The negresses tied me to a post , and amused themselves sticking me with their golden hair-needles . 
But this did not last long , before Wanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head , and with her hands in the pockets of her jacket . 
She had me untied , and then my hands were fastened together on my back . 
She finally had a yoke put around my neck , and harnessed me to the plough . 
Then her black demons drove me out into the field . 
One of them held the plough , the other one led me by a line , the third applied the whip , and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on . 
When I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said : `` Bring another cover , I want you to dine with me to-day , '' and when I was about to sit down opposite her , she added , `` No , over here , close by my side . '' 
She is in the best of humors , gives me soup with her spoon , feeds me with her fork , and places her head on the table like a playful kitten and flirts with me . 
I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee , who serves in my place , perhaps a little longer than is necessary . 
It is only now that I noticed her noble , almost European cast of countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust , which is as if hewn out of black marble . 
The black devil observes that she pleases me , and , grinning , shows her teeth . 
She has hardly left the room , before Wanda leaps up in a rage . 
`` What , you dare to look at another woman besides me ! 
Perhaps you like her even better than you do me , she is even more demonic ! '' 
I am frightened ; I have never seen her like this before ; she is suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles . 
Venus in Furs is jealous of her slave . 
She snatches the whip from its hook and strikes me in the face ; then she calls her black servants , who bind me , and carry me down into the cellar , where they throw me into a dark , dank , subterranean compartment , a veritable prison-cell . 
Then the lock of the door clicks , the bolts are drawn , a key sings in the lock . 
I am a prisoner , buried . 
I have been lying here for I do n't know how long , bound like a calf about to be hauled to the slaughter , on a bundle of damp straw , without any light , without food , without drink , without sleep . 
It would be like her to let me starve to death , if I do n't freeze to death before then . 
I am shaking with cold . 
Or is it fever ? 
I believe I am beginning to hate this woman . 
A red streak , like blood , floods across the floor ; it is a light falling through the door which is now thrust open . 
Wanda appears on the threshold , wrapped in her sables , holding a lighted torch . 
`` Are you still alive ? '' 
she asks . 
`` Are you coming to kill me ? '' 
I reply with a low , hoarse voice . 
With two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side , she kneels down beside me , and places my head in her lap . 
`` Are you ill ?
