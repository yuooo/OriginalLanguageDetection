`` But the Almighty Lord hath struck him , and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman . '' 
-- The Vulgate , Judith , xvi . 
7 . 
My company was charming . 
Opposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus ; she was not a casual woman of the half-world , who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex , like Mademoiselle Cleopatra , but the real , true goddess of love . 
She sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire , whose reflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes , and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them . 
Her head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes ; it was all I could see of her . 
She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur , and rolled herself up trembling like a cat . 
`` I do n't understand it , '' I exclaimed , `` It is n't really cold any longer . 
For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather . 
You must be nervous . '' 
`` Much obliged for your spring , '' she replied with a low stony voice , and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely , twice in succession . 
`` I really ca n't stand it here much longer , and I am beginning to understand -- '' `` What , dear lady ? '' 
`` I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable . 
All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman , and German philosophy , and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love , have n't even an idea of what love is . '' 
`` But , madame , '' I replied flaring up , `` I surely have n't given you any reason . '' 
`` Oh , you -- '' The divinity sneezed for the third time , and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace . 
`` That 's why I have always been nice to you , and even come to see you now and then , although I catch a cold every time , in spite of all my furs . 
Do you remember the first time we met ? '' 
`` How could I forget it , '' I said . 
`` You wore your abundant hair in brown curls , and you had brown eyes and a red mouth , but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor -- you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin . '' 
`` You were really in love with the costume , and awfully docile . '' 
`` You have taught me what love is . 
Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years . '' 
`` And my faithfulness to you was without equal ! '' 
`` Well , as far as faithfulness goes -- '' `` Ungrateful ! '' 
`` I will not reproach you with anything . 
You are a divine woman , but nevertheless a woman , and like every woman cruel in love . '' 
`` What you call cruel , '' the goddess of love replied eagerly , `` is simply the element of passion and of natural love , which is woman 's nature and makes her give herself where she loves , and makes her love everything , that pleases her . '' 
`` Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the unfaithfulness of the woman he loves ? '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
she replied . 
`` We are faithful as long as we love , but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love , and the giving of herself without enjoyment . 
Who is cruel there -- woman or man ? 
You of the North in general take love too soberly and seriously . 
You talk of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure . '' 
`` That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous , and our relations permanent . '' 
`` And yet a restless , always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of paganism , '' she interrupted , `` but that love , which is the highest joy , which is divine simplicity itself , is not for you moderns , you children of reflection . 
It works only evil in you . 
As soon as you wish to be natural , you become common . 
To you nature seems something hostile ; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece , and out of me a demon . 
You can only exorcise and curse me , or slay yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar . 
And if ever one of you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth , he makes a barefoot pilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow from his withered staff , while under my feet roses , violets , and myrtles spring up every hour , but their fragrance does not agree with you . 
Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense ; let us pagans remain under the debris , beneath the lava ; do not disinter us . 
Pompeii was not built for you , nor our villas , our baths , our temples . 
You do not require gods . 
We are chilled in your world . '' 
The beautiful marble woman coughed , and drew the dark sables still closer about her shoulders . 
`` Much obliged for the classical lesson , '' I replied , `` but you can not deny , that man and woman are mortal enemies , in your serene sunlit world as well as in our foggy one . 
In love there is union into a single being for a short time only , capable of only one thought , one sensation , one will , in order to be then further disunited . 
And you know this better than I ; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will soon feel the feet of the other on his neck -- '' `` And as a rule the man that of the woman , '' cried Madame Venus with proud mockery , `` which you know better than I. '' `` Of course , and that is why I do n't have any illusions . '' 
`` You mean you are now my slave without illusions , and for that reason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy . '' 
`` Madame ! '' 
`` Do n't you know me yet ? 
Yes , I am cruel -- since you take so much delight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so ? 
Man is the one who desires , woman the one who is desired . 
This is woman 's entire but decisive advantage . 
Through his passion nature has given man into woman 's hands , and the woman who does not know how to make him her subject , her slave , her toy , and how to betray him with a smile in the end is not wise . '' 
`` Exactly your principles , '' I interrupted angrily . 
`` They are based on the experience of thousands of years , '' she replied ironically , while her white fingers played over the dark fur . 
`` The more devoted a woman shows herself , the sooner the man sobers down and becomes domineering . 
The more cruelly she treats him and the more faithless she is , the worse she uses him , the more wantonly she plays with him , the less pity she shows him , by so much the more will she increase his desire , be loved , worshipped by him . 
So it has always been , since the time of Helen and Delilah , down to Catherine the Second and Lola Montez . '' 
`` I can not deny , '' I said , `` that nothing will attract a man more than the picture of a beautiful , passionate , cruel , and despotic woman who wantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her whim -- '' `` And in addition wears furs , '' exclaimed the divinity . 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` I know your predilection . '' 
`` Do you know , '' I interrupted , `` that , since we last saw each other , you have grown very coquettish . '' 
`` In what way , may I ask ? '' 
`` In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater advantage than by these dark furs , and that -- '' The divinity laughed . 
`` You are dreaming , '' she cried , `` wake up ! '' 
and she clasped my arm with her marble-white hand . 
`` Do wake up , '' she repeated raucously with the low register of her voice . 
I opened my eyes with difficulty . 
I saw the hand which shook me , and suddenly it was brown as bronze ; the voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who stood before me at his full height of nearly six feet . 
`` Do get up , '' continued the good fellow , `` it is really disgraceful . '' 
`` What is disgraceful ? '' 
`` To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides . '' 
He snuffed the candles which had burned down , and picked up the volume which had fallen from my hand , `` with a book by '' -- he looked at the title page -- `` by Hegel . 
Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr. Severin 's who is expecting us for tea . '' 
`` A curious dream , '' said Severin when I had finished . 
He supported his arms on his knees , resting his face in his delicate , finely veined hands , and fell to pondering . 
I knew that he would n't move for a long time , hardly even breathe . 
This actually happened , but I did n't consider his behavior as in any way remarkable . 
I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly three years , and gotten used to his peculiarities . 
For it can not be denied that he was peculiar , although he was n't quite the dangerous madman that the neighborhood , or indeed the entire district of Kolomea , considered him to be . 
I found his personality not only interesting -- and that is why many also regarded me a bit mad -- but to a degree sympathetic . 
For a Galician nobleman and land-owner , and considering his age -- he was hardly over thirty -- he displayed surprising sobriety , a certain seriousness , even pedantry . 
He lived according to a minutely elaborated , half-philosophical , half-practical system , like clock-work ; not this alone , but also by the thermometer , barometer , aerometer , hydrometer , Hippocrates , Hufeland , Plato , Kant , Knigge , and Lord Chesterfield . 
But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion , and gave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a wall . 
At such times every one preferred to get out of his way . 
While he remained silent , the fire sang in the chimney and the large venerable samovar sang ; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking to and fro smoking my cigar , and the cricket in the old walls sang too . 
I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus , skeletons of animals , stuffed birds , globes , plaster-casts , with which his room was heaped full , until by chance my glance remained fixed on a picture which I had seen often enough before . 
But to-day , under the reflected red glow of the fire , it made an indescribable impression on me . 
It was a large oil painting , done in the robust full-bodied manner of the Belgian school . 
Its subject was strange enough . 
A beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face , with abundant hair tied into a classical knot , on which white powder lay like a soft hoarfrost , was resting on an ottoman , supported on her left arm . 
She was nude in her dark furs . 
Her right hand played with a lash , while her bare foot rested carelessly on a man , lying before her like a slave , like a dog . 
In the sharply outlined , but well-formed linaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate devotion ; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a martyr . 
This man , the footstool for her feet , was Severin , but beardless , and , it seemed , some ten years younger . '' 
Venus in Furs , '' I cried , pointing to the picture . 
`` That is the way I saw her in my dream . '' 
`` I , too , '' said Severin , `` only I dreamed my dream with open eyes . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` It is a tiresome story . '' 
`` Your picture apparently suggested my dream , '' I continued . 
`` But do tell me what it means . 
I can imagine that it played a role in your life , and perhaps a very decisive one . 
But the details I can only get from you . '' 
`` Look at its counterpart , '' replied my strange friend , without heeding my question . 
The counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian 's well-known `` Venus with the Mirror '' in the Dresden Gallery . 
`` And what is the significance ? '' 
Severin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which Titian garbed his goddess of love . 
`` It , too , is a ` Venus in Furs , ' '' he said with a slight smile . 
`` I do n't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention . 
He simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina , and was tactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her majestic allure with cold satisfaction . 
He looks as though his task were becoming burdensome enough . 
The picture is painted flattery . 
Later an ` expert ' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the name of Venus . 
The furs of the despot in which Titian 's fair model wrapped herself , probably more for fear of a cold than out of modesty , have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that constitute woman 's essence and her beauty . 
`` But enough of that . 
The picture , as it now exists , is a bitter satire on our love . 
Venus in this abstract North , in this icy Christian world , has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch cold -- '' Severin laughed , and lighted a fresh cigarette . 
Just then the door opened and an attractive , stoutish , blonde girl entered . 
She had wise , kindly eyes , was dressed in black silk , and brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea . 
Severin took one of the latter , and decapitated it with his knife . 
`` Did n't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled ? '' 
he cried with a violence that made the young woman tremble . 
`` But my dear Sevtchu -- '' she said timidly . 
`` Sevtchu , nothing , '' he yelled , `` you are to obey , obey , do you understand ? '' 
and he tore the kantchuk -LSB- Footnote : A long whip with a short handle . -RSB- 
which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook . 
The woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe . 
`` Just wait , I 'll get you yet , '' he called after her . 
`` But Severin , '' I said placing my hand on his arm , `` how can you treat a pretty young woman thus ? '' 
`` Look at the woman , '' he replied , blinking humorously with his eyes . 
`` Had I flattered her , she would have cast the noose around my neck , but now , when I bring her up with the kantchuk , she adores me . '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
`` Nonsense , nothing , that is the way you have to break in women . '' 
`` Well , if you like it , live like a pasha in your harem , but do n't lay down theories for me -- '' `` Why not , '' he said animatedly . 
`` Goethe 's ` you must be hammer or anvil ' is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman . 
Did n't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you ? 
Woman 's power lies in man 's passion , and she knows how to use it , if man does n't understand himself . 
He has only one choice : to be the tyrant over or the slave of woman . 
As soon as he gives in , his neck is under the yoke , and the lash will soon fall upon him . '' 
`` Strange maxims ! '' 
`` Not maxims , but experiences , '' he replied , nodding his head , '' I have actually felt the lash . 
I am cured . 
Do you care to know how ? '' 
He rose , and got a small manuscript from his massive desk , and put it in front of me . 
`` You have already asked about the picture . 
I have long owed you an explanation . 
Here -- read ! '' 
Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me , and seemed to dream with open eyes . 
Silence had fallen again , and again the fire sang in the chimney , and the samovar and the cricket in the old walls . 
I opened the manuscript and read : CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN . 
The margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known lines from Faust : `` Thou supersensual sensual wooer A woman leads you by the nose . '' 
-- MEPHISTOPHELES . 
I turned the title-page and read : `` What follows has been compiled from my diary of that period , because it is impossible ever frankly to write of one 's past , but in this way everything retains its fresh colors , the colors of the present . '' 
Gogol , the Russian Moliere , says -- where ? 
well , somewhere -- `` the real comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down . '' 
A wonderful saying . 
So I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down . 
The atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers , which overcomes me and gives me a headache . 
The smoke of the fireplace curls and condenses into figures , small gray-bearded kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me . 
Chubby-cheeked cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees . 
I have to smile involuntarily , even laugh aloud , as I am writing down my adventures . 
Yet I am not writing with ordinary ink , but with red blood that drips from my heart . 
All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it throbs and hurts , and now and then a tear falls on the paper . 
The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort . 
You see no one , and no one sees you . 
It is boring enough to write idyls . 
I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings , furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season , a dozen virtuosos with concertos , trios , and duos , but -- what am I saying -- the upshot of it all is that I do n't do much more than to stretch the canvas , smooth the bow , line the scores . 
For I am -- no false modesty , Friend Severin ; you can lie to others , but you do n't quite succeed any longer in lying to yourself -- I am nothing but a dilettante , a dilettante in painting , in poetry , in music , and several other of the so-called unprofitable arts , which , however , at present secure for their masters the income of a cabinet minister , or even that of a minor potentate . 
Above all else I am a dilettante in life . 
Up to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry . 
I never got far beyond the preparation , the plan , the first act , the first stanza . 
There are people like that who begin everything , and never finish anything . 
I am such a one . 
But what am I saying ? 
To the business in hand . 
I lie in my window , and the miserable little town , which fills me with despondency , really seems infinitely full of poetry . 
How wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven with golden sunlight ; mountain-torrents weave through them like ribbons of silver ! 
How clear and blue the heavens into which snowcapped crags project ; how green and fresh the forested slopes ; the meadows on which small herds graze , down to the yellow billows of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again . 
The house in which I live stands in a sort of park , or forest , or wilderness , whatever one wants to call it , and is very solitary . 
Its sole inhabitants are myself , a widow from Lemberg , and Madame Tartakovska , who runs the house , a little old woman , who grows older and smaller each day . 
There are also an old dog that limps on one leg , and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn . 
This ball of yarn , I believe , belongs to the widow . 
She is said to be really beautiful , this widow , still very young , twenty-four at the most , and very rich . 
She dwells in the first story , and I on the ground floor . 
She always keeps the green blinds drawn , and has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants . 
I for my part down below have a comfortable , intimate arbor of honeysuckle , in which I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs . 
I can look up on the balcony . 
Sometimes I actually do so , and then from time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network . 
Really the beautiful woman up there does n't interest me very much , for I am in love with someone else , and terribly unhappy at that ; far more unhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon l'Escault , because the object of my adoration is of stone . 
In the garden , in the tiny wilderness , there is a graceful little meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully . 
On this meadow is a stone statue of Venus , the original of which , I believe , is in Florence . 
This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in all my life . 
That , however , does not signify much , for I have seen few beautiful women , or rather few women at all . 
In love too , I am a dilettante who never got beyond the preparation , the first act . 
But why talk in superlatives , as if something that is beautiful could be surpassed ? 
It is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful . 
I love her passionately with a morbid intensity ; madly as one can only love a woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally uniform , eternally calm , stony smile . 
I literally adore her . 
I often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when the sun broods over the forest . 
Often I visit that cold , cruel mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her , with the face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest , and my prayers go up to her . 
The rising moon , which just now is waning , produces an indescribable effect . 
It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow in its gleam of silver . 
The goddess stands as if transfigured , and seems to bathe in the soft moonlight . 
Once when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks leading to the house , I suddenly saw a woman 's figure , white as stone , under the illumination of the moon and separated from me merely by a screen of trees . 
It seemed as if the beautiful woman of marble had taken pity on me , become alive , and followed me . 
I was seized by a nameless fear , my heart threatened to burst , and instead -- Well , I am a dilettante . 
As always , I broke down at the second stanza ; rather , on the contrary , I did not break down , but ran away as fast as my legs would carry me . 
What an accident ! 
Through a Jew , dealing in photographs I secured a picture of my ideal . 
It is a small reproduction of Titian 's `` Venus with the Mirror . '' 
What a woman ! 
I want to write a poem , but instead , I take the reproduction , and write on it : Venus in Furs . 
You are cold , while you yourself fan flames . 
By all means wrap yourself in your despotic furs , there is no one to whom they are more appropriate , cruel goddess of love and of beauty ! 
-- After a while I add a few verses from Goethe , which I recently found in his paralipomena to Faust . 
TO AMOR `` The pair of wings a fiction are , The arrows , they are naught but claws , The wreath conceals the little horns , For without any doubt he is Like all the gods of ancient Greece Only a devil in disguise . '' 
Then I put the picture before me on my table , supporting it with a book , and looked at it . 
I was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms in her furs of dark sable ; by the severity and hardness which lay in this cold marble-like face . 
Again I took my pen in hand , and wrote the following words : `` To love , to be loved , what happiness ! 
And yet how the glamour of this pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a woman who makes a plaything out of us , of being the slave of a beautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot . 
Even Samson , the hero , the giant , again put himself into the hands of Delilah , even after she had betrayed him , and again she betrayed him , and the Philistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end he kept fixed , drunken with rage and love , upon the beautiful betrayer . '' 
I was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor , and reading in the Book of Judith . 
I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman who cut off his head with a sword , and because of his beautiful sanguinary end . 
`` The almighty Lord hath struck him , and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman . '' 
This sentence strangely impressed me . 
How ungallant these Jews are , I thought . 
And their God might choose more becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex . 
`` The almighty Lord hath struck him , and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman , '' I repeated to myself . 
What shall I do , so that He may punish me ? 
Heaven preserve us ! 
Here comes the housekeeper , who has again diminished somewhat in size overnight . 
And up there among the green twinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again . 
Is it Venus , or the widow ? 
This time it happens to be the widow , for Madame Tartakovska makes a courtesy , and asks me in her name for something to read . 
I run to my room , and gather together a couple of volumes . 
Later I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them , and now it and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there together . 
What will she say ? 
I hear her laugh . 
Is she laughing at me ? 
It is full moon . 
It is already peering over the tops of the low hemlocks that fringe the park . 
A silvery exhalation fills the terrace , the groups of trees , all the landscape , as far as the eye can reach ; in the distance it gradually fades away , like trembling waters . 
I can not resist . 
I feel a strange urge and call within me . 
I put on my clothes again and go out into the garden . 
Some power draws me toward the meadow , toward her , who is my divinity and my beloved . 
The night is cool . 
I feel a slight chill . 
The atmosphere is heavy with the odor of flowers and of the forest . 
It intoxicates . 
What solemnity ! 
What music round about ! 
A nightingale sobs . 
The stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour . 
The meadow seems smooth , like a mirror , like a covering of ice on a pond . 
The statue of Venus stands out august and luminous . 
But -- what has happened ? 
From the marble shoulders of the goddess a large dark fur flows down to her heels . 
I stand dumbfounded and stare at her in amazement ; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me and I take flight . 
I hasten my steps , and notice that I have missed the main path . 
As I am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus sitting before me on a stone bench , not the beautiful woman of marble , but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing pulses . 
She has actually come to life for me , like the statue that began to breathe for her creator . 
Indeed , the miracle is only half completed . 
Her white hair seems still to be of stone , and her white gown shimmers like moonlight , or is it satin ? 
From her shoulders the dark fur flows . 
But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks begin to take color . 
Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall upon me , and now she laughs . 
Her laughter is very mysterious , very -- I do n't know . 
It can not be described , it takes my breath away . 
I flee further , and after every few steps I have to pause to take breath . 
The mocking laughter pursues me through the dark leafy paths , across light open spaces , through the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce . 
I can no longer find my way , I wander about utterly confused , with cold drops of perspiration on the forehead . 
Finally I stand still , and engage in a short monologue . 
It runs -- well -- one is either very polite to one 's self or very rude . 
I say to myself : `` Donkey ! '' 
This word exercises a remarkable effect , like a magic formula , which sets me free and makes me master of myself . 
I am perfectly quiet in a moment . 
With considerable pleasure I repeat : `` Donkey ! '' 
Now everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again . 
There is the fountain , there the alley of box-wood , there the house which I am slowly approaching . 
Yet -- suddenly the appearance is here again . 
Behind the green screen through which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with silver , I again see the white figure , the woman of stone whom I adore , whom I fear and flee . 
With a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and reflect . 
What am I really , a little dilettante or a great big donkey ? 
A sultry morning , the atmosphere is dead , heavily laden with odors , yet stimulating . 
Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor , reading in the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers into beasts . 
A wonderful picture of antique love . 
There is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling . 
A woman 's dress -- She is there -- Venus -- but without furs -- No , this time it is merely the widow -- and yet -- Venus-oh , what a woman ! 
As she stands there in her light white morning gown , looking at me , her slight figure seems full of poetry and grace . 
She is neither large , nor small ; her head is alluring , piquant -- in the sense of the period of the French marquises -- rather than formally beautiful . 
What enchantment and softness , what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth ! 
Her skin is so infinitely delicate , that the blue veins show through everywhere ; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom . 
How abundant her red hair-it is red , not blonde or golden-yellow -- how diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck ! 
Now her eyes meet mine like green lightnings -- they are green , these eyes of hers , whose power is so indescribable -- green , but as are precious stones , or deep unfathomable mountain lakes . 
She observes my confusion , which has even made me discourteous , for I have remained seated and still have my cap on my head . 
She smiles roguishly . 
Finally I rise and bow to her . 
She comes closer , and bursts out into a loud , almost childlike laughter . 
I stammer , as only a little dilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion . 
Thus our acquaintance began . 
The divinity asks for my name , and mentions her own . 
Her name is Wanda von Dunajew . 
And she is actually my Venus . 
`` But madame , what put the idea into your head ? '' 
`` The little picture in one of your books -- '' `` I had forgotten about it . '' 
`` The curious notes on its back -- '' `` Why curious ? '' 
She looked at me . 
`` I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time -- for the sake of the change -- and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe . '' 
`` Dear lady -- in fact -- '' Again I fell victim to an odious , asinine stammering , and in addition blushed in a way that might have been appropriate for a youngster of sixteen , but not for me , who was almost a full ten years older -- `` You were afraid of me last night . '' 
`` Really -- of course -- but wo n't you sit down ? '' 
She sat down , and enjoyed my embarrassment -- for actually I was even more afraid of her now in the full light of day . 
A delightful expression of contempt hovered about her upper lip . 
`` You look at love , and especially woman , '' she began , `` as something hostile , something against which you put up a defense , even if unsuccessfully . 
You feel that their power over you gives you a sensation of pleasurable torture , of pungent cruelty . 
This is a genuinely modern point of view . '' 
`` You do n't share it ? '' 
`` I do not share it , '' she said quickly and decisively , shaking her head , so that her curls flew up like red flames . 
`` The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene sensuousness of the Greeks -- pleasure without pain . 
I do not believe in the kind of love which is preached by Christianity , by the moderns , by the knights of the spirit . 
Yes , look at me , I am worse than a heretic , I am a pagan . 
` Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel When in Ida 's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles ? ' 
`` These lines from Goethe 's Roman Elegy have always delighted me . 
`` In nature there is only the love of the heroic age , ` when gods and goddesses loved . ' 
At that time ` desire followed the glance , enjoyment desire . ' 
All else is factitious , affected , a lie . 
Christianity , whose cruel emblem , the cross , has always had for me an element of the monstrous , brought something alien and hostile into nature and its innocent instincts . 
`` The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern man . 
I do not care to have a share in it . '' 
`` Yes , Mount Olympus would be the place for you , madame , '' I replied , `` but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity , least of all in love . 
The idea of sharing a woman , even if it were an Aspasia , with another revolts us . 
We are jealous as is our God . 
For example , we have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne . 
`` We prefer one of Holbein 's meagre , pallid virgins , which is wholly ours to an antique Venus , no matter how divinely beautiful she is , but who loves Anchises to-day , Paris to-morrow , Adonis the day after . 
And if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing , passionate devotion to such a woman , her serene joy of life appears to us as something demonic and cruel , and we read into our happiness a sin which we must expiate . '' 
`` So you too are one of those who rave about modern women , those miserable hysterical feminine creatures who do n't appreciate a real man in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine ideal . 
Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian duties ; they cheat and are cheated ; they always seek again and choose and reject ; they are never happy , and never give happiness . 
They accuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and live as Helen and Aspasia lived . 
Nature admits of no permanence in the relation between man and woman . '' 
`` But , my dear lady -- '' `` Let me finish . 
It is only man 's egoism which wants to keep woman like some buried treasure . 
All endeavors to introduce permanence in love , the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence , have gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies , vows , and legalities . 
Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself over to corruption ? '' 
`` But -- '' `` But you are about to say , the individual who rebels against the arrangements of society is ostracized , branded , stoned . 
So be it . 
I am willing to take the risk ; my principles are very pagan . 
I will live my own life as it pleases me . 
I am willing to do without your hypocritical respect ; I prefer to be happy . 
The inventors of the Christian marriage have done well , simultaneously to invent immortality . 
I , however , have no wish to live eternally . 
When with my last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned comes to an end here below , what does it profit me whether my pure spirit joins the choirs of angels , or whether my dust goes into the formation of new beings ? 
Shall I belong to one man whom I do n't love , merely because I have once loved him ? 
No , I do not renounce ; I love everyone who pleases me , and give happiness to everyone who loves me . 
Is that ugly ? 
No , it is more beautiful by far , than if cruelly I enjoy the tortures , which my beauty excites , and virtuously reject the poor fellow who is pining away for me . 
I am young , rich , and beautiful , and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and enjoyment . '' 
While she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly , and I had taken hold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them , but being a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again . 
`` Your frankness , '' I said , `` delights me , and not it alone -- '' My confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were a rope around my neck . 
`` You were about to say -- '' `` I was about to say -- I was -- I am sorry -- I interrupted you . '' 
`` How , so ? '' 
A long pause . 
She is doubtless engaging in a monologue , which translated into my language would be comprised in the single word , `` donkey . '' 
`` If I may ask , '' I finally began , `` how did you arrive at these -- these conclusions ? '' 
`` Quite simply , my father was an intelligent man . 
From my cradle onward I was surrounded by replicas of ancient art ; at ten years of age I read Gil Blas , at twelve La Pucelle . 
Where others had Hop-o ' - my-thumb , Bluebeard , Cinderella , as childhood friends , mine were Venus and Apollo , Hercules and Lackoon . 
My husband 's personality was filled with serenity and sunlight . 
Not even the incurable illness which fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow . 
On the very night of his death he took me in his arms , and during the many months when he lay dying in his wheel chair , he often said jokingly to me : ` Well , have you already picked out a lover ? ' 
I blushed with shame . 
` Do n't deceive me , ' he added on one occasion , ` that would seem ugly to me , but pick out an attractive lover , or preferably several . 
You are a splendid woman , but still half a child , and you need toys . ' 
`` I suppose , I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had no lover ; but it was through him that I have become what I am , a woman of Greece . '' 
`` A goddess , '' I interrupted . 
`` Which one , '' she smiled . 
`` Venus . '' 
She threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows . 
`` Perhaps , even a ` Venus in Furs . ' 
Watch out , I have a large , very large fur , with which I could cover you up entirely , and I have a mind to catch you in it as in a net . '' 
`` Do you believe , '' I said quickly , for an idea which seemed good , in spite of its conventionality and triteness , flashed into my head , `` do you believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the present time , that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity among our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and serenity ? '' '' 
Undraped , of course not , but in furs , '' she replied smiling , `` would you care to see mine ? '' 
`` And then -- '' `` What then ? '' 
`` Beautiful , free , serene , and happy human beings , such as the Greeks were , are only possible when it is permitted to have slaves who will perform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else labor for them . '' 
`` Of course , '' she replied playfully , `` an Olympian divinity , such as I am , requires a whole army of slaves . 
Beware of me ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
I myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this `` why '' ; it did not startle her in the least . 
She drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became visible , and then said lightly , as if she were discussing some trifling matter , `` Do you want to be my slave ? '' 
`` There is no equality in love , '' I replied solemnly . 
`` Whenever it is a matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled , it seems much more satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman . 
But where shall I find the woman who knows how to rule , calmly , full of self-confidence , even harshly , and not seek to gain her power by means of petty nagging ? '' 
`` Oh , that might not be so difficult . '' 
`` You think -- '' `` I -- for instance -- '' she laughed and leaned far back -- `` I have a real talent for despotism -- I also have the necessary furs -- but last night you were really seriously afraid of me ! '' 
`` Quite seriously . ''
