`` And now ? '' 
`` Now , I am more afraid of you than ever ! '' 
We are together every day , I and -- Venus ; we are together a great deal . 
We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor , and have tea in her little sitting-room . 
I have an opportunity to unfold all my small , very small talents . 
Of what use would have been my study of all the various sciences , my playing at all the arts , if I were unable in the case of a pretty , little woman -- But this woman is by no means little ; in fact she impresses me tremendously . 
I made a drawing of her to-day , and felt particularly clearly , how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a cameo-head like hers . 
The configuration of her face has little of the Roman , but much of the Greek . 
Sometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche , and then again as Astarte . 
It depends upon the expression in her eyes , whether it is vaguely dreamy , or half-consuming , filled with tired desire . 
She , however , insists that it be a portrait-likeness . 
I shall make her a present of furs . 
How could I have any doubts ? 
If not for her , for whom would princely furs be suitable ? 
I was with her yesterday evening , reading the Roman Elegies to her . 
Then I laid the book aside , and improvised something for her . 
She seemed pleased ; rather more than that , she actually hung upon my words , and her bosom heaved . 
Or was I mistaken ? 
The rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes , the fire crackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort . 
I felt quite at home with her , and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman ; I kissed her hand , and she permitted it . 
Then I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for her . 
VENUS IN FURS . 
`` Place thy foot upon thy slave , Oh thou , half of hell , half of dreams ; Among the shadows , dark and grave , Thy extended body softly gleams . '' 
And -- so on . 
This time I really got beyond the first stanza . 
At her request I gave her the poem in the evening , keeping no copy . 
And now as I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first stanza . 
I am filled with a very curious sensation . 
I do n't believe that I am in love with Wanda ; I am sure that at our first meeting , I felt nothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion . 
But I feel how her extraordinary , really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares about me . 
It is n't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me ; it is a physical subjection , coming on slowly , but for that reason more absolutely . 
I suffer under it more and more each day , and she -- she merely smiles . 
Without any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day : `` You interest me . 
Most men are very commonplace , without verve or poetry . 
In you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a deep seriousness , which delight me . 
I might learn to love you . '' 
After a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow and the statue of Venus . 
All about us the earth steamed ; mists rose up toward heaven like clouds of incense ; a shattered rainbow still hovered in the air . 
The trees were still shedding drops , but sparrows and finches were already hopping from twig to twig . 
They are twittering gaily , as if very much pleased at something . 
Everything is filled with a fresh fragrance . 
We can not cross the meadow for it is still wet . 
In the sunlight it looks like a small pool , and the goddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like surface . 
About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing , which , illuminated by the sun , seem to hover above her like an aureole . 
Wanda is enjoying the lovely scene . 
As all the benches along the walk are still wet , she supports herself on my arm to rest a while . 
A soft weariness permeates her whole being , her eyes are half closed ; I feel the touch of her breath on my cheek . 
How I managed to get up courage enough I really do n't know , but I took hold of her hand , asking , `` Could you love me ? '' 
`` Why not , '' she replied , letting her calm , clear look rest upon me , but not for long . 
A moment later I am kneeling before her , pressing my burning face against the fragrant muslin of her gown . 
`` But Severin -- this is n't right , '' she cried . 
But I take hold of her little foot , and press my lips upon it . 
`` You are getting worse and worse ! '' 
she cried . 
She tore herself free , and fled rapidly toward the house , the while her adorable slipper remained in my hand . 
Is it an omen ? 
All day long I did n't dare to go near her . 
Toward evening as I was sitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the greenery of her balcony . 
`` Why do n't you come up ? '' 
he called down impatiently . 
I ran upstairs , and at the top lost courage again . 
I knocked very lightly . 
She did n't say come-in , but opened the door herself , and stood on the threshold . 
`` Where is my slipper ? '' 
`` It is -- I have -- I want , '' I stammered . 
`` Get it , and then we will have tea together , and chat . '' 
When I returned , she was engaged in making tea . 
I ceremoniously placed the slipper on the table , and stood in the corner like a child awaiting punishment . 
I noticed that her brows were slightly contracted , and there was an expression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted me . 
All of a sudden she broke out laughing . 
`` So -- you are really in love -- with me ? '' 
`` Yes , and I suffer more from it than you can imagine ? '' 
`` You suffer ? '' 
she laughed again . 
I was revolted , mortified , annihilated , but all this was quite useless . 
`` Why ? '' 
she continued , `` I like you , with all my heart . '' 
She gave me her hand , and looked at me in the friendliest fashion . 
`` And will you be my wife ? '' 
Wanda looked at me -- how did she look at me ? 
I think first of all with surprise , and then with a tinge of irony . 
`` What has given you so much courage , all at once ? '' 
`` Courage ? '' 
`` Yes courage , to ask anyone to be your wife , and me in particular ? '' 
She lifted up the slipper . 
`` Was it through a sudden friendship with this ? 
But joking aside . 
Do you really wish to marry me ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , Severin , that is a serious matter . 
I believe , you love me , and I care for you too , and what is more important each of us finds the other interesting . 
There is no danger that we would soon get bored , but , you know , I am a fickle person , and just for that reason I take marriage seriously . 
If I assume obligations , I want to be able to meet them . 
But I am afraid -- no -- it would hurt you . '' 
`` Please be perfectly frank with me , '' I replied . 
`` Well then honestly , I do n't believe I could love a man longer than -- '' She inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused . 
`` A year . '' 
`` What do you imagine -- a month perhaps . '' 
`` Not even me ? '' 
`` Oh you -- perhaps two . '' 
`` Two months ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` Two months is very long . '' 
`` You go beyond antiquity , madame . '' 
`` You see , you can not stand the truth . '' 
Wanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace , watching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece . 
`` What shall I do with you ? '' 
she began anew . 
`` Whatever you wish , '' I replied with resignation , `` whatever will give you pleasure . '' 
`` How illogical ! '' 
she cried , `` first you want to make me your wife , and then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with . '' 
`` Wanda -- I love you . '' 
`` Now we are back to the place where we started . 
You love me , and want to make me your wife , but I do n't want to enter into a new marriage , because I doubt the permanence of both my and your feelings . '' 
`` But if I am willing to take the risk with you ? '' 
I replied . 
`` But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you , '' she said quietly . 
`` I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my entire life , but he would have to be a whole man , a man who would dominate me , who would subjugate me by his inate strength , do you understand ? 
And every man -- I know this very well -- as soon as he falls in love becomes weak , pliable , ridiculous . 
He puts himself into the woman 's hands , kneels down before her . 
The only man whom I could love permanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel . 
I 've gotten to like you so much , however , that I 'll try it with you . '' 
I fell down at her feet . 
`` For heaven 's sake , here you are kneeling already , '' she said mockingly . 
`` You are making a good beginning . '' 
When I had risen again she continued , `` I will give you a year 's time to win me , to convince me that we are suited to each other , that we might live together . 
If you succeed , I will become your wife , and a wife , Severin , who will conscientiously and strictly perform all her duties . 
During this year we will live as though we were married -- '' My blood rose to my head . 
In her eyes too there was a sudden flame -- `` We will live together , '' she continued , `` share our daily life , so that we may find out whether we are really fitted for each other . 
I grant you all the rights of a husband , of a lover , of a friend . 
Are you satisfied ? '' 
`` I suppose , I 'll have to be ? '' 
`` You do n't have to . '' 
`` Well then , I want to -- '' `` Splendid . 
That is how a man speaks . 
Here is my hand . '' 
For ten days I have been with her every hour , except at night . 
All the time I was allowed to look into her eyes , hold her hands , listen to what she said , accompany her wherever she went . 
My love seems to me like a deep , bottomless abyss , into which I subside deeper and deeper . 
There is nothing now which could save me from it . 
This afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the Venus-statue . 
I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap ; she wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess . 
Suddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration . 
Losing command over myself , I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips , and she -- she drew me close to her heaving breast . 
`` Are you angry ? '' 
I then asked her . 
`` I am never angry at anything that is natural -- '' she replied , `` but I am afraid you suffer . '' 
`` Oh , I am suffering frightfully . '' 
`` Poor friend ! '' 
she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head . 
`` I hope it is n't through any fault of mine . '' 
`` No -- '' I replied , -- `` and yet my love for you has become a sort of madness . 
The thought that I might lose you , perhaps actually lose you , torments me day and night . '' 
`` But you do n't yet possess me , '' said Wanda , and again she looked at me with that vibrant , consuming expression , which had already once before carried me away . 
Then she rose , and with her small transparent hands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head of Venus . 
Half against my will I threw my arm around her body . 
`` I can no longer live without you , oh wonderful woman , '' I said . 
`` Believe me , believe only this once , that this time it is not a phrase , not a thing of dreams . 
I feel deep down in my innermost soul , that my life belongs inseparably with yours . 
If you leave me , I shall perish , go to pieces . '' 
`` That will hardly be necessary , for I love you , '' she took hold of my chin , `` you foolish man ! '' 
`` But you will be mine only under conditions , while I belong to you unconditionally -- '' `` That is n't wise , Severin , '' she replied almost with a start . 
`` Do n't you know me yet , do you absolutely refuse to know me ? 
I am good when I am treated seriously and reasonably , but when you abandon yourself too absolutely to me , I grow arrogant -- '' `` So be it , be arrogant , be despotic , '' I cried in the fulness of exaltation , `` only be mine , mine forever . '' 
I lay at her feet , embracing her knees . 
`` Things will end badly , my friend , '' she said soberly , without moving . 
`` It shall never end , '' I cried excitedly , almost violently . 
`` Only death shall part us . 
If you can not be mine , all mine and for always , then I want to be your slave , serve you , suffer everything from you , if only you wo n't drive me away . '' 
`` Calm yourself , '' she said , bending down and kissing my forehead , `` I am really very fond of you , but your way is not the way to win and hold me . '' 
`` I want to do everything , absolutely everything , that you want , only not to lose you , '' I cried , `` only not that , I can not bear the thought . '' 
`` Do get up . '' 
I obeyed . 
`` You are a strange person , '' continued Wanda . 
`` You wish to possess me at any price ? '' 
`` Yes , at any price . '' 
`` But of what value , for instance , would that be ? '' 
-- She pondered ; a lurking uncanny expression entered her eyes -- `` If I no longer loved you , if I belonged to another . '' 
A shudder ran through me . 
I looked at her She stood firmly and confident before me , and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam . 
`` You see , '' she continued , `` the very thought frightens you . '' 
A beautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face . 
`` I feel a perfect horror , when I imagine , that the woman I love and who has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless of me . 
But have I still a choice ? 
If I love such a woman , even unto madness , shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake of a bit of boastful strength ; shall I send a bullet through my brains ? 
I have two ideals of woman . 
If I can not obtain the one that is noble and simple , the woman who will faithfully and truly share my life , well then I do n't want anything half-way or lukewarm . 
Then I would rather be subject to a woman without virtue , fidelity , or pity . 
Such a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal . 
If I am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love , fully and wholly , I want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs ; I want to be maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love , and the more cruelly the better . 
This too is a luxury . '' 
`` Have you lost your senses , '' cried Wanda . 
`` I love you with all my soul , '' I continued , `` with all my senses , and your presence and personality are absolutely essential to me , if I am to go on living . 
Choose between my ideals . 
Do with me what you will , make of me your husband or your slave . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Wanda , contracting her small but strongly arched brows , `` it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man , who interests me and loves me , completely in my power ; at least I shall not lack pastime . 
You were imprudent enough to leave the choice to me . 
Therefore I choose ; I want you to be my slave , I shall make a plaything for myself out of you ! '' 
`` Oh , please do , '' I cried half-shuddering , half-enraptured . 
`` If the foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement , it is likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites . 
We are such opposites , almost enemies . 
That is why my love is part hate , part fear . 
In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other anvil . 
I wish to be the anvil . 
I can not be happy when I look down upon the woman I love . 
I want to adore a woman , and this I can only do when she is cruel towards me . '' 
`` But , Severin , '' replied Wanda , almost angrily , `` do you believe me capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do , and whom I love ? '' 
`` Why not , if I adore you the more on this account ? 
It is possible to love really only that which stands above us , a woman , who through her beauty , temperament , intelligence , and strength of will subjugates us and becomes a despot over us . '' 
`` Then that which repels others , attracts you . '' 
`` Yes . 
That is the strange part of me . '' 
`` Perhaps , after all , there is n't anything so very unique or strange in all your passions , for who does n't love beautiful furs ? 
And everyone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are related . '' 
`` But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest degree , '' I replied . 
`` In other words , reason has little power over you , and you are by nature , soft , sensual , yielding . '' 
`` Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature ? '' 
`` The martyrs ? '' 
`` On the contrary , they were supersensual men , who found enjoyment in suffering . 
They sought out the most frightful tortures , even death itself , as others seek joy , and as they were , so am I -- supersensual . '' 
`` Have a care that in being such , you do not become a martyr to love , the martyr of a woman . '' 
We are sitting on Wanda 's little balcony in the mellow fragrant summer night . 
A twofold roof is above us , first the green ceiling of climbing-plants , and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable stars . 
The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park . 
I am sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity , and am telling her of my childhood . 
`` And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked in you ? '' 
asked Wanda . 
`` Of course , I ca n't remember a time when I did n't have them . 
Even in my cradle , so mother has told me , I was supersensual . 
I scorned the healthy breast of my nurse , and had to be brought up on goats ' milk . 
As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women , which really was only an expression of an inordinate interest in them . 
I was oppressed by the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church , and actually afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints . 
Secretly , however , I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood in my father 's little library . 
I kneeled down before her , and to her I said the prayers I had been taught -- the Paternoster , the Ave Maria , and the Credo . 
`` Once at night I left my bed to visit her . 
The sickle of the moon was my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light . 
I prostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet , as I had seen our peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior . 
`` An irresistible yearning seized me . 
`` I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold lips . 
A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled , and later in a dream , it seemed to me , as if the goddess stood beside my bed , threatening me with up-raised arm . 
`` I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium . 
I passionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world of antiquity accessible to me . 
Soon I was more familiar with the gods of Greece than with the religion of Jesus . 
I was with Paris when he gave the fateful apple to Venus , I saw Troy burn , and followed Ulysses on his wanderings . 
The prototypes of all that is beautiful sank deep into my soul , and consequently at the time when other boys are coarse and obscene , I displayed an insurmountable aversion to everything base , vulgar , unbeautiful . 
`` To me , the maturing youth , love for women seemed something especially base and unbeautiful , for it showed itself to me first in all its commonness . 
I avoided all contact with the fair sex ; in short , I was supersensual to madness . 
`` When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid , young , attractive , with a figure just budding into womanhood . 
I was sitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the virtues of the ancient Teutons , while she was sweeping my room . 
Suddenly she stopped , bent down over me , in the meantime holding fast to the broom , and a pair of fresh , full , adorable lips touched mine . 
The kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder , but I raised up my Germania , like a shield against the temptress , and indignantly left the room . '' 
Wanda broke out in loud laughter . 
`` It would , indeed , be hard to find another man like you , but continue . '' 
`` There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period , '' I continued my story . 
`` Countess Sobol , a distant aunt of mine , was visiting my parents . 
She was a beautiful majestic woman with an attractive smile . 
I , however , hated her , for she was regarded by the family as a sort of Messalina . 
My behavior toward her was as rude , malicious , and awkward as possible . 
`` One day my parents drove to the capital of the district . 
My aunt determined to take advantage of their absence , and to exercise judgment over me . 
She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined kazabaika , -LSB- Footnote : A woman 's jacket . -RSB- 
followed by the cook , kitchen-maid , and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned . 
Without asking any questions , they seized me and bound me hand and foot , in spite of my violent resistance . 
Then my aunt , with an evil smile , rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch . 
She whipped so hard that the blood flowed , and that , at last , notwithstanding my heroic spirit , I cried and wept and begged for mercy . 
She then had me untied , but I had to get down on my knees and thank her for the punishment and kiss her hand . 
`` Now you understand the supersensual fool ! 
Under the lash of a beautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman . 
In her fur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen , and from then on my aunt became the most desirable woman on God 's earth . 
`` My Cato-like austerity , my shyness before woman , was nothing but an excessive feeling for beauty . 
In my imagination sensuality became a sort of cult . 
I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its holy wealth upon any ordinary person , but I would reserve it for an ideal woman , if possible for the goddess of love herself . 
`` I went to the university at a very early age . 
It was in the capital where my aunt lived . 
My room looked at that time like Doctor Faustus 's . 
Everything in it was in a wild confusion . 
There were huge closets stuffed full of books , which I bought for a song from a Jewish dealer on the Servanica ; -LSB- Footnote : The street of the Jews in Lemberg . -RSB- 
there were globes , atlases , flasks , charts of the heavens , skeletons of animals , skulls , the busts of eminent men . 
It looked as though Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment . 
`` I studied everything in a jumble without system , without selection : chemistry , alchemy , history , astronomy , philosophy , law , anatomy , and literature ; I read Homer , Virgil , Ossian , Schiller , Goethe , Shakespeare , Cervantes , Voltaire , Moliere , the Koran , the Kosmos , Casanova 's Memoirs . 
I grew more confused each day , more fantastical , more supersensual . 
All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my imagination . 
Every so and so often she appeared before me like a vision among my leather-bound books and dead bones , lying on a bed of roses , surrounded by cupids . 
Sometimes she appeared gowned like the Olympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus ; sometimes in braids of a rich brown , blue-eyes , in my aunt 's red velvet kazabaika , trimmed with ermine . 
`` One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my imagination in all her smiling beauty , I went to see Countess Sobol , who received me in a friendly , even cordial manner . 
She gave me a kiss of welcome , which put all my senses in a turmoil . 
She was probably about forty years old , but like most well-preserved women of the world , still very attractive . 
She wore as always her fur-edged jacket . 
This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten . 
But nothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was now discernable . 
`` On the contrary , there was so little of cruelty in her that without any more ado she let me adore her . 
`` Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence , and it pleased her to make me happy . 
As for myself -- I was as happy as a young god . 
What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her on my knees , and to kiss her hands , those with which she had scourged me ! 
What marvellous hands they were , of beautiful form , delicate , rounded , and white , with adorable dimples ! 
I really was in love with her hands only . 
I played with them , let them submerge and emerge in the dark fur , held them against the light , and was unable to satiate my eyes with them . '' 
Wanda involuntarily looked at her hand ; I noticed it , and had to smile . 
`` From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those days you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I received from my aunt ; and about two years later when I paid court to a young actress only in the roles she played . 
Still later I became the admirer of a respectable woman . 
She acted the part of irreproachable virtue , only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew . 
You see , it is because I was betrayed , sold , by a woman who feigned the strictest principles and the highest ideals , that I hate that sort of poetical , sentimental virtue so intensely . 
Give me rather a woman who is honest enough to say to me : I am a Pompadour , a Lucretia Borgia , and I am ready to adore her . '' 
Wanda rose and opened the window . 
`` You have a curious way of arousing one 's imagination , stimulating all one 's nerves , and making one 's pulses beat faster . 
You put an aureole on vice , provided only if it is honest . 
Your ideal is a daring courtesan of genius . 
Oh , you are the kind of man who will corrupt a woman to her very last fiber . '' 
In the middle of the night there was a knock at my window ; I got up , opened it , and was startled . 
Without stood `` Venus in Furs , '' just as she had appeared to me the first time . 
`` You have disturbed me with your stories ; I have been tossing about in bed , and ca n't go to sleep , '' she said . 
`` Now come and stay with me . '' 
`` In a moment . '' 
As I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had kindled a small fire . 
`` Autumn is coming , '' she began , `` the nights are really quite cold already . 
I am afraid you may not like it , but I ca n't put off my furs until the room is sufficiently warm . '' 
`` Not like it -- you are joking -- you know -- '' I threw my arm around her , and kissed her . 
`` Of course , I know , but why this great fondness for furs ? '' 
`` I was born with it , '' I replied . 
`` I already had it as a child . 
Furthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized natures . 
This is due both to general and natural laws . 
It is a physical stimulus which sets you tingling , and no one can wholly escape it . 
Science has recently shown a certain relationship between electricity and warmth ; at any rate , their effects upon the human organism are related . 
The torrid zone produces more passionate characters , a heated atmosphere stimulation . 
Likewise with electricity . 
This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises such a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect . 
This is why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom , these adorable , scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite animal of a Mahommed , Cardinal Richelieu , Crebillon , Rousseau , Wieland . '' 
`` A woman wearing furs , then , '' cried Wanda , `` is nothing else than a large cat , an augmented electric battery ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' I replied . 
`` That is my explanation of the symbolic meaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty . 
Monarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in this sense for their costume , exclusively ; great painters used it only for queenly beauty . 
The most beautiful frame , which Raphael could find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the roseate body of his beloved , was dark furs . '' 
`` Thanks for the learned discourse on love , '' said Wanda , `` but you have n't told me everything . 
You associate something entirely individual with furs . '' 
`` Certainly , '' I cried . 
`` I have repeatedly told you that suffering has a peculiar attraction for me . 
Nothing can intensify my passion more than tyranny , cruelty , and especially the faithlessness of a beautiful woman . 
And I can not imagine this woman , this strange ideal derived from an aesthetics of ugliness , this soul of Nero in the body of a Phryne , except in furs . '' 
`` I understand , '' Wanda interrupted . 
`` It gives a dominant and imposing quality to a woman . '' 
`` Not only that , '' I continued . 
`` You know I am supersensual . 
With me everything has its roots in the imagination , and thence it receives its nourishment . 
I was already pre-maturely developed and highly sensitive , when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs fell into my hands . 
I remember reading with a kind of horror , which really was rapture , of how they pined in prisons , were laid on the gridiron , pierced with arrows , boiled in pitch , thrown to wild animals , nailed to the cross , and suffered the most horrible torment with a kind of joy . 
To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on seemed to me exquisite delight , especially when it was inflicted by a beautiful woman , for ever since I can remember all poetry and everything demonic was for me concentrated in woman . 
I literally carried the idea into a sort of cult . 
`` I felt there was something sacred in sex ; in fact , it was the only sacred thing . 
In woman and her beauty I saw something divine , because the most important function of existence -- the continuation of the species -- is her vocation . 
To me woman represented a personification of nature , Isis , and man was her priest , her slave . 
In contrast to him she was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served her purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it . 
To him her cruelties , even death itself , still were sensual raptures . 
`` I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the bridal night , and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress had sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game . 
I envied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily ensnared in a forest near Prague , and carried to her castle Divin , where , after having amused herself a while with him , she had him broken on the wheel -- '' `` Disgusting , '' cried Wanda . 
`` I almost wish you might fall into the hands of a woman of their savage race . 
In the wolf 's skin , under the teeth of the dogs , or upon the wheel , you would lose the taste for your kind of poetry . '' 
`` Do you think so ? 
I hardly do . '' 
`` Have you actually lost your senses . '' 
`` Possibly . 
But let me go on . 
I developed a perfect passion for reading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described . 
I loved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented them . 
All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne ; the inquisitors who had the heretics tortured , roasted , and butchered ; all the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful , beautiful , and violent women like Libussa , Lucretia Borgia , Agnes of Hungary , Queen Margot , Isabeau , the Sultana Roxolane , the Russian Czarinas of last century -- all these I saw in furs or in robes bordered with ermine . '' 
`` And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you , '' said Wanda , and simultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak coquettishly about her , so that the dark shining sable played beautifully around her bust and arms . 
`` Well , how do you feel now , half broken on the wheel ? '' 
Her piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking satisfaction . 
Overcome by desire , I flung myself down before her , and threw my arms about her . 
`` Yes -- you have awakened my dearest dream , '' I cried . 
`` It has slept long enough . '' 
`` And this is ? '' 
She put her hand on my neck . 
I was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this warm little hand and of her regard , which , tenderly searching , fell upon me through her half-closed lids . 
`` To be the slave of a woman , a beautiful woman , whom I love , whom I worship . '' 
`` And who on that account maltreats you , '' interrupted Wanda , laughing . 
`` Yes , who fetters me and whips me , treads me underfoot , the while she gives herself to another . '' 
`` And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of you to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must meet him face to face , who will turn you over to his absolute mercy . 
Why not ? 
This final tableau does n't please you so well ? '' 
I looked at Wanda frightened . 
`` You surpass my dreams . '' 
`` Yes , we women are inventive , '' she said , `` take heed , when you find your ideal , it might easily happen , that she will treat you more cruelly than you anticipate . '' 
`` I am afraid that I have already found my ideal ! '' 
I exclaimed , burying my burning face in her lap . 
`` Not I ? '' 
exclaimed Wanda , throwing off her furs and moving about the room laughing . 
She was still laughing as I went downstairs , and when I stood musing in the yard , I still heard her peals of laughter above . 
`` Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal ? '' 
Wanda asked archly , when we met in the park to-day . 
At first I could find no answer . 
The most antagonistic emotions were battling within me . 
In the meantime she sat down on one of the stone-benches , and played with a flower . 
`` Well -- am I ? '' 
I kneeled down and seized her hands . 
`` Once more I beg you to become my wife , my true and loyal wife ; if you ca n't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal , absolutely , without reservation , without softness . '' 
`` You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand , if you prove to be the man I am seeking , '' Wanda replied very seriously , `` but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you realized your imaginings . 
Well , which do you prefer ? '' 
`` I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in your personality . '' 
`` You are mistaken . ''
