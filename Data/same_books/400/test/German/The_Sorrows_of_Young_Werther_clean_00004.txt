Oh , the very thought of folding that dearest of Heaven 's creatures in my arms ! 
Dear Wilhelm , my whole frame feels convulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist ! 
And shall I avow it ? 
Why should I not , Wilhelm ? 
She would have been happier with me than with him . 
Albert is not the man to satisfy the wishes of such a heart . 
He wants a certain sensibility ; he wants -- in short , their hearts do not beat in unison . 
How often , my dear friend , I 'm reading a passage from some interesting book , when my heart and Charlotte 's seemed to meet , and in a hundred other instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story of some fictitious character , have I felt that we were made for each other ! 
But , dear Wilhelm , he loves her with his whole soul ; and what does not such a love deserve ? 
I have been interrupted by an insufferable visit . 
I have dried my tears , and composed my thoughts . 
Adieu , my best friend ! 
I am not alone unfortunate . 
All men are disappointed in their hopes , and deceived in their expectations . 
I have paid a visit to my good old woman under the lime-trees . 
The eldest boy ran out to meet me : his exclamation of joy brought out his mother , but she had a very melancholy look . 
Her first word was , `` Alas ! 
dear sir , my little John is dead . '' 
He was the youngest of her children . 
I was silent . 
`` And my husband has returned from Switzerland without any money ; and , if some kind people had not assisted him , he must have begged his way home . 
He was taken ill with fever on his journey . '' 
I could answer nothing , but made the little one a present . 
She invited me to take some fruit : I complied , and left the place with a sorrowful heart . 
My sensations are constantly changing . 
Sometimes a happy prospect opens before me ; but alas ! 
it is only for a moment ; and then , when I am lost in reverie , I can not help saying to myself , `` If Albert were to die ? 
-- Yes , she would become -- and I should be '' -- and so I pursue a chimera , till it leads me to the edge of a precipice at which I shudder . 
When I pass through the same gate , and walk along the same road which first conducted me to Charlotte , my heart sinks within me at the change that has since taken place . 
All , all , is altered ! 
No sentiment , no pulsation of my heart , is the same . 
My sensations are such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should return to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times , adorned with costly magnificence , and left to a beloved son , but whose glory he should find departed , and its halls deserted and in ruins . 
I sometimes can not understand how she can love another , how she dares love another , when I love nothing in this world so completely , so devotedly , as I love her , when I know only her , and have no other possession . 
It is even so ! 
As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomes autumn with me and around me . 
My leaves are sere and yellow , and the neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage . 
Do you remember my writing to you about a peasant boy shortly after my arrival here ? 
I have just made inquiries about him in Walheim . 
They say he has been dismissed from his service , and is now avoided by every one . 
I met him yesterday on the road , going to a neighbouring village . 
I spoke to him , and he told me his story . 
It interested me exceedingly , as you will easily understand when I repeat it to you . 
But why should I trouble you ? 
Why should I not reserve all my sorrow for myself ? 
Why should I continue to give you occasion to pity and blame me ? 
But no matter : this also is part of my destiny . 
At first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort of subdued melancholy , which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition ; but , as we grew to understand each other , he spoke with less reserve , and openly confessed his faults , and lamented his misfortune . 
I wish , my dear friend , I could give proper expression to his language . 
He told me with a sort of pleasurable recollection , that , after my departure , his passion for his mistress increased daily , until at last he neither knew what he did nor what he said , nor what was to become of him . 
He could neither eat nor drink nor sleep : he felt a sense of suffocation ; he disobeyed all orders , and forgot all commands involuntarily ; he seemed as if pursued by an evil spirit , till one day , knowing that his mistress had gone to an upper chamber , he had followed , or , rather , been drawn after her . 
As she proved deaf to his entreaties , he had recourse to violence . 
He knows not what happened ; but he called God to witness that his intentions to her were honourable , and that he desired nothing more sincerely than that they should marry , and pass their lives together . 
When he had come to this point , he began to hesitate , as if there was something which he had not courage to utter , till at length he acknowledged with some confusion certain little confidences she had encouraged , and liberties she had allowed . 
He broke off two or three times in his narration , and assured me most earnestly that he had no wish to make her bad , as he termed it , for he loved her still as sincerely as ever ; that the tale had never before escaped his lips , and was only now told to convince me that he was not utterly lost and abandoned . 
And here , my dear friend , I must commence the old song which you know I utter eternally . 
If I could only represent the man as he stood , and stands now before me , could I only give his true expressions , you would feel compelled to sympathise in his fate . 
But enough : you , who know my misfortune and my disposition , can easily comprehend the attraction which draws me toward every unfortunate being , but particularly toward him whose story I have recounted . 
On perusing this letter a second time , I find I have omitted the conclusion of my tale ; but it is easily supplied . 
She became reserved toward him , at the instigation of her brother who had long hated him , and desired his expulsion from the house , fearing that his sister 's second marriage might deprive his children of the handsome fortune they expected from her ; as she is childless . 
He was dismissed at length ; and the whole affair occasioned so much scandal , that the mistress dared not take him back , even if she had wished it . 
She has since hired another servant , with whom , they say , her brother is equally displeased , and whom she is likely to marry ; but my informant assures me that he himself is determined not to survive such a catastrophe . 
This story is neither exaggerated nor embellished : indeed , I have weakened and impaired it in the narration , by the necessity of using the more refined expressions of society . 
This love , then , this constancy , this passion , is no poetical fiction . 
It is actual , and dwells in its greatest purity amongst that class of mankind whom we term rude , uneducated . 
We are the educated , not the perverted . 
But read this story with attention , I implore you . 
I am tranquil to-day , for I have been employed upon this narration : you see by my writing that I am not so agitated as usual . 
I read and re-read this tale , Wilhelm : it is the history of your friend ! 
My fortune has been and will be similar ; and I am neither half so brave nor half so determined as the poor wretch with whom I hesitate to compare myself . 
Charlotte had written a letter to her husband in the country , where he was detained by business . 
It commenced , `` My dearest love , return as soon as possible : I await you with a thousand raptures . '' 
A friend who arrived , brought word , that , for certain reasons , he could not return immediately . 
Charlotte 's letter was not forwarded , and the same evening it fell into my hands . 
I read it , and smiled . 
She asked the reason . 
`` What a heavenly treasure is imagination : '' I exclaimed ; `` I fancied for a moment that this was written to me . '' 
She paused , and seemed displeased . 
I was silent . 
It cost me much to part with the blue coat which I wore the first time I danced with Charlotte . 
But I could not possibly wear it any longer . 
But I have ordered a new one , precisely similar , even to the collar and sleeves , as well as a new waistcoat and pantaloons . 
But it does not produce the same effect upon me . 
I know not how it is , but I hope in time I shall like it better . 
She has been absent for some days . 
She went to meet Albert . 
To-day I visited her : she rose to receive me , and I kissed her hand most tenderly . 
A canary at the moment flew from a mirror , and settled upon her shoulder . 
`` Here is a new friend , '' she observed , while she made him perch upon her hand : `` he is a present for the children . 
What a dear he is ! 
Look at him ! 
When I feed him , he flutters with his wings , and pecks so nicely . 
He kisses me , too , only look ! '' 
She held the bird to her mouth ; and he pressed her sweet lips with so much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss which he enjoyed . 
`` He shall kiss you too , '' she added ; and then she held the bird toward me . 
His little beak moved from her mouth to mine , and the delightful sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetest bliss . 
`` A kiss , '' I observed , `` does not seem to satisfy him : he wishes for food , and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments . '' 
`` But he eats out of my mouth , '' she continued , and extended her lips to him containing seed ; and she smiled with all the charm of a being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love . 
I turned my face away . 
She should not act thus . 
She ought not to excite my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence and happiness , nor awaken my heart from its slumbers , in which it dreams of the worthlessness of life ! 
And why not ? 
Because she knows how much I love her . 
It makes me wretched , Wilhelm , to think that there should be men incapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real value in life . 
You remember the walnut trees at S -- , under which I used to sit with Charlotte , during my visits to the worthy old vicar . 
Those glorious trees , the very sight of which has so often filled my heart with joy , how they adorned and refreshed the parsonage yard , with their wide-extended branches ! 
and how pleasing was our remembrance of the good old pastor , by whose hands they were planted so many years ago : The schoolmaster has frequently mentioned his name . 
He had it from his grandfather . 
He must have been a most excellent man ; and , under the shade of those old trees , his memory was ever venerated by me . 
The schoolmaster informed us yesterday , with tears in his eyes , that those trees had been felled . 
Yes , cut to the ground ! 
I could , in my wrath , have slain the monster who struck the first stroke . 
And I must endure this ! 
-- I , who , if I had had two such trees in my own court , and one had died from old age , should have wept with real affliction . 
But there is some comfort left , such a thing is sentiment , the whole village murmurs at the misfortune ; and I hope the vicar 's wife will soon find , by the cessation of the villagers ' presents , how much she has wounded the feelings of the neighborhhood . 
It was she who did it , the wife of the present incumbent -LRB- our good old man is dead -RRB- , a tall , sickly creature who is so far right to disregard the world , as the world totally disregards her . 
The silly being affects to be learned , pretends to examine the canonical books , lends her aid toward the new-fashioned reformation of Christendom , moral and critical , and shrugs up her shoulders at the mention of Lavater 's enthusiasm . 
Her health is destroyed , on account of which she is prevented from having any enjoyment here below . 
Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut trees ! 
I can never pardon it . 
Hear her reasons . 
The falling leaves made the court wet and dirty ; the branches obstructed the light ; boys threw stones at the nuts when they were ripe , and the noise affected her nerves ; and disturbed her profound meditations , when she was weighing the difficulties of Kennicot , Semler , and Michaelis . 
Finding that all the parish , particularly the old people , were displeased , I asked `` why they allowed it ? '' 
`` Ah , sir ! '' 
they replied , `` when the steward orders , what can we poor peasants do ? '' 
But one thing has happened well . 
The steward and the vicar -LRB- who , for once , thought to reap some advantage from the caprices of his wife -RRB- intended to divide the trees between them . 
The revenue-office , being informed of it , revived an old claim to the ground where the trees had stood , and sold them to the best bidder . 
There they still lie on the ground . 
If I were the sovereign , I should know how to deal with them all , vicar , steward , and revenue-office . 
Sovereign , did I say ? 
I should , in that case , care little about the trees that grew in the country . 
Only to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness ! 
And what grieves me , is , that Albert does not seem so happy as he -- hoped to be -- as I should have been -- if -- I am no friend to these pauses , but here I can not express it otherwise ; and probably I am explicit enough . 
Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart . 
To what a world does the illustrious bard carry me ! 
To wander over pathless wilds , surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds , where , by the feeble light of the moon , we see the spirits of our ancestors ; to hear from the mountain-tops , mid the roar of torrents , their plaintive sounds issuing from deep caverns , and the sorrowful lamentations of a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warrior by whom she was adored . 
I meet this bard with silver hair ; he wanders in the valley ; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers , and , alas ! 
he finds only their tombs . 
Then , contemplating the pale moon , as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea , the memory of bygone days strikes the mind of the hero , days when approaching danger invigorated the brave , and the moon shone upon his bark laden with spoils , and returning in triumph . 
When I read in his countenance deep sorrow , when I see his dying glory sink exhausted into the grave , as he inhales new and heart-thrilling delight from his approaching union with his beloved , and he casts a look on the cold earth and the tall grass which is so soon to cover him , and then exclaims , `` The traveller will come , -- he will come who has seen my beauty , and he will ask , ` Where is the bard , where is the illustrious son of Fingal ? ' 
He will walk over my tomb , and will seek me in vain ! '' 
Then , O my friend , I could instantly , like a true and noble knight , draw my sword , and deliver my prince from the long and painful languor of a living death , and dismiss my own soul to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free ! 
Alas ! 
the void the fearful void , which I feel in my bosom ! 
Sometimes I think , if I could only once but once , press her to my heart , this dreadful void would be filled . 
Yes , I feel certain , Wilhelm , and every day I become more certain , that the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence . 
A friend of Charlotte 's called to see her just now . 
I withdrew into a neighbouring apartment , and took up a book ; but , finding I could not read , I sat down to write . 
I heard them converse in an undertone : they spoke upon indifferent topics , and retailed the news of the town . 
One was going to be married ; another was ill , very ill , she had a dry cough , her face was growing thinner daily , and she had occasional fits . 
`` N -- is very unwell too , '' said Charlotte . 
`` His limbs begin to swell already , '' answered the other ; and my lively imagination carried me at once to the beds of the infirm . 
There I see them struggling against death , with all the agonies of pain and horror ; and these women , Wilhelm , talk of all this with as much indifference as one would mention the death of a stranger . 
And when I look around the apartment where I now am -- when I see Charlotte 's apparel lying before me , and Albert 's writings , and all those articles of furniture which are so familiar to me , even to the very inkstand which I am using , -- when I think what I am to this family -- everything . 
My friends esteem me ; I often contribute to their happiness , and my heart seems as if it could not beat without them ; and yet -- if I were to die , if I were to be summoned from the midst of this circle , would they feel -- or how long would they feel the void which my loss would make in their existence ? 
How long ! 
Yes , such is the frailty of man , that even there , where he has the greatest consciousness of his own being , where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression , even in the memory , in the heart , of his beloved , there also he must perish , -- vanish , -- and that quickly . 
I could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little we are capable of influencing the feelings of each other . 
No one can communicate to me those sensations of love , joy , rapture , and delight which I do not naturally possess ; and , though my heart may glow with the most lively affection , I can not make the happiness of one in whom the same warmth is not inherent . 
I possess so much , but my love for her absorbs it all . 
I possess so much , but without her I have nothing . 
One hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her . 
Heavens ! 
what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passing and repassing before us , and yet not dare to lay hold of it ! 
And laying hold is the most natural of human instincts . 
Do not children touch everything they see ? 
And I ! 
Witness , Heaven , how often I lie down in my bed with a wish , and even a hope , that I may never awaken again . 
And in the morning , when I open my eyes , I behold the sun once more , and am wretched . 
If I were whimsical , I might blame the weather , or an acquaintance , or some personal disappointment , for my discontented mind ; and then this insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely upon myself . 
But , alas ! 
I feel it too sadly . 
I am alone the cause of my own woe , am I not ? 
Truly , my own bosom contains the source of all my sorrow , as it previously contained the source of all my pleasure . 
Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess of happiness , who , at every step , saw paradise open before him , and whose heart was ever expanded toward the whole world ? 
And this heart is now dead , no sentiment can revive it ; my eyes are dry ; and my senses , no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears , wither and consume my brain . 
I suffer much , for I have lost the only charm of life : that active , sacred power which created worlds around me , -- it is no more . 
When I look from my window at the distant hills , and behold the morning sun breaking through the mists , and illuminating the country around , which is still wrapped in silence , whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows , which have shed their leaves ; when glorious nature displays all her beauties before me , and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to extract one tear of joy from my withered heart , I feel that in such a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven , hardened , insensible , and unmoved . 
Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to the earth , and implore God for the blessing of tears , as the desponding labourer in some scorching climate prays for the dews of heaven to moisten his parched corn . 
But I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to our importunate entreaties . 
And oh , those bygone days , whose memory now torments me ! 
why were they so fortunate ? 
Because I then waited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal , and received his gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart . 
Charlotte has reproved me for my excesses , with so much tenderness and goodness ! 
I have lately been in the habit of drinking more wine than heretofore . 
`` Do n't do it , '' she said . 
`` Think of Charlotte ! '' 
`` Think of you ! '' 
I answered ; `` need you bid me do so ? 
Think of you -- I do not think of you : you are ever before my soul ! 
This very morning I sat on the spot where , a few days ago , you descended from the carriage , and -- '' She immediately changed the subject to prevent me from pursuing it farther . 
My dear friend , my energies are all prostrated : she can do with me what she pleases . 
I thank you , Wilhelm , for your cordial sympathy , for your excellent advice ; and I implore you to be quiet . 
Leave me to my sufferings . 
In spite of my wretchedness , I have still strength enough for endurance . 
I revere religion -- you know I do . 
I feel that it can impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted , but does it affect all men equally ? 
Consider this vast universe : you will see thousands for whom it has never existed , thousands for whom it will never exist , whether it be preached to them , or not ; and must it , then , necessarily exist for me ? 
Does not the Son of God himself say that they are his whom the Father has given to him ? 
Have I been given to him ? 
What if the Father will retain me for himself , as my heart sometimes suggests ? 
I pray you , do not misinterpret this . 
Do not extract derision from my harmless words . 
I pour out my whole soul before you . 
Silence were otherwise preferable to me , but I need not shrink from a subject of which few know more than I do myself . 
What is the destiny of man , but to fill up the measure of his sufferings , and to drink his allotted cup of bitterness ? 
And if that same cup proved bitter to the God of heaven , under a human form , why should I affect a foolish pride , and call it sweet ? 
Why should I be ashamed of shrinking at that fearful moment , when my whole being will tremble between existence and annihilation , when a remembrance of the past , like a flash of lightning , will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity , when everything shall dissolve around me , and the whole world vanish away ? 
Is not this the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all resource , self-deficient , about to plunge into inevitable destruction , and groaning deeply at its inadequate strength , `` My God ! 
my God ! 
why hast thou forsaken me ? '' 
And should I feel ashamed to utter the same expression ? 
Should I not shudder at a prospect which had its fears , even for him who folds up the heavens like a garment ? 
She does not feel , she does not know , that she is preparing a poison which will destroy us both ; and I drink deeply of the draught which is to prove my destruction . 
What mean those looks of kindness with which she often -- often ? 
no , not often , but sometimes , regards me , that complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentiments which frequently escape me , and the tender pity for my sufferings which appears in her countenance ? 
Yesterday , when I took leave she seized me by the hand , and said , `` Adieu , dear Werther . '' 
Dear Werther ! 
It was the first time she ever called me dear : the sound sunk deep into my heart . 
I have repeated it a hundred times ; and last night , on going to bed , and talking to myself of various things , I suddenly said , `` Good night , dear Werther ! '' 
and then could not but laugh at myself . 
I can not pray , `` Leave her to me ! '' 
and yet she often seems to belong to me . 
I can not pray , `` Give her to me ! '' 
for she is another 's . 
In this way I affect mirth over my troubles ; and , if I had time , I could compose a whole litany of antitheses . 
She is sensible of my sufferings . 
This morning her look pierced my very soul . 
I found her alone , and she was silent : she steadfastly surveyed me . 
I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty or the fire of genius : these had disappeared . 
But I was affected by an expression much more touching , a look of the deepest sympathy and of the softest pity . 
Why was I afraid to throw myself at her feet ? 
Why did I not dare to take her in my arms , and answer her by a thousand kisses ? 
She had recourse to her piano for relief , and in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music with delicious sounds . 
Her lips never appeared so lovely : they seemed but just to open , that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued from the instrument , and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely mouth . 
Oh ! 
who can express my sensations ? 
I was quite overcome , and , bending down , pronounced this vow : `` Beautiful lips , which the angels guard , never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss . '' 
And yet , my friend , oh , I wish -- but my heart is darkened by doubt and indecision -- could I but taste felicity , and then die to expiate the sin ! 
What sin ? 
Oftentimes I say to myself , `` Thou alone art wretched : all other mortals are happy , none are distressed like thee ! '' 
Then I read a passage in an ancient poet , and I seem to understand my own heart . 
I have so much to endure ! 
Have men before me ever been so wretched ? 
I shall never be myself again ! 
Wherever I go , some fatality occurs to distract me . 
Even to-day alas -- for our destiny ! 
alas for human nature ! 
About dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side , for I had no appetite . 
Everything around seemed gloomy : a cold and damp easterly wind blew from the mountains , and black , heavy clouds spread over the plain . 
I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat : he was wandering among the rocks , and seemed to be looking for plants . 
When I approached , he turned round at the noise ; and I saw that he had an interesting countenance in which a settled melancholy , strongly marked by benevolence , formed the principal feature . 
His long black hair was divided , and flowed over his shoulders . 
As his garb betokened a person of the lower order , I thought he would not take it ill if I inquired about his business ; and I therefore asked what he was seeking . 
He replied , with a deep sigh , that he was looking for flowers , and could find none . 
`` But it is not the season , '' I observed , with a smile . 
`` Oh , there are so many flowers ! '' 
he answered , as he came nearer to me . 
`` In my garden there are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts : one sort was given to me by my father ! 
they grow as plentifully as weeds ; I have been looking for them these two days , and can not find them . 
There are flowers out there , yellow , blue , and red ; and that centaury has a very pretty blossom : but I can find none of them . '' 
I observed his peculiarity , and therefore asked him , with an air of indifference , what he intended to do with his flowers . 
A strange smile overspread his countenance . 
Holding his finger to his mouth , he expressed a hope that I would not betray him ; and he then informed me that he had promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress . 
`` That is right , '' said I. `` Oh ! '' 
he replied , `` she possesses many other things as well : she is very rich . '' 
`` And yet , '' I continued , `` she likes your nosegays . '' 
`` Oh , she has jewels and crowns ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
I asked who she was . 
`` If the states-general would but pay me , '' he added , `` I should be quite another man . 
Alas ! 
there was a time when I was so happy ; but that is past , and I am now -- '' He raised his swimming eyes to heaven . 
`` And you were happy once ? '' 
I observed . 
`` Ah , would I were so still ! '' 
was his reply . 
`` I was then as gay and contented as a man can be . '' 
An old woman , who was coming toward us , now called out , `` Henry , Henry ! 
where are you ? 
We have been looking for you everywhere : come to dinner . '' 
`` Is he your son ? '' 
I inquired , as I went toward her . 
`` Yes , '' she said : `` he is my poor , unfortunate son . 
The Lord has sent me a heavy affliction . '' 
I asked whether he had been long in this state . 
She answered , `` He has been as calm as he is at present for about six months . 
I thank Heaven that he has so far recovered : he was for one whole year quite raving , and chained down in a madhouse . 
Now he injures no one , but talks of nothing else than kings and queens . 
He used to be a very good , quiet youth , and helped to maintain me ; he wrote a very fine hand ; but all at once he became melancholy , was seized with a violent fever , grew distracted , and is now as you see . 
If I were only to tell you , sir -- '' I interrupted her by asking what period it was in which he boasted of having been so happy . 
`` Poor boy ! '' 
she exclaimed , with a smile of compassion , `` he means the time when he was completely deranged , a time he never ceases to regret , when he was in the madhouse , and unconscious of everything . '' 
I was thunderstruck : I placed a piece of money in her hand , and hastened away . 
`` You were happy ! '' 
I exclaimed , as I returned quickly to the town , '' ` as gay and contented as a man can be ! ' '' 
God of heaven ! 
and is this the destiny of man ? 
Is he only happy before he has acquired his reason , or after he has lost it ? 
Unfortunate being ! 
And yet I envy your fate : I envy the delusion to which you are a victim . 
You go forth with joy to gather flowers for your princess , -- in winter , -- and grieve when you can find none , and can not understand why they do not grow . 
But I wander forth without joy , without hope , without design ; and I return as I came . 
You fancy what a man you would be if the states general paid you . 
Happy mortal , who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause ! 
You do not know , you do not feel , that in your own distracted heart and disordered brain dwells the source of that unhappiness which all the potentates on earth can not relieve . 
Let that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertaking a journey to distant , healthful springs , where he often finds only a heavier disease and a more painful death , or who can exult over the despairing mind of a sinner , who , to obtain peace of conscience and an alleviation of misery , makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre . 
Each laborious step which galls his wounded feet in rough and untrodden paths pours a drop of balm into his troubled soul , and the journey of many a weary day brings a nightly relief to his anguished heart . 
Will you dare call this enthusiasm , ye crowd of pompous declaimers ? 
Enthusiasm ! 
O God ! 
thou seest my tears . 
Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery : must we also have brethren to persecute us , to deprive us of our consolation , of our trust in thee , and in thy love and mercy ? 
For our trust in the virtue of the healing root , or in the strength of the vine , what is it else than a belief in thee from whom all that surrounds us derives its healing and restoring powers ? 
Father , whom I know not , -- who wert once wont to fill my soul , but who now hidest thy face from me , -- call me back to thee ; be silent no longer ; thy silence shall not delay a soul which thirsts after thee . 
What man , what father , could be angry with a son for returning to him suddenly , for falling on his neck , and exclaiming , `` I am here again , my father ! 
forgive me if I have anticipated my journey , and returned before the appointed time ! 
The world is everywhere the same , -- a scene of labour and pain , of pleasure and reward ; but what does it all avail ? 
I am happy only where thou art , and in thy presence am I content to suffer or enjoy . '' 
And wouldst thou , heavenly Father , banish such a child from thy presence ? 
Wilhelm , the man about whom I wrote to you -- that man so enviable in his misfortunes -- was secretary to Charlotte 's father ; and an unhappy passion for her which he cherished , concealed , and at length discovered , caused him to be dismissed from his situation . 
This made him mad . 
Think , whilst you peruse this plain narration , what an impression the circumstance has made upon me ! 
But it was related to me by Albert with as much calmness as you will probably peruse it . 
I implore your attention . 
It is all over with me . 
I can support this state no longer . 
To-day I was sitting by Charlotte . 
She was playing upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies , with such intense expression ! 
Her little sister was dressing her doll upon my lap . 
The tears came into my eyes . 
I leaned down , and looked intently at her wedding-ring : my tears fell -- immediately she began to play that favourite , that divine , air which has so often enchanted me . 
I felt comfort from a recollection of the past , of those bygone days when that air was familiar to me ; and then I recalled all the sorrows and the disappointments which I had since endured . 
I paced with hasty strides through the room , my heart became convulsed with painful emotions . 
At length I went up to her , and exclaimed With eagerness , `` For Heaven 's sake , play that air no longer ! '' 
She stopped , and looked steadfastly at me . 
She then said , with a smile which sunk deep into my heart , `` Werther , you are ill : your dearest food is distasteful to you . 
But go , I entreat you , and endeavour to compose yourself . '' 
I tore myself away . 
God , thou seest my torments , and wilt end them ! 
How her image haunts me ! 
Waking or asleep , she fills my entire soul ! 
Soon as I close my eyes , here , in my brain , where all the nerves of vision are concentrated , her dark eyes are imprinted . 
Here -- I do not know how to describe it ; but , if I shut my eyes , hers are immediately before me : dark as an abyss they open upon me , and absorb my senses . 
And what is man -- that boasted demigod ? 
Do not his powers fail when he most requires their use ? 
And whether he soar in joy , or sink in sorrow , is not his career in both inevitably arrested ? 
And , whilst he fondly dreams that he is grasping at infinity , does he not feel compelled to It is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidence of the last remarkable days of our friend ; and we are , therefore , obliged to interrupt the progress of his correspondence , and to supply the deficiency by a connected narration . 
I have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from the mouths of persons well acquainted with his history . 
The story is simple ; and all the accounts agree , except in some unimportant particulars . 
It is true , that , with respect to the characters of the persons spoken of , opinions and judgments vary . 
We have only , then , to relate conscientiously the facts which our diligent labour has enabled us to collect , to give the letters of the deceased , and to pay particular attention to the slightest fragment from his pen , more especially as it is so difficult to discover the real and correct motives of men who are not of the common order . 
Sorrow and discontent had taken deep root in Werther 's soul , and gradually imparted their character to his whole being . 
The harmony of his mind became completely disturbed ; a perpetual excitement and mental irritation , which weakened his natural powers , produced the saddest effects upon him , and rendered him at length the victim of an exhaustion against which he struggled with still more painful efforts than he had displayed , even in contending with his other misfortunes . 
His mental anxiety weakened his various good qualities ; and he was soon converted into a gloomy companion , always unhappy and unjust in his ideas , the more wretched he became . 
This was , at least , the opinion of Albert 's friends . 
They assert , moreover , that the character of Albert himself had undergone no change in the meantime : he was still the same being whom Werther had loved , honoured , and respected from the commencement . 
His love for Charlotte was unbounded : he was proud of her , and desired that she should be recognised by every one as the noblest of created beings . 
Was he , however , to blame for wishing to avert from her every appearance of suspicion ? 
or for his unwillingness to share his rich prize with another , even for a moment , and in the most innocent manner ? 
It is asserted that Albert frequently retired from his wife 's apartment during Werther 's visits ; but this did not arise from hatred or aversion to his friend , but only from a feeling that his presence was oppressive to Werther . 
Charlotte 's father , who was confined to the house by indisposition , was accustomed to send his carriage for her , that she might make excursions in the neighbourhood . 
One day the weather had been unusually severe , and the whole country was covered with snow . 
Werther went for Charlotte the following morning , in order that , if Albert were absent , he might conduct her home . 
The beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubled spirit . 
A heavy weight lay upon his soul , deep melancholy had taken possession of him , and his mind knew no change save from one painful thought to another . 
As he now never enjoyed internal peace , the condition of his fellow creatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress . 
He believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife ; and , whilst he censured himself strongly for this , he began to entertain a secret dislike to Albert . 
His thoughts were occasionally directed to this point . 
`` Yes , '' he would repeat to himself , with ill-concealed dissatisfaction , `` yes , this is , after all , the extent of that confiding , dear , tender , and sympathetic love , that calm and eternal fidelity ! 
What do I behold but satiety and indifference ? 
Does not every frivolous engagement attract him more than his charming and lovely wife ? 
Does he know how to prize his happiness ? 
Can he value her as she deserves ? 
He possesses her , it is true , I know that , as I know much more , and I have become accustomed to the thought that he will drive me mad , or , perhaps , murder me . 
Is his friendship toward me unimpaired ? 
Does he not view my attachment to Charlotte as an infringement upon his rights , and consider my attention to her as a silent rebuke to himself ? 
I know , and indeed feel , that he dislikes me , that he wishes for my absence , that my presence is hateful to him . '' 
He would often pause when on his way to visit Charlotte , stand still , as though in doubt , and seem desirous of returning , but would nevertheless proceed ; and , engaged in such thoughts and soliloquies as we have described , he finally reached the hunting-lodge , with a sort of involuntary consent . 
Upon one occasion he entered the house ; and , inquiring for Charlotte , he observed that the inmates were in a state of unusual confusion . 
The eldest boy informed him that a dreadful misfortune had occurred at Walheim , -- that a peasant had been murdered ! 
But this made little impression upon him . 
Entering the apartment , he found Charlotte engaged reasoning with her father , who , in spite of his infirmity , insisted on going to the scene of the crime , in order to institute an inquiry . 
The criminal was unknown ; the victim had been found dead at his own door that morning . 
Suspicions were excited : the murdered man had been in the service of a widow , and the person who had previously filled the situation had been dismissed from her employment . 
As soon as Werther heard this , he exclaimed with great excitement , `` Is it possible ! 
I must go to the spot -- I can not delay a moment ! '' 
He hastened to Walheim . 
Every incident returned vividly to his remembrance ; and he entertained not the slightest doubt that that man was the murderer to whom he had so often spoken , and for whom he entertained so much regard . 
His way took him past the well-known lime trees , to the house where the body had been carried ; and his feelings were greatly excited at the sight of the fondly recollected spot . 
That threshold where the neighbours ' children had so often played together was stained with blood ; love and attachment , the noblest feelings of human nature , had been converted into violence and murder . 
The huge trees stood there leafless and covered with hoarfrost ; the beautiful hedgerows which surrounded the old churchyard wall were withered ; and the gravestones , half covered with snow , were visible through the openings . 
As he approached the inn , in front of which the whole village was assembled , screams were suddenly heard . 
A troop of armed peasants was seen approaching , and every one exclaimed that the criminal had been apprehended . 
Werther looked , and was not long in doubt . 
The prisoner was no other than the servant , who had been formerly so attached to the widow , and whom he had met prowling about , with that suppressed anger and ill-concealed despair , which we have before described . 
`` What have you done , unfortunate man ? '' 
inquired Werther , as he advanced toward the prisoner . 
The latter turned his eyes upon him in silence , and then replied with perfect composure ; `` No one will now marry her , and she will marry no one . '' 
The prisoner was taken into the inn , and Werther left the place .
