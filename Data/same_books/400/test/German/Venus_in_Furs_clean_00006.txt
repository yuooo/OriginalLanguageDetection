Your eyes glow so , do you love me ? 
I want you to love me . '' 
She draws forth a short dagger . 
I start with fright when its blade gleams in front of my eyes . 
I actually believe that she is about to kill me . 
She laughs , and cuts the ropes that bind me . 
Every evening after dinner she now has me called . 
I have to read to her , and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and subjects . 
She seems entirely transformed ; it is as if she were ashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty with which she treated me . 
A touching gentleness transfigures her entire being , and when at the good-night she gives me her hand , a superhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes , of the kind which calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the miseries of existence and all the terrors of death . 
I am reading Manon l'Escault to her . 
She feels the association , she does n't say a word , but she smiles from time to time , and finally she shuts up the little book . 
`` Do n't you want to go on reading ? '' 
`` Not to-day . 
We will ourselves act Manon l'Escault to-day . 
I have a rendezvous in the Cascine , and you , my dear Chevalier , will accompany me ; I know , you will do it , wo n't you ? '' 
`` You command it . '' 
`` I do not command it , I beg it of you , '' she says with irresistible charm . 
She then rises , puts her hands on my shoulders , and looks at me . 
`` Your eyes ! '' 
she exclaims . 
`` I love you , Severin , you have no idea how I love you ! '' 
`` Yes , I have ! '' 
I replied bitterly , `` so much so that you have arranged for a rendezvous with some one else . '' 
`` I do this only to allure you the more , '' she replied vivaciously . 
`` I must have admirers , so as not to lose you . 
I do n't ever want to lose you , never , do you hear , for I love only you , you alone . '' 
She clung passionately to my lips . 
`` Oh , if I only could , as I would , give you all of my soul in a kiss -- thus -- but now come . '' 
She slipped into a simple black velvet coat , and put a dark bashlyk -LSB- Footnote : A kind of Russian cap . -RSB- 
on her head . 
Then she rapidly went through the gallery , and entered the carriage . 
`` Gregor will drive , '' she called out to the coachman who withdrew in surprise . 
I ascended the driver 's seat , and angrily whipped up the horses . 
In the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path , Wanda got out . 
It was night , only occasional stars shone through the gray clouds that fled across the sky . 
By the bank of the Arno stood a man in a dark cloak , with a brigand 's hat , and looked at the yellow waves . 
Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery , and tapped him on the shoulder . 
I saw him turn and seize her hand , and then they disappeared behind the green wall . 
An hour full of torments . 
Finally there was a rustling in the bushes to one side , and they returned . 
The man accompanied her to the carriage . 
The light of the lamp fell full and glaringly upon an infinitely young , soft and dreamy face which I had never before seen , and played in his long , blond curls . 
She held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect , then she signaled to me , and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy wall which follows the river like a long green screen . 
The bell at the garden-gate rings . 
It is a familiar face . 
The man from the Cascine . 
`` Whom shall I announce ? '' 
I ask him in French . 
He timidly shakes his head . 
`` Do you , perhaps , understand some German ? '' 
he asks shyly . 
`` Yes . 
Your name , please . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have n't any yet , '' he replies , embarrassed -- `` Tell your mistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like -- but there she is herself . '' 
Wanda had stepped out on the balcony , and nodded toward the stranger . 
`` Gregor , show the gentleman in ! '' 
she called to me . 
I showed the painter the stairs . 
`` Thanks , I 'll find her now , thanks , thanks very much . '' 
He ran up the steps . 
I remained standing below , and looked with deep pity on the poor German . 
Venus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair . 
He will paint her , and go mad . 
It is a sunny winter 's day . 
Something that looks like gold trembles on the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level of the meadow . 
The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious in their abundant buds . 
Wanda is sitting in the loggia ; she is drawing . 
The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded as in adoration , and looks at her . 
No , he rather looks at her face , and is entirely absorbed in it , enraptured . 
But she does not see him , neither does she see me , who with the spade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed , solely that I may see her and feel her nearness , which produces an effect on me like poetry , like music . 
The painter has gone . 
It is a hazardous thing to do , but I risk it . 
I go up to the gallery , quite close , and ask Wanda `` Do you love the painter , mistress ? '' 
She looks at me without getting angry , shakes her head , and finally even smiles . 
`` I feel sorry for him , '' she replies , `` but I do not love him . 
I love no one . 
I used to love you , as ardently , as passionately , as deeply as it was possible for me to love , but now I do n't love even you any more ; my heart is a void , dead , and this makes me sad . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I exclaimed , deeply moved . 
`` Soon , you too will no longer love me , '' she continued , `` tell me when you have reached that point , and I will give back to you your freedom . '' 
`` Then I shall remain your slave , all my life long , for I adore you and shall always adore you , '' I cried , seized by that fanaticism of love which has repeatedly been so fatal to me . 
Wanda looked at me with a curious pleasure . 
`` Consider well what you do , '' she said . 
`` I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic towards you so that I might fulfil your dream . 
Something of my old feeling , a sort of real sympathy for you , still trembles in my breast . 
When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give you your liberty ; whether I shall not then become really cruel , merciless , even brutal toward ; whether I shall not take a diabolical pleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships me idolatrously , the while I remain indifferent or love someone else ; perhaps , I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me . 
Consider this well . '' 
`` I have long since considered all that , '' I replied as in a glow of fever . 
`` I can not exist , can not live without you ; I shall die if you set me at liberty ; let me remain your slave , kill me , but do not drive me away . '' 
`` Very well then , be my slave , '' she replied , `` but do n't forget that I no longer love you , and your love does n't mean any more to me than a dog 's , and dogs are kicked . '' 
To-day I visited the Venus of Medici . 
It was still early , and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was filled with half-lights like a sanctuary ; I stood with folded hands in deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity . 
But I did not stand for long . 
Not a human soul was in the gallery , not even an Englishman , and I fell down on my knees . 
I looked up at the lovely slender body , the budding breasts , the virginal and yet voluptuous face , the fragrant curls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead . 
My mistress 's bell . 
It is noonday . 
She , however , is still abed with her arms intertwined behind her neck . 
`` I want to bathe , '' she says , `` and you will attend me . 
Lock the door ! '' 
I obey . 
`` Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked . '' 
I descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the bath ; my feet gave way beneath me , and I had to support myself against the iron banister . 
After having ascertained that the door leading to the Loggia and the garden was locked , I returned . 
Wanda was now sitting on the bed with loosened hair , wrapped in her green velvet furs . 
When she made a rapid movement , I noticed that the furs were her only covering . 
It made me start terribly , I do n't know why ? 
I was like one condemned to death , who knows he is on the way to the scaffold , and yet begins to tremble when he sees it . 
`` Come , Gregor , take me on your arms . '' 
`` You mean , mistress ? '' 
`` You are to carry me , do n't you understand ? '' 
I lifted her up , so that she rested in my arms , while she twined hers around my neck . 
Slowly , step by step , I went down the stairs with her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her foot sought support against my knee . 
I trembled under the beautiful burden I was carrying , and every moment it seemed as if I had to break down beneath it . 
The bath consisted of a wide , high rotunda , which received a soft quiet light from a red glass cupola above . 
Two palms extended their broad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions . 
From here steps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which occupied the center . 
`` There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs , '' said Wanda , as I let her down on the couch , `` go get it , and also bring the whip . '' 
I flew upstairs and back again , and kneeling put both in my mistress 's hands . 
She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot which I fastened with the green ribbon . 
Then I prepared the bath . 
I did this very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me . 
Again and again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet cushions , and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and there beneath the furs . 
Some magnetic power stronger than my will compelled me to look . 
I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in that which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed ; and the truth of this I recognized even more acutely , when the basin at last was full , and Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture , and stood before me like the goddess in the Tribuna . 
At that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled beauty , as did the divinity of long ago . 
I sank down on my knees before her , and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot . 
My soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier , suddenly was perfectly calm , and I now felt no element of cruelty in Wanda . 
She slowly descended the stairs , and I could watch her with a calmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was intermingled . 
I could see her plunge into and rise out of the crystalline water , and the wavelets which she herself raised played about her like tender lovers . 
Our nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says : a real apple is more beautiful than a painted one , and a living woman is more beautiful than a Venus of stone . 
And when she left the bath , and the silvery drops and the roseate light rippled down her body , I was seized with silent rapture . 
I wrapped the linen sheets about her , drying her glorious body . 
The calm bliss remained with me , even now when one foot upon me as upon a footstool , she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak . 
The lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body . 
Her left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan in the dark fur of the sleeve , while her left hand played carelessly with the whip . 
By chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite , and I cried out , for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in a picture . 
The picture was so marvellously beautiful , so strange , so imaginative , that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that its lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Wanda . 
I pointed to the mirror . 
`` Ah , that is really beautiful , '' she exclaimed , `` too bad one ca n't capture the moment and make it permanent . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Would not any artist , even the most famous , be proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by means of his brush . 
`` The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to the world , '' I continued still watching her enthusiastically , `` is horrible -- all this glorious facial expression , this mysterious eye with its green fires , this demonic hair , this magnificence of body . 
The idea fills me with a horror of death , of annihilation . 
But the hand of an artist shall snatch you from this . 
You shall not like the rest of us disappear absolutely and forever , without leaving a trace of your having been . 
Your picture must live , even when you yourself have long fallen to dust ; your beauty must triumph beyond death ! '' 
Wanda smiled . 
`` Too bad , that present-day Italy has n't a Titian or Raphael , '' she said , `` but , perhaps , love will make amends for genius , who knows ; our little German might do ? '' 
She pondered . 
`` Yes , he shall paint you , and I will see to it that the god of love mixes his colors . '' 
The young painter has established his studio in her villa ; he is completely in her net . 
He has just begun a Madonna , a Madonna with red hair and green eyes ! 
Only the idealism of a German would attempt to use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of virginity . 
The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I am . 
Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass 's ears too soon . 
Now she laughs derisively at us , and how she laughs ! 
I hear her insolent melodious laughter in his studio , under the open window of which I stand , jealously listening . 
`` Are you mad , me -- ah , it is unbelievable , me as the Mother of God ! '' 
she exclaimed and laughed again . 
`` Wait a moment , I will show you another picture of myself , one that I myself have painted , and you shall copy it . '' 
Her head appeared in the window , luminous like a flame under the sunlight . 
`` Gregor ! '' 
I hurried up the stairs , through the gallery , into the studio . 
`` Lead him to the bath , '' Wanda commanded , while she herself hurried away . 
A few moments passed and Wanda arrived ; dressed in nothing but the sable fur , with the whip in her hand ; she descended the stairs and stretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion . 
I lay at her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me ; her right hand played with the whip . 
`` Look at me , '' she said , `` with your deep , fanatical look , that 's it . '' 
The painter had turned terribly pale . 
He devoured the scene with his beautiful dreamy blue eyes ; his lips opened , but he remained dumb . 
`` Well , how do you like the picture ? '' 
`` Yes , that is how I want to paint you , '' said the German , but it was really not a spoken language ; it was the eloquent moaning , the weeping of a sick soul , a soul sick unto death . 
The charcoal outline of the painting is done ; the heads and flesh parts are painted in . 
Her diabolical face is already becoming visible under a few bold strokes , life flashes in her green eyes . 
Wanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her breast . 
`` This picture , like many of those of the Venetian school , is simultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story , '' explained the painter , who again had become pale as death . 
`` And what will you call it ? '' 
she asked , `` but what is the matter with you , are you ill ? '' 
`` I am afraid -- '' he answered with a consuming look fixed on the beautiful woman in furs , `` but let us talk of the picture . '' 
`` Yes , let us talk about the picture . '' 
`` I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus for the sake of some mortal man . 
And always cold in this modern world of ours , she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur and her feet in the lap of her lover . 
I imagine the favorite of a beautiful despot , who whips her slave , when she is tired of kissing him , and the more she treads him underfoot , the more insanely he loves her . 
And so I shall call the picture : Venus in Furs . '' 
The painter paints slowly , but his passion grows more and more rapidly . 
I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide . 
She plays with him and propounds riddles to him which he can not solve , and he feels his blood congealing in the process , but it amuses her . 
During the sitting she nibbles at candies , and rolls the paper-wrappers into little pellets with which she bombards him . 
`` I am glad you are in such good humor , '' said the painter , `` but your face has lost the expression which I need for my picture . '' 
`` The expression which you need for your picture , '' she replied , smiling . 
`` Wait a moment . '' 
She rose , and dealt me a blow with the whip . 
The painter looked at her with stupefaction , and a child-like surprise showed on his face , mingled with disgust and admiration . 
While whipping me , Wanda 's face acquired more and more of the cruel , contemptuous character , which so haunts and intoxicates me . 
`` Is this the expression you need for your picture ? '' 
she exclaimed . 
The painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her eye . 
`` It is the expression -- '' he stammered , `` but I ca n't paint now -- '' `` What ? '' 
said Wanda , scornfully , `` perhaps I can help you ? '' 
`` Yes -- '' cried the German , as if taken with madness , `` whip me too . '' 
`` Oh ! 
With pleasure , '' she replied , shrugging her shoulders , `` but if I am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest . '' 
`` Whip me to death , '' cried the painter . 
`` Will you let me tie you ? '' 
she asked , smiling . 
`` Yes -- '' he moaned -- Wanda left the room for a moment , and returned with ropes . 
`` Well -- are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of Venus in Furs , the beautiful despot , for better or worse ? '' 
she began ironically . 
`` Yes , tie me , '' the painter replied dully . 
Wanda tied his hands on his back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his body , and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window . 
Then she rolled back the fur , seized the whip , and stepped in front of him . 
The scene had a grim attraction for me , which I can not describe . 
I felt my heart beat , when , with a smile , she drew back her arm for the first blow , and the whip hissed through the air . 
He winced slightly under the blow . 
Then she let blow after blow rain upon him , with her mouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips , until he finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous , blue eyes . 
It was indescribable . 
She is sitting for him now , alone . 
He is working on her head . 
She has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain , where I ca n't be seen , but can see everything . 
What does she intend now ? 
Is she afraid of him ? 
She has driven him insane enough to be sure , or is she hatching a new torment for me ? 
My knees tremble . 
They are talking . 
He has lowered his voice so that I can not understand a word , and she replies in the same way . 
What is the meaning of this ? 
Is there an understanding between them ? 
I suffer frightful torments ; my heart seems about to burst . 
He kneels down before her , embraces her , and presses his head against her breast , and she -- in her heartlessness -- laughs -- and now I hear her saying aloud : `` Ah ! 
You need another application of the whip . '' 
`` Woman ! 
Goddess ! 
Are you without a heart -- ca n't you love , '' exclaimed the German , `` do n't you even know , what it means to love , to be consumed with desire and passion , ca n't you even imagine what I suffer ? 
Have you no pity for me ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
she replied proudly and mockingly , `` but I have the whip . '' 
She drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat , and struck him in the face with the handle . 
He rose , and drew back a couple of paces . 
`` Now , are you ready to paint again ? '' 
she asked indifferently . 
He did not reply , but again went to the easel and took up his brush and palette . 
The painting is marvellously successful . 
It is a portrait which as far as the likeness goes could n't be better , and at the same time it seems to have an ideal quality . 
The colors glow , are supernatural ; almost diabolical , I would call them . 
The painter has put all his sufferings , his adoration , and all his execration into the picture . 
Now he is painting me ; we are alone together for several hours every day . 
To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said : `` You love this woman ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I also love her . '' 
His eyes were bathed in tears . 
He remained silent for a while , and continued painting . 
`` We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells , '' he murmured to himself . 
`` She is a demon . '' 
The picture is finished . 
She insisted on paying him for it , munificently , in the manner of queens . 
`` Oh , you have already paid me , '' he said , with a tormented smile , refusing her offer . 
Before he left , he secretly opened his portfolio , and let me look inside . 
I was startled . 
Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror and seemed actually to be alive . 
`` I shall take it along , '' he said , `` it is mine ; she ca n't take it away from me . 
I have earned it with my heart 's blood . '' 
`` I am really rather sorry for the poor painter , '' she said to me to-day , `` it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am . 
Do n't you think so too ? '' 
I did not dare to reply to her . 
`` Oh , I forgot that I am talking with a slave ; I need some fresh air , I want to be diverted , I want to forget . 
`` The carriage , quick ! '' 
Her new dress is extravagant : Russian half-boots of violet-blue velvet trimmed with ermine , and a skirt of the same material , decorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs . 
Above it is an appropriate , close-fitting jacket , also richly trimmed and lined with ermine . 
The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of Catherine the Second , with a small aigrette , held in place by a diamond-agraffe ; her red hair falls loose down her back . 
She ascends on the driver 's seat , and holds the reins herself ; I take my seat behind . 
How she lashes on the horses ! 
The carriage flies along like mad . 
Apparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day , to make conquests , and she succeeds completely . 
She is the lioness of the Cascine . 
People nod to her from carriages ; on the footpath people gather in groups to discuss her . 
She pays no attention to anyone , except now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen with a slight nod . 
Suddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed . 
As soon as he sees Wanda , he stops his horse and makes it walk . 
When he is quite close , he stops entirely and lets her pass . 
And she too sees him -- the lioness , the lion . 
Their eyes meet . 
She madly drives past him , but she can not tear herself free from the magic power of his look , and she turns her head after him . 
My heart stops when I see the half-surprised , half-enraptured look with which she devours him , but he is worthy of it . 
For he is , indeed , a magnificent specimen of man , No , rather , he is a man whose like I have never yet seen among the living . 
He is in the Belvedere , graven in marble , with the same slender , yet steely musculature , with the same face and the same waving curls . 
What makes him particularly beautiful is that he is beardless . 
If his hips were less narrow , one might take him for a woman in disguise . 
The curious expression about the mouth , the lion 's lip which slightly discloses the teeth beneath , lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful face -- Apollo flaying Marsyas . 
He wears high black boots , closely fitting breeches of white leather , short fur coat of black cloth , of the kind worn by Italian cavalry officers , trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops ; on his black locks is a red fez . 
I now understand the masculine Eros , and I marvel at Socrates for having remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this . 
I have never seen my lioness so excited . 
Her cheeks flamed when she left from the carriage at her villa . 
She hurried upstairs , and with an imperious gesture ordered me to follow . 
Walking up and down her room with long strides , she began to talk so rapidly , that I was frightened . 
`` You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was , immediately -- `` Oh , what a man ! 
Did you see him ? 
What do you think of him ? 
Tell me . '' 
`` The man is beautiful , '' I replied dully . 
`` He is so beautiful , '' she paused , supporting herself on the arm of a chair , `` that he has taken my breath away . '' 
`` I can understand the impression he has made on you , '' I replied , my imagination carrying me away in a mad whirl . 
`` I am quite lost in admiration myself , and I can imagine -- '' `` You may imagine , '' she laughed aloud , `` that this man is my lover , and that he will apply the lash to you , and that you will enjoy being punished by him . 
`` But now go , go . '' 
Before evening fell , I had the desired information . 
Wanda was still fully dressed when I returned . 
She reclined on the ottoman , her face buried in her hands , her hair in a wild tangle , like the red mane of a lioness . 
`` What is his name ? '' 
she asked , uncanny calm . 
`` Alexis Papadopolis . '' 
`` A Greek , then , '' I nodded . 
`` He is very young ? '' 
`` Scarcely older than you . 
They say he was educated in Paris , and that he is an atheist . 
He fought against the Turks in Candia , and is said to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred and cruelty , than by his bravery . '' 
`` All in all , then , a man , '' she cried with sparkling eyes . 
`` At present he is living in Florence , '' I continued , `` he is said to be tremendously rich -- '' `` I did n't ask you about that , '' she interrupted quickly and sharply . 
`` The man is dangerous . 
Are n't you afraid of him ? 
I am afraid of him . 
Has he a wife ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` A mistress ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` What theaters does he attend ? '' 
`` To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater , where Virginia Marini and Salvini are acting ; they are the greatest living artists in Italy , perhaps in Europe . 
`` See that you get a box -- and be quick about it ! '' 
she commanded . 
`` But , mistress -- '' `` Do you want a taste of the whip ? '' 
`` You can wait down in the lobby , '' she said when I had placed the opera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted the footstool . 
I am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so as not to fall down with envy and rage -- no , rage is n't the right word ; it was a mortal fear . 
I saw her in her box dressed in blue moire , with a huge ermine cloak about her bare shoulders ; he sat opposite . 
I saw them devour each other with their eyes . 
For both of them the stage , Goldoni 's Pamela , Salvini , Marini , the public , even the entire world , were non-existant to-night . 
And I -- what was I at that moment ? 
-- To-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador 's . 
Does she know , that she will meet him there ? 
At any rate she dressed , as if she did . 
A heavy sea-green silk dress plastically encloses her divine form , leaving the bust and arms bare . 
In her hair , which is done into a single flaming knot , a white water-lily blossoms ; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose strands fall down toward her neck . 
There no longer is any trace of agitation or trembling feverishness in her being . 
She is calm , so calm , that I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her glance . 
Slowly , with a weary , indolent majesty , she ascends the marble staircase , lets her precious wrap slide off , and listlessly enters the hall , where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist . 
For a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze , then I pick up her furs , which without my being aware , had slipped from my hands . 
They are still warm from her shoulders . 
I kiss the spot , and my eyes fill with tears . 
He has arrived . 
In his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable , he is a beautiful , haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men . 
He stands in the ante-room , looking around proudly , and his eyes rest on me for an uncomfortably long time . 
Under his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear . 
I have a presentiment that this man can enchain her , captivate her , subjugate her , and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity ; I am filled with envy , with jealousy . 
I feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains , merely ! 
And what is most humiliating , I want to hate him , but I ca n't . 
Why is that among all the host of servants he has chosen me . 
With an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to him , and I -- I obey his call -- against my own will . 
`` Take my furs , '' he quickly commands . 
My entire body trembles with resentment , but I obey , abjectly like a slave . 
All night long I waited in the ante-room , raving as in a fever . 
Strange images hovered past my inner eye . 
I saw their meeting -- their long exchange of looks . 
I saw her float through the hall in his arms , drunken , lying with half-closed lids against his breast . 
I saw him in the holy of holies of love , lying on the ottoman , not as slave , but as master , and she at his feet . 
On my knees I served them , the tea-tray faltering in my hands , and I saw him reach for the whip . 
But now the servants are talking about him . 
He is a man who is like a woman ; he knows that he is beautiful , and he acts accordingly . 
He changes his clothes four or five times a day , like a vain courtesan . 
In Paris he appeared first in woman 's dress , and the men assailed him with love-letters . 
An Italian singer , famous equally for his art and his passionate intensity , even invaded his home , and lying on his knees before him threatened to commit suicide if he would n't be his . 
`` I am sorry , '' he replied , smiling , `` I should like to do you the favor , but you will have to carry out your threat , for I am a man . '' 
The drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree , but she apparently has no thought of leaving . 
Morning is already peering through the blinds . 
At last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along behind her like green waves . 
She advances step by step , engaged in conversation with him . 
I hardly exist for her any longer ; she does n't even trouble to give me an order . 
`` The cloak for madame , '' he commands . 
He , of course , does n't think of looking after her himself . 
While I put her furs about her , he stands to one side with his arms crossed . 
While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes , she lightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder . 
She asks : `` And what about the lioness ? '' 
`` When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is attacked by another , '' the Greek went on with his narrative , `` the lioness quietly lies down and watches the battle . 
Even if her mate is worsted she does not go to his aid . 
She looks on indifferently as he bleeds to death under his opponent 's claws , and follows the victor , the stronger -- that is the female 's nature . '' 
At this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me . 
It made me shudder , though I did n't know why -- and the red dawn immerses me and her and him in blood . 
She did not go to bed , but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid her hair ; then she ordered me to build a fire , and she sat by the fire-place , and stared into the flames . 
`` Do you need me any longer , mistress ? '' 
I asked , my voice failed me at the last word . 
Wanda shook her head . 
I left the room , passed through the gallery , and sat down on one of the steps , leading from there down into the garden . 
A gentle north wind brought a fresh , damp coolness from the Arno , the green hills extended into the distance in a rosy mist , a golden haze hovered over the city , over the round cupola of the Duomo . 
A few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky . 
I tore open my coat , and pressed my burning forehead against the marble . 
Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere child 's play ; but now things were beginning to be serious , terribly serious . 
I anticipated a catastrophe , I visualized it , I could lay hold of it with my hands , but I lacked the courage to meet it . 
My strength was broken . 
And if I am honest with myself , neither the pains and sufferings that threatened me , not the humiliations that impended , were the thing that frightened me .
