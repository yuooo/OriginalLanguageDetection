The mind of Werther was fearfully excited by this shocking occurrence . 
He ceased , however , to be oppressed by his usual feeling of melancholy , moroseness , and indifference to everything that passed around him . 
He entertained a strong degree of pity for the prisoner , and was seized with an indescribable anxiety to save him from his impending fate . 
He considered him so unfortunate , he deemed his crime so excusable , and thought his own condition so nearly similar , that he felt convinced he could make every one else view the matter in the light in which he saw it himself . 
He now became anxious to undertake his defence , and commenced composing an eloquent speech for the occasion ; and , on his way to the hunting-lodge , he could not refrain from speaking aloud the statement which he resolved to make to the judge . 
Upon his arrival , he found Albert had been before him : and he was a little perplexed by this meeting ; but he soon recovered himself , and expressed his opinion with much warmth to the judge . 
The latter shook , his head doubtingly ; and although Werther urged his case with the utmost zeal , feeling , and determination in defence of his client , yet , as we may easily suppose , the judge was not much influenced by his appeal . 
On the contrary , he interrupted him in his address , reasoned with him seriously , and even administered a rebuke to him for becoming the advocate of a murderer . 
He demonstrated , that , according to this precedent , every law might be violated , and the public security utterly destroyed . 
He added , moreover , that in such a case he could himself do nothing , without incurring the greatest responsibility ; that everything must follow in the usual course , and pursue the ordinary channel . 
Werther , however , did not abandon his enterprise , and even besought the judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner . 
But this proposal was peremptorily rejected . 
Albert , who had taken some part in the discussion , coincided in opinion with the judge . 
At this Werther became enraged , and took his leave in great anger , after the judge had more than once assured him that the prisoner could not be saved . 
The excess of his grief at this assurance may be inferred from a note we have found amongst his papers , and which was doubtless written upon this very occasion . 
`` You can not be saved , unfortunate man ! 
I see clearly that we can not be saved ! '' 
Werther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert had made to the judge in this matter of the prisoner . 
He thought he could detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally ; and although , upon reflection , it could not escape his sound judgment that their view of the matter was correct , he felt the greatest possible reluctance to make such an admission . 
A memorandum of Werther 's upon this point , expressive of his general feelings toward Albert , has been found amongst his papers . 
`` What is the use of my continually repeating that he is a good and estimable man ? 
He is an inward torment to me , and I am incapable of being just toward him . '' 
One fine evening in winter , when the weather seemed inclined to thaw , Charlotte and Albert were returning home together . 
The former looked from time to time about her , as if she missed Werther 's company . 
Albert began to speak of him , and censured him for his prejudices . 
He alluded to his unfortunate attachment , and wished it were possible to discontinue his acquaintance . 
`` I desire it on our own account , '' he added ; `` and I request you will compel him to alter his deportment toward you , and to visit you less frequently . 
The world is censorious , and I know that here and there we are spoken of . '' 
Charlotte made no reply , and Albert seemed to feel her silence . 
At least , from that time he never again spoke of Werther ; and , when she introduced the subject , he allowed the conversation to die away , or else he directed the discourse into another channel . 
The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was the last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished . 
He sank almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom and inactivity , until he was at length brought to perfect distraction by learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against the prisoner , who asserted his complete innocence . 
His mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortune of his past life . 
The mortification he had suffered at the ambassador 's , and his subsequent troubles , were revived in his memory . 
He became utterly inactive . 
Destitute of energy , he was cut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the business of common life ; and he became a victim to his own susceptibility , and to his restless passion for the most amiable and beloved of women , whose peace he destroyed . 
In this unvarying monotony of existence his days were consumed ; and his powers became exhausted without aim or design , until they brought him to a sorrowful end . 
A few letters which he left behind , and which we here subjoin , afford the best proofs of his anxiety of mind and of the depth of his passion , as well as of his doubts and struggles , and of his weariness of life . 
Dear Wilhelm , I am reduced to the condition of those unfortunate wretches who believe they are pursued by an evil spirit . 
Sometimes I am oppressed , not by apprehension or fear , but by an inexpressible internal sensation , which weighs upon my heart , and impedes my breath ! 
Then I wander forth at night , even in this tempestuous season , and feel pleasure in surveying the dreadful scenes around me . 
Yesterday evening I went forth . 
A rapid thaw had suddenly set in : I had been informed that the river had risen , that the brooks had all overflowed their banks , and that the whole vale of Walheim was under water ! 
Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth . 
I beheld a fearful sight . 
The foaming torrents rolled from the mountains in the moonlight , -- fields and meadows , trees and hedges , were confounded together ; and the entire valley was converted into a deep lake , which was agitated by the roaring wind ! 
And when the moon shone forth , and tinged the black clouds with silver , and the impetuous torrent at my feet foamed and resounded with awful and grand impetuosity , I was overcome by a mingled sensation of apprehension and delight . 
With extended arms I looked down into the yawning abyss , and cried , `` Plunge ! ' '' 
For a moment my senses forsook me , in the intense delight of ending my sorrows and my sufferings by a plunge into that gulf ! 
And then I felt as if I were rooted to the earth , and incapable of seeking an end to my woes ! 
But my hour is not yet come : I feel it is not . 
O Wilhelm , how willingly could I abandon my existence to ride the whirlwind , or to embrace the torrent ! 
and then might not rapture perchance be the portion of this liberated soul ? 
I turned my sorrowful eyes toward a favourite spot , where I was accustomed to sit with Charlotte beneath a willow after a fatiguing walk . 
Alas ! 
it was covered with water , and with difficulty I found even the meadow . 
And the fields around the hunting-lodge , thought I. Has our dear bower been destroyed by this unpitying storm ? 
And a beam of past happiness streamed upon me , as the mind of a captive is illumined by dreams of flocks and herds and bygone joys of home ! 
But I am free from blame . 
I have courage to die ! 
Perhaps I have , -- but I still sit here , like a wretched pauper , who collects fagots , and begs her bread from door to door , that she may prolong for a few days a miserable existence which she is unwilling to resign . 
What is the matter with me , dear Wilhelm ? 
I am afraid of myself ! 
Is not my love for her of the purest , most holy , and most brotherly nature ? 
Has my soul ever been sullied by a single sensual desire ? 
but I will make no protestations . 
And now , ye nightly visions , how truly have those mortals understood you , who ascribe your various contradictory effects to some invincible power ! 
This night I tremble at the avowal -- I held her in my arms , locked in a close embrace : I pressed her to my bosom , and covered with countless kisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft protestations of love . 
My sight became confused by the delicious intoxication of her eyes . 
Heavens ! 
is it sinful to revel again in such happiness , to recall once more those rapturous moments with intense delight ? 
Charlotte ! 
Charlotte ! 
I am lost ! 
My senses are bewildered , my recollection is confused , mine eyes are bathed in tears -- I am ill ; and yet I am well -- I wish for nothing -- I have no desires -- it were better I were gone . 
Under the circumstances narrated above , a determination to quit this world had now taken fixed possession of Werther 's soul . 
Since Charlotte 's return , this thought had been the final object of all his hopes and wishes ; but he had resolved that such a step should not be taken with precipitation , but with calmness and tranquillity , and with the most perfect deliberation . 
His troubles and internal struggles may be understood from the following fragment , which was found , without any date , amongst his papers , and appears to have formed the beginning of a letter to Wilhelm . 
`` Her presence , her fate , her sympathy for me , have power still to extract tears from my withered brain . 
`` One lifts up the curtain , and passes to the other side , -- that is all ! 
And why all these doubts and delays ? 
Because we know not what is behind -- because there is no returning -- and because our mind infers that all is darkness and confusion , where we have nothing but uncertainty . '' 
His appearance at length became quite altered by the effect of his melancholy thoughts ; and his resolution was now finally and irrevocably taken , of which the following ambiguous letter , which he addressed to his friend , may appear to afford some proof . 
I am grateful to your love , Wilhelm , for having repeated your advice so seasonably . 
Yes , you are right : it is undoubtedly better that I should depart . 
But I do not entirely approve your scheme of returning at once to your neighbourhood ; at least , I should like to make a little excursion on the way , particularly as we may now expect a continued frost , and consequently good roads . 
I am much pleased with your intention of coming to fetch me ; only delay your journey for a fortnight , and wait for another letter from me . 
One should gather nothing before it is ripe , and a fortnight sooner or later makes a great difference . 
Entreat my mother to pray for her son , and tell her I beg her pardon for all the unhappiness I have occasioned her . 
It has ever been my fate to give pain to those whose happiness I should have promoted . 
Adieu , my dearest friend . 
May every blessing of Heaven attend you ! 
Farewell . 
We find it difficult to express the emotions with which Charlotte 's soul was agitated during the whole of this time , whether in relation to her husband or to her unfortunate friend ; although we are enabled , by our knowledge of her character , to understand their nature . 
It is certain that she had formed a determination , by every means in her power to keep Werther at a distance ; and , if she hesitated in her decision , it was from a sincere feeling of friendly pity , knowing how much it would cost him , indeed , that he would find it almost impossible to comply with her wishes . 
But various causes now urged her to be firm . 
Her husband preserved a strict silence about the whole matter ; and she never made it a subject of conversation , feeling bound to prove to him by her conduct that her sentiments agreed with his . 
The same day , which was the Sunday before Christmas , after Werther had written the last-mentioned letter to his friend , he came in the evening to Charlotte 's house , and found her alone . 
She was busy preparing some little gifts for her brothers and sisters , which were to be distributed to them on Christmas Day . 
He began talking of the delight of the children , and of that age when the sudden appearance of the Christmas-tree , decorated with fruit and sweetmeats , and lighted up with wax candles , causes such transports of joy . 
`` You shall have a gift too , if you behave well , '' said Charlotte , hiding her embarrassment under sweet smile . 
`` And what do you call behaving well ? 
What should I do , what can I do , my dear Charlotte ? '' 
said he . 
`` Thursday night , '' she answered , `` is Christmas Eve . 
The children are all to be here , and my father too : there is a present for each ; do you come likewise , but do not come before that time . '' 
Werther started . 
`` I desire you will not : it must be so , '' she continued . 
`` I ask it of you as a favour , for my own peace and tranquillity . 
We can not go on in this manner any longer . '' 
He turned away his face walked hastily up and down the room , muttering indistinctly , `` We can not go on in this manner any longer ! '' 
Charlotte , seeing the violent agitation into which these words had thrown him , endeavoured to divert his thoughts by different questions , but in vain . 
`` No , Charlotte ! '' 
he exclaimed ; `` I will never see you any more ! '' 
`` And why so ? '' 
she answered . 
`` We may -- we must see each other again ; only let it be with more discretion . 
Oh ! 
why were you born with that excessive , that ungovernable passion for everything that is dear to you ? '' 
Then , taking his hand , she said , `` I entreat of you to be more calm : your talents , your understanding , your genius , will furnish you with a thousand resources . 
Be a man , and conquer an unhappy attachment toward a creature who can do nothing but pity you . '' 
He bit his lips , and looked at her with a gloomy countenance . 
She continued to hold his hand . 
`` Grant me but a moment 's patience , Werther , '' she said . 
`` Do you not see that you are deceiving yourself , that you are seeking your own destruction ? 
Why must you love me , me only , who belong to another ? 
I fear , I much fear , that it is only the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire for me so strong . '' 
He drew back his hand , whilst he surveyed her with a wild and angry look . '' 
'T is well ! '' 
he exclaimed , '' 't is very well ! 
Did not Albert furnish you with this reflection ? 
It is profound , a very profound remark . '' 
`` A reflection that any one might easily make , '' she answered ; `` and is there not a woman in the whole world who is at liberty , and has the power to make you happy ? 
Conquer yourself : look for such a being , and believe me when I say that you will certainly find her . 
I have long felt for you , and for us all : you have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrow a circle . 
Conquer yourself ; make an effort : a short journey will be of service to you . 
Seek and find an object worthy of your love ; then return hither , and let us enjoy together all the happiness of the most perfect friendship . '' 
`` This speech , '' replied Werther with a cold smile , `` this speech should be printed , for the benefit of all teachers . 
My dear Charlotte , allow me but a short time longer , and all will be well . '' 
`` But however , Werther , '' she added , `` do not come again before Christmas . '' 
He was about to make some answer , when Albert came in . 
They saluted each other coldly , and with mutual embarrassment paced up and down the room . 
Werther made some common remarks ; Albert did the same , and their conversation soon dropped . 
Albert asked his wife about some household matters ; and , finding that his commissions were not executed , he used some expressions which , to Werther 's ear , savoured of extreme harshness . 
He wished to go , but had not power to move ; and in this situation he remained till eight o'clock , his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing . 
At length the cloth was laid for supper , and he took up his hat and stick . 
Albert invited him to remain ; but Werther , fancying that he was merely paying a formal compliment , thanked him coldly , and left the house . 
Werther returned home , took the candle from his servant , and retired to his room alone . 
He talked for some time with great earnestness to himself , wept aloud , walked in a state of great excitement through his chamber ; till at length , without undressing , he threw himself on the bed , where he was found by his servant at eleven o'clock , when the latter ventured to enter the room , and take off his boots . 
Werther did not prevent him , but forbade him to come in the morning till he should ring . 
On Monday morning , the 21st of December , he wrote to Charlotte the following letter , which was found , sealed , on his bureau after his death , and was given to her . 
I shall insert it in fragments ; as it appears , from several circumstances , to have been written in that manner . 
`` It is all over , Charlotte : I am resolved to die ! 
I make this declaration deliberately and coolly , without any romantic passion , on this morning of the day when I am to see you for the last time . 
At the moment you read these lines , O best of women , the cold grave will hold the inanimate remains of that restless and unhappy being who , in the last moments of his existence , knew no pleasure so great as that of conversing with you ! 
I have passed a dreadful night or rather , let me say , a propitious one ; for it has given me resolution , it has fixed my purpose . 
I am resolved to die . 
When I tore myself from you yesterday , my senses were in tumult and disorder ; my heart was oppressed , hope and pleasure had fled from me for ever , and a petrifying cold had seized my wretched being . 
I could scarcely reach my room . 
I threw myself on my knees ; and Heaven , for the last time , granted me the consolation of shedding tears . 
A thousand ideas , a thousand schemes , arose within my soul ; till at length one last , fixed , final thought took possession of my heart . 
It was to die . 
I lay down to rest ; and in the morning , in the quiet hour of awakening , the same determination was upon me . 
To die ! 
It is not despair : it is conviction that I have filled up the measure of my sufferings , that I have reached my appointed term , and must sacrifice myself for thee . 
Yes , Charlotte , why should I not avow it ? 
One of us three must die : it shall be Werther . 
O beloved Charlotte ! 
this heart , excited by rage and fury , has often conceived the horrid idea of murdering your husband -- you -- myself ! 
The lot is cast at length . 
And in the bright , quiet evenings of summer , when you sometimes wander toward the mountains , let your thoughts then turn to me : recollect how often you have watched me coming to meet you from the valley ; then bend your eyes upon the churchyard which contains my grave , and , by the light of the setting sun , mark how the evening breeze waves the tall grass which grows above my tomb . 
I was calm when I began this letter , but the recollection of these scenes makes me weep like a child . '' 
About ten in the morning , Werther called his servant , and , whilst he was dressing , told him that in a few days he intended to set out upon a journey , and bade him therefore lay his clothes in order , and prepare them for packing up , call in all his accounts , fetch home the books he had lent , and give two months ' pay to the poor dependants who were accustomed to receive from him a weekly allowance . 
He breakfasted in his room , and then mounted his horse , and went to visit the steward , who , however , was not at home . 
He walked pensively in the garden , and seemed anxious to renew all the ideas that were most painful to him . 
The children did not suffer him to remain alone long . 
They followed him , skipping and dancing before him , and told him , that after to-morrow and tomorrow and one day more , they were to receive their Christmas gift from Charlotte ; and they then recounted all the wonders of which they had formed ideas in their child imaginations . 
`` Tomorrow and tomorrow , '' said he , `` and one day more ! '' 
And he kissed them tenderly . 
He was going ; but the younger boy stopped him , to whisper something in his ear . 
He told him that his elder brothers had written splendid New-Year 's wishes so large ! 
one for papa , and another for Albert and Charlotte , and one for Werther ; and they were to be presented early in the morning , on New Year 's Day . 
This quite overcame him . 
He made each of the children a present , mounted his horse , left his compliments for papa and mamma , and , with tears in his eyes , rode away from the place . 
He returned home about five o'clock , ordered his servant to keep up his fire , desired him to pack his books and linen at the bottom of the trunk , and to place his coats at the top . 
He then appears to have made the following addition to the letter addressed to Charlotte : `` You do not expect me . 
You think I will obey you , and not visit you again till Christmas Eve . 
O Charlotte , today or never ! 
On Christmas Eve you will hold this paper in your hand ; you will tremble , and moisten it with your tears . 
I will -- I must ! 
Oh , how happy I feel to be determined ! '' 
In the meantime , Charlotte was in a pitiable state of mind . 
After her last conversation with Werther , she found how painful to herself it would be to decline his visits , and knew how severely he would suffer from their separation . 
She had , in conversation with Albert , mentioned casually that Werther would not return before Christmas Eve ; and soon afterward Albert went on horseback to see a person in the neighbourhood , with whom he had to transact some business which would detain him all night . 
Charlotte was sitting alone . 
None of her family were near , and she gave herself up to the reflections that silently took possession of her mind . 
She was for ever united to a husband whose love and fidelity she had proved , to whom she was heartily devoted , and who seemed to be a special gift from Heaven to ensure her happiness . 
On the other hand , Werther had become dear to her . 
There was a cordial unanimity of sentiment between them from the very first hour of their acquaintance , and their long association and repeated interviews had made an indelible impression upon her heart . 
She had been accustomed to communicate to him every thought and feeling which interested her , and his absence threatened to open a void in her existence which it might be impossible to fill . 
How heartily she wished that she might change him into her brother , -- that she could induce him to marry one of her own friends , or could reestablish his intimacy with Albert . 
She passed all her intimate friends in review before her mind , but found something objectionable in each , and could decide upon none to whom she would consent to give him . 
Amid all these considerations she felt deeply but indistinctly that her own real but unexpressed wish was to retain him for herself , and her pure and amiable heart felt from this thought a sense of oppression which seemed to forbid a prospect of happiness . 
She was wretched : a dark cloud obscured her mental vision . 
It was now half-past six o'clock , and she heard Werther 's step on the stairs . 
She at once recognised his voice , as he inquired if she were at home . 
Her heart beat audibly -- we could almost say for the first time -- at his arrival . 
It was too late to deny herself ; and , as he entered , she exclaimed , with a sort of ill concealed confusion , `` You have not kept your word ! '' 
`` I promised nothing , '' he answered . 
`` But you should have complied , at least for my sake , '' she continued . 
`` I implore you , for both our sakes . '' 
She scarcely knew what she said or did ; and sent for some friends , who , by their presence , might prevent her being left alone with Werther . 
He put down some books he had brought with him , then made inquiries about some others , until she began to hope that her friends might arrive shortly , entertaining at the same time a desire that they might stay away . 
At one moment she felt anxious that the servant should remain in the adjoining room , then she changed her mind . 
Werther , meanwhile , walked impatiently up and down . 
She went to the piano , and determined not to retire . 
She then collected her thoughts , and sat down quietly at Werther 's side , who had taken his usual place on the sofa . 
`` Have you brought nothing to read ? '' 
she inquired . 
He had nothing . 
`` There in my drawer , '' she continued , `` you will find your own translation of some of the songs of Ossian . 
I have not yet read them , as I have still hoped to hear you recite them ; but , for some time past , I have not been able to accomplish such a wish . '' 
He smiled , and went for the manuscript , which he took with a shudder . 
He sat down ; and , with eyes full of tears , he began to read . 
`` Star of descending night ! 
fair is thy light in the west ! 
thou liftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud ; thy steps are stately on thy hill . 
What dost thou behold in the plain ? 
The stormy winds are laid . 
The murmur of the torrent comes from afar . 
Roaring waves climb the distant rock . 
The flies of evening are on their feeble wings : the hum of their course is on the field . 
What dost thou behold , fair light ? 
But thou dost smile and depart . 
The waves come with joy around thee : they bathe thy lovely hair . 
Farewell , thou silent beam ! 
Let the light of Ossian 's soul arise ! 
`` And it does arise in its strength ! 
I behold my departed friends . 
Their gathering is on Lora , as in the days of other years . 
Fingal comes like a watery column of mist ! 
his heroes are around : and see the bards of song , gray-haired Ullin ! 
stately Ryno ! 
Alpin with the tuneful voice : the soft complaint of Minona ! 
How are ye changed , my friends , since the days of Selma 's feast ! 
when we contended , like gales of spring as they fly along the hill , and bend by turns the feebly whistling grass . 
`` Minona came forth in her beauty , with downcast look and tearful eye . 
Her hair was flying slowly with the blast that rushed unfrequent from the hill . 
The souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice . 
Oft had they seen the grave of Salgar , the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma . 
Colma left alone on the hill with all her voice of song ! 
Salgar promised to come ! 
but the night descended around . 
Hear the voice of Colma , when she sat alone on the hill ! 
`` Colma . 
It is night : I am alone , forlorn on the hill of storms . 
The wind is heard on the mountain . 
The torrent is howling down the rock . 
No hut receives me from the rain : forlorn on the hill of winds ! 
`` Rise moon ! 
from behind thy clouds . 
Stars of the night , arise ! 
Lead me , some light , to the place where my love rests from the chase alone ! 
His bow near him unstrung , his dogs panting around him ! 
But here I must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream . 
The stream and the wind roar aloud . 
I hear not the voice of my love ! 
Why delays my Salgar ; why the chief of the hill his promise ? 
Here is the rock and here the tree ! 
here is the roaring stream ! 
Thou didst promise with night to be here . 
Ah ! 
whither is my Salgar gone ? 
With thee I would fly from my father , with thee from my brother of pride . 
Our race have long been foes : we are not foes , O Salgar ! 
`` Cease a little while , O wind ! 
stream , be thou silent awhile ! 
let my voice be heard around ! 
let my wanderer hear me ! 
Salgar ! 
it is Colma who calls . 
Here is the tree and the rock . 
Salgar , my love , I am here ! 
Why delayest thou thy coming ? 
Lo ! 
the calm moon comes forth . 
The flood is bright in the vale . 
The rocks are gray on the steep . 
I see him not on the brow . 
His dogs come not before him with tidings of his near approach . 
Here I must sit alone ! 
`` Who lie on the heath beside me ? 
Are they my love and my brother ? 
Speak to me , O my friends ! 
To Colma they give no reply . 
Speak to me : I am alone ! 
My soul is tormented with fears . 
Ah , they are dead ! 
Their swords are red from the fight . 
O my brother ! 
my brother ! 
why hast thou slain my Salgar ! 
Why , O Salgar , hast thou slain my brother ! 
Dear were ye both to me ! 
what shall I say in your praise ? 
Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands ! 
he was terrible in fight ! 
Speak to me ! 
hear my voice ! 
hear me , sons of my love ! 
They are silent ! 
silent for ever ! 
Cold , cold , are their breasts of clay ! 
Oh , from the rock on the hill , from the top of the windy steep , speak , ye ghosts of the dead ! 
Speak , I will not be afraid ! 
Whither are ye gone to rest ? 
In what cave of the hill shall I find the departed ? 
No feeble voice is on the gale : no answer half drowned in the storm ! 
`` I sit in my grief : I wait for morning in my tears ! 
Rear the tomb , ye friends of the dead . 
Close it not till Colma come . 
My life flies away like a dream . 
Why should I stay behind ? 
Here shall I rest with my friends , by the stream of the sounding rock . 
When night comes on the hill when the loud winds arise my ghost shall stand in the blast , and mourn the death of my friends . 
The hunter shall hear from his booth ; he shall fear , but love my voice ! 
For sweet shall my voice be for my friends : pleasant were her friends to Colma . 
`` Such was thy song , Minona , softly blushing daughter of Torman . 
Our tears descended for Colma , and our souls were sad ! 
Ullin came with his harp ; he gave the song of Alpin . 
The voice of Alpin was pleasant , the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire ! 
But they had rested in the narrow house : their voice had ceased in Selma ! 
Ullin had returned one day from the chase before the heroes fell . 
He heard their strife on the hill : their song was soft , but sad ! 
They mourned the fall of Morar , first of mortal men ! 
His soul was like the soul of Fingal : his sword like the sword of Oscar . 
But he fell , and his father mourned : his sister 's eyes were full of tears . 
Minona 's eyes were full of tears , the sister of car-borne Morar . 
She retired from the song of Ullin , like the moon in the west , when she foresees the shower , and hides her fair head in a cloud . 
I touched the harp with Ullin : the song of morning rose ! 
`` Ryno . 
The wind and the rain are past , calm is the noon of day . 
The clouds are divided in heaven . 
Over the green hills flies the inconstant sun . 
Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill . 
Sweet are thy murmurs , O stream ! 
but more sweet is the voice I hear . 
It is the voice of Alpin , the son of song , mourning for the dead ! 
Bent is his head of age : red his tearful eye . 
Alpin , thou son of song , why alone on the silent hill ? 
why complainest thou , as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely shore ? 
`` Alpin . 
My tears , O Ryno ! 
are for the dead my voice for those that have passed away . 
Tall thou art on the hill ; fair among the sons of the vale . 
But thou shalt fall like Morar : the mourner shall sit on thy tomb . 
The hills shall know thee no more : thy bow shall lie in thy hall unstrung ! 
`` Thou wert swift , O Morar ! 
as a roe on the desert : terrible as a meteor of fire . 
Thy wrath was as the storm . 
Thy sword in battle as lightning in the field . 
Thy voice was as a stream after rain , like thunder on distant hills . 
Many fell by thy arm : they were consumed in the flames of thy wrath . 
But when thou didst return from war , how peaceful was thy brow . 
Thy face was like the sun after rain : like the moon in the silence of night : calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid . 
`` Narrow is thy dwelling now ! 
dark the place of thine abode ! 
With three steps I compass thy grave , O thou who wast so great before ! 
Four stones , with their heads of moss , are the only memorial of thee . 
A tree with scarce a leaf , long grass which whistles in the wind , mark to the hunter 's eye the grave of the mighty Morar . 
Morar ! 
thou art low indeed . 
Thou hast no mother to mourn thee , no maid with her tears of love . 
Dead is she that brought thee forth . 
Fallen is the daughter of Morglan . 
`` Who on his staff is this ? 
Who is this whose head is white with age , whose eyes are red with tears , who quakes at every step ? 
It is thy father , O Morar ! 
the father of no son but thee . 
He heard of thy fame in war , he heard of foes dispersed . 
He heard of Morar 's renown , why did he not hear of his wound ? 
Weep , thou father of Morar ! 
Weep , but thy son heareth thee not . 
Deep is the sleep of the dead , low their pillow of dust . 
No more shall he hear thy voice , no more awake at thy call . 
When shall it be morn in the grave , to bid the slumberer awake ? 
Farewell , thou bravest of men ! 
thou conqueror in the field ! 
but the field shall see thee no more , nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel . 
Thou has left no son . 
The song shall preserve thy name . 
Future times shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen Morar ! 
`` The grief of all arose , but most the bursting sigh of Armin . 
He remembers the death of his son , who fell in the days of his youth . 
Carmor was near the hero , the chief of the echoing Galmal . 
Why burst the sigh of Armin ? 
he said . 
Is there a cause to mourn ? 
The song comes with its music to melt and please the soul . 
It is like soft mist that , rising from a lake , pours on the silent vale ; the green flowers are filled with dew , but the sun returns in his strength , and the mist is gone .
