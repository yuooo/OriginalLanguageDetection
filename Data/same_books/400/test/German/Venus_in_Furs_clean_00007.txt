I merely felt a fear , the fear of losing her whom I loved with a sort of fanatical devotion ; but it was so overwhelming , so crushing that I suddenly began to sob like a child . 
During the day she remained locked in her room , and had the negress attend her . 
When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky , I saw her pass through the garden , and , carefully following her at a distance , watched her enter the shrine of Venus . 
I stealthily followed and peered through the chink in the door . 
She stood before the divine image of the goddess , her hands folded as in prayer , and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue rays over her . 
On my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such powerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me . 
I lighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath a saint 's image , and entered her bedroom , covering the light with one hand . 
The lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted . 
She had fallen asleep among her pillows , lying on her back , her hands clenched , breathing heavily . 
A dream seemed to oppress her . 
I slowly withdrew my hand , and let the red light fall full on her wonderful face . 
But she did not awaken . 
I gently set the lamp on the floor , sank down beside Wanda 's bed , and rested my head on her soft , glowing arm . 
She moved slightly , but even now did not awaken . 
I do not know how long I lay thus in the middle of the night , turned as into a stone by horrible torments . 
Finally a severe trembling seized me , and I was able to cry . 
My tears flowed over her arm . 
She quivered several times and finally sat up ; she brushed her hand across her eyes , and looked at me . 
`` Severin , '' she exclaimed , more frightened than angry . 
I was unable to reply . 
`` Severin , '' she continued softly , `` what is the matter ? 
Are you ill ? '' 
Her voice sounded so sympathetic , so kind , so full of love , that it clutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud . 
`` Severin , '' she began anew . 
`` My poor unhappy friend . '' 
Her hand gently stroked my hair . 
`` I am sorry , very sorry for you ; but I ca n't help you ; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that would cure you . '' 
`` Oh , Wanda , must it be ? '' 
I moaned in my agony . 
`` What , Severin ? 
What are you talking about ? '' 
`` Do n't you love me any more ? '' 
I continued . 
`` Have n't you even a little bit of pity for me ? 
Has the beautiful stranger taken complete possession of you ? '' 
`` I can not lie , '' she replied softly after a short pause . 
`` He has made an impression on me which I have n't yet been able to analyse , further than that I suffer and tremble beneath it . 
It is an impression of the sort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage , but I always thought it was a figment of the imagination . 
Oh , he is a man like a lion , strong and beautiful and yet gentle , not brutal like the men of our northern world . 
I am sorry for you , Severin , I am ; but I must possess him . 
What am I saying ? 
I must give myself to him , if he will have me . '' 
`` Consider your reputation , Wanda , which so far has remained spotless , '' I exclaimed , `` even if I no longer mean anything to you . '' 
`` I am considering it , '' she replied , `` I intend to be strong , as long as it is possible , I want -- '' she buried her head shyly in the pillows -- `` I want to become his wife -- if he will have me . '' 
`` Wanda , '' I cried , seized again by that mortal fear , which always robs me of my breath , makes me lose possession of myself , `` you want to be his wife , belong to him for always . 
Oh ! 
Do not drive me away ! 
He does not love you -- '' `` Who says that ? '' 
she exclaimed , flaring up . 
`` He does not love you , '' I went on passionately , `` but I love you , I adore you , I am your slave , I let you tread me underfoot , I want to carry you on my arms through life . '' 
`` Who says that he does n't love me ? '' 
she interrupted vehemently . 
`` Oh ! 
be mine , '' I replied , `` be mine ! 
I can not exist , can not live without you . 
Have mercy on me , Wanda , have mercy ! '' 
She looked at me again , and her face had her cold heartless expression , her evil smile . 
`` You say he does n't love me , '' she said , scornfully . 
`` Very well then , get what consolation you can out of it . '' 
With this she turned over on the other side , and contemptuously showed me her back . 
`` Good God , are you a woman without flesh or blood , have n't you a heart as well as I ! '' 
I cried , while my breast heaved convulsively . 
`` You know what I am , '' she replied , coldly . 
`` I am a woman of stone , Venus in Furs , your ideal , kneel down , and pray to me . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I implored , `` mercy ! '' 
She began to laugh . 
I buried my face in her pillows . 
Pain had loosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow . 
For a long time silence reigned , then Wanda slowly raised herself . 
`` You bore me , '' she began . 
`` Wanda ! '' 
`` I am tired , let me go to sleep . '' 
`` Mercy , '' I implored . 
`` Do not drive me away . 
No man , no one , will love you as I do . '' 
`` Let me go to sleep , '' -- she turned her back to me again . 
I leaped up , and snatched the poinard , which hung beside her bed , from its sheath , and placed its point against my breast . 
`` I shall kill myself here before your eyes , '' I murmured dully . 
`` Do what you please , '' Wanda replied with complete indifference . 
`` But let me go to sleep . '' 
She yawned aloud . 
`` I am very sleepy . '' 
For a moment I stood as if petrified . 
Then I began to laugh and cry at the same time . 
Finally I placed the poinard in my belt , and again fell on my knees before her . 
`` Wanda , listen to me , only for a few moments , '' I begged . 
`` I want to go to sleep ! 
Do n't you hear ! '' 
she cried , leaping angrily out of bed and pushing me away with her foot . 
`` You forget that I am your mistress ? '' 
When I did n't budge , she seized the whip and struck me . 
I rose ; she struck me again -- this time right in the face . 
`` Wretch , slave ! '' 
With clenched fist held heavenward , I left her bedroom with a sudden resolve . 
She tossed the whip aside , and broke out into clear laughter . 
I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been very droll . 
I have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman , who has treated me so cruelly , and is now about to break faith and betray me , as a reward for all my slavish devotion , for everything I have suffered from her . 
I packed my few belongings into a bundle , and then wrote her as follows : `` Dear Madam , -- I have loved you even to madness , I have given myself to you as no man ever has given himself to a woman . 
You have abused my most sacred emotions , and played an impudent , frivolous game with me . 
However , as long as you were merely cruel and merciless , it was still possible for me to love you . 
Now you are about to become cheap . 
I am no longer the slave whom you can kick about and whip . 
You yourself have set me free , and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise . 
Severin Kusiemski . '' 
I handed these lines to the negress , and hastened away as fast as I could go . 
I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath . 
Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped . 
I began to weep . 
It is humiliating that I want to flee and I ca n't . 
I turn back -- whither ? 
-- to her , whom I abhor , and yet , at the same time , adore . 
Again I pause . 
I can not go back . 
I dare not . 
But how am I to leave Florence . 
I remember that I have n't any money , not a penny . 
Very well then , on foot ; it is better to be an honest beggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan . 
But still I ca n't leave . 
She has my pledge , my word of honor . 
I have to return . 
Perhaps she will release me . 
After a few rapid strides , I stop again . 
She has my word of honor and my bond , that I shall remain her slave as long as she desires , until she herself gives me my freedom . 
But I might kill myself . 
I go through the Cascine down to the Arno , where its yellow waters plash monotonously about a couple of stray willows . 
There I sit , and cast up my final accounts with existence . 
I let my entire life pass before me in review . 
On the whole , it is rather a wretched affair -- a few joys , an endless number of indifferent and worthless things , and between these an abundant harvest of pains , miseries , fears , disappointments , shipwrecked hopes , afflictions , sorrow and grief . 
I thought of my mother , whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to watch waste away beneath a horrible disease ; of my brother , who full of the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth , without even having put his lips to the cup of life . 
I thought of my dead nurse , my childhood playmates , the friends that had striven and studied with me ; of all those , covered by the cold , dead , indifferent earth . 
I thought of my turtle-dove , who not infrequently made his cooing bows to me , instead of to his mate . 
-- All have returned , dust unto dust . 
I laughed aloud , and slid down into the water , but at the same moment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches , hanging above the yellow waves . 
As in a vision , I see the woman who has caused all my misery . 
She hovers above the level of the water , luminous in the sunlight as though she were transparent , with red flames about her head and neck . 
She turns her face toward me and smiles . 
I am back again , dripping , wet through , glowing with shame and fever . 
The negress has delivered my letter ; I am judged , lost , in the power of a heartless , affronted woman . 
Well , let her kill me . 
I am unable to do it myself , and yet I have no wish to go on living . 
As I walk around the house , she is standing in the gallery , leaning over the railing . 
Her face is full in the light of the sun , and her green eyes sparkle . 
`` Still alive ? '' 
she asked , without moving . 
I stood silent , with bowed head . 
`` Give me back my poinard , '' she continued . 
`` It is of no use to you . 
You have n't even the courage to take your own life . '' 
`` I have lost it , '' I replied , trembling , shaken by chills . 
She looked me over with a proud , scornful glance . 
`` I suppose you lost it in the Arno ? '' 
She shrugged her shoulders . 
`` No matter . 
Well , and why did n't you leave ? '' 
I mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand . 
`` Oh ! 
you have n't any money , '' she cried . 
`` Here ! '' 
With an indescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse . 
I did not pick it up . 
Both of us were silent for some time . 
`` You do n't want to leave then ? '' 
`` I ca n't . '' 
Wanda drives in the Cascine without me , and goes to the theater without me ; she receives company , and the negress serves her . 
No one asks after me . 
I stray about the garden , irresolutely , like an animal that has lost its master . 
Lying among the bushes , I watch a couple of sparrows , fighting over a seed . 
Suddenly I hear the swish of a woman 's dress . 
Wanda approaches in a gown of dark silk , modestly closed up to the neck ; the Greek is with her . 
They are in an eager discussion , but I can not as yet understand a word of what they are saying . 
He stamps his foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions , and he lashes the air with his riding whip . 
Wanda startles . 
Is she afraid that he will strike her ? 
Have they gone that far ? 
He has left her , she calls him ; he does not hear her , does not want to hear her . 
Wanda sadly lowers her head , and then sits down on the nearest stone-bench . 
She sits for a long time , lost in thought . 
I watch her with a sort of malevolent pleasure , finally I pull myself together by sheer force of will , and ironically step before her . 
She startles , and trembles all over . 
`` I come to wish you happiness , '' I said , bowing , `` I see , my dear lady , too , has found a master . '' 
`` Yes , thank God ! '' 
she exclaimed , `` not a new slave , I have had enough of them . 
A master ! 
Woman needs a master , and she adores him . '' 
`` You adore him , Wanda ? '' 
I cried , `` this brutal person -- '' `` Yes , I love him , as I have never loved any one else . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I clenched my fists , but tears already filled my eyes , and I was seized by the delirium of passion , as by a sweet madness . 
`` Very well , take him as your husband , let him be your master , but I want to remain your slave , as long as I live . '' 
`` You want to remain my slave , even then ? '' 
she said , `` that would be interesting , but I am afraid he would n't permit it . '' 
`` He ? '' 
`` Yes , he is already jealous of you , '' she exclaimed , `` he , of you ! 
He demanded that I dismiss you immediately , and when I told him who you were -- '' `` You told him -- '' I repeated , thunderstruck . 
`` I told him everything , '' she replied , `` our whole story , all your queerness , everything -- and he , instead of being amused , grew angry , and stamped his foot . '' 
`` And threatened to strike you ? '' 
Wanda looked to the ground , and remained silent . 
`` Yes , indeed , '' I said with mocking bitterness , `` you are afraid of him , Wanda ! '' 
I threw myself down at her feet , and in my agitation embraced her knees . 
`` I do n't want anything of you , except to be your slave , to be always near you ! 
I will be your dog - '' `` Do you know , you bore me ? '' 
said Wanda , indifferently . 
I leaped up . 
Everything within me was seething . 
`` You are now no longer cruel , but cheap , '' I said , clearly and distinctly , accentuating every word . 
`` You have already written that in your letter , '' Wanda replied , with a proud shrug of the shoulders . 
`` A man of brains should never repeat himself . '' 
`` The way you are treating me , '' I broke out , `` what would you call it ? '' 
`` I might punish you , '' she replied ironically , `` but I prefer this time to reply with reasons instead of lashes . 
You have no right to accuse me . 
Have n't I always been honest with you ? 
Have n't I warned you more than once ? 
Did n't I love you with all my heart , even passionately , and did I conceal the fact from you , that it was dangerous to give yourself into my power , to abase yourself before me , and that I want to be dominated ? 
But you wished to be my plaything , my slave ! 
You found the highest pleasure in feeling the foot , the whip of an arrogant , cruel woman . 
What do you want now ? 
`` Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me , but you were the first to awaken them . 
If I now take pleasure in torturing you , abusing you , it is your fault ; you have made of me what I now am , and now you are even unmanly , weak , and miserable enough to accuse me . '' 
`` Yes , I am guilty , '' I said , `` but have n't I suffered because of it ? 
Let us put an end now to the cruel game . '' 
`` That is my wish , too , '' she replied with a curious deceitful look . 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I exclaimed violently , `` do n't drive me to extremes ; you see that I am a man again . '' 
`` A fire of straw , '' she replied , `` which makes a lot of stir for a moment , and goes out as quickly as it flared up . 
You imagine you can intimidate me , and you only make yourself ridiculous . 
Had you been the man I first thought you were , serious , reserved , stern , I would have loved you faithfully , and become your wife . 
Woman demands that she can look up to a man , but one like you who voluntarily places his neck under her foot , she uses as a welcome plaything , only to toss it aside when she is tired of it . '' 
`` Try to toss me aside , '' I said , jeeringly . 
`` Some toys are dangerous . '' 
`` Do n't challenge me , '' exclaimed Wanda . 
Her eyes began to flash , and a flush entered her cheeks . 
`` If you wo n't be mine now , '' I continued , with a voice stifled with rage , `` no one else shall possess you either . '' 
`` What play is this from ? '' 
she mocked , seizing me by the breast . 
She was pale with anger at this moment . 
`` Do n't challenge me , '' she continued , `` I am not cruel , but I do n't know whether I may not become so and whether then there will be any bounds . '' 
`` What worse can you do , than to make your lover , your husband ? '' 
I exclaimed , more and more enraged . 
`` I might make you his slave , '' she replied quickly , `` are you not in my power ? 
Have n't I the agreement ? 
But , of course , you will merely take pleasure in it , if I have you bound , and say to him . 
`` Do with him what you please . '' 
`` Woman , are you mad ! '' 
I cried . 
`` I am entirely rational , '' she said , calmly . 
`` I warn you for the last time . 
Do n't offer any resistance , one who has gone as far as I have gone might easily go still further . 
I feel a sort of hatred for you , and would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death ; I am still restraining myself , but -- '' Scarcely master of myself any longer , I seized her by the wrist and forced her to the ground , so that she lay on her knees before me . 
`` Severin ! '' 
she cried . 
Rage and terror were painted on her face . 
`` I shall kill you if you marry him , '' I threatened ; the words came hoarsely and dully from my breast . 
`` You are mine , I wo n't let you go , I love you too much . '' 
Then I clutched her and pressed her close to me ; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had in my belt . 
Wanda fixed a large , calm , incomprehensible look on me . 
`` I like you that way , '' she said , carelessly . 
`` Now you are a man , and at this moment I know I still love you . '' 
`` Wanda , '' I wept with rapture , and bent down over her , covering her dear face with kisses , and she , suddenly breaking into a loud gay laugh , said , `` Have you finished with your ideal now , are you satisfied with me ? '' 
`` You mean ? '' 
I stammered , `` that you were n't serious ? '' 
`` I am very serious , '' she gaily continued . 
`` I love you , only you , and you -- you foolish , little man , did n't know that everything was only make-believe and play-acting . 
How hard it often was for me to strike you with the whip , when I would have rather taken your head and covered it with kisses . 
But now we are through with that , are n't we ? 
I have played my cruel role better than you expected , and now you will be satisfied with my being a good , little wife who is n't altogether unattractive . 
Is n't that so ? 
We will live like rational people -- '' `` You will marry me ! '' 
I cried , overflowing with happiness . 
`` Yes -- marry you -- you dear , darling man , '' whispered Wanda , kissing my hands . 
I drew her up to my breast . 
`` Now , you are no longer Gregor , my slave , '' said she , `` but Severin , the dear man I love -- '' `` And he -- you do n't love him ? '' 
I asked in agitation . 
`` How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type ? 
You were blind to everything , I was really afraid for you . '' 
`` I almost killed myself for your sake . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
she cried , `` ah , I still tremble at the thought , that you were already in the Arno . '' 
`` But you saved me , '' I replied , tenderly . 
`` You hovered over the waters and smiled , and your smile called me back to life . '' 
I have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies silently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles . 
I feel like one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium , or like a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that momentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe shore . 
`` I hate this Florence , where you have been so unhappy , '' she declared , as I was saying good-night to her . 
`` I want to leave immediately , tomorrow , you will be good enough to write a couple of letters for me , and , while you are doing that , I will drive to the city to pay my farewell visits . 
Is that satisfactory to you ? '' 
`` Of course , you dear , sweet , beautiful woman . '' 
Early in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept . 
Her tenderness is positively wonderful . 
I should never have believed that she could be so tender . 
She has now been gone for over four hours . 
I have long since finished the letters , and am now sitting in the gallery , looking down the street to see whether I can not discover her carriage in the distance . 
I am a little worried about her , and yet I know there is no reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear . 
However , a feeling of oppression weighs me down , and I can not rid myself of it . 
It is probably the sufferings of the past days , which still cast their shadows into my soul . 
She is back , radiant with happiness and contentment . 
`` Well , has everything gone as you wished ? '' 
I asked tenderly , kissing her hand . 
`` Yes , dear heart , '' she replied , `` and we shall leave to-night . 
Help me pack my trunks . '' 
Toward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her letters myself . 
I took her carriage , and was back within an hour . 
`` Mistress has asked for you , '' said the negress , with a grin , as I ascended the wide marble stairs . 
`` Has anyone been here ? '' 
`` No one , '' she replied , crouching down on the steps like a black cat . 
I slowly passed through the drawing-room , and then stood before her bedroom door . 
Why does my heart beat so ? 
Am I not perfectly happy ? 
Opening the door softly , I draw back the portiere . 
Wanda is lying on the ottoman , and does not seem to notice me . 
How beautiful she looks , in her silver-gray dress , which fits closely , and while displaying in tell-tale fashion her splendid figure , leaves her wonderful bust and arms bare . 
Her hair is interwoven with , and held up by a black velvet ribbon . 
A mighty fire is burning in the fire-place , the hanging lamp casts a reddish glow , and the whole room is as if drowned in blood . 
`` Wanda , '' I said at last . 
`` Oh Severin , '' she cried out joyously . 
`` I have been impatiently waiting for you . '' 
She leaped up , and folded me in her arms . 
She sat down again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her side , but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her lap . 
`` Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day ? '' 
she whispered , brushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes . 
`` How beautiful your eyes are , I have always loved them as the best of you , but to-day they fairly intoxicate me . 
I am all -- '' She extended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath her red lashes . 
`` And you -- you are cold -- you hold me like a block of wood ; wait , I 'll stir you with the fire of love , '' she said , and again clung fawningly and caressingly to my lips . 
`` I no longer please you ; I suppose I 'll have to be cruel to you again , evidently I have been too kind to you to-day . 
Do you know , you little fool , what I shall do , I shall whip you for a while -- '' `` But child -- '' `` I want to . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
`` Come , let me bind you , '' she continued , and ran gaily through the room . 
`` I want to see you very much in love , do you understand ? 
Here are the ropes . 
I wonder if I can still do it ? '' 
She began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind my back , pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner . 
`` So , '' she said , with gay eagerness . 
`` Can you still move ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Fine -- '' She then tied a noose in a stout rope , threw it over my head , and let it slip down as far as the hips . 
She drew it tight , and bound me to a pillar . 
A curious tremor seized me at that moment . 
`` I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed , '' I said with a low voice . 
`` Well , you shall have a thorough punishment to-day , '' exclaimed Wanda . 
`` But put on your fur-jacket , please , '' I said . 
`` I shall gladly give you that pleasure , '' she replied . 
She got her kazabaika , and put it on . 
Then she stood in front of me with her arms folded across her chest , and looked at me out of half-closed eyes . 
`` Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius ? '' 
she asked . 
`` I remember it only vaguely , what about it ? '' 
`` A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of Syracuse . 
It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were to be shut , and then pushed into a mighty furnace . 
`` As soon as the iron ox began to get hot , and the condemned person began to cry out in his torment , his wails sounded like the bellowing of an ox . 
`` Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor , and to put his invention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox . 
`` It is a very instructive story . 
`` It was you who innoculated me with selfishness , pride , and cruelty , and you shall be their first victim . 
I now literally enjoy having a human being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power ; I love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I , especially a man who loves me . 
`` Do you still love me ? '' 
`` Even to madness , '' I exclaimed . 
`` So much the better , '' she replied , `` and so much the more will you enjoy what I am about to do with you now . '' 
`` What is the matter with you ? '' 
I asked . 
`` I do n't understand you , there is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day , and you are strangely beautiful -- completely Venus in Furs . '' 
Without replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me . 
I was again seized by my fanatical passion . 
`` Where is the whip ? '' 
I asked . 
Wanda laughed , and withdrew a couple of steps . 
`` You really insist upon being punished ? '' 
she exclaimed , proudly tossing back her head . 
`` Yes . '' 
Suddenly Wanda 's face was completely transformed . 
It was as if disfigured by rage ; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me . 
`` Very well , then you whip him ! '' 
she called loudly . 
At the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black curls through the curtains of her four-poster bed . 
At first I was speechless , petrified . 
There was a horribly comic element in the situation . 
I would have laughed aloud , had not my position been at the same time so terribly cruel and humiliating . 
It went beyond anything I had imagined . 
A cold shudder ran down my back , when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots , his tight-fitting white breeches , and his short velvet jacket , and I saw his athletic limbs . 
`` You are indeed cruel , '' he said , turning to Wanda . 
`` Only inordinately fond of pleasure , '' she replied with a wild sort of humor . 
`` Pleasure alone lends value to existence ; whoever enjoys does not easily part from life , whoever suffers or is needy meets death like a friend . 
`` But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the ancient world ; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others ; he must never feel pity ; he must be ready to harness others to his carriage or his plough as though they were animals . 
He must know how to make slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does , and use them for his service and pleasure without remorse . 
It is not his affair whether they like it , or whether they go to rack and ruin . 
He must always remember this , that if they had him in their power , as he has them they would act in exactly the same way , and he would have to pay for their pleasure with his sweat and blood and soul . 
That was the world of the ancients : pleasure and cruelty , liberty and slavery went hand in hand . 
People who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have slaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds , and gladiators who will do battle , the while they banquet , and they must not mind if by chance a bit of blood bespatters them . '' 
Her words brought back my complete self-possession . 
`` Unloosen me ! '' 
I exclaimed angrily . 
`` Are n't you my slave , my property ? '' 
replied Wanda . 
`` Do you want me to show you the agreement ? '' 
`` Untie me ! '' 
I threatened , `` otherwise -- '' I tugged at the ropes . 
`` Can he tear himself free ? '' 
she asked . 
`` He has threatened to kill me . '' 
`` Be entirely at ease , '' said the Greek , testing my fetters . 
`` I shall call for help , '' I began again . 
`` No one will hear you , '' replied Wanda , `` and no one will hinder me from abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game with you . '' 
she continued , repeating with satanic mockery phrases from my letter to her .
