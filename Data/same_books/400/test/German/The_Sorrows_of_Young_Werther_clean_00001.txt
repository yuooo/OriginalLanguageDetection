How happy I am that I am gone ! 
My dear friend , what a thing is the heart of man ! 
To leave you , from whom I have been inseparable , whom I love so dearly , and yet to feel happy ! 
I know you will forgive me . 
Have not other attachments been specially appointed by fate to torment a head like mine ? 
Poor Leonora ! 
and yet I was not to blame . 
Was it my fault , that , whilst the peculiar charms of her sister afforded me an agreeable entertainment , a passion for me was engendered in her feeble heart ? 
And yet am I wholly blameless ? 
Did I not encourage her emotions ? 
Did I not feel charmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature , which , though but little mirthful in reality , so often amused us ? 
Did I not -- but oh ! 
what is man , that he dares so to accuse himself ? 
My dear friend I promise you I will improve ; I will no longer , as has ever been my habit , continue to ruminate on every petty vexation which fortune may dispense ; I will enjoy the present , and the past shall be for me the past . 
No doubt you are right , my best of friends , there would be far less suffering amongst mankind , if men -- and God knows why they are so fashioned -- did not employ their imaginations so assiduously in recalling the memory of past sorrow , instead of bearing their present lot with equanimity . 
Be kind enough to inform my mother that I shall attend to her business to the best of my ability , and shall give her the earliest information about it . 
I have seen my aunt , and find that she is very far from being the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be . 
She is a lively , cheerful woman , with the best of hearts . 
I explained to her my mother 's wrongs with regard to that part of her portion which has been withheld from her . 
She told me the motives and reasons of her own conduct , and the terms on which she is willing to give up the whole , and to do more than we have asked . 
In short , I can not write further upon this subject at present ; only assure my mother that all will go on well . 
And I have again observed , my dear friend , in this trifling affair , that misunderstandings and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice and wickedness . 
At all events , the two latter are of less frequent occurrence . 
In other respects I am very well off here . 
Solitude in this terrestrial paradise is a genial balm to my mind , and the young spring cheers with its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgiving heart . 
Every tree , every bush , is full of flowers ; and one might wish himself transformed into a butterfly , to float about in this ocean of perfume , and find his whole existence in it . 
The town itself is disagreeable ; but then , all around , you find an inexpressible beauty of nature . 
This induced the late Count M to lay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect each other with the most charming variety , and form the most lovely valleys . 
The garden is simple ; and it is easy to perceive , even upon your first entrance , that the plan was not designed by a scientific gardener , but by a man who wished to give himself up here to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart . 
Many a tear have I already shed to the memory of its departed master in a summer-house which is now reduced to ruins , but was his favourite resort , and now is mine . 
I shall soon be master of the place . 
The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days , and he will lose nothing thereby . 
A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul , like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart . 
I am alone , and feel the charm of existence in this spot , which was created for the bliss of souls like mine . 
I am so happy , my dear friend , so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence , that I neglect my talents . 
I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment ; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now . 
When , while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me , and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees , and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary , I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream ; and , as I lie close to the earth , a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me : when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks , and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies , then I feel the presence of the Almighty , who formed us in his own image , and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us , as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss ; and then , my friend , when darkness overspreads my eyes , and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power , like the form of a beloved mistress , then I often think with longing , Oh , would I could describe these conceptions , could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me , that it might be the mirror of my soul , as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God ! 
O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions ! 
I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot , or whether it be the warm , celestial fancy in my own heart which makes everything around me seem like paradise . 
In front of the house is a fountain , -- a fountain to which I am bound by a charm like Melusina and her sisters . 
Descending a gentle slope , you come to an arch , where , some twenty steps lower down , water of the clearest crystal gushes from the marble rock . 
The narrow wall which encloses it above , the tall trees which encircle the spot , and the coolness of the place itself , -- everything imparts a pleasant but sublime impression . 
Not a day passes on which I do not spend an hour there . 
The young maidens come from the town to fetch water , -- innocent and necessary employment , and formerly the occupation of the daughters of kings . 
As I take my rest there , the idea of the old patriarchal life is awakened around me . 
I see them , our old ancestors , how they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at the fountain-side ; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded by beneficent spirits . 
He who is a stranger to these sensations has never really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the fatigue of a weary summer day . 
You ask if you shall send me books . 
My dear friend , I beseech you , for the love of God , relieve me from such a yoke ! 
I need no more to be guided , agitated , heated . 
My heart ferments sufficiently of itself . 
I want strains to lull me , and I find them to perfection in my Homer . 
Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my blood ; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady , so uncertain , as my heart . 
But need I confess this to you , my dear friend , who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing my sudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy , and from sweet melancholy to violent passions ? 
I treat my poor heart like a sick child , and gratify its every fancy . 
Do not mention this again : there are people who would censure me for it . 
The common people of the place know me already , and love me , particularly the children . 
When at first I associated with them , and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles , some fancied that I wished to ridicule them , and turned from me in exceeding ill-humour . 
I did not allow that circumstance to grieve me : I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed . 
Persons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof from the common people , as though they feared to lose their importance by the contact ; whilst wanton idlers , and such as are prone to bad joking , affect to descend to their level , only to make the poor people feel their impertinence all the more keenly . 
I know very well that we are not all equal , nor can be so ; but it is my opinion that he who avoids the common people , in order not to lose their respect , is as much to blame as a coward who hides himself from his enemy because he fears defeat . 
The other day I went to the fountain , and found a young servant-girl , who had set her pitcher on the lowest step , and looked around to see if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her head . 
I ran down , and looked at her . 
`` Shall I help you , pretty lass ? '' 
said I . 
She blushed deeply . 
`` Oh , sir ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
`` No ceremony ! '' 
I replied . 
She adjusted her head-gear , and I helped her . 
She thanked me , and ascended the steps . 
I have made all sorts of acquaintances , but have as yet found no society . 
I know not what attraction I possess for the people , so many of them like me , and attach themselves to me ; and then I feel sorry when the road we pursue together goes only a short distance . 
If you inquire what the people are like here , I must answer , `` The same as everywhere . '' 
The human race is but a monotonous affair . 
Most of them labour the greater part of their time for mere subsistence ; and the scanty portion of freedom which remains to them so troubles them that they use every exertion to get rid of it . 
Oh , the destiny of man ! 
But they are a right good sort of people . 
If I occasionally forget myself , and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yet forbidden to the peasantry , and enjoy myself , for instance , with genuine freedom and sincerity , round a well-covered table , or arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely , and so forth , all this produces a good effect upon my disposition ; only I must forget that there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which moulder uselessly , and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed . 
Ah ! 
this thought affects my spirits fearfully . 
And yet to be misunderstood is the fate of the like of us . 
Alas , that the friend of my youth is gone ! 
Alas , that I ever knew her ! 
I might say to myself , `` You are a dreamer to seek what is not to be found here below . '' 
But she has been mine . 
I have possessed that heart , that noble soul , in whose presence I seemed to be more than I really was , because I was all that I could be . 
Good heavens ! 
did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised ? 
In her presence could I not display , to its full extent , that mysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature ? 
Was not our intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions , of the keenest wit , the varieties of which , even in their very eccentricity , bore the stamp of genius ? 
Alas ! 
the few years by which she was my senior brought her to the grave before me . 
Never can I forget her firm mind or her heavenly patience . 
A few days ago I met a certain young V -- , a frank , open fellow , with a most pleasing countenance . 
He has just left the university , does not deem himself overwise , but believes he knows more than other people . 
He has worked hard , as I can perceive from many circumstances , and , in short , possesses a large stock of information . 
When he heard that I am drawing a good deal , and that I know Greek -LRB- two wonderful things for this part of the country -RRB- , he came to see me , and displayed his whole store of learning , from Batteaux to Wood , from De Piles to Winkelmann : he assured me he had read through the first part of Sultzer 's theory , and also possessed a manuscript of Heyne 's work on the study of the antique . 
I allowed it all to pass . 
I have become acquainted , also , with a very worthy person , the district judge , a frank and open-hearted man . 
I am told it is a most delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children , of whom he has nine . 
His eldest daughter especially is highly spoken of . 
He has invited me to go and see him , and I intend to do so on the first opportunity . 
He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges , which can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking , and which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife , as it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court . 
There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable sort , who are in all respects undesirable , and most intolerable in their demonstration of friendship . 
Good-bye . 
This letter will please you : it is quite historical . 
That the life of man is but a dream , many a man has surmised heretofore ; and I , too , am everywhere pursued by this feeling . 
When I consider the narrow limits within which our active and inquiring faculties are confined ; when I see how all our energies are wasted in providing for mere necessities , which again have no further end than to prolong a wretched existence ; and then that all our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigation ends in nothing better than a passive resignation , whilst we amuse ourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliant landscapes , -- when I consider all this , Wilhelm , I am silent . 
I examine my own being , and find there a world , but a world rather of imagination and dim desires , than of distinctness and living power . 
Then everything swims before my senses , and I smile and dream while pursuing my way through the world . 
All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not comprehend the cause of their desires ; but that the grown-up should wander about this earth like children , without knowing whence they come , or whither they go , influenced as little by fixed motives , but guided like them by biscuits , sugar-plums , and the rod , -- this is what nobody is willing to acknowledge ; and yet I think it is palpable . 
I know what you will say in reply ; for I am ready to admit that they are happiest , who , like children , amuse themselves with their playthings , dress and undress their dolls , and attentively watch the cupboard , where mamma has locked up her sweet things , and , when at last they get a delicious morsel , eat it greedily , and exclaim , `` More ! '' 
These are certainly happy beings ; but others also are objects of envy , who dignify their paltry employments , and sometimes even their passions , with pompous titles , representing them to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfare and glory . 
But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of all this , who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen converts his little garden into a paradise , and how patiently even the poor man pursues his weary way under his burden , and how all wish equally to behold the light of the sun a little longer , -- yes , such a man is at peace , and creates his own world within himself ; and he is also happy , because he is a man . 
And then , however limited his sphere , he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of liberty , and knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes . 
You know of old my ways of settling anywhere , of selecting a little cottage in some cosy spot , and of putting up in it with every inconvenience . 
Here , too , I have discovered such a snug , comfortable place , which possesses peculiar charms for me . 
About a league from the town is a place called Walheim . 
-LRB- The reader need not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated . 
We have found it necessary to change the names given in the original . -RRB- 
It is delightfully situated on the side of a hill ; and , by proceeding along one of the footpaths which lead out of the village , you can have a view of the whole valley . 
A good old woman lives there , who keeps a small inn . 
She sells wine , beer , and coffee , and is cheerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age . 
The chief charm of this spot consists in two linden-trees , spreading their enormous branches over the little green before the church , which is entirely surrounded by peasants ' cottages , barns , and homesteads . 
I have seldom seen a place so retired and peaceable ; and there often have my table and chair brought out from the little inn , and drink my coffee there , and read my Homer . 
Accident brought me to the spot one fine afternoon , and I found it perfectly deserted . 
Everybody was in the fields except a little boy about four years of age , who was sitting on the ground , and held between his knees a child about six months old : he pressed it to his bosom with both arms , which thus formed a sort of arm-chair ; and , notwithstanding the liveliness which sparkled in its black eyes , it remained perfectly still . 
The sight charmed me . 
I sat down upon a plough opposite , and sketched with great delight this little picture of brotherly tenderness . 
I added the neighbouring hedge , the barn-door , and some broken cart-wheels , just as they happened to lie ; and I found in about an hour that I had made a very correct and interesting drawing , without putting in the slightest thing of my own . 
This confirmed me in my resolution of adhering , for the future , entirely to nature . 
She alone is inexhaustible , and capable of forming the greatest masters . 
Much may be alleged in favour of rules , as much may be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society : an artist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad or disgusting ; as a man who observes the laws , and obeys decorum , can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour , nor a decided villain : but yet , say what you will of rules , they destroy the genuine feeling of nature , as well as its true expression . 
Do not tell me `` that this is too hard , that they only restrain and prune superfluous branches , etc. '' My good friend , I will illustrate this by an analogy . 
These things resemble love . 
A warmhearted youth becomes strongly attached to a maiden : he spends every hour of the day in her company , wears out his health , and lavishes his fortune , to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted to her . 
Then comes a man of the world , a man of place and respectability , and addresses him thus : `` My good young friend , love is natural ; but you must love within bounds . 
Divide your time : devote a portion to business , and give the hours of recreation to your mistress . 
Calculate your fortune ; and out of the superfluity you may make her a present , only not too often , -- on her birthday , and such occasions . '' 
Pursuing this advice , he may become a useful member of society , and I should advise every prince to give him an appointment ; but it is all up with his love , and with his genius if he be an artist . 
O my friend ! 
why is it that the torrent of genius so seldom bursts forth , so seldom rolls in full-flowing stream , overwhelming your astounded soul ? 
Because , on either side of this stream , cold and respectable persons have taken up their abodes , and , forsooth , their summer-houses and tulip-beds would suffer from the torrent ; wherefore they dig trenches , and raise embankments betimes , in order to avert the impending danger . 
I find I have fallen into raptures , declamation , and similes , and have forgotten , in consequence , to tell you what became of the children . 
Absorbed in my artistic contemplations , which I briefly described in my letter of yesterday , I continued sitting on the plough for two hours . 
Toward evening a young woman , with a basket on her arm , came running toward the children , who had not moved all that time . 
She exclaimed from a distance , `` You are a good boy , Philip ! '' 
She gave me greeting : I returned it , rose , and approached her . 
I inquired if she were the mother of those pretty children . 
`` Yes , '' she said ; and , giving the eldest a piece of bread , she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with a mother 's tenderness . 
`` I left my child in Philip 's care , '' she said , `` whilst I went into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheaten bread , some sugar , and an earthen pot . '' 
I saw the various articles in the basket , from which the cover had fallen . 
`` I shall make some broth to-night for my little Hans -LRB- which was the name of the youngest -RRB- : that wild fellow , the big one , broke my pot yesterday , whilst he was scrambling with Philip for what remained of the contents . '' 
I inquired for the eldest ; and she had scarcely time to tell me that he was driving a couple of geese home from the meadow , when he ran up , and handed Philip an osier-twig . 
I talked a little longer with the woman , and found that she was the daughter of the schoolmaster , and that her husband was gone on a journey into Switzerland for some money a relation had left him . 
`` They wanted to cheat him , '' she said , `` and would not answer his letters ; so he is gone there himself . 
I hope he has met with no accident , as I have heard nothing of him since his departure . '' 
I left the woman , with regret , giving each of the children a kreutzer , with an additional one for the youngest , to buy some wheaten bread for his broth when she went to town next ; and so we parted . 
I assure you , my dear friend , when my thoughts are all in tumult , the sight of such a creature as this tranquillises my disturbed mind . 
She moves in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of her existence ; she supplies her wants from day to day ; and , when she sees the leaves fall , they raise no other idea in her mind than that winter is approaching . 
Since that time I have gone out there frequently . 
The children have become quite familiar with me ; and each gets a lump of sugar when I drink my coffee , and they share my milk and bread and butter in the evening . 
They always receive their kreutzer on Sundays , for the good woman has orders to give it to them when I do not go there after evening service . 
They are quite at home with me , tell me everything ; and I am particularly amused with observing their tempers , and the simplicity of their behaviour , when some of the other village children are assembled with them . 
It has given me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of the mother , lest -LRB- as she says -RRB- `` they should inconvenience the gentleman . '' 
What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect to poetry . 
It is only necessary for us to know what is really excellent , and venture to give it expression ; and that is saying much in few words . 
To-day I have had a scene , which , if literally related , would , make the most beautiful idyl in the world . 
But why should I talk of poetry and scenes and idyls ? 
Can we never take pleasure in nature without having recourse to art ? 
If you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction , you will be sadly mistaken . 
It relates merely to a peasant-lad , who has excited in me the warmest interest . 
As usual , I shall tell my story badly ; and you , as usual , will think me extravagant . 
It is Walheim once more -- always Walheim -- which produces these wonderful phenomena . 
A party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees , to drink coffee . 
The company did not exactly please me ; and , under one pretext or another , I lingered behind . 
A peasant came from an adjoining house , and set to work arranging some part of the same plough which I had lately sketched . 
His appearance pleased me ; and I spoke to him , inquired about his circumstances , made his acquaintance , and , as is my wont with persons of that class , was soon admitted into his confidence . 
He said he was in the service of a young widow , who set great store by him . 
He spoke so much of his mistress , and praised her so extravagantly , that I could soon see he was desperately in love with her . 
`` She is no longer young , '' he said : `` and she was treated so badly by her former husband that she does not mean to marry again . '' 
From his account it was so evident what incomparable charms she possessed for him , and how ardently he wished she would select him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband 's misconduct , that I should have to repeat his own words in order to describe the depth of the poor fellow 's attachment , truth , and devotion . 
It would , in fact , require the gifts of a great poet to convey the expression of his features , the harmony of his voice , and the heavenly fire of his eye . 
No words can portray the tenderness of his every movement and of every feature : no effort of mine could do justice to the scene . 
His alarm lest I should misconceive his position with regard to his mistress , or question the propriety of her conduct , touched me particularly . 
The charming manner with which he described her form and person , which , without possessing the graces of youth , won and attached him to her , is inexpressible , and must be left to the imagination . 
I have never in my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility of such intense devotion , such ardent affections , united with so much purity . 
Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of this innocence and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul ; that this picture of fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere ; and that my own heart , as though enkindled by the flame , glows and burns within me . 
I mean now to try and see her as soon as I can : or perhaps , on second thoughts , I had better not ; it is better I should behold her through the eyes of her lover . 
To my sight , perhaps , she would not appear as she now stands before me ; and why should I destroy so sweet a picture ? 
`` Why do I not write to you ? '' 
You lay claim to learning , and ask such a question . 
You should have guessed that I am well -- that is to say -- in a word , I have made an acquaintance who has won my heart : I have -- I know not . 
To give you a regular account of the manner in which I have become acquainted with the most amiable of women would be a difficult task . 
I am a happy and contented mortal , but a poor historian . 
An angel ! 
Nonsense ! 
Everybody so describes his mistress ; and yet I find it impossible to tell you how perfect she is , or why she is so perfect : suffice it to say she has captivated all my senses . 
So much simplicity with so much understanding -- so mild , and yet so resolute -- a mind so placid , and a life so active . 
But all this is ugly balderdash , which expresses not a single character nor feature . 
Some other time -- but no , not some other time , now , this very instant , will I tell you all about it . 
Now or never . 
Well , between ourselves , since I commenced my letter , I have been three times on the point of throwing down my pen , of ordering my horse , and riding out . 
And yet I vowed this morning that I would not ride to-day , and yet every moment I am rushing to the window to see how high the sun is . 
I could not restrain myself -- go to her I must . 
I have just returned , Wilhelm ; and whilst I am taking supper I will write to you . 
What a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midst of her dear , beautiful children , -- eight brothers and sisters ! 
But , if I proceed thus , you will be no wiser at the end of my letter than you were at the beginning . 
Attend , then , and I will compel myself to give you the details . 
I mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted with S -- , the district judge , and that he had invited me to go and visit him in his retirement , or rather in his little kingdom . 
But I neglected going , and perhaps should never have gone , if chance had not discovered to me the treasure which lay concealed in that retired spot . 
Some of our young people had proposed giving a ball in the country , at which I consented to be present . 
I offered my hand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable , but rather commonplace , sort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood ; and it was agreed that I should engage a carriage , and call upon Charlotte , with my partner and her aunt , to convey them to the ball . 
My companion informed me , as we drove along through the park to the hunting-lodge , that I should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady . 
`` Take care , '' added the aunt , `` that you do not lose your heart . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
said I. `` Because she is already engaged to a very worthy man , '' she replied , `` who is gone to settle his affairs upon the death of his father , and will succeed to a very considerable inheritance . '' 
This information possessed no interest for me . 
When we arrived at the gate , the sun was setting behind the tops of the mountains . 
The atmosphere was heavy ; and the ladies expressed their fears of an approaching storm , as masses of low black clouds were gathering in the horizon . 
I relieved their anxieties by pretending to be weather-wise , although I myself had some apprehensions lest our pleasure should be interrupted . 
I alighted ; and a maid came to the door , and requested us to wait a moment for her mistress . 
I walked across the court to a well-built house , and , ascending the flight of steps in front , opened the door , and saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed . 
Six children , from eleven to two years old , were running about the hall , and surrounding a lady of middle height , with a lovely figure , dressed in a robe of simple white , trimmed with pink ribbons . 
She was holding a rye loaf in her hand , and was cutting slices for the little ones all around , in proportion to their age and appetite . 
She performed her task in a graceful and affectionate manner ; each claimant awaiting his turn with outstretched hands , and boisterously shouting his thanks . 
Some of them ran away at once , to enjoy their evening meal ; whilst others , of a gentler disposition , retired to the courtyard to see the strangers , and to survey the carriage in which their Charlotte was to drive away . 
`` Pray forgive me for giving you the trouble to come for me , and for keeping the ladies waiting : but dressing , and arranging some household duties before I leave , had made me forget my children 's supper ; and they do not like to take it from any one but me . '' 
I uttered some indifferent compliment : but my whole soul was absorbed by her air , her voice , her manner ; and I had scarcely recovered myself when she ran into her room to fetch her gloves and fan . 
The young ones threw inquiring glances at me from a distance ; whilst I approached the youngest , a most delicious little creature . 
He drew back ; and Charlotte , entering at the very moment , said , `` Louis , shake hands with your cousin . '' 
The little fellow obeyed willingly ; and I could not resist giving him a hearty kiss , notwithstanding his rather dirty face . 
`` Cousin , '' said I to Charlotte , as I handed her down , `` do you think I deserve the happiness of being related to you ? '' 
She replied , with a ready smile , `` Oh ! 
I have such a number of cousins , that I should be sorry if you were the most undeserving of them . '' 
In taking leave , she desired her next sister , Sophy , a girl about eleven years old , to take great care of the children , and to say good-bye to papa for her when he came home from his ride . 
She enjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as they would herself , upon which some promised that they would ; but a little fair-haired girl , about six years old , looked discontented , and said , `` But Sophy is not you , Charlotte ; and we like you best . '' 
The two eldest boys had clambered up the carriage ; and , at my request , she permitted them to accompany us a little way through the forest , upon their promising to sit very still , and hold fast . 
We were hardly seated , and the ladies had scarcely exchanged compliments , making the usual remarks upon each other 's dress , and upon the company they expected to meet , when Charlotte stopped the carriage , and made her brothers get down . 
They insisted upon kissing her hands once more ; which the eldest did with all the tenderness of a youth of fifteen , but the other in a lighter and more careless manner . 
She desired them again to give her love to the children , and we drove off . 
The aunt inquired of Charlotte whether she had finished the book she had last sent her . 
`` No , '' said Charlotte ; `` I did not like it : you can have it again . 
And the one before was not much better . '' 
I was surprised , upon asking the title , to hear that it was . 
-LRB- We feel obliged to suppress the passage in the letter , to prevent any one from feeling aggrieved ; although no author need pay much attention to the opinion of a mere girl , or that of an unsteady young man . -RRB- 
I found penetration and character in everything she said : every expression seemed to brighten her features with new charms , -- with new rays of genius , -- which unfolded by degrees , as she felt herself understood . 
`` When I was younger , '' she observed , `` I loved nothing so much as romances . 
Nothing could equal my delight when , on some holiday , I could settle down quietly in a corner , and enter with my whole heart and soul into the joys or sorrows of some fictitious Leonora . 
I do not deny that they even possess some charms for me yet . 
But I read so seldom , that I prefer books suited exactly to my taste . 
And I like those authors best whose scenes describe my own situation in life , -- and the friends who are about me , whose stories touch me with interest , from resembling my own homely existence , -- which , without being absolutely paradise , is , on the whole , a source of indescribable happiness . '' 
I endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned , but it was of slight avail ; for , when she had expressed so truly her opinion of `` The Vicar of Wakefield , '' and of other works , the names of which I omit -LRB- Though the names are omitted , yet the authors mentioned deserve Charlotte 's approbation , and will feel it in their hearts when they read this passage . 
It concerns no other person . -RRB- 
, I could no longer contain myself , but gave full utterance to what I thought of it : and it was not until Charlotte had addressed herself to the two other ladies , that I remembered their presence , and observed them sitting mute with astonishment . 
The aunt looked at me several times with an air of raillery , which , however , I did not at all mind . 
We talked of the pleasures of dancing . 
`` If it is a fault to love it , '' said Charlotte , `` I am ready to confess that I prize it above all other amusements . 
If anything disturbs me , I go to the piano , play an air to which I have danced , and all goes right again directly . '' 
You , who know me , can fancy how steadfastly I gazed upon her rich dark eyes during these remarks , how my very soul gloated over her warm lips and fresh , glowing cheeks , how I became quite lost in the delightful meaning of her words , so much so , that I scarcely heard the actual expressions . 
In short , I alighted from the carriage like a person in a dream , and was so lost to the dim world around me , that I scarcely heard the music which resounded from the illuminated ballroom . 
The two Messrs. Andran and a certain N. N. -LRB- I can not trouble myself with the names -RRB- , who were the aunt 's and Charlotte 's partners , received us at the carriage-door , and took possession of their ladies , whilst I followed with mine . 
We commenced with a minuet . 
I led out one lady after another , and precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bring themselves to leave off . 
Charlotte and her partner began an English country dance , and you must imagine my delight when it was their turn to dance the figure with us . 
You should see Charlotte dance . 
She dances with her whole heart and soul : her figure is all harmony , elegance , and grace , as if she were conscious of nothing else , and had no other thought or feeling ; and , doubtless , for the moment , every other sensation is extinct . 
She was engaged for the second country dance , but promised me the third , and assured me , with the most agreeable freedom , that she was very fond of waltzing . 
`` It is the custom here , '' she said , `` for the previous partners to waltz together ; but my partner is an indifferent waltzer , and will feel delighted if I save him the trouble . 
Your partner is not allowed to waltz , and , indeed , is equally incapable : but I observed during the country dance that you waltz well ; so , if you will waltz with me , I beg you would propose it to my partner , and I will propose it to yours . '' 
We agreed , and it was arranged that our partners should mutually entertain each other . 
We set off , and , at first , delighted ourselves with the usual graceful motions of the arms . 
With what grace , with what ease , she moved ! 
When the waltz commenced , and the dancers whirled around each other in the giddy maze , there was some confusion , owing to the incapacity of some of the dancers . 
We judiciously remained still , allowing the others to weary themselves ; and , when the awkward dancers had withdrawn , we joined in , and kept it up famously together with one other couple , -- Andran and his partner . 
Never did I dance more lightly . 
I felt myself more than mortal , holding this loveliest of creatures in my arms , flying , with her as rapidly as the wind , till I lost sight of every other object ; and O Wilhelm , I vowed at that moment , that a maiden whom I loved , or for whom I felt the slightest attachment , never , never should waltz with any one else but with me , if I went to perdition for it ! 
-- you will understand this . 
We took a few turns in the room to recover our breath . 
Charlotte sat down , and felt refreshed by partaking of some oranges which I had had secured , -- the only ones that had been left ; but at every slice which , from politeness , she offered to her neighbours , I felt as though a dagger went through my heart . 
We were the second couple in the third country dance . 
As we were going down -LRB- and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her arms and eyes , beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuine enjoyment -RRB- , we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charming expression of countenance ; although she was no longer young . 
She looked at Charlotte with a smile , then , holding up her finger in a threatening attitude , repeated twice in a very significant tone of voice the name of `` Albert . '' 
`` Who is Albert , '' said I to Charlotte , `` if it is not impertinent to ask ? '' 
She was about to answer , when we were obliged to separate , in order to execute a figure in the dance ; and , as we crossed over again in front of each other , I perceived she looked somewhat pensive . 
`` Why need I conceal it from you ? '' 
she said , as she gave me her hand for the promenade . 
`` Albert is a worthy man , to whom I am engaged . '' 
Now , there was nothing new to me in this -LRB- for the girls had told me of it on the way -RRB- ; but it was so far new that I had not thought of it in connection with her whom , in so short a time , I had learned to prize so highly . 
Enough , I became confused , got out in the figure , and occasioned general confusion ; so that it required all Charlotte 's presence of mind to set me right by pulling and pushing me into my proper place . 
The dance was not yet finished when the lightning which had for some time been seen in the horizon , and which I had asserted to proceed entirely from heat , grew more violent ; and the thunder was heard above the music . 
When any distress or terror surprises us in the midst of our amusements , it naturally makes a deeper impression than at other times , either because the contrast makes us more keenly susceptible , or rather perhaps because our senses are then more open to impressions , and the shock is consequently stronger . 
To this cause I must ascribe the fright and shrieks of the ladies . 
One sagaciously sat down in a corner with her back to the window , and held her fingers to her ears ; a second knelt down before her , and hid her face in her lap ; a third threw herself between them , and embraced her sister with a thousand tears ; some insisted on going home ; others , unconscious of their actions , wanted sufficient presence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young partners , who sought to direct to themselves those sighs which the lips of our agitated beauties intended for heaven . 
Some of the gentlemen had gone down-stairs to smoke a quiet cigar , and the rest of the company gladly embraced a happy suggestion of the hostess to retire into another room which was provided with shutters and curtains . 
We had hardly got there , when Charlotte placed the chairs in a circle ; and , when the company had sat down in compliance with her request , she forthwith proposed a round game . 
I noticed some of the company prepare their mouths and draw themselves up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit . 
`` Let us play at counting , '' said Charlotte . 
`` Now , pay attention : I shall go round the circle from right to left ; and each person is to count , one after the other , the number that comes to him , and must count fast ; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a box on the ear , and so on , till we have counted a thousand . '' 
It was delightful to see the fun . 
She went round the circle with upraised arm . 
`` One , '' said the first ; `` two , '' the second ; `` three , '' the third ; and so on , till Charlotte went faster and faster . 
One made a mistake , instantly a box on the ear ; and , amid the laughter that ensued , came another box ; and so on , faster and faster . 
I myself came in for two . 
I fancied they were harder than the rest , and felt quite delighted . 
A general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long before we had counted as far as a thousand . 
The party broke up into little separate knots : the storm had ceased , and I followed Charlotte into the ballroom . 
On the way she said , `` The game banished their fears of the storm . '' 
I could make no reply . 
`` I myself , '' she continued , `` was as much frightened as any of them ; but by affecting courage , to keep up the spirits of the others , I forgot my apprehensions . '' 
We went to the window . 
It was still thundering at a distance : a soft rain was pouring down over the country , and filled the air around us with delicious odours . 
Charlotte leaned forward on her arm ; her eyes wandered over the scene ; she raised them to the sky , and then turned them upon me ; they were moistened with tears ; she placed her hand on mine and said , `` Klopstock ! '' 
at once I remembered the magnificent ode which was in her thoughts : I felt oppressed with the weight of my sensations , and sank under them . 
It was more than I could bear . 
I bent over her hand , kissed it in a stream of delicious tears , and again looked up to her eyes . 
Divine Klopstock ! 
why didst thou not see thy apotheosis in those eyes ? 
And thy name so often profaned , would that I never heard it repeated ! 
I no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative : I only know it was two in the morning when I went to bed ; and if you had been with me , that I might have talked instead of writing to you , I should , in all probability , have kept you up till daylight . 
I think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home from the ball , nor have I time to tell you now . 
It was a most magnificent sunrise : the whole country was refreshed , and the rain fell drop by drop from the trees in the forest . 
Our companions were asleep . 
Charlotte asked me if I did not wish to sleep also , and begged of me not to make any ceremony on her account . 
Looking steadfastly at her , I answered , `` As long as I see those eyes open , there is no fear of my falling asleep . '' 
We both continued awake till we reached her door . 
The maid opened it softly , and assured her , in answer to her inquiries , that her father and the children were well , and still sleeping . 
I left her asking permission to visit her in the course of the day . 
She consented , and I went , and , since that time , sun , moon , and stars may pursue their course : I know not whether it is day or night ; the whole world is nothing to me . 
My days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect ; and , whatever be my fate hereafter , I can never say that I have not tasted joy , -- the purest joy of life . 
You know Walheim . 
I am now completely settled there . 
In that spot I am only half a league from Charlotte ; and there I enjoy myself , and taste all the pleasure which can fall to the lot of man . 
Little did I imagine , when I selected Walheim for my pedestrian excursions , that all heaven lay so near it . 
How often in my wanderings from the hillside or from the meadows across the river , have I beheld this hunting-lodge , which now contains within it all the joy of my heart ! 
I have often , my dear Wilhelm , reflected on the eagerness men feel to wander and make new discoveries , and upon that secret impulse which afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle , conform to the laws of custom , and embarrass themselves no longer with what passes around them . 
It is so strange how , when I came here first , and gazed upon that lovely valley from the hillside , I felt charmed with the entire scene surrounding me . 
The little wood opposite -- how delightful to sit under its shade ! 
How fine the view from that point of rock ! 
Then , that delightful chain of hills , and the exquisite valleys at their feet ! 
Could I but wander and lose myself amongst them ! 
I went , and returned without finding what I wished . 
Distance , my friend , is like futurity . 
A dim vastness is spread before our souls : the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our vision ; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being , that it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of one glorious emotion . 
But alas ! 
when we have attained our object , when the distant there becomes the present here , all is changed : we are as poor and circumscribed as ever , and our souls still languish for unattainable happiness . 
So does the restless traveller pant for his native soil , and find in his own cottage , in the arms of his wife , in the affections of his children , and in the labour necessary for their support , that happiness which he had sought in vain through the wide world . 
When , in the morning at sunrise , I go out to Walheim , and with my own hands gather in the garden the pease which are to serve for my dinner , when I sit down to shell them , and read my Homer during the intervals , and then , selecting a saucepan from the kitchen , fetch my own butter , put my mess on the fire , cover it up , and sit down to stir it as occasion requires , I figure to myself the illustrious suitors of Penelope , killing , dressing , and preparing their own oxen and swine . 
Nothing fills me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than those traits of patriarchal life which , thank Heaven ! 
I can imitate without affectation . 
Happy is it , indeed , for me that my heart is capable of feeling the same simple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is covered with food of his own rearing , and who not only enjoys his meal , but remembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when he planted it , the soft evenings when he watered it , and the pleasure he experienced in watching its daily growth . 
The day before yesterday , the physician came from the town to pay a visit to the judge . 
He found me on the floor playing with Charlotte 's children . 
Some of them were scrambling over me , and others romped with me ; and , as I caught and tickled them , they made a great noise . 
The doctor is a formal sort of personage : he adjusts the plaits of his ruffles , and continually settles his frill whilst he is talking to you ; and he thought my conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man . 
I could perceive this by his countenance . 
But I did not suffer myself to be disturbed . 
I allowed him to continue his wise conversation , whilst I rebuilt the children 's card houses for them as fast as they threw them down . 
He went about the town afterward , complaining that the judge 's children were spoiled enough before , but that now Werther was completely ruining them . 
Yes , my dear Wilhelm , nothing on this earth affects my heart so much as children . 
When I look on at their doings ; when I mark in the little creatures the seeds of all those virtues and qualities which they will one day find so indispensable ; when I behold in the obstinate all the future firmness and constancy of a noble character ; in the capricious , that levity and gaiety of temper which will carry them lightly over the dangers and troubles of life , their whole nature simple and unpolluted , -- then I call to mind the golden words of the Great Teacher of mankind , `` Unless ye become like one of these ! '' 
And now , my friend , these children , who are our equals , whom we ought to consider as our models , we treat them as though they were our subjects . 
They are allowed no will of their own . 
And have we , then , none ourselves ? 
Whence comes our exclusive right ? 
Is it because we are older and more experienced ? 
Great God ! 
from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great children and little children , and no others ; and thy Son has long since declared which afford thee greatest pleasure . 
But they believe in him , and hear him not , -- that , too , is an old story ; and they train their children after their own image , etc. . 
Adieu , Wilhelm : I will not further bewilder myself with this subject . 
The consolation Charlotte can bring to an invalid I experience from my own heart , which suffers more from her absence than many a poor creature lingering on a bed of sickness . 
She is gone to spend a few days in the town with a very worthy woman , who is given over by the physicians , and wishes to have Charlotte near her in her last moments . 
I accompanied her last week on a visit to the Vicar of S -- , a small village in the mountains , about a league hence . 
We arrived about four o'clock : Charlotte had taken her little sister with her . 
When we entered the vicarage court , we found the good old man sitting on a bench before the door , under the shade of two large walnut-trees . 
At the sight of Charlotte he seemed to gain new life , rose , forgot his stick , and ventured to walk toward her . 
She ran to him , and made him sit down again ; then , placing herself by his side , she gave him a number of messages from her father , and then caught up his youngest child , a dirty , ugly little thing , the joy of his old age , and kissed it . 
I wish you could have witnessed her attention to this old man , -- how she raised her voice on account of his deafness ; how she told him of healthy young people , who had been carried off when it was least expected ; praised the virtues of Carlsbad , and commended his determination to spend the ensuing summer there ; and assured him that he looked better and stronger than he did when she saw him last . 
I , in the meantime , paid attention to his good lady . 
The old man seemed quite in spirits ; and as I could not help admiring the beauty of the walnut-trees , which formed such an agreeable shade over our heads , he began , though with some little difficulty , to tell us their history . 
`` As to the oldest , '' said he , `` we do not know who planted it , -- some say one clergyman , and some another : but the younger one , there behind us , is exactly the age of my wife , fifty years old next October ; her father planted it in the morning , and in the evening she came into the world . 
My wife 's father was my predecessor here , and I can not tell you how fond he was of that tree ; and it is fully as dear to me . 
Under the shade of that very tree , upon a log of wood , my wife was seated knitting , when I , a poor student , came into this court for the first time , just seven and twenty years ago . '' 
Charlotte inquired for his daughter . 
He said she was gone with Herr Schmidt to the meadows , and was with the haymakers . 
The old man then resumed his story , and told us how his predecessor had taken a fancy to him , as had his daughter likewise ; and how he had become first his curate , and subsequently his successor . 
He had scarcely finished his story when his daughter returned through the garden , accompanied by the above-mentioned Herr Schmidt . 
She welcomed Charlotte affectionately , and I confess I was much taken with her appearance . 
She was a lively-looking , good-humoured brunette , quite competent to amuse one for a short time in the country . 
Her lover -LRB- for such Herr Schmidt evidently appeared to be -RRB- was a polite , reserved personage , and would not join our conversation , notwithstanding all Charlotte 's endeavours to draw him out . 
I was much annoyed at observing , by his countenance , that his silence did not arise from want of talent , but from caprice and ill-humour . 
This subsequently became very evident , when we set out to take a walk , and Frederica joining Charlotte , with whom I was talking , the worthy gentleman 's face , which was naturally rather sombre , became so dark and angry that Charlotte was obliged to touch my arm , and remind me that I was talking too much to Frederica . 
Nothing distresses me more than to see men torment each other ; particularly when in the flower of their age , in the very season of pleasure , they waste their few short days of sunshine in quarrels and disputes , and only perceive their error when it is too late to repair it . 
This thought dwelt upon my mind ; and in the evening , when we returned to the vicar 's , and were sitting round the table with our bread end milk , the conversation turned on the joys and sorrows of the world , I could not resist the temptation to inveigh bitterly against ill-humour . 
`` We are apt , '' said I , `` to complain , but -- with very little cause , that our happy days are few , and our evil days many . 
If our hearts were always disposed to receive the benefits Heaven sends us , we should acquire strength to support evil when it comes . '' 
`` But , '' observed the vicar 's wife , `` we can not always command our tempers , so much depends upon the constitution : when the body suffers , the mind is ill at ease . '' 
`` I acknowledge that , '' I continued ; `` but we must consider such a disposition in the light of a disease , and inquire whether there is no remedy for it . ''
