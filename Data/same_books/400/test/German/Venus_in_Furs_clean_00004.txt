She clung to my lips , drawing my soul from my body . 
My head whirled , my blood began to seethe , my heart beat violently against hers . 
`` I want to be absolutely in your power , Wanda , '' I exclaimed suddenly , seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think clearly or decide freely . 
`` I want to put myself absolutely at your mercy for good or evil without any condition , without any limit to your power . '' 
While saying this I had slipped from the ottoman , and lay at her feet looking up at her with drunken eyes . 
`` How beautiful you now are , '' she exclaimed , `` your eyes half-broken in ecstacy fill me with joy , carry me away . 
How wonderful your look would be if you were being beaten to death , in the extreme agony . 
You have the eye of a martyr . '' 
Sometimes , nevertheless , I have an uneasy feeling about placing myself so absolutely , so unconditionally into a woman 's hands . 
Suppose she did abuse my passion , her power ? 
Well , then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since my childhood , what has always given me the feeling of seductive terror . 
A foolish apprehension ! 
It will be a wanton game she will play with me , nothing more . 
She loves me , and she is good , a noble personality , incapable of a breach of faith . 
But it lies in her hands -- if she wants to she can . 
What a temptation in this doubt , this fear ! 
Now I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier , who , even in the pillory , while she was another man 's mistress , still adored her . 
Love knows no virtue , no profit ; it loves and forgives and suffers everything , because it must . 
It is not our judgment that leads us ; it is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover , that make us abandon ourselves , or that repel us . 
It is a sweet , soft , enigmatic power that drives us on . 
We cease to think , to feel , to will ; we let ourselves be carried away by it , and ask not whither ? 
A Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade . 
He aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure , magnificent face , and splendid bearing . 
The women particularly gaped at him as though he were a wild animal , but he went his way gloomily without paying attention to any one . 
He was accompanied by two servants , one a negro , completely dressed in red satin , and the other a Circassian in his full gleaming uniform . 
Suddenly he saw Wanda , and fixed his cold piercing look upon her ; he even turned his head after her , and when she had passed , he stood still and followed her with his eyes . 
And she -- she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes -- and did everything possible to meet him again . 
The cunning coquetry with which she walked , moved , and looked at him , almost stifled me . 
On the way home I remarked about it . 
She knit her brows . 
`` What do you want , '' she said , `` the prince is a man whom I might like , who even dazzles me , and I am free . 
I can do what I please -- '' `` Do n't you love me any longer -- '' I stammered , frightened . 
`` I love only you , '' she replied , `` but I shall have the prince pay court to me . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
`` Are n't you my slave ? '' 
she said calmly . 
`` Am I not Venus , the cruel northern Venus in Furs ? '' 
I was silent . 
I felt literally crushed by her words ; her cold look entered my heart like a dagger . 
`` You will find out immediately the prince 's name , residence , and circumstances , '' she continued . 
`` Do you understand ? '' 
`` But -- '' `` No argument , obey ! '' 
exclaimed Wanda , more sternly than I would have thought possible for her , `` and do n't dare to enter my sight until you can answer my questions . '' 
It was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired information for Wanda . 
She let me stand before her like a servant , while she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me , smiling . 
Then she nodded ; she seemed to be satisfied . 
`` Bring me my footstool , '' she commanded shortly . 
I obeyed , and after having put it before her and having put her feet on it , I remained kneeling . 
`` How will this end ? '' 
I asked sadly after a short pause . 
She broke into playful laughter . 
`` Why things have n't even begun yet . '' 
`` You are more heartless than I imagined , '' I replied , hurt . 
`` Severin , '' Wanda began earnestly . 
`` I have n't done anything yet , not the slightest thing , and you are already calling me heartless . 
What will happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization , when I shall lead a gay , free life and have a circle of admirers about me , when I shall actually fulfil your ideal , tread you underfoot and apply the lash ? '' 
`` You take my dreams too seriously . '' 
`` Too seriously ? 
I ca n't stop at make-believe , when once I begin , '' she replied . 
`` You know I hate all play-acting and comedy . 
You have wished it . 
Was it my idea or yours ? 
Did I persuade you or did you inflame my imagination ? 
I am taking things seriously now . '' 
`` Wanda , '' I replied , caressingly , `` listen quietly to me . 
We love each other infinitely , we are very happy , will you sacrifice our entire future to a whim ? '' 
`` It is no longer a whim , '' she exclaimed . 
`` What is it ? '' 
I asked frightened . 
`` Something that was probably latent in me , '' she said quietly and thoughtfully . 
`` Perhaps it would never have come to light , if you had not called it to life , and made it grow . 
Now that it has become a powerful impulse , fills my whole being , now that I enjoy it , now that I can not and do not want to do otherwise , now you want to back out -- you -- are you a man ? '' 
`` Dear , sweet Wanda ! '' 
I began to caress her , kiss her . 
`` Do n't -- you are not a man -- '' `` And you , '' I flared up . 
`` I am stubborn , '' she said , `` you know that . 
I have n't a strong imagination , and like you I am weak in execution . 
But when I make up my mind to do something , I carry it through , and the more certainly , the more opposition I meet . 
Leave me alone ! '' 
She pushed me away , and got up . 
`` Wanda ! '' 
I likewise rose , and stood facing her . 
`` Now you know what I am , '' she continued . 
`` Once more I warn you . 
You still have the choice . 
I am not compelling you to be my slave . '' 
`` Wanda , '' I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes , `` do n't you know how I love you ? '' 
Her lips quivered contemptuously . 
`` You are mistaken , you make yourself out worse than you are ; you are good and noble by nature -- '' `` What do you know about my nature , '' she interrupted vehemently , `` you will get to know me as I am . '' 
`` Wanda ! '' 
`` Decide , will you submit , unconditionally ? '' 
`` And if I say no . '' 
`` Then -- '' She stepped close up to me , cold and contemptuous . 
As she stood before me now , the arms folded across her breast , with an evil smile about her lips , she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams . 
Her expression seemed hard , and nothing lay in her eyes that promised kindness or mercy . 
`` Well -- '' she said at last . 
`` You are angry , '' I cried , `` you will punish me . '' 
`` Oh no ! '' 
she replied , `` I shall let you go . 
You are free . 
I am not holding you . '' 
`` Wanda -- I , who love you so -- '' `` Yes , you , my dear sir , you who adore me , '' she exclaimed contemptuously , `` but who are a coward , a liar , and a breaker of promises . 
Leave me instantly -- '' `` Wanda I -- '' `` Wretch ! '' 
My blood rose in my heart . 
I threw myself down at her feet and began to cry . 
`` Tears , too ! '' 
She began to laugh . 
Oh , this laughter was frightful . 
`` Leave me -- I do n't want to see you again . '' 
`` Oh my God ! '' 
I cried , beside myself . 
`` I will do whatever you command , be your slave , a mere object with which you can do what you will -- only do n't send me away -- I ca n't bear it -- I can not live without you . '' 
I embraced her knees , and covered her hand with kisses . 
`` Yes , you must be a slave , and feel the lash , for you are not a man , '' she said calmly . 
She said this to me with perfect composure , not angrily , not even excitedly , and it was what hurt most . 
`` Now I know you , your dog-like nature , that adores where it is kicked , and the more , the more it is maltreated . 
Now I know you , and now you shall come to know me . '' 
She walked up and down with long strides , while I remained crushed on my knees ; my head was hanging supine , tears flowed from my eyes . 
`` Come here , '' Wanda commanded harshly , sitting down on the ottoman . 
I obeyed her command , and sat down beside her . 
She looked at me sombrely , and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior of her eye . 
Smiling , she drew me toward her breast , and began to kiss the tears out of my eyes . 
The odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily 's park . 
I can escape and do n't want to ; I am ready to endure everything as soon as she threatens to set me free . 
If only she would use the whip again . 
There is something uncanny in the kindness with which she treats me . 
I seem like a little captive mouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays . 
She is ready at any moment to tear it to pieces , and my heart of a mouse threatens to burst . 
What are her intentions ? 
What does she purpose to do with me ? 
It seems she has completely forgotten the contract , my slavehood . 
Or was it actually only stubbornness ? 
And she gave up her whole plan as soon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim ? 
How kind she is to me , how tender , how loving ! 
We are spending marvellously happy days . 
To-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and Mephistopheles , in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar . 
Her glance hung on me with strange pleasure . 
`` I do n't understand , '' she said when I had finished , `` how a man who can read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression , and interpret them so clearly , concisely , and intelligently , can at the same time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are . '' 
`` Were you pleased , '' said I , and kissed her forehead . 
She gently stroked my brow . 
`` I love you , Severin , '' she whispered . 
`` I do n't believe I could ever love any one more than you . 
Let us be sensible , what do you say ? '' 
Instead of replying I folded her in my arms ; a deep inward , yet vaguely sad happiness filled my breast , my eyes grew moist , and a tear fell upon her hand . 
`` How can you cry ! '' 
she exclaimed , `` you are a child ! '' 
On a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage . 
He seemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda 's side , and looked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his electric gray eyes . 
She , however , did not seem to notice him . 
I felt at that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet . 
She let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an inanimate object , a tree , for instance , and turned to me with her gracious smile . 
When I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly unaccountably distracted and moody . 
What was occupying her ? 
`` I am sorry you are going , '' she said when I was already standing on the threshold . 
`` It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my trial , to cease tormenting me -- '' I pleaded . 
`` Do you imagine that this compulsion is n't a torment for me , too , '' Wanda interjected . 
`` Then end it , '' I exclaimed , embracing her , `` be my wife . '' '' 
Never , Severin , '' she said gently , but with great firmness . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
I was frightened in my innermost soul . '' 
You are not the man for me . '' 
I looked at her , and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about her waist ; then I left the room , and she -- she did not call me back . 
A sleepless night ; I made countless decisions , only to toss them aside again . 
In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared our relationship dissolved . 
My hand trembled when I put on the seal , and I burned my fingers . 
As I went upstairs to hand it to the maid , my knees threatened to give way . 
The door opened , and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers . 
`` I have n't had my hair dressed yet , '' she said , smiling . 
`` What have you there ? '' 
`` A letter -- '' `` For me ? '' 
I nodded . 
`` Ah , you want to break with me , '' she exclaimed , mockingly . 
`` Did n't you tell me yesterday that I was n't the man for you ? '' 
`` I repeat it now ! '' 
`` Very well , then . '' 
My whole body was trembling , my voice failed me , and I handed her the letter . 
`` Keep it , '' she said , measuring me coldly . 
`` You forget that is no longer a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man ; as a slave you will doubtless do well enough . '' 
`` Madame ! '' 
I exclaimed , aghast . 
`` That is what you will call me in the future , '' replied Wanda , throwing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt . 
`` Put your affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours . 
The day after to-morrow I shall start for Italy , and you will accompany me as my servant . '' 
`` Wanda -- '' `` I forbid any sort of familiarity , '' she said , cutting my words short , `` likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you , and you are not to speak to me until you are spoken to . 
From now on your name is no longer Severin , but Gregor . '' 
I trembled with rage , and yet , unfortunately , I can not deny it , I also felt a strange pleasure and stimulation . 
`` But , madame , you know my circumstances , '' I began in my confusion . 
`` I am dependent on my father , and I doubt whether he will give me the large sum of money needed for this journey -- '' `` That means you have no money , Gregor , '' said Wanda , delightedly , `` so much the better , you are then entirely dependent on me , and in fact my slave . '' 
`` You do n't consider , '' I tried to object , `` that as man of honor it is impossible for me -- '' `` I have indeed considered it , '' she replied almost with a tone of command . 
`` As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your promise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey whatever I command . 
Now leave me , Gregor ! '' 
I turned toward the door . 
`` Not yet -- you may first kiss my hand . '' 
She held it out to me with a certain proud indifference , and I the dilettante , the donkey , the miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips which were dry and hot with excitement . 
There was another gracious nod of the head . 
Then I was dismissed . 
Though it was late in the evening my light was still lit , and a fire was burning in the large green stove . 
There were still many things among my letters and documents to be put in order . 
Autumn , as is usually the case with us , had fallen with all its power . 
Suddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip . 
I opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and in a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great Catherine favored . 
`` Are you ready , Gregor ? '' 
she asked darkly . 
`` Not yet , mistress , '' I replied . 
`` I like that word , '' she said then , `` you are always to call me mistress , do you understand ? 
We leave here to-morrow morning at nine o'clock . 
As far as the district capital you will be my companion and friend , but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are my slave , my servant . 
Now close the window , and open the door . '' 
After I had done as she had demanded , and after she had entered , she asked , contracting her brows ironically , `` well , how do you like me . '' 
`` Wanda , you -- '' `` Who gave you permission ? '' 
She gave me a blow with the whip . 
`` You are very beautiful , mistress . '' 
Wanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair . 
`` Kneel down -- here beside my chair . '' 
I obeyed . 
`` Kiss my hand . '' 
I seized her small cold hand and kissed it . 
`` And the mouth -- '' In a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel woman , and covered her face , arms , and breast with glowing kisses . 
She returned them with equal fervor -- the eyelids closed as in a dream . 
It was after midnight when she left . 
At nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure , as she had ordered . 
We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a comfortable light carriage . 
The most interesting drama of my life had reached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible to foretell . 
So far everything went well . 
I sat beside Wanda , and she chatted very graciously and intelligently with me , as with a good friend , concerning Italy , Pisemski 's new novel , and Wagner 's music . 
She wore a sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short jacket of the same material , set with dark fur . 
It fitted closely and showed her figure to best advantage . 
Over it she wore dark furs . 
Her hair wound into an antique knot , lay beneath a small dark fur-hat from which a black veil hung . 
Wanda was in very good humor ; she fed me candies , played with my hair , loosened my neck cloth and made a pretty cockade of it ; she covered my knees with her furs and stealthily pressed the fingers of my hand . 
When our Jewish driver persistently went on nodding to himself , she even gave me a kiss , and her cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal rose , which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and upon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice . 
We are at the district capital . 
We get out at the railway station . 
Wanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm , and goes to secure the tickets . 
When she returns she has completely changed . 
`` Here is your ticket , Gregor , '' she says in a tone which supercilious ladies use to their servants . 
`` A third-class ticket , '' I reply with comic horror . 
`` Of course , '' she continues , `` but now be careful . 
You wo n't get on until I am settled in my compartment and do n't need you any longer . 
At each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders . 
Do n't forget . 
And now give me my furs . '' 
After I had helped her into them , humbly like a slave , she went to find an empty first-class coupe . 
I followed . 
Supporting herself on my shoulder , she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed them on the warming bottle . 
Then she nodded to me , and dismissed me . 
I slowly ascended a third-class carriage , which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed like the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades . 
I now had the leisure to muse about the riddle of human existence , and about its greatest riddle of all -- woman . 
Whenever the train stops , I jump off , run to her carriage , and with drawn cap await her orders . 
She wants coffee and then a glass of water , at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands , and thus it goes on . 
She lets several men who have entered her compartment pay court to her . 
I am dying of jealousy and have to leap about like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and not miss the train . 
In this way the night passes . 
I have n't had time to eat a mouthful and I ca n't sleep , I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish peasants , Jewish peddlers , and common soldiers . 
When I mount the steps of her coupe , she is lying stretched out on cushions in her comfortable furs , covered up with the skins of animals . 
She is like an oriental despot , and the men sit like Indian deities , straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to breathe . 
She stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping , and particularly to buy series of luxurious gowns . 
She continues to treat me as her servant . 
I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces . 
She hands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look , and laden down like a donkey I pant along behind . 
Before leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel waiters . 
I am ordered to put on her livery . 
It is a Cracovian costume in her colors , light-blue with red facings , and red quadrangular cap , ornamented with peacock-feathers . 
The costume is rather becoming to me . 
The silver buttons bear her coat of arms . 
I have the feeling of having been sold or of having bonded myself to the devil . 
My fair demon leads me from Vienna to Florence . 
Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and greasy-haired Jews , my companions now are curly-haired Contadini , a magnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers , and a poor German painter . 
The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions , but of salami and cheese . 
Night has fallen again . 
I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack ; my arms and legs seem broken . 
But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the affair . 
The stars sparkle round about , the Italian sergeant has a face like Apollo Belvedere , and the German painter sings a lovely German song . 
`` Now that all the shadows gather And endless stars grow light , Deep yearning on me falls And softly fills the night . '' 
`` Through the sea of dreams Sailing without cease , Sailing goes my soul In thine to find release . '' 
And I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal comfort among her soft furs . 
Florence ! 
Crowds , cries , importunate porters and cab-drivers . 
Wanda chooses a carriage , and dismisses the porters . 
`` What have I a servant for , '' she says , `` Gregor -- here is the ticket -- get the luggage . '' 
She wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I drag the heavy trunks hither , one after another . 
I break down for a moment under the last one ; a good-natured carabiniere with an intelligent face comes to my assistance . 
She laughs . 
`` It must be heavy , '' said she , `` all my furs are in it . '' 
I get up on the driver 's seat , wiping drops of perspiration from my brow . 
She gives the name of the hotel , and the driver urges on his horse . 
In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated entrance . 
`` Have you any rooms ? '' 
she asks the portier . 
`` Yes , madame . '' 
`` Two for me , one for my servant , all with stoves . '' 
`` Two first-class rooms for you , madame , both with stoves , '' replied the waiter who had hastily come up , `` and one without heat for your servant . '' 
She looked at them , and then abruptly said : `` they are satisfactory , have fires built at once ; my servant can sleep in the unheated room . '' 
I merely looked at her . 
`` Bring up the trunks , Gregor , '' she commands , paying no attention to my looks . 
`` In the meantime I 'll be dressing , and then will go down to the dining-room , and you can eat something for supper . '' 
As she goes into the adjoining room , I drag the trunks upstairs and help the waiter build a fire in her bed-room . 
He tries to question me in bad French about my employer . 
With a brief glance I see the blazing fire , the fragrant white poster-bed , and the rugs which cover the floor . 
Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs , and ask for something to eat . 
A good-natured waiter , who used to be in the Austrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German , shows me the dining-room and waits on me . 
I have just had the first fresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on my fork , when she enters . 
I rise . 
`` What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my servant is eating , '' she snaps at the waiter , flaring with anger . 
She turns around and leaves . 
Meanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating . 
Later I climb the four flights upstairs to my room . 
My small trunk is already there , and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning . 
It is a narrow room without fire-place , without a window , but with a small air-hole . 
If it were n't so beastly cold , it would remind me of one of the Venetian piombi . 
-LSB- Footnote : These were notorious prisons under the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges . -RSB- 
Involuntarily I have to laugh out aloud , so that it re-echoes , and I am startled by my own laughter . 
Suddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical Italian gesture calls `` You are to come down to madame , at once . '' 
I pick up my cap , stumble down the first few steps , but finally arrive in front of her door on the first floor and knock . 
`` Come in ! '' 
I enter , shut the door , and stand attention . 
Wanda has made herself comfortable . 
She is sitting in a neglige of white muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a footstool that matches . 
She has thrown her fur-cloak about her . 
It is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time , as goddess of love . 
The yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections , their reflections in the large mirrors , and the red flames from the open fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet , the dark-brown sable of the cloak , the smooth white skin , and the red , flaming hair of the beautiful woman . 
Her clear , but cold face is turned toward me , and her cold green eyes rest upon me . 
`` I am satisfied with you , Gregor , '' she began . 
I bowed . 
`` Come closer . '' 
I obeyed . 
`` Still closer , '' she looked down , and stroked the sable with her hand . 
`` Venus in Furs receives her slave . 
I can see that you are more than an ordinary dreamer , you do n't remain far in arrears of your dreams ; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into effect , no matter how mad they are . 
I confess , I like this ; it impresses me . 
There is strength in this , and strength is the only thing one respects . 
I actually believe that under unusual circumstances , in a period of great deeds , what seems to be your weakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power . 
Under the early emperors you would have been a martyr , at the time of the Reformation an anabaptist , during the French Revolution one of those inspired Girondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their lips . 
But you are my slave , my -- '' She suddenly leaped up ; the furs slipped down , and she threw her arms with soft pressure about my neck . 
`` My beloved slave , Severin , oh , how I love you , how I adore you , how handsome you are in your Cracovian costume ! 
You will be cold to-night up in your wretched room without a fire . 
Shall I give you one of my furs , dear heart , the large one there -- '' She quickly picked it up , throwing it over my shoulders , and before I knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it . 
`` How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face , they bring out your noble lines . 
As soon as you cease being my slave , you must wear a velvet coat with sable , do you understand ? 
Otherwise I shall never put on my fur-jacket again . '' 
And again she began to caress me and kiss me ; finally she drew me down on the little divan . 
`` You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs , '' she said . 
`` Quick , quick , give them to me , or I will lose all sense of dignity . '' 
I placed the furs about her , and Wanda slipped her right arm into the sleeve . 
`` This is the pose in Titian 's picture . 
But now enough of joking . 
Do n't always look so solemn , it makes me feel sad . 
As far as the world is concerned you are still merely my servant ; you are not yet my slave , for you have not yet signed the contract . 
You are still free , and can leave me any moment . 
You have played your part magnificently . 
I have been delighted , but are n't you tired of it already , and do n't you think I am abominable ? 
Well , say something -- I command it . '' 
`` Must I confess to you , Wanda ? '' 
I began . 
`` Yes , you must . '' 
`` Even it you take advantage of it , '' I continued , `` I shall love you the more deeply , adore you the more fanatically , the worse you treat me . 
What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my senses . '' 
I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her moist lips . 
`` Oh , you beautiful woman , '' I then exclaimed , looking at her . 
In my enthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth against her neck . 
`` You love me even when I am cruel , '' said Wanda , `` now go ! 
-- you bore me -- do n't you hear ? '' 
She boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears . 
`` Help me into my furs , slave . '' 
I helped her , as well as I could . 
`` How awkward , '' she exclaimed , and was scarcely in it before she struck me in the face again . 
I felt myself growing pale . 
`` Did I hurt you ? '' 
she asked , softly touching me with her hand . 
`` No , no , '' I exclaimed . 
`` At any rate you have no reason to complain , you want it thus ; now kiss me again . '' 
I threw my arms about her , and her lips clung closely to mine . 
As she lay against my breast in her large heavy furs , I had a curiously oppressive sensation . 
It was as if a wild beast , a she-bear , were embracing me . 
It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my flesh . 
But this time the she-bear let me off easily . 
With my heart filled with smiling hopes , I went up to my miserable servant 's room , and threw myself down on my hard couch . 
`` Life is really amazingly droll , '' I thought . 
`` A short time ago the most beautiful woman , Venus herself , rested against your breast , and now you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell . 
Unlike us , they do n't hurl the damned into flames , but they have devils chasing them out into fields of ice . 
`` Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated rooms . '' 
During the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream . 
I had been dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way ; I had been looking in vain for a way out . 
Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a sleigh harnessed with reindeer ; he had the face of the waiter who had shown me to the unheated room . 
`` What are you looking for here , my dear sir ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This is the North Pole . '' 
A moment later he had disappeared , and Wanda flew over the smooth ice on tiny skates . 
Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled ; the ermine of her jacket and cap , but especially her face , gleamed whiter than the snow . 
She shot toward me , inclosed me in her arms , and began to kiss me . 
Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side . 
`` What are you doing ? '' 
I asked horror-stricken . 
She laughed , and as I looked at her now , it was no longer Wanda , but a huge , white she-bear , who was digging her paws into my body . 
I cried out in despair , and still heard her diabolical laughter when I awoke , and looked about the room in surprise . 
Early in the morning I stood at Wanda 's door , and the waiter brought the coffee . 
I took it from him , and served it to my beautiful mistress .
