I think it is good that such remarkable things as these , which may never have been heard of or seen before , should come to the attention of many people instead of being buried away in the tomb of oblivion . 
Because it might turn out that someone who reads about them will like what he reads , and even people who only glance lightly through this book may be entertained . 
Pliny says along these lines that there is no book -- no matter how bad it is -- that does n't have something good in it . 
And this is all the more true since all tastes are not the same : what one man wo n't even touch , another will be dying to get . 
And so there are things that some people do n't care for , while others do . 
The point is that nothing should be destroyed or thrown away unless it is really detestable ; instead , it should be shown to everybody , especially if it wo n't do any harm and they might get some good out of it . 
If this were n't so , there would be very few people who would write for only one reader , because writing is hardly a simple thing to do . 
But since writers go ahead with it , they want to be rewarded , not with money but with people seeing and reading their works , and if there is something worthwhile in them , they would like some praise . 
Along these lines too , Cicero says : `` Honor promotes the arts . '' 
Does anyone think that the first soldier to stand up and charge the enemy hates life ? 
Of course not ; a craving for glory is what makes him expose himself to danger . 
And the same is true in arts and letters . 
The young preacher gives a very good sermon and is really interested in the improvement of people 's souls , but ask his grace if he minds when they tell him , `` Oh , what an excellent sermon you gave today , Reverend ! '' 
And So-and-so was terrible in jousting today , but when some rascal praised him for the way he had handled his weapons , he gave him his armor . 
What would he have done if it had really been true ? 
And so everything goes : I confess that I 'm no more saintly than my neighbors , but I would not mind it at all if those people who find some pleasure in this little trifle of mine -LRB- written in my crude style -RRB- would get wrapped up in it and be entertained by it , and if they could see that a man who has had so much bad luck and so many misfortunes and troubles does exist . 
Please take this poor effort from a person who would have liked to make it richer if only his ability had been as great as his desire . 
And since you told me that you wanted me to write down all the details of the matter , I have decided not to start out in the middle but at the beginning . 
That way you will have a complete picture of me , and at the same time those people who received a large inheritance will see how little they had to do with it , since fortune favored them , and they will also see how much more those people accomplished whose luck was going against them , since they rowed hard and well and brought their ship safely into port . 
You should know first of all that I 'm called Lazaro of Tormes , and that I 'm the son of Tome Gonzales and Antona Perez , who were born in Tejares , a village near Salamanca . 
I was actually born in the Tormes River , and that 's how I got my name . 
It happened this way : My father -LRB- God rest his soul -RRB- was in charge of a mill on the bank of that river , and he was the miller there for more than fifteen years . 
Well , one night while my mother was in the mill , carrying me around in her belly , she went into labor and gave birth to me right there . 
So I can really say I was born in the river . 
Then when I was eight years old , they accused my father of gutting the sacks that people were bringing to the mill . 
They took him to jail , and without a word of protest he went ahead and confessed everything , and he suffered persecution for righteousness ' sake . 
But I trust God that he 's in heaven because the Bible calls that kind of man blessed . 
At that time they were getting together an expedition to go fight the Moors , and my father went with them . 
They had exiled him because of the bad luck that I 've already told about , so he went along as a muleteer for one of the men , and like a loyal servant , he ended his life with his master . 
My widowed mother , finding herself without a husband or anyone to take care of her , decided to lie at the side -- I mean , stay on the side -- of good men and be like them . 
So she came to the city to live . 
She rented a little house and began to cook for some students . 
She washed clothes for some stableboys who served the Commander of La Magdalena , too , so a lot of the time she was around the stables . 
She and a dark man -- one of those men who took care of the animals -- got to know each other . 
Sometimes he would come to our house and would n't leave till the next morning ; and other times he would come to our door in the daytime pretending that he wanted to buy eggs , and then he would come inside . 
When he first began to come I did n't like him , he scared me because of the color of his skin and the way he looked . 
But when I saw that with him around there the food got better , I began to like him quite a lot . 
He always brought bread and pieces of meat , and in the winter he brought in firewood so we could keep warm . 
So with his visits and the relationship going right along , it happened that my mother gave me a pretty little black baby , and I used to bounce it on my knee and help keep it warm . 
I remember one time when my black stepfather was playing with the little fellow , the child noticed that my mother and I were white but that my stepfather was n't and he got scared . 
He ran to my mother and pointed his finger at him and said , `` Mama , it 's the bogeyman ! '' 
And my stepfather laughed : `` You little son-of-a-bitch ! '' 
Even though I was still a young boy , I thought about the word my little brother had used , and I said to myself : How many people there must be in the world who run away from others when they do n't see themselves . 
As luck would have it , talk about Zaide -LRB- that was my stepfather 's name -RRB- reached the ears of the foreman , and when a search was made they found out that he 'd been stealing about half of the barley that was supposed to be given to the animals . 
He 'd pretended that the bran , wool , currycombs , aprons , and the horse covers and blankets had been lost ; and when there was nothing else left to steal , he took the shoes right off the horses ' hooves . 
And he was using all this to buy things for my mother so that she could bring up my little brother . 
Why should we be surprised at priests when they steal from the poor or at friars when they take things from their monasteries to give to their lady followers , or for other things , when we see how love can make a poor slave do what he did ? 
And they found him guilty of everything I 've said and more because they asked me questions and threatened me too , and I answered them like a child . 
I was so frightened that I told them everything I knew -- even about some horseshoes my mother had made me sell to a blacksmith . 
They beat and tarred my poor stepfather , and they gave my mother a stiff sentence besides the usual hundred lashes : they said that she could n't go into the house of the Commander -LRB- the one I mentioned -RRB- and that she could n't take poor Zaide into her own house . 
So that matters would n't get any worse , the poor woman went ahead and carried out the sentence . 
And to avoid any danger and get away from wagging tongues , she went to work as a servant for the people who were living at the Solano Inn then . 
And there , while putting up with all kinds of indignities , she managed to raise my little brother until he knew how to walk . 
And she even raised me to be a good little boy who would take wine and candles to the guests and do whatever else they told me . 
About this time a blind man came by and stayed at the inn . 
He thought I would be a good guide for him , so he asked my mother if I could serve him , and she said I could . 
She told him what a good man my father had been and how he 'd died in the battle of Gelves for the holy faith . 
She said she trusted God that I would n't turn out any worse a man than my father , and she begged him to be good to me and look after me , since I would be an orphan now . 
He told her he would and said that I would n't be a servant to him , but a son . 
And so I began to serve and guide my new old master . 
After he had been in Salamanca a few days , my master was n't happy with the amount of money he was taking in , and he decided to go somewhere else . 
So when we were ready to leave , I went to see my mother . 
And with both of us crying she gave me her blessing and said , `` Son , I know that I 'll never see you again . 
Try to be good , and may God be your guide . 
I 've raised you and given you to a good master ; take good care of yourself . '' 
And then I went back out to my master who was waiting for me . 
We left Salamanca and we came to a bridge ; and at the edge of this bridge there 's a stone statue of an animal that looks something like a bull . 
The blind man told me to go up next to the animal , and when I was there he said , `` Lazaro , put your ear up next to this bull and you 'll hear a great sound inside of it . '' 
I put my ear next to it very simply , thinking he was telling the truth . 
And when he felt my head near the statue , he doubled up his fist and knocked my head into that devil of a bull so hard that I felt the pain from its horns for three days . 
And he said to me , `` You fool , now learn that a blind man 's servant has to be one step ahead of the devil . '' 
And he laughed out loud at his joke . 
It seemed to me that at that very instant I woke up from my childlike simplicity and I said to myself , `` He 's right . 
I 've got to open my eyes and be on my guard . 
I 'm alone now , and I 've got to think about taking care of myself . '' 
We started on our way again , and in just a few days he taught me the slang thieves use . 
When he saw what a quick mind I had he was really happy , and he said , `` I ca n't give you any gold or silver , but I can give you plenty of hints on how to stay alive . '' 
And that 's exactly what he did ; after God , it was this fellow who gave me life and who , although he was blind , enlightened me and showed me how to live . 
I like to tell you these silly things to show what virtue there is in men being able to raise themselves up from the depths , and what a vice it is for them to let themselves slip down from high stations . 
Well , getting back to my dear blind man and telling about his ways , you should know that from the time God created the world there 's no one He made smarter or sharper than that man . 
At his job he was sly as a fox . 
He knew over a hundred prayers by heart . 
He would use a low tone , calm and very sonorous , that would make the church where he was praying echo . 
And whenever he prayed , he would put on a humble and pious expression -- something he did very well . 
And he would n't make faces or grimaces with his mouth or eyes the way others do . 
Besides this he had thousands of other ways of getting money . 
He told everyone that he knew prayers for lots of different things : for women who could n't have children or who were in labor ; for those women who were n't happy in their marriage -- so that their husbands would love them more . 
He would give predictions to expectant mothers about whether they would have a boy or a girl . 
And as far as medicine was concerned , he said that Galen never knew the half of what he did about toothaches , fainting spells , and female illnesses . 
In fact , there was no one who would tell him they were sick that he could n't immediately say to them : `` Do this , and then is ; take this herb , or take that root . '' 
And so everyone came to him -- especially women -- and they believed everything he told them . 
He got a lot out of them with these ways I 've been telling about ; in fact , he earned more in a month than a hundred ordinary blind men earn in a year . 
But I want you to know , too , that even with all he got and all that he had , I 've never seen a more greedy , miserly man . 
He was starving me to death . 
He did n't even give me enough to keep me alive ! 
I 'm telling the truth : If I had n't known how to help myself with my wily ways and some pretty clever tricks , I would have died of hunger lots of times . 
But with all his know-how and carefulness I outwitted him , so that I always -- or usually -- really got the better of him . 
The way I did this was I played some devilish tricks on him , and I 'll tell about some of them , even though I did n't come out on top every time . 
He carried the bread and all the other things in a cloth bag , and he kept the neck of it closed with an iron ring that had a padlock and key . 
And when he put things in or took them out , he did it so carefully and counted everything so well that no one in the world could have gotten a crumb from him . 
So I 'd take what little he gave me , and in less than two mouthfuls it would be gone . 
After he had closed the lock and forgotten about it , thinking that I was busy with other things , I would begin to bleed the miserly bag dry . 
There was a little seam on the side of the bag that I 'd rip open and sew up again . 
And I would take out bread -- not little crumbs , either , but big hunks -- and I 'd get bacon and sausage too . 
And so I was always looking for the right time to score , not on a ball field , but on the food in that blasted bag that the tyrant of a blind man kept away from me . 
And then , every time I had a chance I 'd steal half copper coins . 
And when someone gave him a copper to say a prayer for them -- and since he could n't see -- they 'd no sooner have offered it than I would pop it into my mouth and have a half-copper ready . 
And as soon as he stuck out his hand , there was my coin reduced to half price . 
Then the old blind man would start growling at me . 
As soon as he felt it and realized that it was n't a whole copper he 'd say , `` How the devil is it that now that you 're with me they never give me anything but half coppers , when they almost always used to give me a copper or a two-copper piece ? 
I 'd swear that this is all your fault . '' 
He used to cut his prayers short , too ; he would n't even get halfway through them . 
He told me to pull on the end of his cloak whenever the person who asked for the prayer had gone . 
So that 's what I did . 
Then he 'd begin to call out again with his cry , `` Who would like to have me say a prayer for him ? '' 
in his usual way . 
And he always put a little jug of wine next to him when we ate . 
I would grab it quickly and give it a couple of quiet kisses before I put it back in its place . 
But that did n't go on for very long : he could tell by the number of nips he took that some was missing . 
So to keep his wine safe he never let the jug out of reach ; he 'd always hold on to the handle . 
But not even a magnet could attract the way I could with a long rye straw that I had made for that very purpose . 
And I 'd stick it in the mouth of the jug and suck until -- good-bye , wine ! 
But the old traitor was so wary that I think he must have sensed me , because from then on he stopped that and put the jug between his legs . 
And even then he kept his hand over the top to make sure . 
But I got so used to drinking wine that I was dying for it . 
And when I saw that my straw trick would n't work , I decided to make a spout by carving a little hole in the bottom of the jug and then sealing it off neatly with a little thin strip of wax . 
When it was mealtime , I 'd pretend I was cold and get in between the legs of the miserable blind man to warm up by the little fire we had . 
And the heat of it would melt the wax , since it was such a tiny piece . 
Then the wine would begin to trickle from the spout into my mouth , and I got into a position so that I would n't miss a blasted drop . 
When the poor fellow went to drink he would n't find a thing . 
He 'd draw back , astonished , then he 'd curse and damn the jar and the wine , not knowing what could have happened . 
`` You ca n't say that I drank it , Sir , '' I said , `` since you never let it out of your hand . '' 
But he kept turning the jug around and feeling it , until he finally discovered the hole and saw through my trick . 
But he pretended that he had n't found out . 
Then one day I was tippling on my jug as usual , without realizing what was in store for me or even that the blind man had found me out . 
I was sitting the same as always , taking in those sweet sips , my face turned toward the sky and my eyes slightly closed so I could really savor the delicious liquor . 
The dirty blind man saw that now was the time to take out his revenge on me , and he raised that sweet and bitter jug with both his hands and smashed it down on my mouth with all his might . 
As I say , he used all his strength , and poor Lazaro had n't been expecting anything like this ; in fact , I was drowsy and happy as always . 
So it seemed like the sky and everything in it had really fallen down on top of me . 
The little tap sent me reeling and knocked me unconscious , and that enormous jug was so huge that pieces of it stuck in my face , cutting me in several places and knocking out my teeth , so that I do n't have them to this very day . 
From that minute I began to hate that old blind man . 
Because , even though he took care of me and treated me all right and fixed me up , I saw that he had really enjoyed his dirty trick . 
He used wine to wash the places where the pieces of the jug had cut me , and he smiled and said , `` How about that , Lazaro ? 
The very thing that hurt you is helping to cure you . '' 
And he made other witty remarks that I did n't particularly care for . 
When I had about recovered from the beating and the black and blue marks were nearly gone , I realized that with a few more blows like that the blind man would have gotten rid of me . 
So I decided to be rid of him . 
But I did n't run away right then ; I waited until I could do it in a safer and better way . 
And although I wanted to be kind and forgive the blind man for hitting me with the jug , I could n't because of the harsh treatment he gave me from then on . 
Without any reason he would hit me on the head and yank on my hair . 
And if anyone asked him why he beat me so much , he would tell them about the incident with the jug : `` Do you think this boy of mine is just some innocent little fellow ? 
Well , listen and see if you think the devil himself would try anything like this . '' 
After they 'd heard about it , they would cross themselves and say , `` Well -- who would ever think that such a little boy would do anything like that ! '' 
Then they 'd laugh at the prank and tell him , `` Go on , beat him . 
God will give you your reward . '' 
And this advice he followed to the letter . 
So , for revenge , I 'd lead him down all the worst roads on purpose to see if he would n't get hurt somehow . 
If there were rocks , I 'd take him right over them ; if there was mud , I 'd lead him through the deepest part . 
Because even though I did n't keep dry myself , I would have given an eye if I could have hurt two eyes of that man who did n't even have one . 
Because of this , he was always beating me with the end of his cane so that my head was full of bumps , and with him always pulling on my hair a lot of it was gone . 
I told him I was n't doing it on purpose and that I just could n't find any better roads , but that did n't do any good . 
The old traitor saw through everything and was so wary that he would n't believe me any more . 
So that you can see how smart this shrewd blind man was , I 'll tell you about one of the many times when I was with him that he really seemed to show a lot of perception . 
When we left Salamanca , his plan was to go to Toledo because the people were supposed to be richer there , although not very free with their money . 
But he pinned his hopes on this saying : `` You 'll get more water from a narrow flowing stream than you will from a deep dry well . '' 
And we 'd pass through the best places as we went along . 
Where we were welcomed and were able to get something , we stayed ; where this did n't happen , we 'd move on after a few days . 
And it happened that as we were coming to a place called Almorox when they were gathering the grapes , a grape picker gave him a bunch as alms . 
And since the baskets are usually handled pretty roughly and the grapes were very ripe at the time , the bunch started to fall apart in his hand . 
If we had thrown it in the sack , it and everything it touched would have spoiled . 
He decided that we 'd have a picnic so that it would n't go to waste -- and he did it to please me , too , since he 'd kicked and beat me quite a bit that day . 
So we sat down on a low wall , and he said : `` Now I want to be generous with you : we 'll share this bunch of grapes , and you can eat as many as I do . 
We 'll divide it like this : you take one , then I 'll take one . 
But you have to promise me that you wo n't take more than one at a time . 
I 'll do the same until we finish , and that way there wo n't be any cheating . '' 
The agreement was made , and we began . 
But on his second turn , the traitor changed his mind and began to take two at a time , evidently thinking that I was doing the same . 
But when I saw that he had broken our agreement , I was n't satisfied with going at his rate of speed . 
Instead , I went even further : I took two at a time , or three at a time -- in fact , I ate them as fast as I could . 
And when there were n't any grapes left , he just sat there for a while with the stem in his hand , and then he shook his head and said , `` Lazaro , you tricked me . 
I 'll swear to God that you ate these grapes three at a time . '' 
`` No , I did n't , '' I said . 
`` But why do you think so ? '' 
That wise old blind man answered , `` Do you know how I see that you ate them three at a time ? 
Because I was eating them two at a time , and you did n't say a word . '' 
I laughed to myself , and even though I was only a boy , I was very much aware of the sharpness of that blind man . 
But , so that I wo n't talk too much , I wo n't tell about a lot of humorous and interesting things that happened to me with my first master . 
I just want to tell about how we separated , and be done with him . 
We were in Escalona , a town owned by the duke of that name , at an inn , and the blind man gave me a piece of sausage to roast for him . 
When the sausage had been basted and he had sopped up and eaten the drippings with a piece of bread , he took a coin out of his purse and told me to go get him some wine from the tavern . 
Then the devil put an idea in my head , just like they say he does to thieves . 
It so happened that near the fire there was a little turnip , kind of long and beat up ; it had probably been thrown there because it was n't good enough for stew . 
At that moment he and I were there all alone , and when I whiffed the delicious odor of the sausage , I suddenly got a huge appetite -- and I knew that all I would get of it would be the smell . 
But the thought of eating that sausage made me lose all my fear : I did n't think for a minute what would happen to me . 
So while the blind man was getting the money out of his purse , I took the sausage off the spit and quickly put the turnip on . 
Then the blind man gave me the money for the wine and took hold of the spit , turning it over the fire , trying to cook the very thing that had n't been cooked before because it was so bad . 
I went for the wine , and on the way I downed the sausage . 
When I came back I found that sinner of a blind man holding the turnip between two slices of bread . 
He did n't know what it was yet , because he had n't felt of it . 
But when he took the bread and bit into it , thinking he would get part of the sausage too , he was suddenly stopped cold by the taste of the cold turnip . 
He got mad then , and said , `` What is this , Lazarillo ? '' 
`` You mean , ` Lacerated , ' '' I said . 
`` Are you trying to pin something on me ? 
Did n't I just come back from getting the wine ? 
Someone must have been here and played a joke on you . '' 
`` Oh , no , '' he said . 
`` I have n't let the spit out of my hand . 
No one could have done that . '' 
I kept swearing that I had n't done any switching around . 
But it did n't do me any good -- I could n't hide anything from the sharpness of that miserable blind man . 
He got up and grabbed me by the head and got close so he could smell me . 
And he must have smelled my breath like a good hound . 
Really being anxious to find out if he was right , he held on tight and opened my mouth wider than he should have . 
Then , not very wisely , he stuck in his nose . 
And it was long and sharp . 
And his anger had made it swell a bit , so that the point of it hit me in the throat . 
So with all this and my being really frightened , along with the fact that the black sausage had n't had time to settle in my stomach , and especially with the sudden poking in of his very large nose , half choking me -- all these things went together and made the crime and the snack show themselves , and the owner got back what belonged to him . 
What happened was that before the blind man could take his beak out of my mouth , my stomach got so upset that it hit his nose with what I had stolen . 
So his nose and the black , half-chewed sausage both left my mouth at the same time . 
Oh , Almighty God ! 
I was wishing I 'd been buried at that very moment , because I was already dead . 
The perverse blind man was so mad that if people had n't come at the noise , I think he would have killed me . 
They pulled me out of his hands , and he was left with what few hairs had still been in my head . 
My face was all scratched up , and my neck and throat were clawed . 
But my throat really deserved its rough treatment because it was only on account of what it had done that I 'd been beaten . 
Then that rotten blind man told everyone there about the things I 'd done , and he told them over and over about the jug and the grapes and this last incident . 
They laughed so hard that all the people who were going by in the street came in to see the fun . 
But the blind man told them about my tricks with such wit and cleverness that , even though I was hurt and crying , I felt that it would have been wrong for me not to laugh too . 
And while this was going on I suddenly remembered that I 'd been negligent and cowardly , and I began to swear at myself : I should have bitten off his nose . 
I 'd had the opportunity to do it ; in fact , half of the work had already been done for me . 
If only I 'd clamped down with my teeth , I 'd have had it trapped . 
Even though it belonged to that skunk , my stomach would probably have held it better than it held the sausage ; and since there would n't have been any evidence , I could have denied the crime . 
I wish to God I 'd have done it . 
It would n't have been a bad idea at all ! 
The lady running the inn and the others there made us stop our fighting , and they washed my face and throat with the wine I 'd brought for him to drink . 
Then the dirty blind man made up jokes about it , saying things like : `` The truth of the matter is I use more wine washing this boy in one year than I drink in two . '' 
And : `` At least , Lazaro , you owe more to wine than you do to your father -- he only gave you life once , but wine has brought you to life a thousand times . '' 
Then he told about all the times he 'd beaten me and scratched my face and then doctored me up with wine . 
`` I tell you , '' he said , `` if there 's one man in the world who will be blessed by wine , it 's you . '' 
And the people who were washing me laughed out loud , while I was swearing . 
But the blind man 's prophecy was n't wrong , and since then I 've often thought about that man who must have had a gift for telling the future . 
And I feel sorry about the bad things I did to him , although I really paid him back , since what he told me that day happened just like he said it would , as you 'll see later on . 
Because of this and the dirty tricks the blind man played on me , I decided to leave him for good . 
And since I had thought about it and really had my mind set on it , this last trick of his only made me more determined . 
So the next day we went into town to beg . 
It had rained quite a bit the night before , and since it was still raining that day , he went around praying under the arcades in the town so we would n't get wet . 
But with night coming on and there still being no let up , the blind man said to me , `` Lazaro , this rain is n't going to stop , and the later it gets the harder it 's coming down . 
Let 's go inside the inn before there 's a real downpour . '' 
To get there we had to cross over a ditch that was full of water from the rain . 
And I said to him ; `` Sir , the water 's too wide to cross here , but if you 'd like , I see an easier place to get across , and we wo n't get wet either . 
It 's very narrow there , and if we jump we 'll keep our feet dry . '' 
That seemed like a good idea to him , and he said , `` You 're pretty clever . 
That 's why I like you so much . 
Take me to the place where the ditch is narrow . 
It 's winter now , and I do n't care for water any time , and especially not when I get my feet wet . '' 
Seeing that the time was ripe , I led him under the arcades , to a spot right in front of a sort of pillar or stone post that was in the plaza -- one of those that hold up the overhanging arches of the houses . 
And I said to him , `` Sir , this is the narrowest place along the whole ditch . '' 
It was really raining hard and the poor man was getting wet . 
This , along with the fact that we were in a hurry to get out of the water that was pouring down on us -- and especially because God clouded his mind so I could get revenge -- made him believe me , and he said , `` Point me in the right direction , and you jump over the water . '' 
I put him right in front of the pillar . 
Then I jumped and got behind the post like someone waiting for a bull to charge , and I said to him , `` Come on , jump as far as you can so you 'll miss the water . '' 
As soon as I 'd said that , the poor blind man charged like an old goat . 
First he took one step back to get a running start , and then he hurled himself forward with all his might . 
His head hit the post with a hollow sound like a pumpkin . 
Then he fell over backward , half dead , with his head split open . 
`` What ? 
You mean to say you smelled the sausage but not the post ? 
Smell it , smell it ! '' 
I said , and I left him in the hands of all the people who had run to help him . 
I reached the village gate on the run , and before night fell I made it to Torrijos . 
I did n't know what God had done with him , and I never made any attempt to find out . 
Happened to Him with That Man I did n't feel very safe in that town , so the next day I went to a place named Maqueda . 
There I met up with a priest -LRB- it must have been because of all my sins -RRB- . 
I started to beg from him , and he asked me if I knew how to assist at mass . 
I told him I did , and it was the truth : even though that sinner of a blind man beat me , he 'd taught me all kinds of good things , too , and this was one of them . 
So the priest took me in , and I was out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
Because even though the blind man was the very picture of greed , as I 've said , he was an Alexander the Great compared to this fellow . 
I wo n't say any more , except that all the miserliness in the world was in this man . 
I do n't know if he 'd been born that way , or if it came along with his priest 's frock . 
He had an old chest that he kept locked , and he kept the key tied to his cassock with a leather cord . 
When the holy bread was brought from church , he 'd throw it in the chest and lock it up again . 
And there was n't a thing to eat in the whole place , the way there is in most houses : a bit of bacon hanging from the chimney , some cheese lying on the table or in the cupboard , a basket with some slices of bread left over from dinner . 
It seemed to me that even if I had n't eaten any of it , I would have felt a lot better just being able to look at it . 
The only thing around was a string of onions , and that was kept locked in a room upstairs . 
I was rationed out one onion every four days . 
And if anyone else was around when I asked him for the key to get it , he 'd reach into his breast pocket and untie the key with great airs , and he 'd hand it to me and say , `` Here . 
Take it , but bring it back as soon as you 're through , and do n't stuff yourself . '' 
And this as if all the oranges in Valencia were up there , while there really was n't a damned thing , as I said , besides the onions hanging from a nail . 
And he had those counted so well that if I -LRB- being the sinner that I am -RRB- had taken even one extra onion , I would really have been in for it . 
So there I was , dying of hunger . 
But if he was n't very charitable to me , he was to himself . 
A good five coppers ' worth of meat was his usual fare for supper . 
I have to admit that he did give me some of the soup , but as for the meat -- I did n't even get a whiff of it . 
All I got was a little bread : that blasted man would n't give me half of what I really needed ! 
And on Saturdays everyone around here eats head of mutton , and he sent me for one that cost six coppers . 
He cooked it and ate the eyes , the tongue , the neck , the brains and the meat in the jaws . 
Then he gave me the chewed-over bones ; he put them on a plate and said , `` Here , eat this and be happy . 
It 's a meal fit for a king . 
In fact , you 're living better than the Pope . '' 
`` May God grant you this kind of life , '' I said under my breath . 
After I had been with him for three weeks , I got so skinny that my legs would n't hold me up out of sheer hunger . 
I saw that I was heading right straight for the grave if God and my wits did n't come to my rescue . 
But there was no way I could trick him because there was n't a thing I could steal . 
And even if there had been something , I could n't blind him the way I did the other one -LRB- may he rest in peace if that blow on the head finished him off -RRB- . 
Because even though the other fellow was smart , without that valuable fifth sense he could n't tell what I was doing . 
But this new guy -- there is n't anyone whose sight was as good as his was . 
When we were passing around the offering plate , not a penny fell into the basket that he did n't have it spotted . 
He kept one eye on the people and the other on my hands . 
His eyes danced in their sockets like quicksilver . 
Every cent that was put in was ticked off in his mind . 
And as soon as the offering was over , he would take the plate away from me and put it on the altar . 
I was n't able to get a penny away from him all the time I lived with him -- or , to be more precise , all the time I died with him . 
He never sent me to the tavern for even a drop of wine : what little he brought back from the offering and put in the chest he rationed out so that it lasted him a whole week . 
And to cover up his terrible stinginess , he would say to me , `` Look , son , we priests have to be very moderate in our eating and drinking , and that 's why I do n't indulge the way other people do . '' 
But that old miser was really lying , because when we prayed at meetings or at funerals and other people were paying for the food , he ate like a wolf and drank more than any old , thirsty quack doctor . 
Speaking of funerals , God forgive me but I was never an enemy of mankind except during them . 
This was because we really ate well and I was able to gorge myself . 
I used to hope and pray that God would kill off someone every day . 
We 'd give the sacraments to the sick people , and the priest would ask everyone there to pray . 
And I was certainly not the last to begin -- especially at extreme unction . 
With all my heart and soul I prayed to God -- not that His will be done , as they say , but that He take the person from this world . 
And when one of them escaped -LRB- God forgive me -RRB- , I damned him to hell a thousand times . 
But when one died , I blessed him just as much . 
Because in all the time that I was there -- which must have been nearly six months -- only twenty people died . 
And I really think that I killed them ; I mean , they died at my request . 
Because I think that the Lord must have seen my own endless and awful dying , and He was glad to kill them so that I could live . 
But at that time I could n't find any relief for my misery . 
If I came to life on the days that we buried someone , I really felt the pangs of hunger when there was n't any funeral . 
Because I would get used to filling myself up , and then I would have to go back to my usual hunger again . 
So I could n't think of any way out except to die : I wanted death for myself sometimes just as much as for the others . 
But I never saw it , even though it was always inside of me . 
Lots of times I thought about running away from that penny - pinching master , but I did n't for two reasons . 
First , I did n't trust my legs : lack of food had made them so skinny that I was afraid they would n't hold me up . 
Second , I thought a while , and I said : `` I 've had two masters : the first one nearly starved me to death , and when I left him I met up with this one ; and he gives me so little to eat that I 've already got one foot in the grave . 
Well , if I leave this one and find a master who is one step lower , how could it possibly end except with my death ? '' 
So I did n't dare to move an inch . 
I really thought that each step would just get worse . 
And if I were to go down one more step , Lazaro would n't make another peep and no one would ever hear of him again . 
So there I was , in a terrible state -LRB- and God help any true Christian who finds himself in those circumstances -RRB- , not knowing what to do and seeing that I was going from bad to worse . 
Then one day when that miserable , tightfisted master of mine had gone out , a tinker came to my door . 
I think he must have been an angel in disguise , sent down by the hand of God . 
He asked me if there was anything I wanted fixed . 
`` You could fix me up , and you would n't be doing half bad , '' I said softly but not so he could hear me . 
But there was n't enough time so I could waste it on witty sayings and , inspired by the Holy Spirit , I said to him , `` Sir , I 've lost the key to this chest , and I 'm afraid my master will beat me . 
Please look and see if one of those keys you have will fit . 
I 'll pay you for it . '' 
The angelic tinker began to try out the keys on his chain , one after the other , and I was helping him with my feeble prayers . 
Then , when I least expected it , I saw the face of God , as they say , formed by the loaves of bread inside that chest . 
When it was all the way open I said to him , `` I do n't have any money to give you for the key , but take your payment from what 's in there . '' 
He took the loaf of bread that looked best to him , and he gave me the key and went away happy , leaving me even happier . 
But I did n't touch a thing right then so that the loss would n't be noticeable . 
And , too , when I saw that I was the Lord of all that , I did n't think my hunger would dare come near me . 
Then my miserly old master came back , and -- thank God -- he did n't notice the missing loaf of bread that the angel had carried off . 
The next day , when he left the house , I opened my breadly paradise and sank my hands and teeth into a loaf , and in a flash I made it invisible . 
And , of course , I did n't forget to lock up the chest again . 
Then I began to sweep the house very happily , thinking that from now on my sad life would change . 
And so that day and the next I was happy . 
But it was n't meant for that peace to last very long because on the third day real tertian fever struck . 
It happened that I suddenly saw that man who was starving me to death standing over our chest , moving the loaves of bread from one side to the other , counting and recounting them . 
I pretended not to notice , and silently I was praying , hoping , and begging , `` Saint John , blind him ! '' 
After he had stood there quite a while , counting the days and the loaves on his fingers , he said , `` If I were n't so careful about keeping this chest closed , I 'd swear that someone had taken some of the loaves of bread . 
But from now on , just to close the door on all suspicion , I 'm going to keep close track of them . 
There are nine and a half in there now . '' 
`` May God send you nine pieces of bad news , too , '' I said under my breath . 
It seemed to me that what he said went into my heart like a hunter 's arrow , and my stomach began to rumble when it saw that it would be going back to its old diet . 
Then he left the house . 
To console myself I opened the chest , and when I saw the bread I began to worship it -- but I was afraid to `` take any in remembrance of Him . '' 
Then I counted the loaves to see if the old miser had made a mistake , but he had counted them much better than I 'd have liked . 
The best I could do was to kiss them over and over , and as delicately as I could , I peeled a little off the half-loaf on the side where it was already cut . 
And so I got through that day but not as happily as the one before . 
But my hunger kept growing , mainly because my stomach had gotten used to more bread during those previous two or three days . 
I was dying a slow death , and finally I got to the point that when I was alone the only thing I did was open and close the chest and look at the face of God inside -LRB- or at least that 's how children put it -RRB- . 
But God Himself -- who aids the afflicted -- seeing me in such straits , put a little thought into my head that would help me . 
Thinking to myself , I said : This chest is big and old , and it 's got some holes in it , although they 're small . 
But he might be led to believe that mice are getting into it and are eating the bread . 
It would n't do to take out a whole loaf : he 'd notice that it was missing right away , since he hardly gives me any food at all to live on . 
But he 'll believe this all right . 
And I began to break off crumbs over some cheap tablecloths he had there . 
I would pick up one loaf and put another one down , so that I broke a few little pieces off of three or four of them . 
Then I ate those up just as if they were bonbons , and I felt a little better . 
But when he came home to eat and opened the chest , he saw the mess . 
And he really thought that mice had done the damage because I 'd done my job to perfection , and it looked just like the work of mice . 
He looked the chest over from top to bottom , and he saw the holes where he suspected they 'd gotten in . 
Then he called me over and said , `` Lazaro , look ! 
Look at what a terrible thing happened to our bread this evening ! '' 
And I put on a very astonished face and asked him what it could have been . 
`` What else , '' he said , `` but mice ? 
They get into everything . '' 
We began to eat , and -- thank God -- I came out all right in this , too . 
I got more bread than the miserable little bit he usually gave me because he sliced off the parts he thought the mice had chewed on , and said , `` Eat this . 
The mouse is a very clean animal . '' 
So that day , with the extra that I got by the work of my hands -- or of my fingernails , to be exact -- we finished our meal , although I never really got started . 
And then I got another shock : I saw him walking around carefully , pulling nails out of the walls and looking for little pieces of wood . 
And he used these to board up all the holes in the old chest . 
`` Oh , Lord ! '' 
I said then . 
`` What a life full of misery , trials , and bad luck we 're born into ! 
How short the pleasures of this hard life of ours are ! 
Here I was , thinking that this pitiful little cure of mine would get me through this miserable situation , and I was happy , thinking I was doing pretty well . 
Then along came my bad luck and woke up this miser of a master of mine and made him even more careful than usual -LRB- and misers are hardly ever not careful -RRB- .
