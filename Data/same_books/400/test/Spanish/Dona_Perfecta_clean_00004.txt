We are all friends here . '' 
`` Thanks . 
It is of no consequence . '' 
`` In spite of every thing , '' said Dona Perfecta , smiling with more naturalness than before , `` I shall always be the same for my dear nephew ; in spite of his extravagant and anti-religious ideas . 
In what way do you suppose I am going to spend this evening ? 
Well , in trying to make Uncle Licurgo give up those obstinate notions which would otherwise cause you annoyance . 
I sent for him , and he is waiting for me now in the hall . 
Make yourself easy , I will arrange the matter ; for although I know that he is not altogether without right on his side -- '' `` Thanks , dear aunt , '' responded the young man , his whole being invaded by a wave of the generous emotion which was so easily aroused in his soul . 
Pepe Rey looked in the direction of his cousin , intending to join her , but some wily questions of the canon retained him at Dona Perfecta 's side . 
Rosario looked dejected , and was listening with an air of melancholy indifference to the words of the little lawyer , who , having installed himself at her side , kept up a continuous stream of fulsome flatteries , seasoned with ill-timed jests and fatuous remarks in the worst possible taste . 
`` The worst of it is , '' said Dona Perfecta to her nephew -- surprising the glance which he cast in the direction of the ill-assorted pair -- `` the worst of it is , that you have offended poor Rosario . 
You must do all in your power to make your peace with her . 
The poor child is so good ! '' 
`` Oh , yes ! 
so good , '' added the canon , `` that I have no doubt that she will forgive her cousin . '' 
`` I think that Rosario has already forgiven me , '' affirmed Rey . 
`` And if not , angelic breasts do not harbor resentment long , '' said Don Inocencio mellifluously . 
`` I have a great deal of influence with the child , and I will endeavor to dissipate in her generous soul whatever prejudice may exist there against you . 
As soon as I say a word or two to her -- '' Pepe Rey felt a cloud darken his soul and he said with meaning : `` Perhaps it may not be necessary . '' 
`` I will not speak to her now , '' added the capitular , `` because she is listening entranced to Jacinto 's nonsense . 
Ah , those children ! 
When they once begin there is no stopping them . '' 
The judge of the lower court , the alcalde 's lady , and the dean of the cathedral now made their appearance . 
They all saluted the engineer , manifesting in their words and manner , on seeing him , the satisfaction of gratified curiosity . 
The judge was one of those clever and intelligent young men who every day spring into notice in official circles ; aspiring , almost before they are out of the shell , to the highest political and administrative positions . 
He gave himself airs of great importance , and in speaking of himself and of his juvenile toga , he seemed indirectly to manifest great offence because he had not been all at once made president of the supreme court . 
In such inexpert hands , in a brain thus swollen with vanity , in this incarnation of conceit , had the state placed the most delicate and the most difficult functions of human justice . 
His manners were those of a perfect courtier , and revealed a scrupulous and minute attention to all that concerned his own person . 
He had the insufferable habit of taking off and putting on every moment his gold eye-glasses , and in his conversation he manifested with frequency the strong desire which he had to be transferred to Madrid , in order that he might give his invaluable services to the Department of Grace and Justice . 
The alcalde 's lady was a good-natured woman , whose only weakness was to fancy that she had a great many acquaintances at the court . 
She asked Pepe Rey various questions about the fashions , mentioning establishments in which she had had a mantle or a skirt made on her last journey to the capital , contemporaneous with the visit of Muley-Abbas , and she also mentioned the names of a dozen duchesses and marchionesses ; speaking of them with as much familiarity as if they had been friends of her school-days . 
She said also that the Countess of M. -LRB- famous for her parties -RRB- was a friend of hers and that in '60 she had paid her a visit , when the countess had invited her to her box at the Teatro Real , where she saw Muley-Abbas in Moorish dress and accompanied by his retinue of Moors . 
The alcalde 's wife talked incessantly and was not wanting in humor . 
The dean was a very old man , corpulent and red-faced , plethoric and apoplectic looking , a man so obese that he seemed bursting out of his skin . 
He had belonged to one of the suppressed religious orders ; he talked only of religious matters ; and from the very first manifested the most profound contempt for Pepe Rey . 
The latter appeared every moment more unable to accommodate himself to a society so little to his taste . 
His disposition -- not at all malleable , hard , and very little flexible -- rejected the duplicities and the compromises of language to simulate concord when it did not exist . 
He remained , then , very grave during the whole of the tiresome evening , obliged as he was to endure the oratorical vehemence of the alcalde 's wife , who , without being Fame , had the privilege of fatiguing with a hundred tongues the ears of men . 
If , in some brief respite which this lady gave her hearers , Pepe Rey made an attempt to approach his cousin , the Penitentiary attached himself to him instantly , like the mollusk to the rock ; taking him apart with a mysterious air to propose to him an excursion with Senor Don Cayetano to Mundogrande , or a fishing party on the clear waters of the Nahara . 
At last the evening came to an end , as every thing does in this world . 
The dean retired , leaving the house , as it seemed , empty , and very soon there remained of the alcalde 's wife only an echo , like the buzz which remains in the air after a storm has passed away . 
The judge also deprived the company of his presence , and at last Don Inocencio gave his nephew the signal for departure . 
`` Come , boy , come ; for it is late , '' he said , smiling . 
`` How you have tormented poor Rosarito , has he not , child ? 
Home , you rogue , home , without delay . '' 
`` It is time to go to bed , '' said Dona Perfecta . 
`` Time to go to work , '' responded the little lawyer . 
`` I am always telling him that he ought to get through with his business in the day-time , but he will not mind me . '' 
`` There is so much , so very much business to be got through . '' 
`` No , say rather , that confounded work which you have undertaken . 
He does not wish to say it , Senor Don Jose , but the truth is that he is writing a book on ` The Influence of Woman in Christian Society , ' and , in addition to that , ' A Glance at the Catholic Movement in ' -- somewhere or other . 
What do you know about glances or influences ? 
But these youths of the present day have audacity enough for any thing . 
Oh , what boys ! 
Well , let us go home . 
Good-night , Senora Dona Perfecta -- good-night , Senor Don Jose -- Rosarito . '' 
`` I will wait for Senor Don Cayetano , '' said Jacinto , `` to ask him to give me the Augusto Nicolas . '' 
`` Always carrying books . 
Why , sometimes you come into the house laden like a donkey . 
Very well , then , let us wait . '' 
`` Senor Don Jacinto does not write hastily , '' said Pepe Rey ; `` he prepares himself well for his work , so that his books may be treasures of learning . '' 
`` But that boy will injure his brain , '' objected Dona Perfecta . 
`` For Heaven 's sake be careful ! 
I would set a limit to his reading . '' 
`` Since we are going to wait , '' said the little doctor , in a tone of insufferable conceit , `` I will take with me also the third volume of Concilios . 
What do you think , uncle ? '' 
`` Take that , of course . 
It would never do to leave that behind you . '' 
Fortunately Senor Don Cayetano -LRB- who generally spent his evenings at the house of Don Lorenzo Ruiz -RRB- soon arrived , and the books being received , uncle and nephew left the house . 
Rey read in his cousin 's sad countenance a keen desire to speak to him . 
He approached her while Dona Perfecta and Don Cayetano were discussing some domestic matter apart . 
`` You have offended mamma , '' said Rosarito . 
Her features expressed something like terror . 
`` It is true , '' responded the young man ; `` I have offended your mamma -- I have offended you . '' 
`` No , not me . 
I already imagined that the Infant Jesus ought not to wear trousers . '' 
`` But I hope that you will both forgive me . 
Your mamma was so kind to me a little while ago . '' 
Dona Perfecta 's voice suddenly vibrated through the dining-room , with so discordant a tone that her nephew started as if he had heard a cry of alarm . 
The voice said imperiously : `` Rosario , go to bed ! '' 
Startled , her mind filled with anxious fears , the girl lingered in the room , going here and there as if she was looking for something . 
As she passed her cousin she whispered softly and cautiously these words : `` Mamma is angry . '' 
`` But -- '' `` She is angry -- be on your guard , be on your guard . '' 
Then she left the room . 
Her mother , for whom Uncle Licurgo was waiting , followed her , and for some time the voices of Dona Perfecta and the countryman were heard mingled together in familiar conference . 
Pepe was left with Don Cayetano , who , taking a light , said ; `` Good-night , Pepe . 
But do n't suppose that I am going to sleep , I am going to work . 
But why are you so thoughtful ? 
What is the matter with you ? 
-- Just as I say , to work . 
I am making notes for a ` Memorial Discourse on the Genealogies of Orbajosa . ' 
I have already found data and information of the utmost value . 
There can be no dispute about it . 
In every period of our history the Orbajosans have been distinguished for their delicate sense of honor , their chivalry , their valor , their intellectuality . 
The conquest of Mexico , the wars of the Emperor , the wars of Philip against the heretics , testify to this . 
But are you ill ? 
What is the matter with you ? 
As I say , eminent theologians , valiant warriors , conquerors , saints , bishops , statesmen -- all sorts of illustrious men -- have flourished in this humble land of the garlic . 
No , there is not in Christendom a more illustrious city than ours . 
Its virtues and its glories are in themselves enough and more than enough to fill all the pages of our country 's history . 
Well , I see that it is sleepy you are -- good-night . 
As I say , I would not exchange the glory of being a son of this noble city for all the gold in the world . 
Augusta , the ancients called it ; Augustissima , I call it now ; for now , as then , high-mindedness , generosity , valor , magnanimity , are the patrimony of all . 
Well , good-night , dear Pepe . 
But I fancy you are not well . 
Has the supper disagreed with you ? 
-- Alonzo Gonzalez de Bustamante was right when he said in his ` Floresta Amena ' that the people of Orbajosa suffice in themselves to confer greatness and honor on a kingdom . 
Do n't you think so ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , senor ; undoubtedly , '' responded Pepe Rey , going abruptly toward his room . 
During the following days Pepe Rey made the acquaintance of several of the people of the place ; he visited the Casino , and formed friendships with some of the individuals who spend their lives in the rooms of that corporation . 
But the youth of Orbajosa did not spend all their time in the Casino , as evil-minded people might imagine . 
In the afternoons there were to be seen at the corner of the cathedral , and in the little plaza formed by the intersection of the Calle del Condestable and the Calle de la Triperia , several gentlemen who , gracefully enveloped in their cloaks , stood there like sentinels , watching the people as they passed by . 
If the weather was fine , those shining lights of the Urbs Augustan culture bent their steps , still enveloped in the indispensable cloak , toward the promenade called the Paseo de las Descalzas , which was formed by a double row of consumptive-looking elms and some withered bushes of broom . 
There the brilliant Pleiad watched the daughters of this fellow-townsman or that , who had also come there for a walk , and the afternoon passed tolerably . 
In the evening , the Casino filled up again ; and while some of the members gave their lofty minds to the delights of monte , others read the newspapers , while the majority discussed in the coffee-room subjects of the various kinds , such as the politics , horses , bulls , or the gossip of the place . 
The result of every discussion was the renewed conviction of the supremacy of Orbajosa and its inhabitants over all the other towns and peoples on the face of the earth . 
These distinguished men were the cream of the illustrious city ; some rich landowners , others very poor , but all alike free from lofty aspirations . 
They had the imperturbable tranquillity of the beggar who desires nothing more so long as he has a crust of bread with which to cheat hunger , and the sun to warm him . 
What chiefly distinguished the Orbajosans of the Casino was a sentiment of bitter hostility toward all strangers , and whenever any stranger of note appeared in its august halls , they believed that he had come there to call in question the superiority of the land of the garlic , or to dispute with it , through envy , the incontestable advantages which nature had bestowed upon it . 
When Pepe Rey presented himself in the Casino , they received him with something of suspicion , and as facetious persons abounded in it , before the new member had been there a quarter of an hour , all sorts of jokes had been made about him . 
When in answer to the reiterated questions of the members he said that he had come to Orbajosa with a commission to explore the basin of the Nahara for coal , and to survey a road , they all agreed that Senor Don Jose was a conceited fellow who wished to give himself airs , discovering coalbeds and planning railroads . 
Some one added : `` He has come to a bad place for that , then . 
Those gentlemen imagine that here we are all fools , and that they can deceive us with fine words . 
He has come to marry Dona Perfecta 's daughter , and all that he says about coalbeds is only for the sake of appearances . '' 
`` Well , this morning , '' said another , a merchant who had failed , `` they told me at the Dominguez ' that the gentleman has not a peseta , and that he has come here in order to be supported by his aunt and to see if he can catch Rosarito . '' 
`` It seems that he is no engineer at all , '' added an olive-planter , whose plantations were mortgaged for double their value . 
`` But it is as you say : those starvelings from Madrid think they are justified in deceiving poor provincials , and as they believe that here we all wear tails -- '' `` It is plain to be seen that he is penniless -- '' `` Well , half-jest and the whole earnest , he told us last night that we were lazy barbarians . '' 
`` That we spent our time sunning ourselves , like the Bedouins . '' 
`` That we lived with the imagination . '' 
`` That 's it ; that we lived with the imagination . '' 
`` And that this city was precisely like a city in Morocco . '' 
`` Well ! 
one has no patience to listen to those things . 
Where else could he see -LRB- unless it might be in Paris -RRB- a street like the Calle del Condestable , that can show seven houses in a row , all of them magnificent , from Dona Perfecta 's house to that of Nicolasita Hernandez ? 
Does that fellow suppose that one has never seen any thing , or has never been in Paris ? '' 
`` He also said , with a great deal of delicacy , that Orbajosa was a city of beggars ; and he gave us to understand that in his opinion we live in the meanest way here without being ourselves aware of it . '' 
`` What insolence ! 
If he ever says that to me , there will be a scene in the Casino , '' exclaimed the collector of taxes . 
`` Why did n't they tell him how many arrobas of oil Orbajosa produced last year ? 
Does n't the fool know that in good years Orbajosa produces wheat enough to supply all Spain , and even all Europe , with bread ? 
It is true that the crops have been bad for several years past , but that is not the rule . 
And the crop of garlic ! 
I wager the gentleman does n't know that the garlic of Orbajosa made the gentleman of the jury in the Exposition of London stare ! '' 
These and other conversations of a similar kind were to be heard in the rooms of the Casino in those days . 
Notwithstanding this boastful talk , so common in small towns , which , for the very reason that they are small , are generally arrogant , Rey was not without finding sincere friends among the members of the learned corporation , for they were not all gossips , nor were there wanting among them persons of good sense . 
But our hero had the misfortune -- if misfortune it can be called -- to be unusually frank in the manifestation of his feelings , and this awakened some antipathy toward him . 
Days passed . 
In addition to the natural disgust which the social customs of the episcopal city produced in him , various causes , all of them disagreeable , began to develop in his mind a profound sadness , chief among these causes being the crowd of litigants that swarmed about him like voracious ants . 
Many others of the neighboring landowners besides Uncle Licurgo claimed damages from him , or asked him to render accounts for lands managed by his grandfather . 
A claim was also brought against him because of a certain contract of partnership entered into by his mother and which , as it appeared , had not been fulfilled ; and he was required in the same way to acknowledge a mortgage on the estate of The Poplars executed in an irregular form by his uncle . 
Claims swarmed around him , multiplying with ant-like rapidity . 
He had come to the determination to renounce the ownership of his lands , but meanwhile his dignity required that he should not yield to the wily manoeuvres of the artful rustics ; and as the town-council brought a claim against him also on account of a pretended confusion of the boundary lines of his estate with those of an adjoining wood belonging to the town-lands , the unfortunate young man found himself at every step obliged to prove his rights , which were being continually called in question . 
His honor was engaged , and he had no alternative but to defend his rights to the death . 
Dona Perfecta had promised in her magnanimity to help him to free himself from these disgraceful plots by means of an amicable arrangement ; but the days passed , and the good offices of the exemplary lady had produced no result whatever . 
The claims multiplied with the dangerous swiftness of a violent disease . 
Pepe Rey passed hour after hour at court , making declarations and answering the same questions over and over again , and when he returned home tired and angry , there appeared before him the sharp features and grotesque face of the notary , who had brought him a thick bundle of stamped papers full of horrible formulas -- that he might be studying the question . 
It will be easily understood that Pepe Rey was not a man to endure such annoyances when he might escape from them by leaving the town . 
His mother 's noble city appeared to his imagination like a horrible monster which had fastened its ferocious claws in him and was drinking his blood . 
To free himself from this monster nothing more was necessary , he believed , than flight . 
But a weighty interest -- an interest in which his heart was concerned -- kept him where he was ; binding him to the rock of his martyrdom with very strong bonds . 
Nevertheless , he had come to feel so dissatisfied with his position ; he had come to regard himself as so utterly a stranger , so to say , in that gloomy city of lawsuits , of old-fashioned customs and ideas , of envy and of slander , that he resolved to leave it without further delay , without , however , abandoning the project which had brought him to it . 
One morning , finding a favorable occasion , he opened his mind to Dona Perfecta on this point . 
`` Nephew , '' responded that lady , with her accustomed gentleness , `` do n't be rash . 
Why ! 
you are like fire . 
Your father was just the same -- what a man he was ! 
You are like a flash -- I have already told you that I will be very glad to call you my son . 
Even if you did not possess the good qualities and the talents which distinguish you -LRB- in spite of some little defects , for you have those , too -RRB- ; even if you were not as good as you are ; it is enough that this union has been proposed by your father , to whom both my daughter and myself owe so much , for me to accept it . 
And Rosarito will not oppose it since I wish it . 
What is wanting , then ? 
Nothing ; there is nothing wanting but a little time . 
The marriage can not be concluded with the haste you desire and which might , perhaps , give ground for interpretations discreditable to my dear daughter 's reputation . 
But as you think of nothing but machines , you want every thing done by steam . 
Wait , man , wait ; what hurry are you in ? 
This hatred that you have taken to our poor Orbajosa is nothing but a caprice . 
But of course you can only live among counts and marquises and orators and diplomats -- all you want is to get married and separate me forever from my daughter , '' she added , wiping away a tear . 
`` Since that is the case , inconsiderate boy , at least have the charity to delay for a little this marriage , for which you are so eager . 
What impatience ! 
What ardent love ! 
I did not suppose that a poor country girl like my daughter could inspire so violent a passion . '' 
The arguments of his aunt did not convince Pepe Rey , but he did not wish to contradict her . 
A fresh cause of anxiety was soon added to those which already embittered his existence . 
He had now been in Orbajosa for two weeks , and during that time he had received no letter from his father . 
This could not be attributed to carelessness on the part of the officials of the post-office of Orbajosa , for the functionary who had charge of that service being the friend and protégé of Dona Perfecta , the latter every day recommended him to take the greatest care that the letters addressed to her nephew did not go astray . 
The letter-carrier , named Cristoval Ramos , and nicknamed Caballuco -- a personage whose acquaintance we have already made -- also visited the house , and to him Dona Perfecta was accustomed to address warnings and reprimands as energetic as the following : `` A pretty mail service you have ! 
How is it that my nephew has not received a single letter since he has been in Orbajosa ? 
When the carrying of the mail is entrusted to such a giddy-pate , how can things be expected to go well ? 
I will speak to the governor of the province so that he may be careful what kind of people he puts in the post-office . '' 
Caballuco , shrugging his shoulders , looked at Rey with the most complete indifference . 
One day he entered the house with a letter in his hand . 
`` Thank Heaven ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta to her nephew . 
`` Here are letters from your father . 
Rejoice , man ! 
A pretty fright we have had through my brother 's laziness about writing . 
What does he say ? 
He is well , no doubt , '' she added , seeing that Pepe Rey opened the letter with feverish impatience . 
The engineer turned pale as he glanced over the first lines . 
`` Good Heavens ! 
Pepe , what is the matter ? '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , rising in alarm . 
`` Is your father ill ? '' 
`` This letter is not from my father , '' responded Pepe , revealing in his countenance the greatest consternation . 
`` What is it , then ? '' 
`` An order from the Minister of Public Works , relieving me from the charge which was confided to me . '' 
`` What ! 
Can it be possible ! '' 
`` A dismissal pure and simple , expressed in terms very little flattering to me . '' 
`` Was there ever any thing so unjust ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , when she had recovered from her amazement . 
`` What a humiliation ! '' 
exclaimed the young man . 
`` It is the first time in my life that I have received an affront like this . '' 
`` But the Government is unpardonable ! 
To put such a slight upon you ! 
Do you wish me to write to Madrid ? 
I have very good friends there , and I may be able to obtain satisfaction for you from the Government and reparation for this brutal affront . '' 
`` Thanks , senora , I desire no recommendations , '' said the young man , with ill-humor . 
`` But what a piece of injustice ! 
what a high-handed proceeding ! 
To discharge in this way a young man of your merit , an eminent scientist . 
Why , I can not contain my anger ! '' 
`` I will find out , '' said Pepe , with energy , `` who it is that occupies himself in injuring me . '' 
`` That minister -- but what is to be expected from those infamous politicasters ? '' 
`` In this there is the hand of some one who is determined to drive me to desperation , '' declared the young man , visibly disturbed . 
`` This is not the act of the minister ; this and other contrarieties that I am experiencing are the result of a revengeful plot , of a secret and well-laid plan of some implacable enemy , and this enemy is here in Orbajosa , this plot has been hatched in Orbajosa , doubt it not , dear aunt . '' 
`` You are out of your mind , '' replied Dona Perfecta , with a look of compassion . 
`` You have enemies in Orbajosa , you say ? 
Some one wishes to revenge himself upon you ? 
Come , Pepillo , you have lost your senses . 
The reading of those books in which they say that we have for ancestors monkeys or parrots has turned your brain . '' 
She smiled sweetly as she uttered the last words , and taking a tone of familiar and affectionate admonition , she added : `` My dear boy , the people of Orbajosa may be rude and boorish rustics , without learning , or polish , or fine manners ; but in loyalty and good faith we yield to no one -- to no one , I say , no one . '' 
`` Do n't suppose , '' said the young man , `` that I accuse any one in this house . 
But that my implacable and cruel enemy is in this city , I am persuaded . '' 
`` I wish you would show me that stage villain , '' responded Dona Perfecta , smiling again . 
`` I suppose you will not accuse Uncle Licurgo , nor any of the others who have brought suits against you ; for the poor people believe they are only defending their rights . 
And between ourselves , they are not altogether wanting in reason in this case . 
Besides , Uncle Licurgo likes you greatly . 
He has told me so himself . 
From the moment he saw you , you took his fancy , and the poor old man has conceived such an affection for you -- '' `` Oh , yes -- a profound affection ! '' 
murmured Pepe . 
`` Do n't be foolish , '' continued his aunt , putting her hand on his shoulder and looking at him closely . 
`` Do n't imagine absurdities ; convince yourself that your enemy , if you have one , is in Madrid , in that centre of corruption , of envy and rivalry , not in this peaceful and tranquil corner , where all is good-will and concord . 
Some one , no doubt , who is envious of your merit -- There is one thing I wish to say now -- and that is , that if you desire to go there to learn the cause of this affront and ask an explanation of it from the Government , you must not neglect doing so on our account . '' 
Pepe Rey fixed his eyes on his aunt 's countenance , as if he wished to penetrate with his glance the inmost depths of her soul . 
`` I say that if you wish to go , do so , '' repeated Dona Perfecta , with admirable serenity , while her countenance expressed the most complete and unaffected sincerity . 
`` No , senora : I do not wish to go . '' 
`` So much the better ; I think you are right . 
You are more tranquil here , notwithstanding the suspicions with which you are tormenting yourself . 
Poor Pepillo ! 
We poor rustics of Orbajosa live happy in our ignorance . 
I am very sorry that you are not contented here . 
But is it my fault if you vex and worry yourself without a cause ? 
Do I not treat you like a son ? 
Have I not received you as the hope of my house ? 
Can I do more for you ? 
If in spite of all this you do not like us , if you show so much indifference toward us , if you ridicule our piety , if you insult our friends , is it by chance because we do not treat you well ? '' 
Dona Perfecta 's eyes grew moist . 
`` My dear aunt , '' said Pepe , feeling his anger vanish , `` I too have committed some faults since I have been a guest in this house . '' 
`` Do n't be foolish . 
Do n't talk about committing faults . 
Among the persons of the same family every thing is forgiven . '' 
`` But Rosarito -- where is she ? '' 
asked the young man , rising . 
`` Am I not to see her to-day , either ? '' 
`` She is better . 
Do you know that she did not wish to come down stairs ? '' 
`` I will go up to her then . '' 
`` No , it would be of no use . 
That girl has some obstinate notions -- to-day she is determined not to leave her room . 
She has locked herself in . '' 
`` What a strange idea ! '' 
`` She will get over it . 
Undoubtedly she will get over it . 
We will see to-night if we can not put these melancholy thoughts out of her head . 
We will get up a party to amuse her . 
Why do n't you go to Don Inocencio 's and ask him to come here to-night and bring Jacintillo with him ? '' 
`` Jacintillo ! '' 
`` Yes , when Rosarito has these fits of melancholy , the only one who can divert her is that young man . '' 
`` But I will go upstairs -- '' `` No , you must not . '' 
`` What etiquette there is in this house ! '' 
`` You are ridiculing us . 
Do as I ask you . '' 
`` But I wish to see her . '' 
`` But you can not see her . 
How little you know the girl ! '' 
`` I thought I knew her well . 
I will stay here , then . 
But this solitude is horrible . '' 
`` There comes the notary . '' 
`` Maledictions upon him ! '' 
`` And I think the attorney-general has just come in too -- he is an excellent person . '' 
`` He be hanged with his goodness ! '' 
`` But business affairs , when they are one 's own , serve as a distraction . 
Some one is coming . 
I think it is the agricultural expert . 
You will have something to occupy you now for an hour or two . '' 
`` An hour or two of hell ! '' 
`` Ah , ha ! 
if I am not mistaken Uncle Licurgo and Uncle Paso Largo have just entered . 
Perhaps they have come to propose a compromise to you . '' 
`` I would throw myself into the pond first ! '' 
`` How unnatural you are ! 
For they are all very fond of you . 
Well , so that nothing may be wanting , there comes the constable too . 
He is coming to serve a summons on you . '' 
`` To crucify me . '' 
All the individuals named were now entering the parlor one by one . 
`` Good-by , Pepe ; amuse yourself , '' said Dona Perfecta . 
`` Earth , open and swallow me ! '' 
exclaimed the young man desperately . 
`` Senor Don Jose . '' 
`` My dear Don Jose . '' 
`` Esteemed Don Jose . '' 
`` My dearest Don Jose . '' 
`` My respected friend , Don Jose . '' 
Hearing these honeyed and insinuating preliminaries , Pepe Rey exhaled a deep sigh and gave himself up . 
He gave himself up , soul and body , to the executioners , who brandished horrible leaves of stamped paper while the victim , raising his eyes to heaven with a look of Christian meekness , murmured : `` Father , why hast thou forsaken me ? '' 
Love , friendship , a wholesome moral atmosphere , spiritual light , sympathy , an easy interchange of ideas and feelings , these were what Pepe Rey 's nature imperatively demanded . 
Deprived of them , the darkness that shrouded his soul grew deeper , and his inward gloom imparted a tinge of bitterness and discontent to his manner . 
On the day following the scenes described in the last chapter , what vexed him more than any thing was the already prolonged and mysterious seclusion of his cousin , accounted for at first by a trifling indisposition and then by caprices and nervous feelings difficult of explanation . 
Rey was surprised by conduct so contrary to the idea which he had formed of Rosarito . 
Four days had passed during which he had not seen her ; and certainly it was not because he did not desire to be at her side ; and his situation threatened soon to become humiliating and ridiculous , if , by boldly taking the initiative , he did not at once put an end to it . 
`` Shall I not see my cousin to-day , either ? '' 
he said to his aunt , with manifest ill-humor , when they had finished dining . 
`` No , not to-day , either . 
Heaven knows how sorry I am for it . 
I gave her a good talking to this morning . 
This afternoon we will see what can be done . '' 
The suspicion that in this unreasonable seclusion his adorable cousin was rather the helpless victim than the free and willing agent , induced him to control himself and to wait . 
Had it not been for this suspicion he would have left Orbajosa that very day . 
He had no doubt whatever that Rosario loved him , but it was evident that some unknown influence was at work to separate them , and it seemed to him to be the part of an honorable man to discover whence that malign influence proceeded and to oppose it , as far as it was in his power to do so . 
`` I hope that Rosarito 's obstinacy will not continue long , '' he said to Dona Perfecta , disguising his real sentiments . 
On this day he received a letter from his father in which the latter complained of having received none from Orbajosa , a circumstance which increased the engineer 's disquietude , perplexing him still further . 
Finally , after wandering about alone in the garden for a long time , he left the house and went to the Casino . 
He entered it with the desperate air of a man about to throw himself into the sea . 
In the principal rooms he found various people talking and discussing different subjects . 
In one group they were solving with subtle logic difficult problems relating to bulls ; in another , they were discussing the relative merits of different breeds of donkeys of Orbajosa and Villahorrenda . 
Bored to the last degree , Pepe Rey turned away from these discussions and directed his steps toward the reading-room , where he looked through various reviews without finding any distraction in the reading , and a little later , passing from room to room , he stopped , without knowing why , at the gaming-table . 
For nearly two hours he remained in the clutches of the horrible yellow demon , whose shining eyes of gold at once torture and charm . 
But not even the excitement of play had power to lighten the gloom of his soul , and the same tedium which had impelled him toward the green cloth sent him away from it . 
Shunning the noise , he found himself in an apartment used as an assembly-room , in which at the time there was not a living soul , and here he seated himself wearily at a window overlooking the street . 
This was very narrow , with more corners and salient angles than houses , and was overshaded throughout its whole extent by the imposing mass of the cathedral that lifted its dark and time-corroded walls at one end of it . 
Pepe Rey looked up and down and in every direction ; no sign of life -- not a footstep , not a voice , not a glance , disturbed the stillness , peaceful as that of a tomb , that reigned everywhere . 
Suddenly strange sounds , like the whispering of feminine voices , fell on his ear , and then the rustling of curtains that were being drawn , a few words , and finally the humming of a song , the bark of a lap-dog , and other signs of social life , which seemed very strange in such a place . 
Observing attentively , Pepe Rey perceived that these noises proceeded from an enormous balcony with blinds which displayed its corpulent bulk in front of the window at which he was sitting . 
Before he had concluded his observations , a member of the Casino suddenly appeared beside him , and accosted him laughingly in this manner : `` Ah , Senor Don Pepe ! 
what a rogue you are ! 
So you have shut yourself in here to ogle the girls , eh ? '' 
The speaker was Don Juan Tafetan , a very amiable man , and one of the few members of the Casino who had manifested for Pepe Rey cordial friendship and genuine admiration . 
With his red cheeks , his little dyed mustache , his restless laughing eyes , his insignificant figure , his hair carefully combed to hide his baldness , Don Juan Tafetan was far from being an Antinous in appearance , but he was very witty and very agreeable and he had a happy gift for telling a good story . 
He was much given to laughter , and when he laughed his face , from his forehead to his chin , became one mass of grotesque wrinkles . 
In spite of these qualities , and of the applause which might have stimulated his taste for spicy jokes , he was not a scandal-monger . 
Every one liked him , and Pepe Rey spent with him many pleasant hours . 
Poor Tafetan , formerly an employe in the civil department of the government of the capital of the province , now lived modestly on his salary as a clerk in the bureau of charities ; eking out his income by gallantly playing the clarionet in the processions , in the solemnities of the cathedral , and in the theatre , whenever some desperate company of players made their appearance in those parts with the perfidious design of giving representations in Orbajosa . 
But the most curious thing about Don Juan Tafetan was his liking for pretty girls . 
He himself , in the days when he did not hide his baldness with half a dozen hairs plastered down with pomade , when he did not dye his mustache , when , in the freedom from care of youthful years , he walked with shoulders unstooped and head erect , had been a formidable Tenorio . 
To hear him recount his conquests was something to make one die laughing ; for there are Tenorios and Tenorios , and he was one of the most original . 
`` What girls ? 
I do n't see any girls , '' responded Pepe Rey . 
`` Yes , play the anchorite ! '' 
One of the blinds of the balcony was opened , giving a glimpse of a youthful face , lovely and smiling , that disappeared instantly , like a light extinguished by the wind . 
`` Yes , I see now . '' 
`` Do n't you know them ? '' 
`` On my life I do not . '' 
`` They are the Troyas -- the Troya girls . 
Then you do n't know something good . 
Three lovely girls , the daughters of a colonel of staff , who died in the streets of Madrid in ' 54 . '' 
The blind opened again , and two faces appeared . 
`` They are laughing at me , '' said Tafetan , making a friendly sign to the girls . 
`` Do you know them ? '' 
`` Why , of course I know them . 
The poor things are in the greatest want . 
I do n't know how they manage to live . 
When Don Francisco Troya died a subscription was raised for them , but that did not last very long . '' 
`` Poor girls ! 
I imagine they are not models of virtue . '' 
`` And why not ? 
I do not believe what they say in the town about them . '' 
Once more the blinds opened . 
`` Good-afternoon , girls ! '' 
cried Don Juan Tafetan to the three girls , who appeared , artistically grouped , at the window . 
`` This gentleman says that good things ought not to hide themselves , and that you should throw open the blinds . '' 
But the blind was closed and a joyous concert of laughter diffused a strange gayety through the gloomy street . 
One might have fancied that a flock of birds was passing . 
`` Shall we go there ? '' 
said Tafetan suddenly . 
His eyes sparkled and a roguish smile played on his discolored lips . 
`` But what sort of people are they , then ? '' 
`` Do n't be afraid , Senor de Rey . 
The poor things are honest . 
Bah ! 
Why , they live upon air , like the chameleons . 
Tell me , can any one who does n't eat sin ? 
The poor girls are virtuous enough . 
And even if they did sin , they fast enough to make up for it . '' 
`` Let us go , then . '' 
A moment later Don Juan Tafetan and Pepe Rey were entering the parlor of the Troyas . 
The poverty he saw , that struggled desperately to disguise itself , afflicted the young man . 
The three girls were very lovely , especially the two younger ones , who were pale and dark , with large black eyes and slender figures .
