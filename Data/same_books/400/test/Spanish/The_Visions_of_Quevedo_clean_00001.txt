THE prayers of the church being considered as the most efficacious remedies that can be employed against the possession of the devil , a malady almost invincible , some wealthy inhabitants of the country had brought into this city of Seville , one of their relations , who was thus afflicted , to confide his cure to a religious of renowned sanctity ; or , in other words , for the purpose of having him exorcised . 
On the day assigned for this operation , the possessed was carried to the church of the Cordeliers , which very soon overflowed with spectators . 
The gates having been shut before my arrival , I engaged a religious of my acquaintance to admit me . 
He introduced me by the gate of the monastery ; but I had no sooner entered the church , than I had reason to repent my curiosity : I was hustled by the crowd , and overcome with the heat . 
There my regards were attracted by an unhappy wretch , of an ill figure , with wild eyes and dishevelled garments , his hands bound behind his back , and uttering from time to time the most frightful yells . 
There was much impatience testified to behold this holy priest , of whom I have spoken , whose name was Juan de Cardanas , father of Barnadino de Cardanas , Capuchin , and Bishop of Paragua , in America . 
After the performance of mass , he found himself so much indisposed , that they were obliged to postpone the exorcism till another day . 
I was not sorry ; for , not partaking in the credulity of the people , who often impute epileptical complaints to the operation of demons , I had for a long time been desirous of personally verifying those things they relate concerning the possessions of the devil . 
I lost no time in visiting the relations of this unhappy person , whom I shrewdly suspected had recourse to this adroit method to rid themselves of the inconvenience of certain pecadilloes he had been engaged in . 
I inspired them with sufficient confidence to obtain permission to visit their lodgings the following night , with a view of making such an examination as I should judge proper . 
I preferred this time to any other , that I might the better conceal the defeat of my enterprize if it should not succeed . 
The night being come , I was introduced into the chamber of the possessed whom they had placed upon a bed in such a manner that he could not rise . 
The presence of his friends prevented me from the proposition of certain questions I had meditated . 
The following will serve as a sample : Is it possible to find out the philosopher 's stone ? 
Can the quadrature of the circle be discovered ? 
Is there an universal panacea for every disease ? 
Is there among herbs , any simples which can inspire love in women , or protect from blows and wounds ? 
I had put in writing some other objects of my curiosity ; but as it was not a convenient time to propound them , I began to feel the pulse of the possessed . 
It was frequent and elevated : from time to time his eyes were troubled ; and he had convulsive movements , from which he suffered very much . 
After having examined his body , I examined his mind , speaking to him in Greek , Hebrew , Turkish , Indian , and even in the Mexican tongue . 
He answered me always very appropriately in Spanish , which convinced me that he was in truth possessed with a devil ; for although he spake not all languages , he nevertheless understood them , which could not naturally happen without study or travel . 
His relations assured me he had done neither the one nor the other . 
I demanded of the demon , what name he had in hell ? 
He answered , `` that he had no other appellation than that of the employment which he exercised in the world : that he had been for a long time in the service of an alguazil , in whom he inspired all the chicanery and wickedness with which he plagued poor people . '' 
Let us remark here , that the word alguazil is borrowed from the Moresco tongue , and signifies in Spanish , a constable , a cryer , a clerk , or other subaltern of justice . 
`` Why , '' said I to the demon , `` are you entered into the body of this man ? '' 
`` Because he was himself an alguazil , and a person of a licentious life . 
After having been banished from his paternal home , finding himself necessitous , he associated with alguazils to extort money , under pretence of executing the decrees of justice , and in the arrest of bodies , which he often abandoned for small sums . 
It was in the execution of this business , that he stole a silver cup from the house of a country curate , and subtracted a purse of one hundred ducats from the pocket of a man , who , for the stuff , was delivered from the hands of justice . '' 
I asked him if there were many of these people in hell ? 
`` Very many , '' answered he : `` the constables have neither honour nor conscience ; they drive their trade whether they know any thing of the matter or not : in that particular they resemble the poets . 
You shall scarcely find in hell , a single poet , who will not tell you that he was sent there on account of the versified lies he told in praise of some beauty . 
The poetic spirit hath its origin in the disposition of the heart , to receive tender impressions : it is the lover of heroism and romance ; and to sustain this character , must necessarily make use of much artifice . 
The old poets serve as secretaries to young lovers ; the young ones are ambitious of blazing as the heroes of their own compositions . 
There are so many poets in hell , that it can hardly fail of aggrandizing their quarter . 
I wish to speak in such a manner , that you may comprehend the nature of their occupations and torments there ; but of which you can not have an adequate idea , unless I shall here adduce some examples : -- `` When these authors enter the subterranean abodes , they look around for a Charon , a dog Cerberus , a Rhadamanthus , a Pluto , and all the infernal divinities of fable . 
In place of that , the demons make them realize , that this is a place much more horrible than that : but this is not their severest punishment ; they are forced to hear the compositions of other poets , who are their superiors in talent ; then they are tormented by jealousy ; they hate the epigrams of Martial , the stanzas of Catullus , the odes of Horace , the beauties of Virgil , the satires of Juvenal , the comedies of Terence , and the tragedies of Seneca . 
It is thus also the historians suffer , when they listen to the histories of Herodotus , of Titus , Livy , of Sallust , and of Cæsar . 
`` What a punishment for these rhymsters , when they recollect their own works ! 
You can not imagine the pain they experience , in finding a felicitous rhyme , a happy epithet , a just pause , or an harmonious cadence : they are more tormented by an a or an e , than Tantalus is by thirst , or the Italians are with their jealousy , when they have Frenchmen at their houses . 
And the comic poets , how are they punished , for having filched away the reputation of so many princesses and queens of Castile , of Leon , of Arragon , and other places ! 
This is as fertile a field for them , as all the wars of the Moors of Granada ; but for these larcenies , they suffer sharper agonies as Christians , than will ever be inflicted upon the barbarians and Mohammedans , for all their battles and burnings , or upon the alguazils , even for their violences and exactions . 
`` Behold , in review of the subject , '' said the demon , who spake by the mouth of the possessed , `` there is a much nearer resemblance between poets and alguazils , than one would , at a first glance , imagine . '' 
`` A fine comparison , '' said I , `` for such a false spirit as you ! '' 
`` How ! '' 
answered he , `` are not poets and alguazils both thieves ? 
and if you would but confess it , you well know , that in making these remarks of poets , I speak to a poet , whom I wish to undeceive . 
Do you not recollect the old Spanish proverb , He who never composed two verses , had no wit ; and he who produced four , was a fool ? '' 
`` I confess , '' said I , `` that to be a poet , one must have an original turn of imagination ; and the same qualification is necessary to a painter : one would find it very difficult to assume , without merit , the rank of Apelles and Michael Angelo : but as they can not justly call these celebrated artists so generally admired , fools , so neither do I believe they can accuse of folly the great poets of Spain , of Italy , of France , of Turkey , of Persia , and of China : for in all these places they have made verses . '' 
`` Yes , '' said he , `` and in all these places there are fools , alguazils , painters , astrologers , jealous or complaisant husbands , mountebanks , perfumers , plagiaries , triflers , and slaves of business or pleasure . 
All these , under pretext of pleasure or justice , steal , without compunction , the wealth of others . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said I to him , `` I now recognize in you a true demon ; you delight to lie , and in crying out that all who serve the public rob them , you enhance their reputation . 
But tell me what robbery a magistrate commits , when he obeys , and wishes to compel others to obey , the laws of his prince ? 
when , in fine , he distributes to every one justice ? 
Without justice , which punishes and avenges , no one could enjoy security in his own house . 
A whole city might be given up to pillage , and become more horrible than the hell you inhabit ; a state of things which must excite a very just indignation among reasonable people ; that is , among those who understand the principles of order , equity , and natural right . 
And what a picture would every family offer ! 
Children opposing themselves to their fathers , and servants against their masters ; brothers would make laws for brothers , and mothers have no authority over their daughters ! '' 
`` Behold , '' said the demon , `` a superb description of the disorder which would happen , if the gentlemen of justice did not make it their duty to become the first robbers ! '' 
`` Do you call the pecuniary penalties they impose , robbery ? '' 
replied I. `` They are wisely established as a check upon avarice and usury , which are the ruin of families . 
The fines they impose are regarded sometimes as extortions ; but they are not so ; for if the community provided not for the necessities of all , do you believe that individuals would furnish of themselves , what is necessary for the republic ? 
do you believe they would contribute without a demand ? 
There is not among the officers of government , so much cupidity and bad faith , as you charge them with . 
But answer me : without their assistance , their care , their vigilance , would there be any security to emperors , kings , popes , and bishops in their beds , or repose in their dignities ? '' 
`` I have not , '' said the demon , `` so bad a tongue as you believe . 
I know , truly , all the affairs of the world , and the state of every condition in republics . 
In accusing the most of mankind , I do them no injustice : and those evils which you say would happen , without the assistance of those who are appointed to execute the laws , happen in spite of their wisdom . 
The worst of it is , they are brought about by those very persons who are expected to prevent it , and who are paid for that object . 
Whence has it arisen that so many emperors have been killed , so many kings dethroned , so many popes declared anti-popes , so many bishops dismissed , so many magistrates suppressed , so many families ruined , so many cities pillaged , so many provinces reduced to famine ? 
It is by the ministers of justice , by the overseers of administrations , that all these things are done , either directly or indirectly : directly , with a view to profit by the disorder ; or indirectly , from a culpable inertness . 
How do so many officers of the long robe contrive to live ? 
They lengthen out their robes with the pieces they snatch from the officers of the short robes . 
A man who goes to law , may be compared to him who orders a coat : he will have a good coat , but yet not receive all the stuff he delivered to his tailor . 
He will take enough for two pair of sleeves , and two fore parts ; he will take twice as many buttons , twice as much silk , binding , and lining , as is necessary for one garment ; and you shall have but one , when you ought to have two out of the cloth you purchased . 
A Spanish grandee , wishing to have a coat in the French style , purchased as much cloth as the tailor demanded of him , whom he also left at liberty to take as much lining , assorted to the colour of the cloth . 
After they had taken his measure , he caused them to call the tailor , and told him that he desired the lining of one coat to be red , and that of the other yellow . 
``` How , my lord , ' said the tailor , ` do you wish me to make two coats , when you have given me stuff but for one ? ' 
``` Yes ; I do expect it , ' said the grandee ; ` and if you do not make them both sufficiently large , I will put you in a safe place . ' 
`` The tailor , who feared the prison , made two garments as long and large as they ought to be , without purchasing another shred of cloth . 
When he brought them home , the lord caused all the stuff to be measured by an engineer , in his service ; he found that it yet wanted half a quarter of an ell , besides the little pieces he was forced to cut out for the angles . 
This was not all ; the Spanish grandee , whose name I can tell you , which was Don Pedro de Saccaso , wished that the master tailor should pay him for two garments , which he cabbaged out of stuff he had delivered him the preceding spring ; and as the tailor cried out at this injustice , the grandee refused to pay him for the fashion , lining , and trimming of gold of these two last . 
Thus you will comprehend , '' observed the demon , `` in what particular the people charged with the administration of justice resemble tailors , and in what manner they are unjust , even in rendering justice . 
In their suits they generally make certain pieces of meadow or vineyard the object of contention ; and if the parties complain of want of money to pay their fees , they take from them that which they demand at their tribunal . '' 
`` So , '' said I to the demon , `` there is no justice upon earth ! '' 
`` No , no , there is none , '' added he ; `` and it is not to-day , that for the first time the complaint has been uttered . 
The fable says , that Astrea being come with truth among men , was obliged to return to heaven , because no person would receive her . 
Truth met with the same fate , after having wandered through the world , sometimes among the Egyptians , sometimes among the Greeks , sometimes among the Romans , and sometimes even among the Chinese ; she was constrained , at length , to retire to the house of a poor mute , who yet , by false and equivocal signs , gave her to understand that he wished to get rid of her company . 
She then returned to the place from whence she came . 
Justice perceiving they would not tolerate her in courts , among the abodes of princes , in palaces , or great cities , fled into the villages , where , however , she did not tarry a long-time ; for the stewards of the lords , that is , those ignorant stewards who seek but to amass money with which to pay their charges , gave her chase , and forced her to regain her own country . 
The beauty of Astrea , or Justice , resembles that of the stars -- shining , noble , and worthy of admiration ; but this is only when beheld at a distance ; for were you to approach too near to a star , although it appears to you so diminutive , it would consume you in an instant . 
Justice is fair , but she is proud , austere , rigid , inexorable , and no respecter of persons : she wishes to be sought and beloved , but she loves not one friend more than another ; and like love , she travels a little in the rear . 
Is it possible to find any thing more exact , more faithful , more laborious , more submissive , more complaisant , than a violent love ? 
It fails not in the minutest particular ; it knows no concealment ; nothing appears difficult to it ; it is always ready to obey , accounting no toil disagreeable ; in the desire , to please , it finds every thing just as it wishes . 
Justice does the same in another sense , for she meets with exactness in the slightest circumstance : she is faithful in the least things ; she is laborious , and fears no pain ; she is submissive to the laws which she imposes ; she is complaisant for herself , and even sometimes appears unjust , so impartial and rigorous is she . '' 
`` I suppose then , '' said I , `` there are many judges in hell , if what you say is correct , which seems to me very probable . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the demon , `` they are there in great numbers , and we have put them in the same place with thieves and robbers . 
One circumstance that will surprise you , is , that their multitude is as considerable as that of the amorous ; although they have among the former , only the men who were judges : and among the latter , men and women who have loved once at least in their lives . '' 
`` You wish to give me to understand , '' said I to him , `` that there are many lovers in hell ; but can that be ? 
If men were damned for this passion , no person should be exempt from your infernal jurisdiction . 
But this passion hath one great advantage ; it is conformable to the charity that men owe to one another , and is always accompanied with repentance , and certain remorse of conscience , when it departs from those who have been possessed . 
One sees young girls even , who repent of their faults . 
How many religions houses are founded by penitence ! 
how many old coquettes give themselves up to devotion ! 
how many men follow their example , after love has fled with beauty , constitution , and wealth ! '' 
`` But , '' said the demon , `` how many men and women , young and old , die in their amours , and count you for nothing the despair , the chagrin , the secret pains under which so many lovers have succumbed ? 
Know you not that some temperaments are so affected by this passion , that they quit it but with life ? 
If I should relate to you the histories of both sexes perverted by the perusal of gallant adventures , and having no other desire in their souls but to experience the like ; if I should cause you to see the occupations of these people in hell , you would pity some , while you could not help laughing at the folly of others . 
You would see young men burning at the feet of their mistresses ; and old ones , who , to please theirs , are continually shaving themselves , or plucking out their beard , and who put on bland perukes , to give themselves a youthful appearance ; young girls , who imagine themselves to be Cleopatras , Artemisias , and Clelias ; old coquettes , who paint themselves continually before their glass , who torment their locks , tightening the forehead-cloth to efface the wrinkles , and adjusting to the mouth artificial teeth of ivory or wax : but all their cases are lost , since there is nothing substantial in the other world . 
You would be astonished , if I were to point out to you all the girls who have taken certain means to hide the effects of their love sports . 
It would of necessity be seen , how many surgeons and physicians follow in their train ; and if any one should inquire why these people are in hell , who have rendered such universal service , I answer , because they ought not to afford assistance to every one . 
Can they , for instance , '' added he , `` conscientiously administer those remedies to cause hemorrhages , which end in abortion ? '' 
And as I was about to observe , that the physicians could not be cognizant of a malady which they would not discover -- `` I understand you , '' interrupted the demon : `` be sure they know well enough , without that ; at any rate , it is their duty to know , or to suspect . '' 
`` But , '' said I to him , `` is there not another secret you have omitted , of similar effect to the assistance of the physicians ? '' 
`` Yes , '' he answered : `` there are the poisoners , sorcerers , and adroit women , who teach these mysteries ; and there are some in hell who yet continue this infamous practice . '' 
`` You would have it understood , '' said I , `` that you are a good devil ; a devil of honour and conscience : you would make a good preacher ; the flock would doubtless edify by your sermons . '' 
`` Be persuaded , '' said he , `` that if I preach not agreeable things , I announce wholesome truths : believe also , that I have many preachers dependent upon me . 
` Who are they ? ' 
you inquire . 
They are those who preach for their own glory , to establish a reputation , to acquire celebrity , to gain benefices , and levy contributions upon poor devotees . 
They commit wickedness in doing good to others ; in teaching and edifying them . 
If we lose the hearers through the instrumentality of their discourses , we gain the pastors , which is more honourable to us . 
Finally , I declare to you , that it is by the order of God , that I speak to you before all these persons : I warn you , in particular , that you are lost , unless you abandon all the projects of ambition you have formed , and unless you renounce poetry , which is at the same time so agreeable and fatal . 
`` Draw near , '' said he , to an old man , a relation of the possessed : `` restore the three farms you illegally detain . 
You , young man , imitate Hercules no more with your strength and intrigue ; Hercules is dead ; you may find men who will kill you . 
-- You old judge of the village , you have a very delicate and perilous charge : you were the valet of the lord of the domain ; you have preserved in your new station , the spirit of servitude , which is not sympathetic with justice . 
The petition of your ancient master , you stupid wretch . 
The three peasants who have bound and strangled the helpless patient upon his bed , are those who enjoy the benefit . 
It is now six years since the farm-house of their master was consumed with fire : they ought to be punished for these crimes . 
-- As to those young ladies , they would do well not to admit , for the future , the two strangers , whom they entertain every evening in their chambers , and whom they introduce by the garden . 
Profit , all of you , by what you have now heard : I shall speak to you no more , for to-morrow the priest comes to exorcise me , and I shall depart from the body of this subject , it being the will of God that I should go forth , to attest his power and the glory of his name . '' 
The demon having finished this discourse , took pleasure in tormenting the possessed , and making him utter moving cries . 
I feared the neighbourhood would be alarmed , and that some one would recognize me in a place where I could not be with honour . 
In returning to my house , I reflected upon the wisdom of God , who draweth good from evil , and causeth demons to speak as angels of light . 
The prophet hath also remarked , that divine Providence disposeth things in such a manner , that the hands of our enemies can conduce to our welfare . 
This is the first possessed I ever saw in the course of my life , and the first time I ever conversed with a demon . 
God grant that I may never behold another , neither in this world , nor in the world to come ! 
THERE are those who affirm that none but the wicked are subjected to unpleasant thoughts . 
I have been acquainted with many persons , but I could never find one who was not ready to confess , there were moments of sadness that invaded the soul , the cause of which they could not explain . 
These spring , sometimes from a vicious temperament : the humours mixing themselves with the blood , carry to the brain those spirits that trace upon the imagination frightful and whimsical figures , from whence come those disagreeable dreams and visions that surprise us in the night . 
Dreams proceed often from heaven , often from the devil , and frequently from natural causes ; thus we have thoughts of death , after conversation on the subject , or having read a book that treated of it . 
To speak plainly , it seems that Providence sends us such dreams , for the purpose of forcing our attention to the consideration of those subjects we are generally reluctant to reflect upon . 
Such is , without doubt , the origin of this I have had concerning death . 
I read one night before retiring , the verse of Lucretius , one of the most learned men , and best poets of antiquity . 
I found an eminently beautiful passage , where he says , that all nature , with one consent , elevating her voice , speaks thus to mankind : -- `` Why , O mortals , do you groan for such a length of time , and why are you so sharply afflicted ? 
Why do you submit to the slavery of flying from death , and the fear thereof ? 
Why do you continually reflect upon the pleasures of youth ? 
The enjoyments of this season have passed with the days you regret , as grain escapes from a sack , from whence it finds an issue . 
You are fatigued with the world ; why do you not quit it , as one who returns satisfied from a feast , where the viands were exquisite , and the pleasure of the highest flavour ? 
You are convicted of a strange folly : it is in your power to enjoy tranquillity ; why not , then , seize upon possession ? 
Why fear death , that will render you invulnerable ? '' 
Such are the sentiments of the poet , and they appear like those of a saint ; but this is nature , or rather , natural reason , teaching us that death is not so frightful as we are apt to imagine ; and I am not therefore surprised , that heathen philosophers have exhibited so constant an example of exalted morality . 
Likewise I remember what Job has said upon the brevity of human life , and the swift arrival of death . 
`` The life of man , '' says this illustrious patriarch , `` is of short duration : it is a flower , that before it is scarcely blown , is despoiled of its leaves : it is a shadow , which flies with the rapidity of the wind , without remaining stationary a single moment ; '' and yet , in spite of its brevity , life is subject to so much calamity , that it is doubtful whether it should not rather be called misery , than life . 
Indulging in these grave meditations , I threw myself upon my bed , and slept . 
My spirit was free from external impressions . 
I thought there came into the places where my fancy had transported me , a great multitude of physicians , mounted upon mules , the housings of which , were clothes of the dead . 
In the suit of these physicians , who had an air of sourness and chagrin , followed a crowd of apothecaries , surgeons , and young barbers , who carried the drugs or instruments pertaining to their professions . 
When the physicians had descended from their mules , they began to dance a ballet , to the sound of the mortars and sieves the apothecaries and their adjuncts played upon . 
This ballet was interspersed with songs , in which the physicians took the upper part ; the words of one of them were as follows : -- `` Catholicum , rhubarbarae , opiata , theriaca , Opoponach , O opium , O laudanum anodinum , Polychrestum diureticum , senne anisatum . '' 
Two young physicians performed the air in these words : -- `` Recipe , recipe , recipe , recipe senne , Dragmas duas , dragmas duas , dragmas duas , Semi-dragmum rhei electac , Scrupulum unum polychresti , Infundantur , percolentur , hauriantur , Horâ sextâ matutinâ , Recipe , recipe , recipe , etc. '' Two surgeons answered to that , seca ; ure ; that is to say , cut , burn ; and directly both joined in chorus -- these repeating recipe , the others ure , and the last dancing . 
This troop having sat , there entered another composed of newsmongers , and people who followed them to learn what was transacted abroad in England , France , Holland , Italy , and other places . 
After these entered solicitors , stewards of noble estates , soldiers , priests , and other persons whom I did not know . 
This cavalcade was terminated by a woman of monstrous stature , meagre , pale , and having a very extraordinary equipage . 
Her head dress consisted of crowns , tiaras , electoral bonnets , mitres , red and black hats , hats of straw , turbans , and bonnets of wool and silk : upon one side of the head , she had her hair curled and powdered ; upon the other , shaven after the fashion of monks . 
Her robe was tissue of thread , wool , and silk , ornamented with trimmings of gold and silver , chaplets , precious stones , and pearls : she had upon her feet and legs , shoes of iron , wood , and leather : she bore upon a sceptre , a shepherd 's crook , a scythe , and a great club : she had one eye open , and the other shut ; and carried , pendant from her neck , a sand box , with crosses of the order of Saint James , of the Holy Ghost , and the medals of other military orders : her gait was alternately slow , then quick and precipitate . 
She approached my bed , and said , `` Arise , Chevalier , follow me ! '' 
`` But , before I follow thee , '' replied I , `` inform me who you are . '' 
`` I am Death , '' answered she ; `` follow me ! '' 
`` Is it your pleasure , then , that I should die ? '' 
`` No , no ! 
follow me , and leave behind thy garment ; for a person is not to be clothed when he follows Death . 
I will show you my empire , and my subjects . 
I am the queen of queens , the empress of sovereigns , the sovereign of the human race ; and the powers of earth are but my inspectors . '' 
`` How ! '' 
exclaimed I , `` dare you to say the king of Spain is your inspector ? 
he who possesses so many territories in the world ? '' 
`` Follow , follow , '' said Death ; `` I will show you . '' 
Immediately all those who were there , went out in the same order they had entered : Death following the rear of the procession , and I following Death . 
We traversed vast plains and deserts , which resembled cemeteries , or fields of battle , covered with dead . 
Directly I perceived , at a distance , an immense castle , built in the antique style ; and when I had drawn near , I observed that the materials were nothing but bones cemented with blood and apothecaries ' drugs . 
The three porters in the court were very pleasant to the sight . 
The first resembled a harlequin assuming divers attitudes , and having upon his habits the figures of kingdoms and provinces of the earth ; in such a fashion , indeed , that I seemed to look upon a geographical map : his name was the World . 
The second , who called himself the Flesh , was naked , like those figures of Priapus one sees upon medals . 
The third was armed , cap a pie , in gold and silver , like a curassier . 
They told me those three guards were the enemies of the world , and the porters of Death . 
The pavement of the court was of human sculls , as well as that of the chambers : these sculls were arranged in such a manner , that they resembled a chess board ; some being white , and others , having the hair upon them , appeared black . 
In the middle of this court was a fountain of tears : the figures about the basin , represented Uneasiness , Envy , Jealousy , Despair , Knavery , Sickness , Medicine , War , Revenge , and Love . 
The tapestries of the chambers were all upon particular subjects . 
One might see in one piece , people contracting marriage ; in another , lawyers pleading a case ; in this , merchants preparing for bankruptcy ; in that , honest thieves upon the grand tour , stripping the peasantry . 
The others represented an ecclesiastic , who , dying in his bed , has , in his last moments , the satisfaction of seeing his house pillaged ; a courier riding from Madrid to Rome , to solicit a benefice ; a tiler falling from the roof of a house ; a drunken sailor precipitating himself from his vessel into the sea ; a house burning with such rapidity , that its master is consumed in the flames ; in fine , one might there perceive every species of human death . 
But none of these impressed me with so much horror , as the paintings in fresco under the grand portico . 
There were here servants who strangled their master to obtain his money ; children who assassinated their father , to come more speedily into possession of his property ; subjects who kill their king , after having pronounced his condemnation ; a woman who poisons her husband ; and a mistress who does the same to her lover , to revenge his infidelity . 
In the middle of this gallery , was a colossal figure , representing Ingratitude , and elevated upon a pedestal ; the relief of which presented on the one side Cruelty , on the second Infidelity , on the third Interest , on the fourth Ambition . 
The base was ornamented with sculptural emblems of sporting cupids , satyrs , lions , and cats . 
After having traversed the whole extent of this apartment , Death entered into a grand and magnificent hall ; the sable hangings of which were sown with white drops , like the ornaments commonly seen on monuments in burying places . 
In this hall stood a throne composed of dead men 's bones , and which appeared like ivory : four leg bones formed the supporters ; two arms , with their hands , the arms of the seat ; a spinal bone , with those of the thighs , composed the back part ; the two pommels above were two sculls , and the seat was of other bones . 
It was ascended by four steps , the first of which was called infancy , the second youth , the third manhood , and the fourth old age . 
Death being seated , the whole medical corps ranged themselves on either side , the others being seated at their feet . 
Death spake for some time upon the limits of life , and of the grandeur of her empire : she finished her discourse by observing that there was but one way of coming into existence , but many ways of quitting it . 
She then gave a general order for the dead to appear , and all at once I saw them fall from the wainscot , and come from the walls and pavement . 
`` Speak , '' said the queen , `` each in turn . '' 
The first who commenced , said , `` I am Romulus , first king of Rome ; my ministers not being able to tolerate my government , wished to change it ; they caused me to be assassinated , and a report spread , that I had , in their presence , been translated to heaven . '' 
`` I am , '' said another , `` Cæsar , first emperor of the Romans : the senate caused me to perish by the hand of my adopted son . '' 
A third , `` I am the emperor Claudius , poisoned by my wife . '' 
A fourth , `` I am Alexander the great ; I died in the very bosom of a debauch . '' 
A fifth , `` I am Codrus , king of the Athenians ; I died for my country . '' 
`` And I , '' exclaimed a sixth , `` am Charles the fifth , whose bones my son exhumed , and burnt . '' 
In like manner appeared many of the illustrious dead , now confounded with all kinds of people . 
When they had spoken , they formed a great circle , in the midst of which I perceived a large bottle , from whence issued a voice , that said , `` I am that famous necromancer , the great magician of Europe . 
I caused myself to be cut in pieces by one of my servants , and shut up in this vessel , expecting my members would re-unite , and my body be renewed in its pristine youth ; I know not whether the secret was false , or if he neglected to follow strictly my orders ; but after boiling a long time , I formed only a gross , misshapen , and lifeless mass . '' 
`` You then were of opinion , '' said death , `` that the soul was but a subtle fire ; a flame that could animate your body , and repair itself ! '' 
`` Yes , '' answered the necromancer . 
`` Close the vessel again , '' said Death . 
When all the by-standers had been heard , they were required to put their names upon a great book ; and while they were writing , I saw the bottle move towards me . 
The necromancer within immediately commenced a conversation with me ; inquiring , `` who reigns in Spain ? 
Does Venice yet exist ? 
What is the news in France ? 
Are the Calvinists constantly triumphant ? '' 
I answered him , `` Philip IV . 
reigns in Spain ; Venice is still beautiful , rich , and powerful : the Calvinists and their king are always invincible . '' 
He then besought me to break the bottle . 
As I hesitated , not being without certain qualms of fear , it swelled , and burst of itself . 
I then saw what it had contained expand into a human form , and rising up , resumed the discourse in this manner : -- `` As it is impossible for me to return again into the world , place us henceforth among the dead magicians . '' 
In the place of the bottle , there appeared an old man with a great head and a long beard : he was of a grave mein , and held a globe in his hand . 
`` I am , '' said he , `` Nestradamus , that great French astrologer , who predicted , during my life , every thing that has since happened . '' 
`` How , '' said I , `` are you he that composed those famous centuries , which , after death , were found in your tomb ? 
Resolve me , I pray you , one of your prophecies now in my mind : -- ``` The sign of Aries shall the world command ; Taurus shall rule the waves and solid land ; Mother and sire the virgin shall deceive , The mother 's breasts the tender twins shall leave . 
''' `` That , '' said the astrologer , `` is as clear as the light of day ; and signifies , that married men shall frequently resemble rams : the love of woman , represented by the bull , shall mingle itself with affairs of every kind ; the daughter divert herself spite of the advice of her father , and the sons laugh at maternal expostulation . '' 
`` And this , what is its signification ? '' 
demanded I : -- ``` Mothers soon shall children bear , Who to name no sire shall dare ; None of all the babes they bear , E'er shall lack a father 's care . 
''' `` That is equally easy of explanation . 
I wish to convey the idea , that many children shall call those fathers , who are not so ; and shall have fathers whom they will never discover . '' 
He would have departed , after explaining these two prophecies ; but I stopped him , entreating him only to tell me the meaning of this last : -- ``` Before another year is born , Many a goose quill shall be worn ; Many a quill the ether bear , Many a man shall dance in air ; Men shall sorely rue the attack , Of grey goose quill and Doctor Quack ; Merchants be in bankrupt plight , Nobles turn to blackguards quite ; Province , city , town , and village , Soon shall soldiers sack and pillage ; Lads and lasses soon shall try , What darkness hides from every eye ; No more shall widows ' weeds endure ; The cloister virgins shall immure . 
''' `` That signifies , '' said Nostradamus , who was in haste to depart , `` that one half of the world shall pillage the other ; the people of justice shall rob by their pen ; false witnesses will support themselves by hanging upon their skirts ; the physicians will kill with physic , and be well paid for it ; the merchants thrive by bankruptcy ; nobles shall be ruined by their stewards ; the soldiers will lay all under contribution ; children shall rob one another ; widows contract new nuptials , and to enjoy the portions of their daughters , make nuns of them . 
Let go ! '' 
-- and he hastily left me . 
I then perceived before me a good old man , of a very sad aspect , who demanded if I was dead ? 
`` No , '' answered I ; `` living , and at your service . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said he ; `` I expect a favour of you . 
You must know , I am called They . 
I also bear the appellation of Somebody , of Another , of a certain Personage , of Author , and of I know who . 
While I lived in the world , I was accused of having said and done every thing which could not be traced : if a false report was circulated , it was they who had broached it : if any one was found assassinated in the high way , it was they who had killed him : if there was a man with a bad face , this was somebody : if it was imprudent to name a person in an affair , they called him a certain person : if a writer advanced bold things , this was an author , who had spoken on the first impression : and , finally , when the author was entirely concealed , it was I know who , that had said or acted thus and so . 
All this time I neither said nor did any thing ; I appeared no where ; I knew not what passed , and kept house both day and night ; the chagrin of seeing myself in so bad repute , fairly put an end to my existence . 
I demand , therefore , of you , to vindicate me to your friends , and those persons over whom you have any influence , that they may not in future charge me with any thing ; for , since I am dead , I can of course have nothing more to do with the world . '' 
I promised the old gentleman I would remember what he desired , and he retired contented . 
At this moment a young woman coming up to me , fell upon my neck , exclaiming , `` My dear Æneas , have you at length arrived ! 
I have for a long time wished to see you . 
Virgil hath spoken very illy of you : he has published a history of our loves , which we knew nothing of : I have sought you among all the dead , without being able to find you ; but I know , from your air , that you are Æneas ; for , as you have been the greatest and most illustrious of heroes , so here you surpass all the dead in demeanour and beauty . '' 
As the surprise I felt at this unmerited compliment prevented answer , she continued to speak , and embraced me so vehemently , that I was compelled to cry out . 
`` Peace , there ! '' 
commanded the officer of the chamber , who was called Silence . 
I still continued to bawl out ; and said to Madame Dido , `` O Queen of Carthage ! 
will you not be undeceived ? 
I am Don Francisco de Quevedo de Villegas , Chevalier of the order of Saint James ! '' 
`` Behold ! '' 
replied the queen , `` behold this drunkard , who , being a Trojan , would fain pass himself off for a Spaniard ! 
Go , pious Æneas ; Virgil hath done thee no great wrong in describing thee as thou art . 
Where is thy Palladium ? 
thy nurse ? 
thy son Ascanias ? 
where are thy companions ? 
why are you here without attendants ? '' 
`` Be not disquieted , '' said I : `` address yourself to Charon ; he would know you as well as Æneas , who abandoned you in Africa ; that was a meet punishment for your prudery : but you have not yet been able to forget a man , who surrendered his native city to the Greeks , and fled from his ruined country . 
You are a victim of love ! '' 
`` And you , '' said she , retiring , `` are very credulous ! '' 
The officer again commanded silence , and before I had time to add any thing more , I saw approaching a dead person of great size , with horns upon his head , and who ran towards me as though he was going to strike with them . 
I stretched out my arms to defend myself , and perceiving near me a large fork , that supported the tapestry , I took it in my hand , and firmly awaited his onset . 
`` Do you recognize , '' said he , `` Don Diego Moreno , whom you have called in your poems Signor Cornuto ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied I ; `` and to convince you , that I neither fear you , living nor dead , take in advance a blow with this fork ; '' and at that endeavoured to run him through , but his bones were too hard . 
Moreno then gave me a blow with his head , and casting himself upon me , threw me down : I stuck to his sides , inserting my fingers into the openings beneath the sternum , and as he arose , came up with him . 
This noise causing considerable confusion in the assembly , I saw coming upon me , a great number of the dead , armed in the same manner with Moreno ; and as they pressed upon one another , each anxious to pass his neighbour , their bones made a very curious clicking . 
In the mean time , others marshalled themselves in front , to protect me from their assault . 
During these transactions , Death sat upon her throne in silence , attentive only to the inscription of her subjects names ; and as the secretaries happened to finish at a moment when there was a slight cessation in our tumult , the officer cried -- `` Peace -- listen ! '' 
I seized this occasion to demand justice of the queen . 
`` I supplicate your sovereign majesty , '' said I , `` to do me justice on Diego Moreno , who has insulted me in this palace ; striking me with his horns , knocking me down , and exciting against me the whole host of cuckolds . '' 
`` What defence do you make to this accusation , Moreno ? '' 
asked the queen . 
`` Mighty and wan princess , '' replied he , `` behold the man who caused me to pass in the world as a Vulcan , or a faun : I have always lived pleasantly with my wife , never objecting to the French method , of receiving at her house priests , soldiers , lawyers , politicians , merchants , and strangers of every country . 
As the house had a great deal of good company , where nothing was wanting , although my wife was no expense to me , I found it very convenient ; and because I profited by the follies of others , because I made that a part of my revenue , because I took advantage of my wife 's friends , to amass an estate for my children , the chevalier Quevedo derided me , rendering me ridiculous by his poems , and representing me as the prince of accommodating husbands ; he called me a ram , and made me one of the signs of the zodiac : not content with that , he even comes hither , and strikes me with a fork . 
I demand that he should be retained here , and that he be put in a situation during his slumbers , that will effectually prevent his waking . '' 
`` Which of the two began the affray ? '' 
said Death . 
`` It was I , '' answered Moreno . 
`` We ordain then , that the name and memory of Moreno shall never be forgotten in Spain ; that his grave shall be opened , and his compatriots , if any yet exist , shall make a pilgrimage , to render homage to his ashes . '' 
After that , they called over the names of the dead ; and as they were called , they answered adsum , `` I am here . '' 
Hearing my own name pronounced , which was also that of my uncle and god-father , I answered , as the others , adsum ; at which mistake Moreno taking advantage to laugh at me , I hit him a heavy blow with my fist upon his head ; but I hurt myself more than him , for I almost broke my fingers . 
Moreno cast himself upon me ; I stood firm , and thus we were again engaged in a new combat . 
They endeavoured to separate us , but I had entangled my hands in such a manner , in the bones of his arms , that I could not withdraw them ; and as they pulled me on one side , and him on the other , it gave me such exquisite pain , that I awoke , happy and thankful to find myself in my bed . 
I reviewed in my mind all I had seen and heard , and which is here reported . 
This vision made such a forcible impression upon my imagination , that I yet seem to behold the palace of death , the audience of the dead , and Moreno pouncing upon me : finally , I made many reflections upon what I had seen . 
It is but too true , that all mankind must die ; that we are surrounded with constant peril ; that there is but one thing that can insure a tranquil death , and that is , a blameless life . 
But to live well , one must often think of death . 
I believe the dream I have just rehearsed , was inspired by heaven ; for otherwise I should hardly have thought upon my latter end , not even when my life was peculiarly exposed amidst wars and battle . 
At present , I reflect without ceasing ; I have totally abandoned trifling and poetry , which are synonymous ; and , thanks to God , have more satisfaction in reading books of devotion , than romances and histories . 
I have read in Homer , that dreams come from Jupiter ; and that this can not be doubted , especially when they regard things of importance . 
I verily believe those of kings and princes proceed from on high : but I will substitute the true God in place of Jupiter , who is but a fabulous divinity . 
The vision I had last year , could not have been derived from any other than a heavenly source . 
Behold the events that passed : I was reading the book of the blessed Hypolitus , which treats of the end of the world , and of the coming of God , to judge the quick and the dead , the just and the unjust . 
I fell asleep over this book , sitting in a large easy chair . 
All at once , I thought I saw a noble young man , of extraordinary beauty , flying through the air , having at his mouth a trumpet , that sounded far and wide . 
When he had made five or six great circuits , I perceived soldiers starting from their graves , full of courageous animation , thinking they heard the signal of battle . 
Upon the other hand , the misers started up , in terror , lest thieves had come to rob . 
The courtiers imagined that they enjoyed the agitations of the ring , or of a carousal . 
No one had the least idea that it announced the last judgment . 
I was strongly tempted to laugh at seeing the maimed , the one-eyed , the blind , seeking the one their arms or legs , and the other their eyes . 
I was equally amused , to perceive the clerks unwilling to resume their heads , the slanderers their tongues , and the old women their throats . 
After all these had come forth , and arrived in an immense and smooth valley , very proper for so grand a spectacle , I saw appear people of every art and trade ; likewise the men of letters , among whose ranks there appeared a very considerable embarrassment . 
Each community placed itself separately ; each religion had also its sectaries apart : such as Christians , Jews , Mahometans , Pagans , Heretics , and Schismatics . 
All the people being classed and placed , a judge presented himself , accompanied by twelve counsellors , who seated themselves near his throne ; beneath them were the prophets , in the capacity of advocates . 
Immediately a loud flourish of trumpets was heard , as if an army of cavalry approached , and legions of shining angels appeared , who poised themselves with their wings , above those men to whom they had been guardians . 
That done , the archangel Michael , came and placed himself at the foot of the throne , upon which the judge was seated , having in his hand a naked sword , and beneath his feet a prostrate devil , as he is represented in churches , and called the auditors each by his name . 
Adam answered first ; he was accused by his demon , with having eaten an apple , contrary to the commands of his God ; with having neglected the gifts he had received at his creation ; with having cast the blame upon his wife ; with having had a bad son , and of other faults which I do not distinctly remember . 
But I very well recollect , that these reproaches produced such confusion in him , that he could answer nothing : his good angel answered for him ; he confessed the matters of which his party was accused ; he set forth the excess and duration of his penitence ; the agonies he had suffered from the decree that involved his posterity , the goods which God had seen born of his sin ; in fine , he pleaded with such ability , that his client was acquitted . 
When they called Judas , Herod , and Pilate , their crimes were so glaring , that they could neither defend themselves , nor would any angel speak in their favour ; and they were accordingly condemned . 
After them , were examined the most noted heretics , and neither could they obtain pardon . 
Presently there appeared a number of pagan philosophers , among whom , I distinguished the seven sages of Greece , with Plato , Zeno , Socrates , Aristotle , and others : there were also Mercury , Trismegistus , an Egyptian , Sanconianthon , a Phenician , and Confucius , a Chinese . 
The majority of these avowed , that they had adored no other than the true God . 
The judge demanded , if they had given him all the glory , and rendered to him all the honour that was his due . 
They answered nothing , and were not exculpated . 
The corps of artists next presented themselves : some of them were justified , but by far the greatest part were condemned for larcenies , frauds , surprises , and infidelities . 
The men of letters then had their turn : many of them were charged with having taught and written contrary to their real opinions . 
The poets made every one laugh , on asserting , that when they spoke of Jupiter , of gods and goddesses , they meant the true God , saints , and saintesses : that they had never seriously deified the king of Candia , nor the first king of Egypt , nor the queens of Cyprus and Sicily ; that if these people had become idolaters , they ought to take the blame upon themselves . 
Virgil in particular , was examined very minutely upon that passage of his poems , where he invokes the Sicilian muses : he pretended to have spoken of the birth of the Messiah ; but he was answered that he must then have been in the soul of the Son of Pollio . 
Orpheus was accused by the ladies of Thrace , because he had taught men a love that did not concern them . 
The clerks , lawyers , and constables , applied to Saint Ives de Chartres , to plead their cause ; but he refused , saying , he had never been a robber , but had always pursued the cause of truth and justice , and that they had not acted in that manner . 
The devils also accusing them of having often been corrupted by presents , and the solicitations of women ; few among them escaped . 
After these , the physicians , surgeons , and apothecaries , were brought forward : they justified themselves by the authority of Hippocrates , Galen , and Paracelsus ; but those whom they summoned , mocked at them , and their allegations . 
`` And who are they , '' demanded those eminent physicians , `` who have cited us , and presume to shelter themselves behind our example ? '' 
The unhappy accused then sought the assistance of their two saints , Come and Damiens ; but they refused to defend homicides , and judgment of condemnation was accordingly pronounced . 
As it is out of my power to follow all the judgments in their order , I shall report only those that appeared most worthy of note . 
A fencing master , being unwilling to approach the bar , an angel extended his arm to seize him ; but the master , throwing himself into an attitude , made a fanciful push towards the angel , telling him at the same time , that from such a thrust with the small sword , he would have received a mortal wound ; that all those who had taken lessons of him , never failed to kill their man , and that he himself had always been victorious , till he met with his physician . 
At last , constrained by force , he was brought forward and convicted of all the homicides committed by his scholars , who , confident in their skill , had often sought quarrels , for the purpose of putting their theory in practice . 
For these offences it was decreed that he should go into hell in a perpendicular line . 
`` Zounds , '' said the master , `` I will go as I may , but not in a perpendicular line ; I am not a mathematician . '' 
`` How , '' said the angel , `` do you wish to go ? '' 
`` In making leaps backward before the mouth of hell . '' 
`` Not quite so much subtlety , '' said the devil ; `` I will make you obedient ; '' and he carried him into the abyss , that was at the extremity of the valley . 
This man gave place to a great astrologer , whom his angel endeavoured to bring before the tribunal : he was loaded with almanacs , globes , spheres , astrolabes , compasses , quadrants , rules , and papers , filled with astronomical calculations . 
`` You are mistaken , '' said he to the angel ; `` the last judgment has not yet arrived , because the constellation of Saturn , and that of fear , have not yet finished their courses ; it ought not to arrive in less than twenty-four thousand years ; for God hath not created the universe and the celestial globes , not to permit them to finish their journeys ; and there is yet no appearance of an union of the sun and stars , to set fire to the world , as must necessarily happen at the last day . 
I appeal , then , in advance , against all other judgments . '' 
`` March , '' said the devil , `` or I shall carry you . '' 
`` Carry me , '' said the astronomer , `` into the kingdom of the moon ; I will reward you well ; I am curious to see those beautiful countries , we discover with our telescopes ; the countries of Galileo , of Copernicus , of Tycho Brahe , and other celebrated astronomers , who are gone to dwell in the moon , and who have bestowed their names upon those regions they inhabit . '' 
The discourse of this fool , did not prevent an accusation before the judge , of irreligion , superstition , and other vices which he could not dispute . 
I then saw an operator , who , imagining himself to be in a proper place for vending his drugs , praised the properties of his orrietan , and the virtues of his counter-poisons . 
When he came before his judges , he was desirous of trying some experiments , and demanded if he should use realgal , arsenic , or the blood of toads and spiders . 
The devil , who stood at his side , asked him if he had any fire ointment . 
`` How , '' said he , `` are you in want ? '' 
`` It is yourself that will soon need it , '' answered the devil ; `` because you have cheated so many people with your lies and knaveries . '' 
He was confounded at this discourse , and was led away to hell . 
When they were close by , he said to the devil , `` I perceive the jest ; you keep here the feast of Peter ; I am not so much alarmed as you think : let us go , let us go , '' said he , entering into hell , `` let us go and see Don Peter . '' 
There then came a troop of tailors , the chief one of whom diverted me much : he had a pair of scissors in his hand , and a long slip of parchment , with which he took measure for garments . 
Perceiving me , he stepped up and proposed to make me a coat in the French fashion : I assured him that I had no need of such a garment ; but he ran round me , insisting upon taking my measure . 
I observed that it was then no time to transact such business ; that he was before his judge , and had better invoke his guardian angel : but the angel advised him to plead his own cause , as he could not conscientiously defend a case so obvious . 
`` Signor , '' answered the tailor , `` I engage to give you a suit every year , gratis ; for it is doubtless for lack of tailors , that you angels go always naked . '' 
`` Without dispute ; '' replied the angel , `` for there is not a single tailor in heaven . '' 
`` Very well , '' resumed the tailor ; `` I go then in person , to defend myself and brethren . 
We have never stolen more stuff than we could put into our eyes ; we threw the useless pieces into the street ; we have always measured the trimmings of gold and silver , after finishing the suit , and took no more than was absolutely necessary . 
As to the rest , our trade is one inculcating mercy ; to clothe the naked , and furnish a defence from the cold ; meritoriously following the gospel precept : thus have we acted , besides suffering patiently the prejudice the embroiderers have done us in making the habits of the church . 
I demand that Saint Martin , archbishop of Tours , who gave the moiety of his mantle to a poor beggar , should be heard in our behalf . '' 
`` Saint Martin , '' said one of the angels , `` hath never been the protector of tailors ; and so far would he be from defending you , that he would condemn you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
well , '' said the tailor , `` oblige us by being yourself our interlocutor . '' 
`` I consent , '' replied he , `` and will quickly expose the tricks of your trade : the tailors have in their shops a private drawer , which they call the eye ; and it is there they deposit what they steal . 
The under part of their table and its immediate neighbourhood , they call the street ; and here they cast the superfluous stuffs : so when this master cheat asserted , he had never stolen more than might have been contained in his eye , or that he threw into the street the waste pieces of cloth , or stuff , it was equivalent to saying , that , he had never taken more than might be put into his drawer , or beneath his table . 
As to the trimmings of gold and silver , it is true , they are measured upon the garment , but then it is found after the chain of binding is cut , that it stretches very easily . 
When he said that his trade was merciful and charitable , he spoke the truth , if these are the attributes of thieves : but I demand , if , without pillaging cloth , they could ornament chambers with rich tapestry , build fine houses , give portions to their daughters , bear the extravagancies of their children , give sumptuous entertainments , and enjoy all the luxuries of life ? '' 
`` No , no , '' simultaneously exclaimed the whole assembly . 
The corps of tailors was accordingly condemned , and they were precipitated into the abyss . 
When all the judgments had been pronounced , the judge , his counsellors , the angels , and the elect , launched forth into the air , and ascended to heaven , amid an harmonious concert of trumpets , and other instruments . 
Those who remained in the valley , and had not been sent to hell , were in despair , because they were not able to follow the array of the blessed . 
When the celestial throng had wholly disappeared , a most horrid tumult ensued : the planets fell from their orbits , the mountains came together with dreadful washings , the earth gaped , and all who remained fell into the abyss , uttering such piercing shrieks that I was seized with terror . 
I awoke , and felt the most lively pleasure to find myself out of danger . 
I reflected afterwards upon the multitude of the guilty , and the small number adjudged innocent . 
Oh , how necessary it is , that all the living should experience a similar vision , that they might be witnesses of the disorder , of the despair , and torments of the damned . 
It would suffice also to exemplify the piteous confusion , which can neither be expressed nor comprehended , that will not fail to happen at the last day . 
I am not now surprised that the Israelites , at the foot of Mount Sinai , could not endure the noise of the thunder that resounded from its summit . 
ON the fourth day of January , I had passed the evening in the company of some beautiful and amiable young ladies . 
Contrary to my usual custom of retiring at an early hour , I sat up late , amusing myself and trifling with these ladies , which brought to my imagination , during sleep , the most delightful images . 
I fancied I heard a voice , which recited these verses , borrowed by Virgil from Theocritus : `` What phrensy , shepherd has thy soul possess 'd ? 
Thy vineyard lies half prun 'd , and half undress 'd , Quench , Corydon , thy long unanswered fire ; Mind what the common wants of life require . 
On willow twigs employ thy weaving care ; And find an easier love , though not so fair . '' 
I am ignorant by what paths I was conducted , but I suddenly found myself in a most delightful country , such as the poets are wont to describe the isle of Cyprus and the gardens of Love ; it was bordered by two little rivers , one of which was sweet , and the other bitter water . 
These waters , conducted by a subterranean canal , united in a great basin of white marble , placed in the middle of a garden . 
After I had promenaded a little , to admire the beauty of the trees , and respire the perfume of the flowers , I entered into a long and magnificent walk , planted with citrons and oranges : upon each side were arbours , adorned interiorly with paintings and sculpture , and surrounded without by jessamines , laurels , honeysuckles , and other shrubs . 
At the extremity of this walk , there appeared , in perspective , a large and superb edifice , which was called the Palace of Love . 
The porticoes were of the Doric order : upon the pedestals , the bases , the columns , the cornices , the friezes , the architraves , and the chapters , were , in half relief , little cupids , who disported themselves in all sorts of gambols . 
There was written upon the gate in letters of gold upon a black ground , this inscription : -- ` Behold the palace of the happy , The abode of lovers . ' 
The custody of the gate was committed to a woman of a nymph like appearance : her name was Beauty . 
She was tall and well proportioned : her features were regular , and her whole appearance so seducing , that her name seemed to answer her description exactly . 
Her garments were magnificent , but their transparency permitted the sight of charms that eclipsed the light . 
The whiteness of the snow would have yielded to the whiteness of her bosom : in a word , she had about her that , I know not what , of enchantment , which no pencil could delineate , or language describe . 
She made me so gracious a salutation , that I was emboldened to request of her a conductor , to show me the apartments of the palace . 
`` Address yourself , '' said she , `` to the Introducer ; he is lodged in this wing , '' motioning me with her right hand to the left side of the edifice . 
I thanked her , and went in quest of the Introducer , who was at the same time the Inspector of this smiling country . 
I perceived in him an old man with a long beard . 
He received me with great civility ; and having signified to him my desire , he told me that he would himself conduct me to the foot of the throne of the Queen . 
He girded upon his thigh instead of a sword , along sharp scythe .
