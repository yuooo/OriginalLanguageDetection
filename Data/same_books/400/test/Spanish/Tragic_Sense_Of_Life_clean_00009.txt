For Leibnitz this world is the best because it conspires to perpetuate consciousness , and , together with consciousness , will , because intelligence increases will and perfects it , because the end of man is the contemplation of God ; while for Schopenhauer this world is the worst of all possible worlds , because it conspires to destroy will , because intelligence , representation , nullifies the will that begot it . 
And similarly Franklin , who believed in another life , asserted that he was willing to live this life over again , the life that he had actually lived , `` from its beginning to the end '' ; while Leopardi , who did not believe in another life , asserted that nobody would consent to live his life over again . 
These two views of life are not merely ethical , but religious ; and the feeling of moral good , in so far as it is a teleological value , is of religious origin also . 
And to return to our interrogations : Shall not all be saved , shall not all be made eternal , and eternal not in suffering but in happiness , those whom we call good and those whom we call bad alike ? 
And as regards this question of good and evil , does not the malice of him who judges enter in ? 
Is the badness in the intention of him who does the deed or is it not rather in that of him who judges it to be bad ? 
But the terrible thing is that man judges himself , creates himself his own judge . 
Who then shall be saved ? 
And now the imagination puts forth another possibility -- neither more nor less rational than all those which have just been put forward interrogatively -- and that is that only those are saved who have longed to be saved , that only those are eternalized who have lived in an agony of hunger for eternity and for eternalization . 
He who desires never to die and believes that he shall never die in the spirit , desires it because he deserves it , or rather , only he desires personal immortality who carries his immortality within him . 
The man who does not long passionately , and with a passion that triumphs over all the dictates of reason , for his own immortality , is the man who does not deserve it , and because he does not deserve it he does not long for it . 
And it is no injustice not to give a man that which he does not know how to desire , for `` ask , and it shall be given you . '' 
It may be that to each will be given that which he desired . 
And perhaps the sin against the Holy Ghost -- for which , according to the Evangelist , there is no remission -- is none other than that of not desiring God , not longing to be made eternal . 
As is your sort of mind So is your sort of search ; you 'll find What you desire , and that 's to be A Christian , said Robert Browning in Christmas Eve and Easter Day . 
In his Inferno Dante condemned the Epicureans , those who did not believe in another life , to something more terrible than the not having it , and that is the consciousness of not having it , and this he expressed in plastic form by picturing them shut up in their tombs for all eternity , without light , without air , without fire , without movement , without life -LRB- Inferno , x. , 10-15 -RRB- . 
What cruelty is there in denying to a man that which he did not or could not desire ? 
In the sixth book of his Æneid -LRB- 426-429 -RRB- the gentle Virgil makes us hear the plaintive voices and sobbing of the babes who weep upon the threshold of Hades , Continuo àuditæ voces , vagitus et ingens , Infantumque animæ flentes in limine primo , unhappy in that they had but entered upon life and never known the sweetness of it , and whom , torn from their mothers ' breasts , a dark day had cut off and drowned in bitter death -- Quos dulcis vitæ exsortes et at ubere raptos Abstulit atra dies et funere mersit acerbo . 
But what life did they lose , if they neither knew life nor longed for it ? 
And yet is it true that they never longed for it ? 
It may be said that others craved life on their behalf , that their parents longed for them to be eternal to the end that they might be gladdened by them in paradise . 
And so a fresh field is opened up for the imagination -- namely , the consideration of the solidarity and representivity of eternal salvation . 
There are many , indeed , who imagine the human race as one being , a collective and solidary individual , in whom each member may represent or may come to represent the total collectivity ; and they imagine salvation as something collective . 
As something collective also , merit , and as something collective sin , and redemption . 
According to this mode of feeling and imagining , either all are saved or none is saved ; redemption is total and it is mutual ; each man is his neighbour 's Christ . 
And is there not perhaps a hint of this in the popular Catholic belief with regard to souls in purgatory , the belief that the living may devote suffrages and apply merits to the souls of their dead ? 
This sense of the transmission of merits , both to the living and the dead , is general in popular Catholic piety . 
Nor should it be forgotten that in the history of man 's religious thought there has often presented itself the idea of an immortality restricted to a certain number of the elect , spirits representative of the rest and in a certain sense including them ; an idea of pagan derivation -- for such were the heroes and demi-gods -- which sometimes shelters itself behind the pronouncement that there are many that are called and few that are chosen . 
Recently , while I was engaged upon this essay , there came into my hands the third edition of the Dialogue sur la vie et sur la mort , by Charles Bonnefon , a book in which imaginative conceptions similar to those that I have been setting forth find succinct and suggestive expression . 
The soul can not live without the body , Bonnefon says , nor the body without the soul , and thus neither birth nor death has any real existence -- strictly speaking , there is no body , no soul , no birth , no death , all of which are abstractions and appearances , but only a thinking life , of which we form part and which can neither be born nor die . 
Hence he is led to deny human individuality and to assert that no one can say `` I am '' but only `` we are , '' or , more correctly , `` there is in us . '' 
It is humanity , the species , that thinks and loves in us . 
And souls are transmitted in the same way that bodies are transmitted . 
`` The living thought or the thinking life which we are will find itself again immediately in a form analogous to that which was our origin and corresponding with our being in the womb of a pregnant woman . '' 
Each of us , therefore , has lived before and will live again , although he does not know it . 
`` If humanity is gradually raised above itself , when the last man dies , the man who will contain all the rest of mankind in himself , who shall say that he may not have arrived at that higher order of humanity such as exists elsewhere , in heaven ? 
... As we are all bound together in solidarity , we shall all , little by little , gather the fruits of our travail . '' 
According to this mode of imagining and thinking , since nobody is born , nobody dies , no single soul has finished its struggle but many times has been plunged into the midst of the human struggle `` ever since the type of embryo corresponding with the same consciousness was represented in the succession of human phenomena . '' 
It is obvious that since Bonnefon begins by denying personal individuality , he leaves out of account our real longing , which is to save our individuality ; but on the other hand , since he , Bonnefon , is a personal individual and feels this longing , he has recourse to the distinction between the called and the chosen , and to the idea of representative spirits , and he concedes to a certain number of men this representative individual immortality . 
Of these elect he says that `` they will be somewhat more necessary to God than we ourselves . '' 
And he closes this splendid dream by supposing that `` it is not impossible that we shall arrive by a series of ascensions at the supreme happiness , and that our life shall be merged in the perfect Life as a drop of water in the sea . 
Then we shall understand , '' he continues , `` that everything was necessary , that every philosophy and every religion had its hour of truth , and that in all our wanderings and errors and in the darkest moments of our history we discerned the light of the distant beacon , and that we were all predestined to participate in the Eternal Light . 
And if the God whom we shall find again possesses a body -- and we can not conceive a living God without a body -- we , together with each of the myriads of races that the myriads of suns have brought forth , shall be the conscious cells of his body . 
If this dream should be fulfilled , an ocean of love would beat upon our shores and the end of every life would be to add a drop of water to this ocean 's infinity . '' 
And what is this cosmic dream of Bonnefon 's but the plastic representation of the Pauline apocatastasis ? 
Yes , this dream , which has its origin far back in the dawn of Christianity , is fundamentally the same as the Pauline anacefaleosis , the fusion of all men in Man , in the whole of Humanity embodied in a Person , who is Christ , and the fusion not only of all men but of all things , and the subsequent subjection of all things to God , in order that God , Consciousness , may be all in all . 
And this supposes a collective redemption and a society beyond the grave . 
In the middle of the eighteenth century , two pietists of Protestant origin , Johann Jakob Moser and Friedrich Christoph Oetinger , gave a new force and value to the Pauline anacefaleosis . 
Moser `` declared that his religion consisted not in holding certain doctrines to be true and in living a virtuous life conformably therewith , but in being reunited to God through Christ . 
But this demands the thorough knowledge -- a knowledge that goes on increasing until the end of life -- of one 's own sins and also of the mercy and patience of God , the transformation of all natural feelings , the appropriation of the atonement wrought by the death of Christ , the enjoyment of peace with God in the permanent witness of the Holy Spirit to the remission of sins , the ordering of life according to the pattern of Christ , which is the fruit of faith alone , the drawing near to God and the intercourse of the soul with Him , the disposition to die in grace and the joyful expectation of the Judgement which will bestow blessedness in the more intimate enjoyment of God and in the commerce with all the saints '' -LRB- Ritschl , Geschichte des Pietismus , vol . 
iii. , § 43 -RRB- . 
The commerce with all the saints -- that is to say , the eternal human society . 
And for his part , Oetinger considers eternal happiness not as the contemplation of God in His infinitude , but , taking the Epistle to the Ephesians as his authority , as the contemplation of God in the harmony of the creature with Christ . 
The commerce with all the saints was , according to him , essential to the content of eternal happiness . 
It was the realization of the kingdom of God , which thus comes to be the kingdom of Man . 
And in his exposition of these doctrines of the two pietists , Ritschl confesses -LRB- op . 
cit . 
, iii. , § 46 -RRB- that both witnesses have with these doctrines contributed something to Protestantism that is of like value with the theological method of Spener , another pietist . 
We see , therefore , that the Christian , mystical , inward longing ever since St. Paul , has been to give human finality , or divine finality , to the Universe , to save human consciousness , and to save it by converting all humanity into a person . 
This longing is expressed in the anacefaleosis , the gathering together of all things , all things in earth and in heaven , the visible and the invisible , in Christ , and also in the apocatastasis , the return of all things to God , to consciousness , in order that God may be all in all . 
And does not God 's being all in all mean that all things shall acquire consciousness and that in this consciousness everything that has happened will come to life again , and that everything that has existed in time will be eternalized ? 
And within the all , all individual consciousnesses , those which have been , those that are , and those that will be , and as they have been , as they are , and as they will be , will exist in a condition of society and solidarity . 
But does not this awakening to consciousness of everything that has been , necessarily involve a fusion of the identical , an amalgamation of like things ? 
In this conversion of the human race into a true society in Christ , a communion of saints , a kingdom of heaven , will not individual differences , tainted as they are with deceit and even with sin , be obliterated , and in the perfect society will that alone remain of each man which was the essential part of him ? 
Would it not perhaps result , according to Bonnefon 's supposition , that this consciousness that lived in the twentieth century in this corner of this earth would feel itself to be the same with other such consciousnesses as have lived in other centuries and perhaps in other worlds ? 
And how can we conceive of an effective and real union , a substantial and intimate union , soul with soul , of all those who have been ? 
If any two creatures grew into one They would do more than the world has done , said Browning in The Flight of the Duchess ; and Christ has told us that where two or three are gathered together in His name , there is He in the midst of them . 
Heaven , then , so it is believed by many , is society , a more perfect society than that of this world ; it is human society fused into a person . 
And there are not wanting some who believe that the tendency of all human progress is the conversion of our species into one collective being with real consciousness -- is not perhaps an individual human organism a kind of confederation of cells ? 
-- and that when it shall have acquired full consciousness , all those who have existed will come to life again in it . 
Heaven , so many think , is society . 
Just as no one can live in isolation , so no one can survive in isolation . 
No one can enjoy God in heaven who sees his brother suffering in hell , for the sin and the merit were common to both . 
We think with the thoughts of others and we feel with the feelings of others . 
To see God when God shall be all in all is to see all things in God and to live in God with all things . 
This splendid dream of the final solidarity of mankind is the Pauline anacefaleosis and apocatastasis . 
We Christians , said the Apostle -LRB- I Cor . 
xii . 
27 -RRB- are the body of Christ , members of Him , flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone -LRB- Eph . 
v. 30 -RRB- , branches of the vine . 
But in this final solidarization , in this true and supreme Christination of all creatures , what becomes of each individual consciousness ? 
what becomes of Me , of this poor fragile I , this I that is the slave of time and space , this I which reason tells me is a mere passing accident , but for the saving of which I live and suffer and hope and believe ? 
Granting that the human finality of the Universe is saved , that consciousness is saved , would I resign myself to make the sacrifice of this poor I , by which and by which alone I know this finality and this consciousness ? 
And here , facing this supreme religious sacrifice , we reach the summit of the tragedy , the very heart of it -- the sacrifice of our own individual consciousness upon the altar of the perfected Human Consciousness , of the Divine Consciousness . 
But is there really a tragedy ? 
If we could attain to a clear vision of this anacefaleosis , if we could succeed in understanding and feeling that we were going to enrich Christ , should we hesitate for a moment in surrendering ourselves utterly to Him ? 
Would the stream that flows into the sea , and feels in the freshness of its waters the bitterness of the salt of the ocean , wish to flow back to its source ? 
would it wish to return to the cloud which drew its life from the sea ? 
is not its joy to feel itself absorbed ? 
And yet ... . 
Yes , in spite of everything , this is the climax of the tragedy . 
And the soul , my soul at least , longs for something else , not absorption , not quietude , not peace , not appeasement , it longs ever to approach and never to arrive , it longs for a never-ending longing , for an eternal hope which is eternally renewed but never wholly fulfilled . 
And together with all this , it longs for an eternal lack of something and an eternal suffering . 
A suffering , a pain , thanks to which it grows without ceasing in consciousness and in longing . 
Do not write upon the gate of heaven that sentence which Dante placed over the threshold of hell , Lasciate ogni speranza ! 
Do not destroy time ! 
Our life is a hope which is continually converting itself into memory and memory in its turn begets hope . 
Give us leave to live ! 
The eternity that is like an eternal present , without memory and without hope , is death . 
Thus do ideas exist , but not thus do men live . 
Thus do ideas exist in the God-Idea , but not thus can men live in the living God , in the God-Man . 
An eternal purgatory , then , rather than a heaven of glory ; an eternal ascent . 
If there is an end of all suffering , however pure and spiritualized we may suppose it to be , if there is an end of all desire , what is it that makes the blessed in paradise go on living ? 
If in paradise they do not suffer for want of God , how shall they love Him ? 
And if even there , in the heaven of glory , while they behold God little by little and closer and closer , yet without ever wholly attaining to Him , there does not always remain something more for them to know and desire , if there does not always remain a substratum of doubt , how shall they not fall asleep ? 
Or , to sum up , if in heaven there does not remain something of this innermost tragedy of the soul , what sort of a life is that ? 
Is there perhaps any greater joy than that of remembering misery -- and to remember it is to feel it -- in time of felicity ? 
Does not the prison haunt the freed prisoner ? 
Does he not miss his former dreams of liberty ? 
* * * * * Mythological dreams ! 
it will be said . 
And I have not pretended that they are anything else . 
But has not the mythological dream its content of truth ? 
Are not dream and myth perhaps revelations of an inexpressible truth , of an irrational truth , of a truth that can not be proven ? 
Mythology ! 
Perhaps ; but , as in the days of Plato , we must needs mythologize when we come to deal with the other life . 
But we have just seen that whenever we seek to give a form that is concrete , conceivable , or in other words , rational , to our primary , primordial , and fundamental longing for an eternal life conscious of itself and of its personal individuality , esthetic , logical , and ethical absurdities are multiplied and there is no way of conceiving the beatific vision and the apocatastasis that is free from contradictions and inconsistencies . 
And nevertheless ! 
... Nevertheless , yes , we must needs long for it , however absurd it may appear to us ; nay , more , we must needs believe in it , in some way or another , in order that we may live . 
In order that we may live , eh ? 
not in order that we may understand the Universe . 
We must needs believe in it , and to believe in it is to be religious . 
Christianity , the only religion which we Europeans of the twentieth century are really capable of feeling , is , as Kierkegaard said , a desperate sortie -LRB- Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift , ii. , i. , cap . 
i. -RRB- , a sortie which can be successful only by means of the martyrdom of faith , which is , according to this same tragic thinker , the crucifixion of reason . 
Not without reason did he who had the right to do so speak of the foolishness of the cross . 
Foolishness , without doubt , foolishness . 
And the American humorist , Oliver Wendell Holmes , was not altogether wide of the mark in making one of the characters in his ingenious conversations say that he thought better of those who were confined in a lunatic asylum on account of religious mania than of those who , while professing the same religious principles , kept their wits and appeared to enjoy life very well outside of the asylums . 
-LSB- 53 -RSB- But those who are at large , are they not really , thanks to God , mad too ? 
Are there not mild madnesses , which not only permit us to mix with our neighbours without danger to society , but which rather enable us to do so , for by means of them we are able to attribute a meaning and finality to life and society themselves ? 
And after all , what is madness and how can we distinguish it from reason , unless we place ourselves outside both the one and the other , which for us is impossible ? 
Madness perhaps it is , and great madness , to seek to penetrate into the mystery of the Beyond ; madness to seek to superimpose the self-contradictory dreams of our imagination upon the dictates of a sane reason . 
And a sane reason tells us that nothing can be built up without foundations , and that it is not merely an idle but a subversive task to fill the void of the unknown with fantasies . 
And nevertheless ... . 
We must needs believe in the other life , in the eternal life beyond the grave , and in an individual and personal life , in a life in which each one of us may feel his consciousness and fed that it is united , without being confounded , with all other consciousnesses in the Supreme Consciousness , in God ; we must needs believe in that other life in order that we may live this life , and endure it , and give it meaning and finality . 
And we must needs believe in that other life , perhaps , in order that we may deserve it , in order that we may obtain it , for it may be that he neither deserves it nor will obtain it who does not passionately desire it above reason and , if need be , against reason . 
And above all , we must feel and act as if an endless continuation of our earthly life awaited us after death ; and if it be that nothingness is the fate that awaits us we must not , in the words of Obermann , so act that it shall be a just fate . 
And this leads us directly to the examination of the practical or ethical aspect of our sole problem . 
L'homme est périssable . 
II se peut ; mais périssons en résistant , et , si le néant nous est reservé , ne faisons pas que ce soit une justice . 
-- SÉNANCOUR : Obermann , lettre xc . 
Several times in the devious course of these essays I have defined , in spite of my horror of definitions , my own position with regard to the problem that I have been examining ; but I know there will always be some dissatisfied reader , educated in some dogmatism or other , who will say : `` This man comes to no conclusion , he vacillates -- now he seems to affirm one thing and then its contrary -- he is full of contradictions -- I ca n't label him . 
What is he ? '' 
Just this -- one who affirms contraries , a man of contradiction and strife , as Jeremiah said of himself ; one who says one thing with his heart and the contrary with his head , and for whom this conflict is the very stuff of life . 
And that is as clear as the water that flows from the melted snow upon the mountain tops . 
I shall be told that this is an untenable position , that a foundation must be laid upon which to build our action and our works , that it is impossible to live by contradictions , that unity and clarity are essential conditions of life and thought , and that it is necessary to unify thought . 
And this leaves us as we were before . 
For it is precisely this inner contradiction that unifies my life and gives it its practical purpose . 
Or rather it is the conflict itself , it is this self-same passionate uncertainty , that unifies my action and makes me live and work . 
We think in order that we may live , I have said ; but perhaps it were more correct to say that we think because we live , and the form of our thought corresponds with that of our life . 
Once more I must repeat that our ethical and philosophical doctrines in general are usually merely the justification a posteriori of our conduct , of our actions . 
Our doctrines are usually the means we seek in order to explain and justify to others and to ourselves our own mode of action . 
And this , be it observed , not merely for others , but for ourselves . 
The man who does not really know why he acts as he does and not otherwise , feels the necessity of explaining to himself the motive of his action and so he forges a motive . 
What we believe to be the motives of our conduct are usually but the pretexts for it . 
The very same reason which one man may regard as a motive for taking care to prolong his life may be regarded by another man as a motive for shooting himself . 
Nevertheless it can not be denied that reasons , ideas , have an influence upon human actions , and sometimes even determine them , by a process analogous to that of suggestion upon a hypnotized person , and this is so because of the tendency in every idea to resolve itself into action -- an idea being simply an inchoate or abortive act . 
It was this notion that suggested to Fouillée his theory of idea-forces . 
But ordinarily ideas are forces which we accommodate to other forces , deeper and much less conscious . 
But putting all this aside for the present , what I wish to establish is that uncertainty , doubt , perpetual wrestling with the mystery of our final destiny , mental despair , and the lack of any solid and stable dogmatic foundation , may be the basis of an ethic . 
He who bases or thinks that he bases his conduct -- his inward or his outward conduct , his feeling or his action -- upon a dogma or theoretical principle which he deems incontrovertible , runs the risk of becoming a fanatic , and moreover , the moment that this dogma is weakened or shattered , the morality based upon it gives way . 
If , the earth that he thought firm begins to rock , he himself trembles at the earthquake , for we do not all come up to the standard of the ideal Stoic who remains undaunted among the ruins of a world shattered into atoms . 
Happily the stuff that is underneath a man 's ideas will save him . 
For if a man should tell you that he does not defraud or cuckold his best friend only because he is afraid of hell , you may depend upon it that neither would he do so even if he were to cease to believe in hell , but that he would invent some other excuse instead . 
And this is all to the honour of the human race . 
But he who believes that he is sailing , perhaps without a set course , on an unstable and sinkable raft , must not be dismayed if the raft gives way beneath his feet and threatens to sink . 
Such a one thinks that he acts , not because he deems his principle of action to be true , but in order to make it true , in order to prove its truth , in order to create his own spiritual world . 
My conduct must be the best proof , the moral proof , of my supreme desire ; and if I do not end by convincing myself , within the bounds of the ultimate and irremediable uncertainty , of the truth of what I hope for , it is because my conduct is not sufficiently pure . 
Virtue , therefore , is not based upon dogma , but dogma upon virtue , and it is not faith that creates martyrs but martyrs who create faith . 
There is no security or repose -- so far as security and repose are obtainable in this life , so essentially insecure and unreposeful -- save in conduct that is passionately good . 
Conduct , practice , is the proof of doctrine , theory . 
`` If any man will do His will -- the will of Him that sent me , '' said Jesus , `` he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself '' -LRB- John vii . 
17 -RRB- ; and there is a well-known saying of Pascal : `` Begin by taking holy water and you will end by becoming a believer . '' 
And pursuing a similar train of thought , Johann Jakob Moser , the pietist , was of the opinion that no atheist or naturalist had the right to regard the Christian religion as void of truth so long as he had not put it to the proof by keeping its precepts and commandments -LRB- Ritschl , Geschichte des Pietismus , book vii. , 43 -RRB- . 
What is our heart 's truth , anti-rational though it be ? 
The immortality of the human soul , the truth of the persistence of our consciousness without any termination whatsoever , the truth of the human finality of the Universe . 
And what is its moral proof ? 
We may formulate it thus : Act so that in your own judgement and in the judgement of others you may merit eternity , act so that you may become irreplaceable , act so that you may not merit death . 
Or perhaps thus : Act as if you were to die to-morrow , but to die in order to survive and be eternalized . 
The end of morality is to give personal , human finality to the Universe ; to discover the finality that belongs to it -- if indeed it has any finality -- and to discover it by acting . 
More than a century ago , in 1804 , in Letter XC of that series that constitutes the immense monody of his Obermann , Sénancour wrote the words which I have put at the head of this chapter -- and of all the spiritual descendants of the patriarchal Rousseau , Sénancour was the most profound and the most intense ; of all the men of heart and feeling that France has produced , not excluding Pascal , he was the most tragic . 
`` Man is perishable . 
That may be ; but let us perish resisting , and if it is nothingness that awaits us , do not let us so act that it shall be a just fate . '' 
Change this sentence from its negative to the positive form -- `` And if it is nothingness that awaits us , let us so act that it shall be an unjust fate '' -- and you get the firmest basis of action for the man who can not or will not be a dogmatist . 
That which is irreligious and demoniacal , that which incapacitates us for action and leaves us without any ideal defence against our evil tendencies , is the pessimism that Goethe puts into the mouth of Mephistopheles when he makes him say , `` All that has achieved existence deserves to be destroyed '' -LRB- denn alles was ensteht ist wert doss es zugrunde geht -RRB- . 
This is the pessimism which we men call evil , and not that other pessimism that consists in lamenting what it fears to be true and struggling against this fear -- namely , that everything is doomed to annihilation in the end . 
Mephistopheles asserts that everything that exists deserves to be destroyed , annihilated , but not that everything will be destroyed or annihilated ; and we assert that everything that exists deserves to be exalted and eternalized , even though no such fate is in store for it . 
The moral attitude is the reverse of this . 
Yes , everything deserves to be eternalized , absolutely everything , even evil itself , for that which we call evil would lose its evilness in being eternalized , because it would lose its temporal nature . 
For the essence of evil consists in its temporal nature , in its not applying itself to any ultimate and permanent end . 
And it might not be superfluous here to say something about that distinction , more overlaid with confusion than any other , between what we are accustomed to call optimism and pessimism , a confusion not less than that which exists with regard to the distinction between individualism and socialism . 
Indeed , it is scarcely possible to form a clear idea as to what pessimism really is . 
I have just this very day read in the Nation -LRB- July 6 , 1912 -RRB- an article , entitled `` A Dramatic Inferno , '' that deals with an English translation of the works of Strindberg , and it opens with the following judicious observations : `` If there were in the world a sincere and total pessimism , it would of necessity be silent . 
The despair which finds a voice is a social mood , it is the cry of misery which brother utters to brother when both are stumbling through a valley of shadows which is peopled with -- comrades . 
In its anguish it bears witness to something that is good in life , for it presupposes sympathy ... The real gloom , the sincere despair , is dumb and blind ; it writes no books , and feels no impulse to burden an intolerable universe with a monument more lasting than brass . '' 
Doubtless there is something of sophistry in this criticism , for the man who is really in pain weeps and even cries aloud , even if he is alone and there is nobody to hear him , simply as a means of alleviating his pain , although this perhaps may be a result of social habits . 
But does not the lion , alone in the desert , roar if he has an aching tooth ? 
But apart from this , it can not be denied that there is a substance of truth underlying these remarks . 
The pessimism that protests and defends itself can not be truly said to be pessimism . 
And , in truth , still less is it pessimism to hold that nothing ought to perish although all things may be doomed to annihilation , while on the other hand it is pessimism to affirm that all things ought to be annihilated even though nothing may perish . 
Pessimism , moreover , may possess different values . 
There is a eudemonistic or economic pessimism , that which denies happiness ; there is an ethical pessimism , that which denies the triumph of moral good ; and there is a religious pessimism , that which despairs of the human finality of the Universe , of the eternal salvation of the individual soul . 
All men deserve to be saved , but , as I have said in the previous chapter , he above all deserves immortality who desires it passionately and even in the face of reason . 
An English writer , H.G. Wells , who has taken upon himself the rôle of the prophet -LRB- a thing not uncommon in his country -RRB- , tells us in Anticipations that `` active and capable men of all forms of religious profession tend in practice to disregard the question of immortality altogether . '' 
And this is because the religious professions of these active and capable men to whom Wells refers are usually simply a lie , and their lives are a lie , too , if they seek to base them upon religion . 
But it may be that at bottom there is not so much truth in what Wells asserts as he and others imagine . 
These active and capable men live in the midst of a society imbued with Christian principles , surrounded by institutions and social feelings that are the product of Christianity , and faith in the immortality of the soul exists deep down in their own souls like a subterranean river , neither seen nor heard , but watering the roots of their deeds and their motives . 
It must be admitted that there exists in truth no more solid foundation for morality than the foundation of the Catholic ethic . 
The end of man is eternal happiness , which consists in the vision and enjoyment of God in sæcula sæculorum . 
Where it errs , however , is in the choice of the means conducive to this end ; for to make the attainment of eternal happiness dependent upon believing or not believing in the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son and not from the Father alone , or in the Divinity of Jesus , or in the theory of the Hypostatic Union , or even in the existence of God , is , as a moment 's reflection will show , nothing less than monstrous . 
A human God -- and that is the only kind of God we are able to conceive -- would never reject him who was unable to believe in Him with his head , and it is not in his head but in his heart that the wicked man says that there is no God , which is equivalent to saying that he wishes that there may not be a God . 
If any belief could be bound up with the attainment of eternal happiness it would be the belief in this happiness itself and in the possibility of it . 
And what shall we say of that other proposition of the king of pedants , to the effect that we have not come into the world to be happy but to fulfil our duty -LRB- Wir sind nicht auf der Welt , um glücklich zu sein , sondern um unsere Schuldigkeit zu tun -RRB- ? 
If we are in the world for something -LRB- um etwas -RRB- , whence can this for be derived but from the very essence of our own will , which asks for happiness and not duty as the ultimate end ? 
And if it is sought to attribute some other value to this for , an objective value , as some Sadducean pedant would say , then it must be recognized that the objective reality , that which would remain even though humanity should disappear , is as indifferent to our duty as to our happiness , is as little concerned with our morality as with our felicity . 
I am not aware that Jupiter , Uranus , or Sirius would allow their course to be affected by the fact that we are or are not fulfilling our duty any more than by the fact that we are or are not happy . 
Such considerations must appear to these pedants to be characterized by a ridiculous vulgarity and a dilettante superficiality . 
-LRB- The intellectual world is divided into two classes -- dilettanti on the one hand , and pedants on the other . -RRB- 
What choice , then , have we ? 
The modern man is he who resigns himself to the truth and is content to be ignorant of the synthesis of culture -- witness what Windelband says on this head in his study of the fate of Hölderlin -LRB- Praeludien , i. -RRB- . 
Yes , these men of culture are resigned , but there remain a few poor savages like ourselves for whom resignation is impossible . 
We do not resign ourselves to the idea of having one day to disappear , and the criticism of the great Pedant does not console us . 
The quintessence of common sense was expressed by Galileo Galilei when he said : `` Some perhaps will say that the bitterest pain is the loss of life , but I say that there are others more bitter ; for whosoever is deprived of life is deprived at the same time of the power to lament , not only this , but any other loss whatsoever . '' 
Whether Galileo was conscious or not of the humour of this sentence I do not know , but it is a tragic humour . 
But , to turn back , I repeat that if the attainment of eternal happiness could be bound up with any particular belief , it would be with the belief in the possibility of its realization . 
And yet , strictly speaking , not even with this . 
The reasonable man says in his head , `` There is no other life after this , '' but only the wicked says it in his heart . 
But since the wicked man is possibly only a man who has been driven to despair , will a human God condemn him because of his despair ? 
His despair alone is misfortune enough . 
But in any event let us adopt the Calderónian formula in La Vida es Sueño : Que estoy soñando y que quiero obrar hacer bien , pues no se pierde el hacer bien aun en sueños -LSB- 54 -RSB- But are good deeds really not lost ? 
Did Calderón know ? 
And he added : Acudamos a lo eterno que es la fama vividora donde ni duermen las dichas no las grandezas reposan -LSB- 55 -RSB- Is it really so ? 
Did Calderón know ? 
Calderón had faith , robust Catholic faith ; but for him who lacks faith , for him who can not believe in what Don Pedro Calderón de la Barca believed , there always remains the attitude of Obermann . 
If it is nothingness that awaits us , let us make an injustice of it ; let us fight against destiny , even though without hope of victory ; let us fight against it quixotically . 
And not only do we fight against destiny in longing for what is irrational , but in acting in such a way that we make ourselves irreplaceable , in impressing our seal and mark upon others , in acting upon our neighbours in order to dominate them , in giving ourselves to them in order that we may eternalize ourselves so far as we can . 
Our greatest endeavour must be to make ourselves irreplaceable ; to make the theoretical fact -- if this expression does not involve a contradiction in terms -- the fact that each one of us is unique and irreplaceable , that no one else can fill the gap that will be left when we die , a practical truth . 
For in fact each man is unique and irreplaceable ; there can not be any other I ; each one of us -- our soul , that is , not our life -- is worth the whole Universe . 
I say the spirit and not the life , for the ridiculously exaggerated value which those attach to human life who , not really believing in the spirit -- that is to say , in their personal immortality -- tirade against war and the death penalty , for example , is a value which they attach to it precisely because they do not really believe in the spirit of which life is the servant . 
For life is of use only in so far as it serves its lord and master , spirit , and if the master perishes with the servant , neither the one nor the other is of any great value . 
And to act in such a way as to make our annihilation an injustice , in such a way as to make our brothers , our sons , and our brothers ' sons , and their sons ' sons , feel that we ought not to have died , is something that is within the reach of all . 
The essence of the doctrine of the Christian redemption is in the fact that he who suffered agony and death was the unique man -- that is , Man , the Son of Man , or the Son of God ; that he , because he was sinless , did not deserve to have died ; and that this propitiatory divine victim died in order that he might rise again and that he might raise us up from the dead , in order that he might deliver us from death by applying his merits to us and showing us the way of life . 
And the Christ who gave himself for his brothers in humanity with an absolute self-abnegation is the pattern for our action to shape itself on . 
All of us , each one of us , can and ought to determine to give as much of himself as he possibly can -- nay , to give more than he can , to exceed himself , to go beyond himself , to make himself irreplaceable , to give himself to others in order that he may receive himself back again from them . 
And each one in his own civil calling or office . 
The word office , officium , means obligation , debt , but in the concrete , and that is what it always ought to mean in practice . 
We ought not so much to try to seek that particular calling which we think most fitting and suitable for ourselves , as to make a calling of that employment in which chance , Providence , or our own will has placed us . 
Perhaps Luther rendered no greater service to Christian civilization than that of establishing the religious value of the civil occupation , of shattering the monastic and medieval idea of the religious calling , an idea involved in the mist of human passions and imaginations and the cause of terrible life tragedies . 
If we could but enter into the cloister and examine the religious vocation of those whom the self-interest of their parents had forced as children into a novice 's cell and who had suddenly awakened to the life of the world -- if indeed they ever do awake ! 
-- or of those whom their own self-delusions had led into it ! 
Luther saw this life of the cloister at close quarters and suffered it himself , and therefore he was able to understand and feel the religious value of the civil calling , to which no man is bound by perpetual vows . 
All that the Apostle said in the fourth chapter of his Epistle to the Ephesians with regard to the respective functions of Christians in the Church must be transferred and applied to the civil or non-ecclesiastical life , for to-day among ourselves the Christian -- whether he know it or not , and whether he like it or not -- is the citizen , and just as the Apostle exclaimed , `` I am a Roman citizen ! '' 
each one of us , even the atheist , might exclaim `` I am a Christian ! '' 
And this demands the civilizing , in the sense of dis-ecclesiasticizing , of Christianity , which was Luther 's task , although he himself eventually became the founder of a Church . 
There is a common English phrase , `` the right man in the right place . '' 
To which we might rejoin , `` Cobbler , to thy last ! '' 
Who knows what is the post that suits him best and for which he is most fitted ? 
Does a man himself know it better than others or do they know it better than he ? 
Who can measure capacities and aptitudes ? 
The religious attitude , undoubtedly , is to endeavour to make the occupation in which we find ourselves our vocation , and only in the last resort to change it for another . 
This question of the proper vocation is possibly the gravest and most deep-seated of social problems , that which is at the root of all the others . 
That which is known par excellence as the social question is perhaps not so much a problem of the distribution of wealth , of the products of labour , as a problem of the distribution of avocations , of the modes of production . 
It is not aptitude -- a thing impossible to ascertain without first putting it to the test and not always clearly indicated in a man , for with regard to the majority of callings a man is not born but made -- it is not special aptitude , but rather social , political , and customary reasons that determine a man 's occupation . 
At certain times and in certain countries it is caste and heredity ; at other times and in other places , the guild or corporation ; in later times machinery -- in almost all cases necessity ; liberty scarcely ever . 
And the tragedy of it culminates in those occupations , pandering to evil , in which the soul is sacrificed for the sake of the livelihood , in which the workman works with the consciousness , not of the uselessness merely , but of the social perversity , of his work , manufacturing the poison that will kill him , the weapon , perchance , with which his children will be murdered . 
This , and not the question of wages , is the gravest problem . 
I shall never forget a scene of which I was a witness that took place on the banks of the river that flows through Bilbao , my native town . 
A workman was hammering at something in a shipwright 's yard , working without putting his heart into his work , as if he lacked energy or worked merely for the sake of getting a wage , when suddenly a woman 's voice was heard crying , `` Help ! 
help ! '' 
A child had fallen into the river . 
Instantly the man was transformed . 
With an admirable energy , promptitude , and sang-froid he threw off his clothes and plunged into the water to rescue the drowning infant . 
Possibly the reason why there is less bitterness in the agrarian socialist movement than in that of the towns is that the field labourer , although his wages and his standard of living are no better than those of the miner or artisan , has a clearer consciousness of the social value of his work . 
Sowing corn is a different thing from extracting diamonds from the earth . 
And it may be that the greatest social progress consists in a certain indifferentiation of labour , in the facility for exchanging one kind of work for another , and that other not perhaps a more lucrative , but a nobler one -- for there are degrees of nobility in labour . 
But unhappily it is only too seldom that a man who keeps to one occupation without changing is concerned with making a religious vocation of it , or that the man who changes his occupation for another does so from any religious motive . 
And do you not know cases in which a man , justifying his action on the ground that the professional organism to which he belongs and in which he works is badly organized and does not function as it ought , will evade the strict performance of his duty on the pretext that he is thereby fulfilling a higher duty ? 
Is not this insistence upon the literal carrying out of orders called disciplinarianism , and do not people speak disparagingly of bureaucracy and the Pharisaism of public officials ? 
And cases occur not unlike that of an intelligent and studious military officer who should discover the deficiencies of his country 's military organization and denounce them to his superiors and perhaps to the public -- thereby fulfilling his duty -- and who , when on active service , should refuse to carry out an operation which he was ordered to undertake , believing that there was but scant probability of success or rather certainty of failure , so long as these deficiencies remained unremedied . 
He would deserve to be shot . 
And as for this question of Pharisaism ... And there is always a way of obeying an order while yet retaining the command , a way of carrying out what one believes to be an absurd operation while correcting its absurdity , even though it involve one 's own death . 
When in my bureaucratic capacity I have come across some legislative ordinance that has fallen into desuetude because of its manifest absurdity , I have always endeavoured to apply it . 
There is nothing worse than a loaded pistol which nobody uses left lying in some corner of the house ; a child finds it , begins to play with it , and kills its own father . 
Laws that have fallen into desuetude are the most terrible of all laws , when the cause of the desuetude is the badness of the law . 
And these are not groundless suppositions , and least of all in our country . 
For there are many who , while they go about looking out for I know not what ideal -- that is to say , fictitious duties and responsibilities -- neglect the duty of putting their whole soul into the immediate and concrete business which furnishes them with a living ; and the rest , the immense majority , perform their task perfunctorily , merely for the sake of nominally complying with their duty -- para cumplir , a terribly immoral phrase -- in order to get themselves out of a difficulty , to get the job done , to qualify for their wages without earning them , whether these wages be pecuniary or otherwise . 
Here you have a shoemaker who lives by making shoes , and makes them with just enough care and attention to keep his clientèle together without losing custom . 
Another shoemaker lives on a somewhat higher spiritual plane , for he has a proper love for his work , and out of pride or a sense of honour strives for the reputation of being the best shoemaker in the town or in the kingdom , even though this reputation brings him no increase of custom or profit , but only renown and prestige . 
But there is a still higher degree of moral perfection in this business of shoemaking , and that is for the shoemaker to aspire to become for his fellow-townsmen the one and only shoemaker , indispensable and irreplaceable , the shoemaker who looks after their footgear so well that they will feel a definite loss when he dies -- when he is `` dead to them , '' not merely `` dead '' -LSB- 56 -RSB- -- and they will feel that he ought not to have died . 
And this will result from the fact that in working for them he was anxious to spare them any discomfort and to make sure that it should not be any preoccupation with their feet that should prevent them from being at leisure to contemplate the higher truths ; he shod them for the love of them and for the love of God in them -- he shod them religiously . 
I have chosen this example deliberately , although it may perhaps appear to you somewhat pedestrian . 
For the fact is that in this business of shoemaking , the religious , as opposed to the ethical , sense is at a very low ebb . 
Working men group themselves in associations , they form co-operative societies and unions for defence , they fight very justly and nobly for the betterment of their class ; but it is not clear that these associations have any great influence on their moral attitude towards their work . 
They have succeeded in compelling employers to employ only such workmen , and no others , as the respective unions shall designate in each particular case ; but in the selection of those designated they pay little heed to their technical fitness . 
Often the employer finds it almost impossible to dismiss an inefficient workman on account of his inefficiency , for his fellow-workers take his part . 
Their work , moreover , is often perfunctory , performed merely as a pretext for receiving a wage , and instances even occur when they deliberately mishandle it in order to injure their employer . 
In attempting to justify this state of things , it may be said that the employers are a hundred times more blameworthy than the workmen , for they are not concerned to give a better wage to the man who does better work , or to foster the general education and technical proficiency of the workman , or to ensure the intrinsic goodness of the article produced . 
The improvement of the product -- which , apart from reasons of industrial and mercantile competition , ought to be in itself and for the good of the consumers , for charity 's sake , the chief end of the business -- is not so regarded either by employers or employed , and this is because neither the one nor the other have any religious sense of their social function . 
Neither of them seek to make themselves irreplaceable . 
The evil is aggravated when the business takes the unhappy form of the impersonal limited company , for where there is no longer any personal signature there is no longer any of that pride which seeks to give the signature prestige , a pride which in its way is a substitute for the craving for eternalization . 
With the disappearance of the concrete individuality , the basis of all religion , the religious sense of the business calling disappears also . 
And what has been said of employers and workmen applies still more to members of the liberal professions and public functionaries . 
There is scarcely a single servant of the State who feels the religious bearing of his official and public duties . 
Nothing could be more unsatisfactory , nothing more confused , than the feeling among our people with regard to their duties towards the State , and this sense of duty is still further obliterated by the attitude of the Catholic Church , whose action so far as the State is concerned is in strict truth anarchical . 
It is no uncommon thing to find among its ministers upholders of the moral lawfulness of smuggling and contraband as if in disobeying the legally constituted authority the smuggler and contrabandist did not sin against the Fourth Commandment of the law of God , which in commanding us to honour our father and mother commands us to obey all lawful authority in so far as the ordinances of such authority are not contrary -LRB- and the levying of these contributions is certainly not contrary -RRB- to the law of God . 
There are many who , since it is written `` In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , '' regard work as a punishment , and therefore they attribute merely an economico-political , or at best an esthetic , value to the work of everyday life . 
For those who take this view -- and it is the view principally held by the Jesuits -- the business of life is twofold : there is the inferior and transitory business of winning a livelihood , of winning bread for ourselves and our children in an honourable , manner -- and the elasticity of this honour is well known ; and there is the grand business of our salvation , of winning eternal glory . 
This inferior or worldly business is to be undertaken not only so as to permit us , without deceiving or seriously injuring our neighbours , to live decently in accordance with our social position , but also so as to afford us the greatest possible amount of time for attending to the other main business of our life . 
And there are others who , rising somewhat above this conception of the work of our civil occupation , a conception which is economical rather than ethical , attain to an esthetic conception and sense of it , and this involves endeavouring to acquire distinction and renown in our occupation , the converting of it into an art for art 's sake , for beauty 's sake . 
But it is necessary to rise still higher than this , to attain to an ethical sense of our civil calling , to a sense which derives from our religious sense , from our hunger of eternalization . 
To work at our ordinary civil occupation , with eyes fixed on God , for the love of God , which is equivalent to saying for the love of our eternalization , is to make of this work a work of religion . 
That saying , `` In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , '' does not mean that God condemned man to work , but to the painfulness of it . 
It would have been no condemnation to have condemned man to work itself , for work is the only practical consolation for having been born . 
And , for a Christian , the proof that God did not condemn man to work itself consists in the saying of the Scripture that , before the Fall , while he was still in a state of innocence , God took man and put him in the garden `` to dress it and to keep it '' -LRB- Gen. ii . 
15 -RRB- . 
And how , in fact , would man have passed his time in Paradise if he had had no work to do in keeping it in order ? 
And may it not be that the beatific vision itself is a kind of work ? 
And even if work were our punishment , we ought to strive to make it , the punishment itself , our consolation and our redemption ; and if we must needs embrace some cross or other , there is for each one of us no better cross than the cross of our own civil calling . 
For Christ did not say , `` Take up my cross and follow me , '' but `` Take up thy cross and follow me '' : every man his own cross , for the Saviour 's cross the Saviour alone can bear . 
And the imitation of Christ , therefore , does not consist in that monastic ideal so shiningly set forth in the book that commonly bears the name of à Kempis , an ideal only applicable to a very limited number of persons and therefore anti-Christian ; but to imitate Christ is to take up each one his own cross , the cross of his own civil occupation -- civil and not merely religions -- as Christ took up his cross , the cross of his calling , and to embrace it and carry it , looking towards God and striving to make each act of this calling a true prayer . 
In making shoes and because he makes them a man can gain heaven , provided that the shoemaker strives to be perfect , as a shoemaker , as our Father in heaven is perfect . 
Fourier , the socialist dreamer , dreamed of making work attractive in his phalansteries by the free choice of vocations and in other ways . 
There is no other way than that of liberty . 
Wherein consists the charm of the game of chance , which is a kind of work , if not in the voluntary submission of the player to the liberty of Nature -- that is , to chance ? 
But do not let us lose ourselves in a comparison between work and play . 
And the sense of making ourselves irreplaceable , of not meriting death , of making our annihilation , if it is annihilation that awaits us , an injustice , ought to impel us not only to perform our own occupation religiously , from love of God and love of our eternity and eternalization , but to perform it passionately , tragically if you like . 
It ought to impel us to endeavour to stamp others with our seal , to perpetuate ourselves in them and in their children by dominating them , to leave on all things the imperishable impress of our signature . 
The most fruitful ethic is the ethic of mutual imposition . 
Above all , we must recast in a positive form the negative commandments which we have inherited from the Ancient Law . 
Thus where it is written , `` Thou shalt not lie ! '' 
let us understand , `` Thou shalt always speak the truth , in season and out of season ! '' 
although it is we ourselves , and not others , who are judges in each case of this seasonableness . 
And for `` Thou shalt not kill ! '' 
let us understand , `` Thou shalt give life and increase it ! '' 
And for `` Thou shalt not steal ! '' 
let us say , `` Thou shalt increase the general wealth ! '' 
And for `` Thou shalt not commit adultery ! '' 
`` Thou shalt give children , healthy , strong , and good , to thy country and to heaven ! '' 
And thus with all the other commandments . 
He who does not lose his life shall not find it . 
Give yourself then to others , but in order to give yourself to them , first dominate them . 
For it is not possible to dominate except by being dominated . 
Everyone nourishes himself upon the flesh of that which he devours . 
In order that you may dominate your neighbour you must know and love him . 
It is by attempting to impose my ideas upon him that I become the recipient of his ideas . 
To love my neighbour is to wish that he may be like me , that he may be another I -- that is to say , it is to wish that I may be he ; it is to wish to obliterate the division between him and me , to suppress the evil . 
My endeavour to impose myself upon another , to be and live in him and by him , to make him mine -- which is the same as making myself his -- is that which gives religious meaning to human collectivity , to human solidarity . 
The feeling of solidarity originates in myself ; since I am a society , I feel the need of making myself master of human society ; since I am a social product , I must socialize myself , and from myself I proceed to God -- who is I projected to the All -- and from God to each of my neighbours . 
My immediate first impulse is to protest against the inquisitor and to prefer the merchant who comes to offer me his wares . 
But when my impressions are clarified by reflection , I begin to see that the inquisitor , when he acts from a right motive , treats me as a man , as an end in myself , and if he molests me it is from a charitable wish to save my soul ; while the merchant , on the other hand , regards me merely as a customer , as a means to an end , and his indulgence and tolerance is at bottom nothing but a supreme indifference to my destiny . 
There is much more humanity in the inquisitor . 
Similarly there is much more humanity in war than in peace . 
Non-resistance to evil implies resistance to good , and to take the offensive , leaving the defensive out of the question , is perhaps the divinest thing in humanity . 
War is the school of fraternity and the bond of love ; it is war that has brought peoples into touch with one another , by mutual aggression and collision , and has been the cause of their knowing and loving one another . 
Human love knows no purer embrace , or one more fruitful in its consequences , than that between victor and vanquished on the battlefield . 
And even the purified hate that springs from war is fruitful . 
War is , in its strictest sense , the sanctification of homicide ; Cain is redeemed as a leader of armies . 
And if Cain had not killed his brother Abel , perhaps he would have died by the hand of Abel . 
God revealed Himself above all in war ; He began by being the God of battles ; and one of the greatest services of the Cross is that , in the form of the sword-hilt , it protects the hand that wields the sword . 
The enemies of the State say that Cain , the fratricide , was the founder of the State . 
And we must accept the fact and turn it to the glory of the State , the child of war . 
Civilization began on the day on which one man , by subjecting another to his will and compelling him to do the work of two , was enabled to devote himself to the contemplation of the world and to set his captive upon works of luxury . 
It was slavery that enabled Plato to speculate upon the ideal republic , and it was war that brought slavery about . 
Not without reason was Athena the goddess of war and of wisdom . 
But is there any need to repeat once again these obvious truths , which , though they have continually been forgotten , are continually rediscovered ? 
And the supreme commandment that arises out of love towards God , and the foundation of all morality , is this : Yield yourself up entirely , give your spirit to the end that you may save it , that you may eternalize it . 
Such is the sacrifice of life . 
The individual quâ individual , the wretched captive of the instinct of preservation and of the senses , cares only about preserving himself , and all his concern is that others should not force their way into his sphere , should not disturb him , should not interrupt his idleness ; and in return for their abstention or for the sake of example he refrains from forcing himself upon them , from interrupting their idleness , from disturbing them , from taking possession of them . 
`` Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you , '' he translates thus : I do not interfere with others -- let them not interfere with me . 
And he shrinks and pines and perishes in this spiritual avarice and this repellent ethic of anarchic individualism : each one for himself . 
And as each one is not himself , he can hardly live for himself . 
But as soon as the individual feels himself in society , he feels himself in God , and kindled by the instinct of perpetuation he glows with love towards God , and with a dominating charity he seeks to perpetuate himself in others , to perennialize his spirit , to eternalize it , to unnail God , and his sole desire is to seal his spirit upon other spirits and to receive their impress in return . 
He has shaken off the yoke of his spiritual sloth and avarice . 
Sloth , it is said , is the mother of all the vices ; and in fact sloth does engender two vices -- avarice and envy -- which in their turn are the source of all the rest . 
Sloth is the weight of matter , in itself inert , within us , and this sloth , while it professes to preserve us by economizing our forces , in reality attenuates us and reduces us to nothing . 
In man there is either too much matter or too much spirit , or to put it better , either he feels a hunger for spirit -- that is , for eternity -- or he feels a hunger for matter -- that is , submission to annihilation . 
When spirit is in excess and he feels a hunger for yet more of it , he pours it forth and scatters it abroad , and in scattering it abroad he amplifies it with that of others ; and on the contrary , when a man is avaricious of himself and thinks that he will preserve himself better by withdrawing within himself , he ends by losing all -- he is like the man who received the single talent : he buried it in order that he might not lose it , and in the end he was bereft of it . 
For to him that hath shall be given , but from him that hath but a little shall be taken away even the little that he hath . 
Be ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect , we are bidden , and this terrible precept -- terrible because for us the infinite perfection of the Father is unattainable -- must be our supreme rule of conduct . 
Unless a man aspires to the impossible , the possible that he achieves will be scarcely worth the trouble of achieving . 
It behoves us to aspire to the impossible , to the absolute and infinite perfection , and to say to the Father , `` Father , I can not -- help Thou my impotence . '' 
And He acting in us will achieve it for us . 
And to be perfect is to be all , it is to be myself and to be all else , it is to be humanity , it is to be the Universe . 
And there is no other way of being all but to give oneself to all , and when all shall be in all , all will be in each one of us . 
The apocatastasis is more than a mystical dream : it is a rule of action , it is a beacon beckoning us to high exploits . 
And from it springs the ethic of invasion , of domination , of aggression , of inquisition if you like . 
For true charity is a kind of invasion -- it consists in putting my spirit into other spirits , in giving them my suffering as the food and consolation for their sufferings , in awakening their unrest with my unrest , in sharpening their hunger for God with my hunger for God . 
It is not charity to rock and lull our brothers to sleep in the inertia and drowsiness of matter , but rather to awaken them to the uneasiness and torment of spirit . 
To the fourteen works of mercy which we learnt in the Catechism of Christian Doctrine there should sometimes be added yet another , that of awakening the sleeper . 
Sometimes , at any rate , and surely when the sleeper sleeps on the brink of a precipice , it is much more merciful to awaken him than to bury him after he is dead -- let us leave the dead to bury their dead . 
It has been well said , `` Whosoever loves thee dearly will make thee weep , '' and charity often causes weeping . 
`` The love that does not mortify does not deserve so divine a name , '' said that ardent Portuguese apostle , Fr . 
Thomé de Jesús , -LSB- 57 -RSB- who was also the author of this ejaculation -- `` O infinite fire , O eternal love , who weepest when thou hast naught to embrace and feed upon and many hearts to burn ! '' 
He who loves his neighbour burns his heart , and the heart , like green wood , in burning groans and distils itself in tears . 
And to do this is generosity , one of the two mother virtues which are born when inertia , sloth , is overcome . 
Most of our miseries come from spiritual avarice . 
The cure for suffering -- which , as we have said , is the collision of consciousness with unconsciousness -- is not to be submerged in unconsciousness , but to be raised to consciousness and to suffer more . 
The evil of suffering is cured by more suffering , by higher suffering . 
Do not take opium , but put salt and vinegar in the soul 's wound , for when you sleep and no longer feel the suffering , you are not . 
And to be , that is imperative . 
Do not then close your eyes to the agonizing Sphinx , but look her in the face and let her seize you in her mouth and crunch you with her hundred thousand poisonous teeth and swallow you .
