He was astonished to see how cheerful I was and what a good appetite I had , and he asked how I could eat when death was so near . 
I told him I was doing it so that all the sea water I would drink when I drowned would n't make me sick . 
My simplicity made him shake with laughter from head to foot . 
I confessed a number of people who did n't utter a word with the agony they were in , and I did n't listen to them because I was too busy eating . 
The officers and people of high rank escaped safely in a skiff , along with two priests who were on board . 
But my clothes were so bad that I could n't fit inside . 
When I had my fill of eating , I went over to a cask full of good wine and transferred as much as I could hold into my stomach . 
I forgot all about the storm , myself , and everything . 
The ship started to sink and the water came pouring in as though it had found its home . 
A corporal grabbed my hands and as he was dying he asked me to listen to a sin he wanted to confess . 
He said he had n't carried out a penance he had been given , which was to make a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Loreto , even though he had had many opportunities to do it . 
And now that he wanted to , he could n't . 
I told him that with the authority vested in me , I would commute his penance , and that instead of going to Our Lady of Loreto , he could go to Santiago . 
`` Oh , sir , '' he said . 
`` I would like to carry out that penance , but the water is starting to come into my mouth , and I ca n't . '' 
`` If that 's the way it is , '' I said , `` the penance I give you is to drink all the water in the sea . '' 
But he did n't carry that out either because there were many men there who drank as much as he did . 
When it came up to my mouth I said to it : Try some other door , this one is not opening . 
And even if it had opened , the water could n't have gotten in , because my body was so full of wine it looked like a stuffed pig . 
As the ship broke apart a huge swarm of fish came in . 
It was as though they were being given aid from the bodies on board . 
They ate the flesh of those miserable people who had been overcome by a drop in the ocean , as if they were grazing in the county pasture . 
They wanted to try me out , but I drew my trustworthy sword and without stopping to chat with such a low-class mob , I laid into them like a donkey in a new field of rye . 
They hissed at me : `` We 're not trying to hurt you . 
We only want to see if you taste good . '' 
I worked so hard that in less than half-a-quarter of an hour I killed more than five hundred tuna , and they were the ones that wanted to make a feast out of the flesh of this sinner . 
The live fish began to feed on the dead ones , and they left Lazaro 's company when they saw it was n't a very profitable place to be . 
I found myself lord of the sea , with no one to oppose me . 
I ran around from one place to another , and I saw things that were unbelievable : huge piles of skeletons and bodies . 
And I found a large number of trunks full of jewels and gold , great heaps of weapons , silks , linens , and spices . 
I was longing for it all and sighing because it was n't back at home , safe , so that , as the buffoon says , I could eat my bread dipped in sardines . 
I did what I could , but that was nothing . 
I opened a huge chest and filled it full of coins and precious jewels . 
I took some ropes from the piles of them there and tied up the chest , and then I knotted other ropes together until I had one I thought was long enough to reach to the surface of the water . 
If I can get all this treasure out of here , I thought to myself , there wo n't be a tavernkeeper in the world better off than I 'll be . 
I 'll build up my estate , live off my investments , and buy a summer house in Toledo . 
They 'll call my wife `` Madam , '' and me they 'll call `` Sir . '' 
I 'll marry my daughter to the richest pastrycook in town . 
Everyone will come to congratulate me , and I 'll tell them that I worked hard for it , and that I did n't take it out of the bowels of the earth but from the heart of the sea . 
That I did n't get damp with sweat but drenched as a dried herring . 
I have never been as happy in my life as I was then , and I was n't even thinking about the fact that if I opened my mouth I would stay down there with my treasure , buried till hell froze over . 
I saw how near I was to death , and I was horrified ; how near I was to being rich , and I was overjoyed . 
Death frightened me , and the treasure delighted me . 
I wanted to run away from the first and enjoy the second . 
I tore off the rags that my master , the squire , had left me for the services I had done him . 
Then I tied the rope to my foot and began to swim -LRB- I did n't know how to do that very well , but necessity put wings on my feet and oars on my hands -RRB- . 
The fish there gathered around to nip at me , and their prodding was like spurs that goaded me on . 
So with them nipping and me galloping , we came up to the surface of the water , where something happened that was the cause of all my troubles . 
The fish and I were caught up in some nets that some fishermen had thrown out , and when they felt the fish in the nets they pulled so mightily , and water began to flow into me just as mightily , so that I could n't hold out , and I started to drown . 
And I would have drowned if the sailors had not pulled the booty on board with their usual speed . 
What a God-awful taste ! 
I have never drunk anything that bad in my entire life . 
It tasted like the archpriest 's piss my wife made me drink once , telling me it was good Ocana wine . 
With the fish on board and myself as well , the fishermen began to pull on the line and discovered the spool -LRB- as the saying goes -RRB- . 
They found me tangled up in the rope and were astonished , and they said , `` What sort of fish is this ? 
Its face looks like a man 's . 
Is it the devil or a ghost ? 
Let 's pull on that rope and see what he has fastened to his foot . '' 
The fishermen pulled so hard that their ship started to sink . 
When they saw the trouble they were in , they cut the rope , and at the same time they cut off Lazaro 's hopes of ever becoming one of the landed gentry . 
They turned me upside down so I would empty out the water I had drunk and the wine , too . 
They saw that I was n't dead -LRB- which was by no means the worst that could have happened to me -RRB- , so they gave me a little wine , and I came back to life like a lamp with kerosene poured in . 
They asked me all kinds of questions , but I did n't answer a word until they gave me something to eat . 
When I got my breath back , the first thing I asked them about was the shackles that were tied to my foot . 
They told me that they had cut them to get out of the danger they had been in . 
Troy was lost and so were all of Lazaro 's great desires : and right then his troubles , cares , and hardships began . 
There is nothing in the world worse than to have fancied yourself rich , on top of the world , and then to suddenly find yourself poor and at the bottom of the ladder . 
I had built my castles on the water , and it had sunk them all . 
I told the fishermen what both of us lost when they had cut off my shackles . 
They were so angry that one of them nearly went mad . 
The shrewdest one said they should throw me back into the sea and wait for me there until I came up again . 
They all agreed with him , and even though I objected strongly , their minds were made up : they said that since I knew the way , it would be easy for me -LRB- as if I would be going to the pastry shop or the tavern ! -RRB- . 
They were so blinded by their greed that they would have thrown me out if my fortune -LRB- or misfortune -RRB- had not arranged for a ship to come up to us to help carry back the fish . 
They all kept quiet so that the others would n't find out about the treasure they had discovered . 
But they had to leave off their evil plan for the moment . 
They brought their boats to shore , and they threw me back with the fish to hide me , intending to hunt for me again when they could . 
Later , two of them picked me up and carried me to a little hut nearby . 
One man who did n't know the secret asked them what I was . 
They said I was a monster that had been caught with the tuna . 
When they had me inside that miserable pigsty , I begged them to give me some rags to cover my naked body so I could be presentable . 
You can do that , '' they said , `` after you 've settled your account with the hostess . '' 
At the time I did n't understand their gibberish . 
The fame of the monster spread through the countryside , and many people came to the hut to see me . 
But the fishermen did n't want to show me ; they said they were waiting for permission from the bishops and the Inquisition and that , until then , it was entirely out of the question . 
I was stupified . 
I did n't know what they were planning , and so I did n't know what to say or do . 
The same thing happened to me that happens to the cuckold : he is the last to find out . 
Those devils cooked up a scheme that Satan himself would n't have thought of . 
But that requires a new chapter and a new look . 
Opportunity makes the thief . 
And when the fishermen realized they had such a good opportunity , they grabbed it lock , stock , and barrel . 
When they saw that so many people were gathering around the new fish , they decided to win back what they had lost when they cut the rope from my foot . 
So they sent word to the ministers of the Inquisition , asking permission to show a fish with a man 's face through all of Spain . 
And when they offered those gentlemen a present of the best fish they had caught , they were given that permission immediately . 
Meanwhile , our friend Lazaro was thanking God for having taken him out of the belly of the whale . 
-LRB- And that was a great miracle since my ability and knowledge were not very good , and I swam like a lead brick . -RRB- 
Four of the fishermen grabbed hold of me , and they seemed more like executioners -- the kind that crucified Christ -- than men . 
They tied up my hands , and then they put a mossy wig and beard on me , and they did n't forget the mustache : I looked like a garden statue . 
They wrapped my feet in seaweed , and I saw that they had dressed me up like a stuffed and trussed trout . 
Then I began to groan and moan over my troubles , complaining to fate or fortune : Why are you always pursuing me ? 
I have never seen or touched you , but if a man can tell the cause by the effects , I know from my experience with you that there is no siren , basilisk , viper , or lioness with her young more cruel than you are . 
By flattery and caresses you lift men up to the height of your riches and pleasures and then hurtle them into the abyss of all their misery and calamities , and their depths are as low as your favors were high . 
One of those cutthroats heard my soliloquy , and with a rasping voice he said to me , `` If you say another word , Mr. Tunafish , we 'll salt you along with your friends , or we 'll burn you as a monster . 
The Inquisition , '' he continued , `` has told us to take you through the village and towns in Spain and to show you off to everyone as a wonder and monster of nature . '' 
I swore to them that I was no tuna , monster , or anything out of the ordinary . 
I said that I was a man just like everyone else , and that if I had come out of the ocean it was because I had fallen into it along with the men who drowned while going to make war on Algiers . 
But they were deaf men , and even worse , because they did n't want to hear . 
When I saw that my begging was as useless as the soap they use to wash an ass 's head , I became patient and waited for time -- which cures everything -- to cure my trouble , knowing it all came from suffering through that damned metamorphosis . 
They put me in a barrel cut in half , made to look like a brigantine . 
Then they filled it with water that came up to my lips as I sat in it . 
I could n't stand up because they had my feet tied with a rope , and one end of it came out between the mesh of that hairy mess of mine so that if I made so much as a peep , they would make me hop and sink like a frog and drink more water than a person with dropsy . 
I would keep my mouth closed until I felt whoever was pulling on the rope let it go slack . 
Then I would stick my head out like a turtle , and I learned by what happened to my own . 
They showed me like this to everyone , and so many people came to see me -LRB- each one paying twenty coppers -RRB- that they made two hundred pieces of silver in one day . 
The more money they made the more they wanted , and they began to be very concerned about my health so they could prolong it . 
They held a summit conference and discussed whether or not they should take me out of the water at night : they were afraid that with all the wet and cold it might cut my life short , and they loved mine more than their own -LRB- because of all the profit they were getting from mine -RRB- . 
They decided to keep me in the water all the time because they thought the force of habit would change my nature . 
So poor Lazaro was like a string of wet rice or the binding on a raft . 
I leave to the dear reader 's imagination what I went through in this situation : here I was , a captive in this free land , in chains because of the wickedness of those greedy puppeteers . 
The worst part about it , and what tormented me most , was that I had to pretend to be mute when I really was n't . 
I was n't even able to open my mouth because the instant I did my guard was so alert that without anyone being able to see him , he would fill me up with water , afraid that I would talk . 
My meals were dunked bread that the people who came to see me threw in so they could watch me eat . 
So for the six months I spent in that cooler I did n't get another damned thing to eat : I was dying of hunger . 
I drank tub water , and since it was n't very clean it was all the more nourishing -- especially because its coldness gave me attacks of diarrhea that lasted me as long as that watery purgatory did . 
Those torturers took me from city to town , from town to village , from village to farm , happier than a lark with their earnings . 
They made fun of poor Lazaro , and they would sing : `` Hooray , hooray for the fish . 
He earns our keep while we loaf . '' 
My `` coffin '' was placed on a cart , and three men went along with me : the mule driver , the man who pulled on the rope whenever I tried to say anything , and the one who told all about me . 
This last one would make a speech about the strange way they caught me , telling more lies than a tailor at Eastertime . 
When we were traveling and no one else was around , they let me talk , and that was the only courtesy they showed me . 
I asked them who the devil had put it in their heads to take me around like that , in a fish bowl . 
They answered that if they did n't do it I would die on the spot because , since I was a fish , I could n't live out of water . 
When I saw how their minds were set on the idea , I decided to be a fish , and I finally convinced myself that I was one : after all , everyone else thought that 's what I was , and that the seawater had changed me into one , and they say that the voice of the people is the voice of God . 
So from then on I was as silent as a man at mass . 
They took me to the capital , and there they really made a lot of money . 
Because the people there , being idlers , liked novelties . 
Among all the people who came to see me there were two students . 
They studied the features of my face very carefully , and then , in a low tone , they said that they would swear on the Bible I was a man and not a fish . 
And they said if they were the authorities they would get at the naked truth by taking a leather strap to our naked shoulders . 
I was praying to God with all my heart and soul that they would do it , as long as they could get me out of there . 
I tried to help them by shouting , ` You scholars are right . '' 
But I hardly had my mouth open when my guard pulled me under the water . 
Everyone 's shouting when I ducked -LRB- or , rather , when they dunked me -RRB- stopped those good scholars from going on with their talk . 
They threw bread to me , and I would bolt it down almost before it had a chance to get wet . 
They did n't give me half of what I could eat . 
I remembered the feasts I had in Toledo , how well I ate with my German friends , and that good wine I used to announce in the streets . 
I prayed to God to repeat the miracle of Cana of Galilee and not let me die at the hands of water -- my worst enemy . 
I thought about what those students had said , which no one heard because of the noise . 
I realized that I was a man , and I never thought otherwise from then on , although my wife had told me many times that I was a beast , and the boys at Toledo used to say , `` Mr. Lazaro , pull your hat down a little -- we can see your horns . '' 
All this , along with the sauce I was in , had made me doubt whether or not I really was a man . 
But after I heard those blessed earthly diviners , I had no more doubts about it , and I tried to escape from the hands of those Chaldeans . 
Once , in the dead of night , I saw that my guards were fast asleep , and I tried to get loose . 
But the ropes around me were wet , and I could n't . 
I thought about shouting , but I decided that that would n't work , since the first one who heard me would seal my mouth with a half-gallon of water . 
When I saw that way out cut off , I began to twist around impatiently in the slough , and I struggled and pushed so much that the cask turned over , and me along with it . 
All the water spilled out , and when I found myself freed I shouted for help . 
The fishermen were terrified when they realized what I 'd done , and they quickly hit on a solution : they stopped up my mouth by stuffing it full of seaweed . 
And to muddle my shouts , they began to shout themselves , even louder , calling out , `` Help , help , call the law ! '' 
And as they were doing all this , they filled the cask back up with water from a nearby well , with unbelievable speed . 
The innkeeper came running out with a battle-ax , and everyone else at the inn came out armed with iron pokers and sticks . 
All the neighbors came in , along with a constable and six deputies who happened to be passing by . 
The innkeeper asked the sailors what had happened , and they answered that thieves had tried to steal their fish . 
And like a madman he began shouting , `` Get the thieves , get the thieves ! '' 
Some went to see if they had gotten out the door ; others went to find out if they were escaping across the rooftops . 
And as for me , my custodians had put me back in my vat . 
It happened that the water that spilled out all ran through a hole in the floor , onto the bed of a room downstairs where the daughter of the house was sleeping . 
Now this girl had been so moved to charity that she had brought a young priest in with her to spend the night in contemplation . 
They became so frightened when the deluge fell on the bed and all the people began shouting that they crawled out through a window as naked as Adam and Eve , without even a fig leaf to cover their private parts . 
There was a full moon , and its brightness was so great that it could have competed with the sun . 
When the people saw them they shouted , `` Get the thieves , catch the thieves ! '' 
The deputies and the constable ran after the girl and the priest and quickly caught up with them because they were barefoot and the stones on the ground made it difficult for them to run . 
And in one swoop they led them off to jail . 
Early next morning the fishermen left Madrid to go to Toledo , and they never did find out what God had done with that simple little maiden and the devout priest . 
Man 's efforts are vain , his knowledge is nil , and he has no ability when God does not strengthen , teach , and guide him . 
All my efforts only served to make my guards more wary and careful . 
The outburst of the night before made them very angry , and they beat me so much along the road that they nearly left me for dead . 
They said , You damned fish -- you were trying to get away . 
If we were n't so kindhearted , we would kill you . 
You 're like an oak tree that wo n't give up its acorns unless it 's beaten . '' 
The fishermen took me into Toledo , pounded , cursed , and dying of hunger . 
They found a place to stay , near the square of Zocodover , at the house of a lady whose wines I used to announce . 
They put me in a room downstairs , and many people came to see me . 
One of them was my Elvira , leading my daughter by the hand . 
When I saw them I could n't hold back two Nile Rivers of tears that flowed from my eyes . 
I sighed and wept -- but to myself so the fishermen would n't deprive me of what I loved so much and what I wanted to feast my eyes on . 
Although it might have been better if those men who took away my voice had taken away my sight , too , because when I looked at my wife carefully I saw -- I do n't know if I should say it -- she looked like she was about to go into labor . 
I sat there absolutely amazed , although I should n't have been if I had thought about it because my lord the archdeacon told me when I left that city to go to war that he would treat her as if she were his very own . 
What really bothered me was that I could n't convince myself that she was pregnant by me because I had been gone for more than a year . 
When we were living together she used to say to me , `` Lazaro , do n't think I 'm cheating on you , because if you do you 're very wrong . '' 
And I was so satisfied that I avoided thinking anything bad about her the way the devil avoids holy water . 
I spent my life happy and content and not at all jealous -LRB- which is a madman 's sickness -RRB- . 
Time and again I have thought to myself that this business of children is all a matter of belief . 
Because how many men are there who love children they think are their own when the only thing they have in common is their name ? 
And there are others who hate their children because they get the notion that their wives have put horns on their heads . 
I began to count the days and months , and I found the road to my consolation closed off . 
Then I began to think that my wife might have dropsy . 
I did n't go on with this pious meditation very long because as soon as she left , two old women began to talk to each other : `` What do you think of that archpriestess ? 
She certainly does n't need her husband around . '' 
`` Who is the father ? '' 
asked the other . 
` Who ? '' 
answered the first , ` Why , the archpriest . 
And he 's such a good man that , to avoid the scandal that would spread if she gave birth in his house without a husband , he 's going to marry her to that foreigner , Pierre , next Sunday , and that fellow will be just as understanding as my friend , Lazaro . '' 
This was the last straw -- the non plus ultra -- of my understanding . 
My heart began to break out in a sweat in the water , and without being able to lift a hand I fainted in that hogsty . 
The water began to pour into me through every door and window , without any resistance . 
I looked like I was dead -LRB- although it was completely against my will , because I wanted to live as long as I could and as long as God would let me , in spite of those damned fishermen and my bad luck -RRB- . 
The fishermen were very upset , and they made every one leave . 
Then they very quickly lifted my head out of the water . 
When they saw that I had no pulse and that I 'd stopped breathing , they did , too . 
They started to moan over what they had lost -LRB- which was no small amount for them -RRB- , and they took me out of the cask . 
Then they tried to make me vomit up all I had drunk , but that was useless because death had come in and closed the door behind . 
When they saw all their dreams gone up in smoke , they turned as ashen as lilies on the Sunday after Easter . 
They could n't think of any way to abet or abate their trials and troubles . 
The Council of Three finally decreed that the following night they would take me to the river and throw me in with a stone tied around my neck so that what had caused my death would also be my grave . 
Never lose hope no matter how miserable you are , because when you least expect it God will open the doors and windows of His mercy and will show that nothing is impossible for Him , and that He has the knowledge , the ability , and the desire to change the plans of the wicked into healthful , beneficial remedies for those who trust in Him . 
Those brutal executioners decided that Death was n't joking -LRB- it seldom does -RRB- , so they put me in a sack , threw me across the back of a donkey like a wineskin -- or rather a waterskin , since I was full of water up to my mouth -- and started out along the road of Cuesta de Carmen . 
And they were more sorrowful than if they were going to bury the father who gave them life and the mother who bore them . 
It was my good fortune that when they put me on the mule , I was belly side down . 
Since my head was hanging downward , I began to spew out water as if they had lifted the floodgates on a dam , or as if I were a drop hammer . 
I came to , and when I caught my breath I realized that I was out of the water and out of that blasted hairy mess . 
I did n't know where I was or where they were taking me . 
I only heard them saying , `` For our own safety we 'll have to find a very deep well so they wo n't discover him so soon . '' 
Then I saw the handwriting on the wall and guessed what was happening . 
I knew that their bark could be no worse than their bite , and when I heard people approaching I called , `` Help , help , for God 's sake ! '' 
The people I had noticed were the night watch , and they ran up when they heard my cries , their swords out and ready . 
They searched the sack , and they found poor Lazaro -- a drenched haddock . 
Body and soul , they took us all off to jail on the spot : the fishermen were crying to see themselves imprisoned , and I was laughing to find myself free . 
They put them in a cell and me in a bed . 
The next morning they took our statements . 
The fishermen confessed that they had carried me all over Spain , but they said that they had done it thinking I was a fish and that they had asked for the Inquisition 's permission to do it . 
I told them the truth of the matter : how those fiends had tied me up so that I could n't make a peep . 
They had the archpriest and my good Bridget come to testify as to whether or not I really was the Lazaro of Tormes I said I was . 
My wife came in first , and she looked me over very carefully , and then said it was true that I did look something like her good husband , but she did n't think I was him because even though I had been an animal , I was more like a drone than a fish , and more like a bullock than a tuna . 
After saying this she made a deep bow and left . 
The attorney for those hangmen said I should be burned because I was undoubtedly a monster , and he was going to prove it . 
I thought to myself : What if there really is an enchanter following me and changing me into anything he likes ? 
The judges told him to be quiet . 
Then the archpriest came in . 
He saw me looking as pale and wrinkled as an old lady 's belly , and he said he did n't recognize my face or my figure . 
I refreshed his memory about some past things -LRB- many of them secret -RRB- that had happened between us ; I especially told him to think back on the night he came to my bed naked and said that he was afraid of a ghost in his bedroom , and then crawled into bed between my wife and me . 
So that I would n't go on with these reminders , he confessed that I really was his good friend and servant , Lazaro . 
The trial ended with the testimony of the captain who had taken me with him from Toledo . 
He was one of those who escaped the storm in a skiff , and he confessed that I was , in fact , his servant Lazaro . 
The time and place the fishermen said they had fished me out supported that . 
The judges sentenced them to two hundred whippings apiece and the confiscation of their belongings : a third of it would be given to the King , a third to the prisoners , and a third to Lazaro . 
They found them with two thousand pieces of silver , two mules , and a cart , and after the costs and expenditures were paid I got two hundred pieces of silver . 
The sailors were plucked and skinned , and I was rich and happy because I had never in my life been the owner of so much money at one time . 
I went to the house of a friend of mine , and after I had downed a few pitchers of wine to get rid of the bad taste of the water and was feeling mellow , I began to strut around like a count and to eat like a king ; I was esteemed by my friends , feared by my enemies , and wooed by everyone . 
My past troubles seemed like a dream to me , my present luck was like a port of leisure , and my future hopes a paradise of delights . 
Hardships humiliate , prosperity makes a man haughty . 
For the time those two hundred silver pieces lasted , if the King had called me his cousin I would have taken it as an insult . 
When we Spaniards get a silver coin , we 're princes , and even if we do n't have one we still have the vanity that goes with it . 
If you ask some shabby beggar who he is , he 'll tell you at the very least that he is of noble blood and that his bad luck has him backed into a corner , and that 's how this mad world is : it raises those who are on the bottom and lowers those who are on top . 
But even though it is that way , he wo n't give in to anyone , he puts only the highest value on himself , and he will die of hunger before he 'll work . 
And if Spaniards do take a job or learn something , they have such contempt for it that either they wo n't work or , if they do , their work is so bad that you can hardly find a good craftsman anywhere in Spain . 
I remember there was a cobbler in Salamanca , and whenever anyone brought him something to fix , he would deliver a soliloquy , complaining that fate had put him in such straits that he had to work in this lowly position when the good name of his family was so well known all over Spain . 
One day I asked one of his neighbors who that bragger 's parents were . 
They told me his father was a grape stomper , and in winter a hogkiller , and that his mother was a belly washer -LRB- I mean the maid for a tripe merchant -RRB- . 
I bought a worn-out velvet suit and a ragged cast-off cape from Segovia . 
The sword I wore was so enormous that its tip would unpave the streets as I walked . 
I did n't want to go and see my wife when I got out of jail so that she would want to see me even more , and also to take revenge for the disdain for me that she was carrying around inside herself . 
I really thought that when she saw me so well-dressed she would repent and greet me with open arms . 
But obstinate she was , and obstinate she remained . 
I found her with a new baby and a new husband . 
When she saw me she shouted , `` Get that damn drenched fish -- that plucked goose -- out of my sight because , if you do n't , I swear on my father 's grave that I 'll get up and poke his eyes out ! '' 
And I answered very coolly , `` Not so fast , Mrs. Streetwalker . 
If you wo n't admit I 'm your husband , then you 're not my wife either . 
Give me my daughter , and we 'll still be friends . 
I have enough of a fortune now , '' I went on , `` to marry her to a very honorable man . '' 
I thought those two hundred pieces of silver would turn out to be like the fifty silver coins of little Blessed John who , every time he spent them , would find fifty more in his purse . 
But since I was little Bedeviled Lazaro , it did n't turn out that way with me , as you will see in the next chapter . 
The archpriest contested my demand . 
He said she was n't mine , and to prove it he showed me the baptismal book , and when it was compared to the marriage records , it was evident that the child had been born four months after I knew my wife . 
Up to then I had felt as spirited as a stallion , but I suddenly realized they had made an ass of me : my daughter was n't mine at all . 
I shook the dust off my feet and washed my hands to show my innocence and that I was leaving for good . 
I turned my back on them , feeling as content as if I had never known them . 
I went looking for my friends and told them what had happened ; they consoled me -- which was n't hard for them to do . 
I did n't want to go back to my job as a town crier because my new velvet clothes had changed my self-esteem . 
While I was taking a walk to the Visagra gate I met an old woman , a friend of mine , at the gate of the convent of San Juan de los Reyes . 
After she greeted me she told me that my wife had softened when she 'd found out about all the money I had , especially now that that Frenchman had chastened her . 
I begged her to tell me what had happened . 
She said the archpriest and my wife had talked one day about whether it would be a good idea to take me back in and throw Frenchy out ; and they discussed the pros and cons of it . 
But their discussion was not so secret that the bridegroom did n't hear it . 
He pretended he had n't heard a thing , and the next morning he went to work at the olive grove . 
At noon , when his wife and mine brought his lunch out to him , he pulled off all her clothes , tied her to the trunk of a tree , and gave her more than a hundred lashes . 
And still not satisfied , he made all her clothes into a bundle , took off her jewelry , and walked away with it all , leaving her tied up , naked and bleeding . 
She would undoubtedly have died there if the archpriest had n't sent someone looking for her . 
The lady also told me she was absolutely sure that if I arranged for somebody to ask her , she would welcome me back , because she had heard my Elvira say , `` Poor me , why did n't I take back my good Lazaro ? 
He was as good as could be . 
He was never critical or particular , and I could do whatever I wanted . '' 
This was the touch that turned me , and I was thinking of taking the good old woman 's advice , but first I wanted to talk it over with my friends . 
We men are like barnyard hens : if we want to do something good we shout it out and cackle about it ; but if it 's something bad , we do n't want anybody to find out so they wo n't stop us from doing what we should n't . 
I went to see one of my friends , and I found three of them there together ; because after I had come into money , they multiplied like flies . 
I told them what I wanted to do -- go back to my wife and get away from wagging tongues because `` Better certain evil than doubtful good . '' 
They painted a black picture to me and said I was spineless and that I did n't have a brain in my body because the woman I wanted to live with was a whore , a hussy , a trollop , a slut , and , finally , a devil 's mule . 
-LRB- That 's what they call a priest 's mistress in Toledo . -RRB- 
My friends said so many things to me and gave me so many arguments that I decided not to beg or even ask my wife . 
When my good friends -LRB- damned friends , anyway -RRB- saw that their arguments and advice had done their work , they went even further . 
They said they were advising me , because I was such a good friend , to remove the spots and the stains on my honor and to defend it , since it had fallen into such bad times , by suing the archpriest and my wife . 
They said it would n't cost so much as a penny since they were lawyers . 
One of them was an attorney for lost causes , and he offered me a thousand pieces of silver from the profits . 
The other one was more knowledgeable because he was a prostitutes ' lawyer , and he told me that if he were in my shoes he would n't take less than two thousand . 
The third one assured me -LRB- and since he was a bumbailiff , he knew what he was talking about -RRB- that he had seen other lawsuits that were less clear , that had brought the people who began them an enormous amount of money . 
Furthermore , he thought that at the first confrontation that Domine Baccalaureus would fill my hands and anoint the lawyers ' to make us withdraw the lawsuit , and that he would beg me to go back to my wife . 
So I would get more honor and profit from it than if I went back to her on my own . 
My friends commended this business to me highly , luring me on with high hopes . 
I was taken in right then . 
I did n't know what to say to their sophist arguments , although it really seemed to me that it would be better to forgive and forget than to go to extremes , and that I should carry out the most difficult of God 's commandments -LRB- the fourth one -RRB- , which is to love your enemies -- especially since my wife had never acted like an enemy to me . 
In fact , it was because of her that I had begun to rise in the world and become known by many people who would point at me and say , `` There goes that nice fellow , Lazaro . '' 
Because of my wife I was somebody . 
If the daughter that the archdeacon said was n't mine , was or was n't , only God , who looks into men 's hearts , knows . 
It could be that he was fooled just the way I was . 
And it could happen that some of the people who are reading and laughing over my simpleness so hard they slobber on their beards might be raising the children of some ignorant priest . 
They might be working , sweating , and striving to leave the very ones rich who will impoverish their honor , and all the time they are so sure that if there is any woman in the world who is faithful , it 's their wife . 
And even your name , dear reader -- Lord Whitehall -- might really come from Wittol . 
But I do n't want to destroy anyone 's illusions . 
All these reflections still were n't enough , so I took out a lawsuit against the archpriest and my wife . 
Since there was ready money , they had them in jail inside of twenty-four hours : him in the archbishop 's prison and her in the public one . 
The lawyers told me not to worry about the money that that business could cost me since it would all come out of that priest 's hide . 
So , to make it even worse for the priest and to raise the costs , I gave whatever they asked me . 
They were walking around diligent , solicitous , and energetic . 
When they smelled my cash , they were like flies on honey : they did n't take a step in vain . 
In less than a week the lawsuit had moved far ahead , and my pocketbook had lost as much ground . 
The evidence was gathered easily because the constables who arrested my wife and the archpriest caught them in the act and had taken them off to jail in their nightshirts , the way they found them . 
There were many witnesses who told the truth . 
My good lawyers and counselors and the court clerk saw how thin and weak my pocketbook was getting , and they began to falter . 
It reached the point where I had to spur them harder than a hired mule to get them to make a move . 
The slowdown was so great that when the archpriest and his group heard about it , they started crowing and anointing the hands and feet of my representatives . 
They seemed like the weights on a clock that were going up just as fast as mine were coming down . 
They managed it so well that in two weeks the archpriest and my wife were out of jail on bond , and in less than one week more they condemned Lazaro with false witnesses so that he had to apologize , pay the court costs , and be banished from Toledo forever . 
I apologized the way I should have , since with only two hundred silver pieces I had taken a lawsuit out against a man who had that much money to burn . 
I gave them the shirt off my back to help pay the court costs , and I left the city in the raw . 
There I was , rich for an instant , suing a dignitary of the Holy Church of Toledo , an undertaking fit only for a prince . 
I had been respected by my friends , feared by my enemies , in the position of a gentleman who would n't put up with a whisper of aspersion . 
And just as suddenly I found myself thrown out -- not from any earthly paradise with figleaves to cover my private parts , but from the place I loved most and where I had gotten so much comfort and pleasure , using some rags I found in a rubbish heap to cover my nakedness . 
I took refuge in the common consolation of all unfortunates . 
I thought that since I was at the bottom of the wheel of fortune I would be certain to go back up . 
I recall now what I once heard my master , the blind man -LRB- who was like a fox whenever he started to preach -RRB- , say : Every man in the world rose and fell on the wheel of fortune ; some followed the movement of the wheel , and others went against it . 
And there was this difference between them : those who followed the wheel 's movement fell as quickly as they rose ; and those who went against it , once they reached the top -- even if they had to work hard at it -- they stayed there longer than the others . 
According to this , I was going right with the grain -- and so quickly that I was barely on top when I found myself in the abyss of misery . 
I found myself a picaro -- and a real one , since I had only been pretending up to then . 
And I could really say : Naked was I born , naked am I now , nothing lost and nothing gained . 
I started off toward Madrid , begging along the way since that was something I knew how to do very well . 
So there I was again , back at my trade . 
I told everyone about my troubles : some felt sorry , others laughed , and some gave me alms . 
Since I had no wife or children to support , with what they gave me I had more than enough to eat , and to drink , too . 
That year people had harvested so many grapes for wine that at nearly every door I went to they asked if I wanted anything to drink , because they did n't have any bread to give me . 
I never refused , and so sometimes I would down a good two gallons of wine before eating anything , and I 'd be happier than a girl on the eve of a party . 
Let me tell you what I really think : the picaresque life is the only life . 
There is nothing in the world like it . 
If rich men tried it , they would give up their estates for it , just the way the ancient philosophers gave up all they possessed to go over to that life . 
I say `` go over '' because the life of a philosopher and the life of a picaro is the same . 
The only difference is that philosophers gave up all they had for their love of that kind of life , and picaros find it without giving up anything . 
Philosophers abandoned their estates to contemplate natural and divine things , the movements of the heavens , with less distraction ; picaros do it to sow all their wild oats . 
Philosophers threw their goods into the sea ; picaros throw them in their stomachs . 
Philosophers despised those things as vain and transitory ; while picaros do n't care for them because they bring along cares and work -- something that goes against their profession . 
So the picaresque life is more leisurely than the life of kings , emperors , and popes . 
I decided to travel this road because it was freer , less dangerous , and never sad . 
There is no position , no science or art a man does not have to apply all his intelligence to if he wants to perfect his knowledge of it . 
Suppose a cobbler has been working at his job for thirty years . 
Tell him to make you a pair of shoes that are wide at the toe , high at the instep , with laces . 
Will he make them ? 
Before you get a pair the way you asked him , your feet will be shriveled . 
Ask a philosopher why a fly 's stool comes out black when it 's on a white object and white when it 's on something black . 
He 'll turn as red as a maiden who is caught doing it by candlelight , and he wo n't know what to answer . 
Or if he does answer this question , he wo n't be able to answer a hundred other tomfooleries . 
Near the town of Illescas , I ran into a fellow who I knew was an archpicaro by the way he looked . 
I went up to him the way I would to an oracle to ask him how I should act in this new life of mine so I would n't be arrested . 
He said that if I wanted to keep free of the law I should combine Mary 's idleness with Martha 's work . 
In other words , if I was going to be a picaro I should also be a kitchenhelper , a brothel servant , a slaughterhouse boy , or a baggage carrier , which was a way of covering up for the picaresque life . 
Furthermore , he said that because he had n't done this , even after the twenty years he 'd been following his profession , they had just yesterday whipped him up one side and down the other for being a tramp . 
I thanked him for the warning and took his advice . 
When I got to Madrid I bought a porter 's strap and stood in the middle of the square , happier than a cat with gibblets . 
As luck would have it , the first person to put me to work was a maiden -LRB- God forgive my lie -RRB- about eighteen years old , but more primped up than a novice in a convent . 
She told me to follow her . 
She took me down so many streets that I thought she was getting paid for walking or was playing a trick on me . 
After a while we came to a house that I recognized as one of ill repute when I saw the side door , the patio , and the beastly old maids dancing there . 
We went into her cell , and she asked me if I wanted her to pay me for my work before we left . 
I told her I would wait until we got to the place where I was taking the bundle . 
I loaded it on my back and started down the road to the Guadalajara gate . 
She told me to put it in a carriage to go to the Nagera fair . 
The load was light since it was mainly made up of mortars , cosmetics , and perfume bottles . 
On the way I found out that she had been in that profession for eight years . 
`` The first one to prick me , '' she said , `` was the Father Rector at Seville , where I 'm from , and he did it with such devotion that from that day to this I 'm very devoted to them . 
He put me in the charge of a holy woman , and she provided me with everything I needed for more than six months . 
Then a captain took me from there . 
And since that time I 've been led from pillar to post until here I am , like this . 
I wish to God I had never left that good father who treated me like a daughter and loved me like his sister . 
Anyway , I 've had to work just to be able to eat . '' 
At this time we came up to a carriage that was about to leave . 
I put the things I was carrying in it and asked her to pay me for my work . 
The chatterbox said she would be glad to , and she hauled off and hit me so hard she knocked me to the ground . 
Then she said , `` Are you so stupid that you ask someone of my profession for money ? 
Did n't I tell you before we left the brothel that I would give you satisfaction there for your work if you wanted ? '' 
She jumped into the carriage like a nag and spurred the horses away , leaving me feeling the sting . 
So there I sat , like a jackass , not sure what had happened to me . 
I thought that if that job finished as well as it was starting out , I would be rich by the end of the year . 
I had n't even left there when another carriage arrived from Alcala de Henares . 
The people inside jumped down : they were all whores , students , and friars .
