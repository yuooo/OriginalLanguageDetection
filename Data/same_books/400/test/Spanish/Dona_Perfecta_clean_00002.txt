Pepe laid the letter on the table after he had glanced through it , and said quietly : `` My aunt wishes me to marry Rosario ! '' 
`` She writes accepting joyfully my idea , '' said his father , with emotion . 
`` For the idea was mine . 
Yes , it is a long time , a very long time since it occurred to me ; but I did not wish to say anything to you until I knew what your sister might think about it . 
As you see , Perfecta receives my plan with joy ; she says that she too had thought of it , but that she did not venture to mention it to me , because you are -- you have seen what she says -- because you are a young man of very exceptional merit and her daughter is a country girl , without either a brilliant education or worldly attractions . 
Those are her words . 
My poor sister ! 
How good she is ! 
I see that you are not displeased ; I see that this project of mine , resembling a little the officious prevision of the fathers of former times who married their children without consulting their wishes in the matter , and making generally inconsiderate and unwise matches , does not seem absurd to you . 
God grant that this may be , as it seems to promise , one of the happiest . 
It is true that you have never seen your cousin , but we are both aware of her virtue , of her discretion , of her modest and noble simplicity . 
That nothing may be wanting , she is even beautiful . 
My opinion is , '' he added gayly , `` that you should at once start for that out-of-the-way episcopal city , that Urbs Augusta , and there , in the presence of my sister and her charming Rosarito , decide whether the latter is to be something more to me or not , than my niece . '' 
Pepe took up the letter again and read it through carefully . 
His countenance expressed neither joy nor sorrow . 
He might have been examining some plan for the junction of two railroads . 
`` In truth , '' said Don Juan , `` in that remote Orbajosa , where , by the way , you have some land that you might take a look at now , life passes with the tranquillity and the sweetness of an idyl . 
What patriarchal customs ! 
What noble simplicity ! 
What rural and Virgilian peace ! 
If , instead of being a mathematician , you were a Latinist , you would repeat , as you enter it , the ergo tua rura manebunt . 
What an admirable place in which to commune with one 's own soul and to prepare one 's self for good works . 
There all is kindness and goodness ; there the deceit and hypocrisy of our great cities are unknown ; there the holy inclinations which the turmoil of modern life stifles spring into being again ; there dormant faith reawakens and one feels within the breast an impulse , vague but keen , like the impatience of youth , that from the depths of the soul cries out : ' I wish to live ! ' '' 
A few days after this conference Pepe left Puerto Real . 
He had refused , some months before , a commission from the government to survey , in its mineralogical aspects , the basin of the River Nahara , in the valley of Orbajosa ; but the plans to which the conference above recorded gave rise , caused him to say to himself : `` It will be as well to make use of the time . 
Heaven only knows how long this courtship may last , or what hours of weariness it may bring with it . '' 
He went , then , to Madrid , solicited the commission to explore the basin of the Nahara , which he obtained without difficulty , although he did not belong officially to the mining corps , set out shortly afterward , and , after a second change of trains , the mixed train No. 65 bore him , as we have seen , to the loving arms of Uncle Licurgo . 
The age of our hero was about thirty-four years . 
He was of a robust constitution , of athletic build , and so admirably proportioned and of so commanding an appearance that , if he had worn a uniform , he would have presented the most martial air and figure that it is possible to imagine . 
His hair and beard were blond in color , but in his countenance there was none of the phlegmatic imperturbability of the Saxon , but , on the contrary , so much animation that his eyes , although they were not black , seemed to be so . 
His figure would have served as a perfect and beautiful model for a statue , on the pedestal of which the sculptor might engrave the words : `` Intellect , strength . '' 
If not in visible characters , he bore them vaguely expressed in the brilliancy of his glance , in the potent attraction with which his person was peculiarly endowed , and in the sympathy which his cordial manners inspired . 
He was not very talkative -- only persons of inconstant ideas and unstable judgment are prone to verbosity . 
His profound moral sense made him sparing of words in the disputes in which the men of the day are prone to engage on any and every subject , but in polite conversation he displayed an eloquence full of wit and intelligence , emanating always from good sense and a temperate and just appreciation of worldly matters . 
He had no toleration for those sophistries , and mystifications , and quibbles of the understanding with which persons of intelligence , imbued with affected culture , sometimes amuse themselves ; and in defence of the truth Pepe Rey employed at times , and not always with moderation , the weapon of ridicule . 
This was almost a defect in the eyes of many people who esteemed him , for our hero thus appeared wanting in respect for a multitude of things commonly accepted and believed . 
It must be acknowledged , although it may lessen him in the opinion of many , that Rey did not share the mild toleration of the compliant age which has invented strange disguises of words and of acts to conceal what to the general eye might be disagreeable . 
Such was the man , whatever slanderous tongues may say to the contrary , whom Uncle Licurgo introduced into Orbajosa just as the cathedral bells were ringing for high mass . 
When , looking over the garden wall , they saw the young girl and the Penitentiary , and then the flight of the former toward the house , they put spurs to their beasts and entered the Calle Real , where a great many idlers stood still to gaze at the traveller , as if he were a stranger and an intruder in the patriarchal city . 
Turning presently to the right and riding in the direction of the cathedral , whose massive bulk dominated the town , they entered the Calle del Condestable , in which , being narrow and paved , the hoofs of the animals clattered noisily , alarming the people of the neighborhood , who came to the windows and to the balconies to satisfy their curiosity . 
Shutters opened with a grating sound and various faces , almost all feminine , appeared above and below . 
By the time Pepe Rey had reached the threshold of the house of Polentinos many and diverse comments had been already made on his person . 
When Rosarito left him so abruptly the Penitentiary looked toward the garden wall , and seeing the faces of Licurgo and his companion , said to himself : `` So the prodigy is already here , then . '' 
He remained thoughtful for some moments , his cloak , grasped with both hands , folded over his abdomen , his eyes fixed on the ground , his gold-rimmed spectacles slipping gently toward the point of his nose , his under-lip moist and projecting , and his iron-gray eyebrows gathered in a slight frown . 
He was a pious and holy man , of uncommon learning and of irreproachable clerical habits , a little past his sixtieth year , affable in his manners , courteous and kind , and greatly addicted to giving advice and counsel to both men and women . 
For many years past he had been master of Latin and rhetoric in the Institute , which noble profession had supplied him with a large fund of quotations from Horace and of florid metaphors , which he employed with wit and opportuneness . 
Nothing more need be said regarding this personage , but that , as soon as he heard the trot of the animals approaching the Calle del Condestable , he arranged the folds of his cloak , straightened his hat , which was not altogether correctly placed upon his venerable head , and , walking toward the house , murmured : `` Let us go and see this paragon . '' 
Meanwhile Pepe was alighting from his nag , and Dona Perfecta , her face bathed in tears and barely able to utter a few trembling words , the sincere expression of her affection , was receiving him at the gate itself in her loving arms . 
`` Pepe -- but how tall you are ! 
And with a beard . 
Why , it seems only yesterday that I held you in my lap . 
And now you are a man , a grown-up man . 
Well , well ! 
How the years pass ! 
This is my daughter Rosario . '' 
As she said this they reached the parlor on the ground floor , which was generally used as a reception-room , and Dona Perfecta presented her daughter to Pepe . 
Rosario was a girl of delicate and fragile appearance , that revealed a tendency to pensive melancholy . 
In her delicate and pure countenance there was something of the soft , pearly pallor which most novelists attribute to their heroines , and without which sentimental varnish it appears that no Enriquieta or Julia can be interesting . 
But what chiefly distinguished Rosario was that her face expressed so much sweetness and modesty that the absence of the perfections it lacked was not observed . 
This is not to say that she was plain ; but , on the other hand , it is true that it would be an exaggeration to call her beautiful in the strictest meaning of the word . 
The real beauty of Dona Perfecta 's daughter consisted in a species of transparency , different from that of pearl , alabaster , marble , or any of the other substances used in descriptions of the human countenance ; a species of transparency through which the inmost depths of her soul were clearly visible ; depths not cavernous and gloomy , like those of the sea , but like those of a clear and placid river . 
But the material was wanting there for a complete personality . 
The channel was wanting , the banks were wanting . 
The vast wealth of her spirit overflowed , threatening to wash away the narrow borders . 
When her cousin saluted her she blushed crimson , and uttered only a few unintelligible words . 
`` You must be fainting with hunger , '' said Dona Perfecta to her nephew . 
`` You shall have your breakfast at once . '' 
`` With your permission , '' responded the traveller , `` I will first go and get rid of the dust of the journey . '' 
`` That is a sensible idea , '' said the senora . 
`` Rosario , take your cousin to the room that we have prepared for him . 
Do n't delay , nephew . 
I am going to give the necessary orders . '' 
Rosario took her cousin to a handsome apartment situated on the ground floor . 
The moment he entered it Pepe recognized in all the details of the room the diligent and loving hand of a woman . 
All was arranged with perfect taste , and the purity and freshness of everything in this charming nest invited to repose . 
The guest observed minute details that made him smile . 
`` Here is the bell , '' said Rosario , taking in her hand the bell-rope , the tassel of which hung over the head of the bed . 
`` All you have to do is to stretch out your hand . 
The writing-table is placed so that you will have the light from the left . 
See , in this basket you can throw the waste papers . 
Do you smoke ? '' 
`` Unfortunately , yes , '' responded Pepe Rey . 
`` Well , then , you can throw the ends of your cigars here , '' she said , touching with the tip of her shoe a utensil of gilt-brass filled with sand . 
`` There is nothing uglier than to see the floor covered with cigar-ends . 
Here is the washstand . 
For your clothes you have a wardrobe and a bureau . 
I think this is a bad place for the watch-case ; it would be better beside the bed . 
If the light annoys you , all you have to do is to lower the shade with this cord ; see , this way . '' 
The engineer was enchanted . 
Rosarito opened one of the windows . 
`` Look , '' she said , `` this window opens into the garden . 
The sun comes in here in the afternoon . 
Here we have hung the cage of a canary that sings as if he was crazy . 
If his singing disturbs you we will take it away . '' 
She opened another window on the opposite side of the room . 
`` This other window , '' she continued , `` looks out on the street . 
Look ; from here you can see the cathedral ; it is very handsome , and full of beautiful things . 
A great many English people come to see it . 
Do n't open both windows at the same time , because draughts are very bad . '' 
`` My dear cousin , '' said Pepe , his soul inundated with an inexplicable joy ; `` in all that is before my eyes I see an angel 's hand that can be only yours . 
What a beautiful room this is ! 
It seems to me as if I had lived in it all my life . 
It invites to peace . '' 
Rosarito made no answer to these affectionate expressions , and left the room , smiling . 
`` Make no delay , '' she said from the door ; `` the dining-room too is down stairs -- in the centre of this hall . '' 
Uncle Licurgo came in with the luggage . 
Pepe rewarded him with a liberality to which the countryman was not accustomed , and the latter , after humbly thanking the engineer , raised his hand to his head with a hesitating movement , and in an embarrassed tone , and mumbling his words , he said hesitatingly : `` When will it be most convenient for me to speak to Senor Don Jose about a -- a little matter of business ? '' 
`` A little matter of business ? 
At once , '' responded Pepe , opening one of his trunks . 
`` This is not a suitable time , '' said the countryman . 
`` When Senor Don Jose has rested it will be time enough . 
There are more days than sausages , as the saying is ; and after one day comes another . 
Rest now , Senor Don Jose . 
Whenever you want to take a ride -- the nag is not bad . 
Well , good-day , Senor Don Jose . 
I am much obliged to you . 
Ah ! 
I had forgotten , '' he added , returning a few moments later . 
`` If you have any message for the municipal judge -- I am going now to speak to him about our little affair . '' 
`` Give him my compliments , '' said Pepe gayly , no better way of getting rid of the Spartan legislator occurring to him . 
`` Good-by , then , Senor Don Jose . '' 
`` Good-by . '' 
The engineer had not yet taken his clothes out of the trunk when for the third time the shrewd eyes and the crafty face of Uncle Licurgo appeared in the door-way . 
`` I beg your pardon , Senor Don Jose , '' he said , displaying his brilliantly white teeth in an affected smile , `` but -- I wanted to say that if you wish to settle the matter by means of friendly arbitrations -- Although , as the saying is , ` Ask other people 's opinion of something that concerns only yourself , and some will say it is white and others black . ' '' 
`` Will you get away from here , man ? '' 
`` I say that , because I hate the law . 
I do n't want to have anything to do with the law . 
Well , good-by , again , Senor Don Jose . 
God give you long life to help the poor ! '' 
`` Good-by , man , good-by . '' 
Pepe turned the key in the lock of the door , saying to himself : `` The people of this town appear to be very litigious . '' 
A little later Pepe made his appearance in the dining-room . 
`` If you eat a hearty breakfast , '' said Dona Perfecta to him , in affectionate accents , `` you will have no appetite for dinner . 
We dine here at one . 
Perhaps you may not like the customs of the country . '' 
`` I am enchanted with them , aunt . '' 
`` Say , then , which you prefer -- to eat a hearty breakfast now , or to take something light , and keep your appetite for dinner . '' 
`` I prefer to take something light now , in order to have the pleasure of dining with you . 
But not even if I had found anything to eat in Villahorrenda , would I have eaten any thing at this early hour . '' 
`` Of course , I need not tell you that you are to treat us with perfect frankness . 
You may give your orders here as if you were in your own house . '' 
`` Thanks , aunt . '' 
`` But how like your father you are ! '' 
said the senora , regarding the young man , as he ate , with real delight . 
`` I can fancy I am looking now at my dear brother Juan . 
He sat just as you are sitting and ate as you are eating . 
In your expression , especially , you are as like as two drops of water . '' 
Pepe began his frugal breakfast . 
The words , as well as the manner and the expression , of his aunt and cousin inspired him with so much confidence that he already felt as if he were in his own house . 
`` Do you know what Rosario was saying to me this morning ? '' 
said Dona Perfecta , looking at her nephew . 
`` Well , she was saying that , as a man accustomed to the luxuries and the etiquette of the capital and to foreign ways , you would not be able to put up with the somewhat rustic simplicity and the lack of ceremony of our manner of life ; for here every thing is very plain . '' 
`` What a mistake ! '' 
responded Pepe , looking at his cousin . 
`` No one abhors more than I do the falseness and the hypocrisy of what is called high society . 
Believe me , I have long wished to give myself a complete bath in nature , as some one has said ; to live far from the turmoil of existence in the solitude and quiet of the country . 
I long for the tranquillity of a life without strife , without anxieties ; neither envying nor envied , as the poet has said . 
For a long time my studies at first , and my work afterward , prevented me from taking the rest which I need , and which my mind and my body both require ; but ever since I entered this house , my dear aunt , my dear cousin , I have felt myself surrounded by the peaceful atmosphere which I have longed for . 
You must not talk to me , then , of society , either high or low ; or of the world , either great or small , for I would willingly exchange them all for this peaceful retreat . '' 
While he was thus speaking , the glass door which led from the dining-room into the garden was obscured by the interposition between it and the light of a dark body . 
The glasses of a pair of spectacles , catching a sunbeam , sent forth a fugitive gleam ; the latch creaked , the door opened , and the Penitentiary gravely entered the room . 
He saluted those present , taking off his broad-brimmed hat and bowing until its brim touched the floor . 
`` It is the Senor Penitentiary , of our holy cathedral , '' said Dona Perfecta : `` a person whom we all esteem greatly , and whose friend you will , I hope , be . 
Take a seat , Senor Don Inocencio . '' 
Pepe shook hands with the venerable canon , and both sat down . 
`` If you are accustomed to smoke after meals , pray do so , '' said Dona Perfecta amiably ; `` and the Senor Penitentiary also . '' 
The worthy Don Inocencio drew from under his cassock a large leather cigar-case , which showed unmistakable signs of long use , opened it , and took from it two long cigarettes , one of which he offered to our friend . 
Rosario took a match from a little leaf-shaped matchbox , which the Spaniards ironically call a wagon , and the engineer and the canon were soon puffing their smoke over each other . 
`` And what does Senor Don Jose think of our dear city of Orbajosa ? '' 
asked the canon , shutting his left eye tightly , according to his habit when he smoked . 
`` I have not yet been able to form an idea of the town , '' said Pepe . 
`` From the little I have seen of it , however , I think that half a dozen large capitalists disposed to invest their money here , a pair of intelligent heads to direct the work of renovating the place , and a couple of thousands of active hands to carry it out , would not be a bad thing for Orbajosa . 
Coming from the entrance to the town to the door of this house , I saw more than a hundred beggars . 
The greater part of them are healthy , and even robust men . 
It is a pitiable army , the sight of which oppresses the heart . '' 
`` That is what charity is for , '' declared Don Inocencio . 
`` Apart from that , Orbajosa is not a poor town . 
You are already aware that the best garlic in all Spain is produced here . 
There are more than twenty rich families living among us . '' 
`` It is true , '' said Dona Perfecta , `` that the last few years have been wretched , owing to the drought ; but even so , the granaries are not empty , and several thousands of strings of garlic were recently carried to market . '' 
`` During the many years that I have lived in Orbajosa , '' said the priest , with a frown , `` I have seen innumerable persons come here from the capital , some brought by the electoral hurly-burly , others to visit some abandoned site , or to see the antiquities of the cathedral , and they all talk to us about the English ploughs and threshing-machines and water-power and banks , and I do n't know how many other absurdities . 
The burden of their song is that this place is very backward , and that it could be improved . 
Let them keep away from us , in the devil 's name ! 
We are well enough as we are , without the gentlemen from the capital visiting us ; a great deal better off without hearing that continual clamor about our poverty and the grandeurs and the wonders of other places . 
The fool in his own house is wiser than the wise man in another 's . 
Is it not so , Senor Don Jose ? 
Of course , you must n't imagine , even remotely , that I say this on your account . 
Not at all ! 
Of course not ! 
I know that we have before us one of the most eminent young men of modern Spain , a man who would be able to transform into fertile lands our arid wastes . 
And I am not at all angry because you sing us the same old song about the English ploughs and arboriculture and silviculture . 
Not in the least . 
Men of such great , such very great merit , may be excused for the contempt which they manifest for our littleness . 
No , no , my friend ; no , no , Senor Don Jose ! 
you are entitled to say any thing you please , even to tell us that we are not much better than Kaffirs . '' 
This philippic , concluded in a marked tone of irony , and all of it impertinent enough , did not please the young man ; but he refrained from manifesting the slightest annoyance and continued the conversation , endeavoring to avoid as far as possible the subjects in which the over-sensitive patriotism of the canon might find cause of offence . 
The latter rose when Dona Perfecta began to speak to her nephew about family matters , and took a few turns about the room . 
This was a spacious and well-lighted apartment , the walls of which were covered with an old-fashioned paper whose flowers and branches , although faded , preserved their original pattern , thanks to the cleanliness which reigned in each and every part of the dwelling . 
The clock , from the case of which hung , uncovered , the apparently motionless weights and the voluble pendulum , perpetually repeating No , no , occupied , with its variegated dial , the most prominent place among the solid pieces of furniture of the dining-room , the adornment of the walls being completed by a series of French engravings representing the exploits of the conqueror of Mexico , with prolix explanations at the foot of each concerning a Ferdinand Cortez , and a Donna Marine , as little true to nature as were the figures delineated by the ignorant artist . 
In the space between the two glass doors which communicated with the garden was an apparatus of brass , which it is not necessary to describe further than to say that it served to support a parrot , which maintained itself on it with the air of gravity and circumspection peculiar to those animals , taking note of everything that went on . 
The hard and ironical expression of the parrot tribe , their green coats , their red caps , their yellow boots , and finally , the hoarse , mocking words which they generally utter , give them a strange and repulsive aspect , half serious , half-comic . 
There is in their air an indescribable something of the stiffness of diplomats . 
At times they remind one of buffoons , and they always resemble those absurdly conceited people who , in their desire to appear very superior , look like caricatures . 
The Penitentiary was very fond of the parrot . 
When he left Dona Perfecta and Rosario conversing with the traveller , he went over to the bird , and , allowing it to bite his forefinger with the greatest good humor , said to it : `` Rascal , knave , why do n't you talk ? 
You would be of little account if you were n't a prater . 
The world of birds , as well as men , is full of praters . '' 
Then , with his own venerable hand , he took some peas from the dish beside him , and gave them to the bird to eat . 
The parrot began to call to the maid , asking her for some chocolate , and its words diverted the two ladies and the young man from a conversation which could not have been very engrossing . 
Suddenly Don Cayetano Polentinos , Dona Perfecta 's brother-in-law , appeared at the door , and entering the room with outstretched arms , cried : `` Let me embrace you , my dear Don Jose . '' 
They embraced each other cordially . 
Don Cayetano and Pepe were already acquainted with each other , for the eminent scholar and bibliophile was in the habit of making a trip to Madrid whenever an executor 's sale of the stock of some dealer in old books was advertised . 
Don Cayetano was tall and thin , of middle age , although constant study or ill-health had given him a worn appearance ; he expressed himself with a refined correctness which became him admirably , and he was affectionate and amiable in his manners , at times to excess . 
With respect to his vast learning , what can be said but that he was a real prodigy ? 
In Madrid his name was always mentioned with respect , and if Don Cayetano had lived in the capital , he could not have escaped becoming a member , in spite of his modesty , of every academy in it , past , present , and to come . 
But he was fond of quiet and retirement , and the place which vanity occupies in the souls of others , a pure passion for books , a love of solitary and secluded study , without any other aim or incentive than the books and the study themselves , occupied in his . 
He had formed in Orbajosa one of the finest libraries that is to be found in all Spain , and among his books he passed long hours of the day and of the night , compiling , classifying , taking notes , and selecting various sorts of precious information , or composing , perhaps , some hitherto unheard-of and undreamed-of work , worthy of so great a mind . 
His habits were patriarchal ; he ate little , drank less , and his only dissipations consisted of a luncheon in the Alamillos on very great occasions , and daily walks to a place called Mundogrande , where were often disinterred from the accumulated dust of twenty centuries , medals , bits of architecture , and occasionally an amphora or cubicularia of inestimable value . 
Don Cayetano and Dona Perfecta lived in such perfect harmony that the peace of Paradise was not to be compared to it . 
They never disagreed . 
It is true that Don Cayetano never interfered in the affairs of the house nor Dona Perfecta in those of the library , except to have it swept and dusted every Saturday , regarding with religious respect the books and papers that were in use on the table or anywhere else in the room . 
After the questions and answers proper to the occasion had been interchanged Don Cayetano said : `` I have already looked at the books . 
I am very sorry that you did not bring me the edition of 1527 . 
I shall have to make a journey to Madrid myself . 
Are you going to remain with us long ? 
The longer the better , my dear Pepe . 
How glad I am to have you here ! 
Between us both we will arrange a part of my library and make an index of the writers on the Art of Horsemanship . 
It is not always one has at hand a man of your talents . 
You shall see my library . 
You can take your fill of reading there -- as often as you like . 
You will see marvels , real marvels , inestimable treasures , rare works that no one but myself has a copy of . 
But I think it must be time for dinner , is it not , Jose ? 
Is it not , Perfecta ? 
Is it not , Rosarito ? 
Is it not , Senor Don Inocencio ? 
To-day you are doubly a Penitentiary -- I mean because you will accompany us in doing penance . '' 
The canon bowed and smiled , manifesting his pleased acquiescence . 
The dinner was substantial , and in all the dishes there was noticeable the excessive abundance of country banquets , realized at the expense of variety . 
There was enough to surfeit twice as many persons as sat down to table . 
The conversation turned on various subjects . 
`` You must visit our cathedral as soon as possible , '' said the canon . 
`` There are few cathedrals like ours , Senor Don Jose ! 
But of course you , who have seen so many wonders in foreign countries , will find nothing remarkable in our old church . 
We poor provincials of Orbajosa , however , think it divine . 
Master Lopez of Berganza , one of the prebendaries of the cathedral , called it in the sixteenth century pulchra augustissima . 
But perhaps for a man of your learning it would possess no merit , and some market constructed of iron would seem more beautiful . '' 
The ironical remarks of the wily canon annoyed Pepe Rey more and more every moment , but , determined to control himself and to conceal his anger , he answered only with vague words . 
Dona Perfecta then took up the theme and said playfully : `` Take care , Pepito ; I warn you that if you speak ill of our holy church we shall cease to be friends . 
You know a great deal , you are a man eminent for your knowledge on every subject , but if you are going to discover that that grand edifice is not the eighth wonder of the world you will do well to keep your knowledge to yourself and leave us in our ignorance . '' 
`` Far from thinking that the building is not handsome , '' responded Pepe , `` the little I have seen of its exterior has seemed to me of imposing beauty . 
So there is no need for you to be alarmed , aunt . 
And I am very far from being a savant . '' 
`` Softly ; softly , '' said the canon , extending his hand and giving his mouth a truce from eating in order to talk . 
`` Stop there -- do n't come now pretending modesty , Senor Don Jose ; we are too well aware of your great merit , of the high reputation you enjoy and the important part you play wherever you are , for that . 
Men like you are not to be met with every day . 
But now that I have extolled your merits in this way -- '' He stopped to eat a mouthful , and when his tongue was once more at liberty he continued thus : `` Now that I have extolled your merits in this way , permit me to express a different opinion with the frankness which belongs to my character . 
Yes , Senor Don Jose , yes , Senor Don Cayetano ; yes , senora and senorita , science , as the moderns study and propagate it , is the death of sentiment and of every sweet illusion . 
Under its influence the life of the spirit declines , every thing is reduced to fixed rules , and even the sublime charms of nature disappear . 
Science destroys the marvellous in the arts , as well as faith in the soul . 
Science says that every thing is a lie , and would reduce every thing to figures and lines , not only maria ac terras , where we are , but coelumque profundum , where God is . 
The wonderful visions of the soul , its mystic raptures , even the inspiration of the poets , are all a lie . 
The heart is a sponge ; the brain , a place for breeding maggots . '' 
Every one laughed , while the canon took a draught of wine . 
`` Come , now , will Senor Don Jose deny , '' continued the ecclesiastic , `` that science , as it is taught and propagated to-day , is fast making of the world and of the human race a great machine ? '' 
`` That depends , '' said Don Cayetano . 
`` Every thing has its pro and its contra . '' 
`` Take some more salad , Senor Penitentiary , '' said Dona Perfecta ; `` it is just as you like it -- with a good deal of mustard . '' 
Pepe Rey was not fond of engaging in useless discussions ; he was not a pedant , nor did he desire to make a display of his learning , and still less did he wish to do so in the presence of women , and in a private re-union ; but the importunate and aggressive verbosity of the canon required , in his opinion , a corrective . 
To flatter his vanity by agreeing with his views would , he thought , be a bad way to give it to him , and he determined therefore to express only such opinions as should be most directly opposed to those of the sarcastic Penitentiary and most offensive to him . 
`` So you wish to amuse yourself at my expense , '' he said to himself . 
`` Wait , and you will see what a fine dance I will lead you . '' 
Then he said aloud : `` All that the Senor Penitentiary has said ironically is the truth . 
But it is not our fault if science overturns day after day the vain idols of the past : its superstitions , its sophisms , its innumerable fables -- beautiful , some of them , ridiculous others -- for in the vineyard of the Lord grow both good fruit and bad . 
The world of illusions , which is , as we might say , a second world , is tumbling about us in ruins . 
Mysticism in religion , routine in science , mannerism in art , are falling , as the Pagan gods fell , amid jests . 
Farewell , foolish dreams ! 
the human race is awakening and its eyes behold the light . 
Its vain sentimentalism , its mysticism , its fevers , its hallucination , its delirium are passing away , and he who was before sick is now well and takes an ineffable delight in the just appreciation of things . 
Imagination , the terrible madwoman , who was the mistress of the house , has become the servant . 
Look around you , Senor Penitentiary , and you will see the admirable aggregation of truths which has taken the place of fable . 
The sky is not a vault ; the stars are not little lamps ; the moon is not a sportive huntress , but an opaque mass of stone ; the sun is not a gayly adorned and vagabond charioteer but a fixed fire ; Scylla and Charybdis are not nymphs but sunken rocks ; the sirens are seals ; and in the order of personages , Mercury is Manzanedo ; Mars is a clean-shaven old man , the Count von Moltke ; Nestor may be a gentleman in an overcoat , who is called M. Thiers ; Orpheus is Verdi ; Vulcan is Krupp ; Apollo is any poet . 
Do you wish more ? 
Well , then , Jupiter , a god who , if he were living now , would deserve to be put in jail , does not launch the thunderbolt , but the thunderbolt falls when electricity wills it . 
There is no Parnassus ; there is no Olympus ; there is no Stygian lake ; nor are there any other Elysian Fields than those of Paris . 
There is no other descent to hell than the descents of Geology , and this traveller , every time he returns from it , declares that there are no damned souls in the centre of the earth . 
There are no other ascents to heaven than those of Astronomy , and she , on her return , declares that she has not seen the six or seven circles of which Dante and the mystical dreamers of the Middle Ages speak . 
She finds only stars and distances , lines , vast spaces , and nothing more . 
There are now no false computations of the age of the earth , for paleontology and prehistoric research have counted the teeth of this skull in which we live and discovered the true age . 
Fable , whether it be called paganism or Christian idealism , exists no longer , and imagination plays only a secondary part . 
All the miracles possible are such as I work , whenever I desire to do so , in my laboratory , with my Bunsen pile , a conducting wire , and a magnetized needle . 
There are now no other multiplications of loaves and fishes than those which Industry makes , with her moulds and her machines , and those of the printing press , which imitates Nature , taking from a single type millions of copies . 
In short , my dear canon , orders have been given to put on the retired list all the absurdities , lies , illusions , dreams , sentimentalities , and prejudices which darken the understanding of man . 
Let us rejoice at the fact . '' 
When Pepe finished speaking , a furtive smile played upon the canon 's lips and his eyes were extraordinarily animated . 
Don Cayetano busied himself in giving various forms -- now rhomboidal , now prismatic -- to a little ball of bread . 
But Dona Perfecta was pale and kept her eyes fixed on the canon with observant insistence . 
Rosarito looked with amazement at her cousin . 
The latter , bending toward her , whispered under his breath : `` Do n't mind me , little cousin ; I am talking all this nonsense only to enrage the canon . '' 
`` Perhaps you think , '' said Dona Perfecta , with a tinge of conceit in her tones , `` that Senor Don Inocencio is going to remain silent and not give you an answer to each and every one of those points . '' 
`` Oh , no ! '' 
exclaimed the canon , arching his eyebrows . 
`` I will not attempt to measure my poor abilities with a champion so valiant and at the same time so well armed . 
Senor Don Jose knows every thing ; that is to say , he has at his command the whole arsenal of the exact sciences . 
Of course I know that the doctrines he upholds are false ; but I have neither the talent nor the eloquence to combat them . 
I would employ theological arguments , drawn from revelation , from faith , from the Divine Word ; but alas ! 
Senor Don Jose , who is an eminent savant , would laugh at theology , at faith , at revelation , at the holy prophets , at the gospel . 
A poor ignorant priest , an unhappy man who knows neither mathematics , nor German philosophy with its ego and its non ego , a poor dominie , who knows only the science of God and something of the Latin poets , can not enter into combat with so valiant a champion . '' 
Pepe Rey burst into a frank laugh . 
`` I see that Senor Don Inocencio , '' he said , `` has taken seriously all the nonsense I have been talking . 
Come , Senor Canon , regard the whole matter as a jest , and let it end there . 
I am quite sure that my opinions do not in reality differ greatly from yours . 
You are a pious and learned man ; it is I who am ignorant . 
If I have allowed myself to speak in jest , pardon me , all of you -- that is my way . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
responded the presbyter , visibly annoyed . 
`` Is that the way you want to get out of it now ? 
I am well aware , we are all well aware , that the views you have sustained are your own . 
It could not be otherwise . 
You are the man of the age . 
It can not be denied that you have a wonderful , a truly wonderful intellect . 
While you were talking , at the same time that I inwardly deplored errors so great , I could not but admire , I will confess it frankly , the loftiness of expression , the prodigious fluency , the surprising method of your reasoning , the force of your arguments . 
What a head , Senora Dona Perfecta , what a head your young nephew has ! 
When I was in Madrid and they took me to the Atheneum , I confess that I was amazed to see the wonderful talent which God has bestowed on the atheists and the Protestants . '' 
`` Senor Don Inocencio , '' said Dona Perfecta , looking alternately at her nephew and her friend , `` I think that in judging this boy you are more than benevolent . 
Do n't get angry , Pepe , or mind what I say , for I am neither a savante , nor a philosopher , nor a theologian ; but it seems to me that Senor Don Inocencio has just given a proof of his great modesty and Christian charity in not crushing you as he could have done if he had wished . '' 
`` Oh , senora ! '' 
said the ecclesiastic . 
`` That is the way with him , '' continued Dona Perfecta , `` always pretending to know nothing . 
And he knows more than the seven doctors put together . 
Ah , Senor Don Inocencio , how well the name you have suits you ! 
But do n't affect an unseasonable humility now . 
Why , my nephew has no pretensions . 
All he knows is what he has been taught . 
If he has been taught error , what more can he desire than that you should enlighten him and take him out of the limbo of his false doctrines ? '' 
`` Just so ; I desire nothing more than that the Senor Penitentiary should take me out , '' -- murmured Pepe , comprehending that without intending it , he had got himself into a labyrinth . 
`` I am a poor priest , whose only learning is some knowledge of the ancients , '' responded Don Inocencio . 
`` I recognize the immense value , from a worldly point of view , of Senor Don Jose 's scientific knowledge , and before so brilliant an oracle I prostrate myself and am silent . '' 
So saying , the canon folded his hands across his breast and bent his head . 
Pepe Rey was somewhat disturbed because of the turn which his mind had chosen to give to an idle discussion jestingly followed up , and in which he had engaged only to enliven the conversation a little . 
He thought that the most prudent course to pursue would be to end at once so dangerous a debate , and for this purpose he addressed a question to Senor Don Cayetano when the latter , shaking off the drowsiness which had overcome him after the dessert , offered the guests the indispensable toothpicks stuck in a china peacock with outspread tail . 
`` Yesterday I discovered a hand grasping the handle of an amphora , on which there are a number of hieratic characters . 
I will show it to you , '' said Don Cayetano , delighted to introduce a favorite theme . 
`` I suppose that Senor de Rey is very expert in archaeological matters also , '' said the canon , who , still implacable , pursued his victim to his last retreat . 
`` Of course , '' said Dona Perfecta . 
`` What is there that these clever children of our day do not understand ? 
They have all the sciences at their fingers ' ends . 
The universities and the academics teach them every thing in a twinkling , giving them a patent of learning . '' 
`` Oh , that is unjust ! '' 
responded the canon , observing the pained expression of the engineer 's countenance . 
`` My aunt is right , '' declared Pepe . 
`` At the present day we learn a little of every thing , and leave school with the rudiments of various studies . '' 
`` I was saying , '' continued the canon , `` that you are no doubt a great archaeologist . '' 
`` I know absolutely nothing of that science , '' responded the young man . 
`` Ruins are ruins , and I have never cared to cover myself with dust going among them . '' 
Don Cayetano made an expressive grimace . 
`` That is not to say that I condemn archaeology , '' said Dona Perfecta 's nephew quickly , observing with pain that he could not utter a word without wounding some one . 
`` I know that from that dust issues history . 
Those studies are delightful and very useful . '' 
`` You , '' said the Penitentiary , putting his toothpick into the last of his back teeth , `` are no doubt more inclined to controversial studies . 
An excellent idea has just occurred to me , Senor Don Jose ; you ought to be a lawyer . '' 
`` Law is a profession which I abhor , '' replied Pepe Rey . 
`` I know many estimable lawyers , among them my father , who is the best of men ; but , in spite of so favorable a specimen , I could never had brought myself to practise a profession which consists in defending with equal readiness the pro and the contra of a question . 
I know of no greater misjudgment , no greater prejudice , no greater blindness , than parents show in their eagerness to dedicate their sons to the law . 
The chief and the most terrible plague of Spain is the crowd of our young lawyers , for whose existence a fabulous number of lawsuits are necessary . 
Lawsuits multiply in proportion to the demand . 
And even thus , numbers are left without employment , and , as a jurisconsult can not put his hand to the plough or seat himself at the loom , the result is that brilliant squadron of idlers full of pretensions , who clamor for places , embarrass the administration , agitate public opinion , and breed revolutions . 
In some way they must make a living . 
It would be a greater misfortune if there were lawsuits enough for all of them . '' 
`` Pepe , for Heaven 's sake , take care what you say , '' said Dona Perfecta , in a tone of marked severity . 
`` But excuse him , Senor Don Inocencio , for he is not aware that you have a nephew who , although he has only lately left the university , is a prodigy in the law . '' 
`` I speak in general terms , '' said Pepe , with firmness . 
`` Being , as I am , the son of a distinguished lawyer , I can not be ignorant of the fact that there are many men who practise that noble profession with honor to themselves . '' 
`` No ; my nephew is only a boy yet , '' said the canon , with affected humility . 
`` Far be it from me to assert that he is a prodigy of learning , like Senor de Rey . 
In time , who can tell ? 
His talents are neither brilliant nor seductive . 
Of course , Jacinto 's ideas are solid and his judgment is sound . 
What he knows he knows thoroughly . 
He is unacquainted with sophistries and hollow phrases . '' 
Pepe Rey appeared every moment more and more disturbed . 
The idea that , without desiring it , his opinions should be in opposition to those of the friends of his aunt , vexed him , and he resolved to remain silent lest he and Don Inocencio should end by throwing the plates at each other 's heads . 
Fortunately the cathedral bell , calling the canon to the important duties of the choir , extricated him from his painful position . 
The venerable ecclesiastic rose and took leave of every one , treating Rey with as much amiability and kindness as if they had been old and dear friends . 
The canon , after offering his services to Pepe for all that he might require , promised to present his nephew to him in order that the young man might accompany him to see the town , speaking in the most affectionate terms and deigning , on leaving the room , to pat him on the shoulder . 
Pepe Rey , accepting with pleasure these formulas of concord , nevertheless felt indescribably relieved when the priest had left the dining-room and the house . 
A little later the scene had changed . 
Don Cayetano , finding rest from his sublime labors in a gentle slumber that had overcome him after dinner , reclined comfortably in an arm-chair in the dining-room . 
Rosarito , seated at one of the windows that opened into the garden , glanced at her cousin , saying to him with the mute eloquence of her eyes : `` Cousin , sit down here beside me and tell me every thing you have to say to me . '' 
Her cousin , mathematician though he was , understood . 
`` My dear cousin , '' said Pepe , `` how you must have been bored this afternoon by our disputes ! 
Heaven knows that for my own pleasure I would not have played the pedant as I did ; the canon was to blame for it . 
Do you know that that priest appears to me to be a singular character ? '' 
`` He is an excellent person ! '' 
responded Rosarito , showing the delight she felt at being able to give her cousin all the data and the information that he might require . 
`` Oh , yes ! 
An excellent person . 
That is very evident ! '' 
`` When you know him a little better , you will see that . '' 
`` That he is beyond all price !
