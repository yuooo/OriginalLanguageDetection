But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian . 
`` Drink and pass ! '' 
he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . 
`` The crew alone now drink . 
Round with it , round ! 
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; 't is hot as Satan 's hoof . 
So , so ; it goes round excellently . 
It spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye . 
Well done ; almost drained . 
That way it went , this way it comes . 
Hand it me -- here 's a hollow ! 
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . 
Steward , refill ! 
`` Attend now , my braves . 
I have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . 
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha ! 
boy , come back ? 
bad pennies come not sooner . 
Hand it me . 
Why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , were ' t not thou St. Vitus ' imp -- away , thou ague ! 
`` Advance , ye mates ! 
Cross your lances full before me . 
Well done ! 
Let me touch the axis . '' 
So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask . 
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life . 
The three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect . 
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright . 
`` In vain ! '' 
cried Ahab ; `` but , maybe , 't is well . 
For did ye three but once take the full-forced shock , then mine own electric thing , THAT had perhaps expired from out me . 
Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . 
Perchance ye need it not . 
Down lances ! 
And now , ye mates , I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . 
Disdain the task ? 
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? 
Oh , my sweet cardinals ! 
your own condescension , THAT shall bend ye to it . 
I do not order ye ; ye will it . 
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! '' 
Silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him . 
`` Stab me not with that keen steel ! 
Cant them ; cant them over ! 
know ye not the goblet end ? 
Turn up the socket ! 
So , so ; now , ye cup-bearers , advance . 
The irons ! 
take them ; hold them while I fill ! '' 
Forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter . 
`` Now , three to three , ye stand . 
Commend the murderous chalices ! 
Bestow them , ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league . 
Ha ! 
Starbuck ! 
but the deed is done ! 
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it . 
Drink , ye harpooneers ! 
drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat 's bow -- Death to Moby Dick ! 
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death ! '' 
The long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss . 
Starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered . 
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin . 
THE CABIN ; BY THE STERN WINDOWS ; AHAB SITTING ALONE , AND GAZING OUT . 
I leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where'er I sail . 
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass . 
Yonder , by ever-brimming goblet 's rim , the warm waves blush like wine . 
The gold brow plumbs the blue . 
The diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up ! 
she wearies with her endless hill . 
Is , then , the crown too heavy that I wear ? 
this Iron Crown of Lombardy . 
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds . 
'T is iron -- that I know -- not gold . 
'T is split , too -- that I feel ; the jagged edge galls me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight ! 
Dry heat upon my brow ? 
Oh ! 
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed . 
No more . 
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne'er enjoy . 
Gifted with the high perception , I lack the low , enjoying power ; damned , most subtly and most malignantly ! 
damned in the midst of Paradise ! 
Good night -- good night ! 
-LRB- WAVING HIS HAND , HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW . -RRB- 
'T was not so hard a task . 
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve . 
Or , if you will , like so many ant-hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match . 
Oh , hard ! 
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting ! 
What I 've dared , I 've willed ; and what I 've willed , I 'll do ! 
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac , I am madness maddened ! 
That wild madness that 's only calm to comprehend itself ! 
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye ! 
I lost this leg . 
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer . 
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one . 
That 's more than ye , ye great gods , ever were . 
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket-players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes ! 
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; do n't pommel ME ! 
No , ye 've knocked me down , and I am up again ; but YE have run and hidden . 
Come forth from behind your cotton bags ! 
I have no long gun to reach ye . 
Come , Ahab 's compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me . 
Swerve me ? 
ye can not swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves ! 
man has ye there . 
Swerve me ? 
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run . 
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! 
Naught 's an obstacle , naught 's an angle to the iron way ! 
BY THE MAINMAST ; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT . 
My soul is more than matched ; she 's overmanned ; and by a madman ! 
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field ! 
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me ! 
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it . 
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut . 
Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it . 
Yet is there hope . 
Time and tide flow wide . 
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe . 
His heaven-insulting purpose , God may wedge aside . 
I would up heart , were it not like lead . 
But my whole clock 's run down ; my heart the all-controlling weight , I have no key to lift again . 
-LSB- A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE . -RSB- 
Oh , God ! 
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! 
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea . 
The white whale is their demigorgon . 
Hark ! 
the infernal orgies ! 
that revelry is forward ! 
mark the unfaltering silence aft ! 
Methinks it pictures life . 
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . 
The long howl thrills me through ! 
Peace ! 
ye revellers , and set the watch ! 
Oh , life ! 
't is in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , -- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life ! 
't is now that I do feel the latent horror in thee ! 
but 't is not me ! 
that horror 's out of me ! 
and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! 
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences ! 
Fore-Top . 
-LRB- STUBB SOLUS , AND MENDING A BRACE . -RRB- 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
hem ! 
clear my throat ! 
-- I 've been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha 's the final consequence . 
Why so ? 
Because a laugh 's the wisest , easiest answer to all that 's queer ; and come what will , one comfort 's always left -- that unfailing comfort is , it 's all predestinated . 
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt . 
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him , too . 
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it . 
Well , Stubb , WISE Stubb -- that 's my title -- well , Stubb , what of it , Stubb ? 
Here 's a carcase . 
I know not all that may be coming , but be it what it will , I 'll go to it laughing . 
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles ! 
I feel funny . 
Fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
What 's my juicy little pear at home doing now ? 
Crying its eyes out ? 
-- Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers , I dare say , gay as a frigate 's pennant , and so am I -- fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- ASIDE -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming . 
HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS . 
-LRB- FORESAIL RISES AND DISCOVERS THE WATCH STANDING , LOUNGING , LEANING , AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES , ALL SINGING IN CHORUS . -RRB- 
Farewell and adieu to you , Spanish ladies ! 
Farewell and adieu to you , ladies of Spain ! 
Our captain 's commanded . 
-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
Oh , boys , do n't be sentimental ; it 's bad for the digestion ! 
Take a tonic , follow me ! 
-LRB- SINGS , AND ALL FOLLOW -RRB- Our captain stood upon the deck , A spy-glass in his hand , A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand . 
Oh , your tubs in your boats , my boys , And by your braces stand , And we 'll have one of those fine whales , Hand , boys , over hand ! 
So , be cheery , my lads ! 
may your hearts never fail ! 
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale ! 
MATE 'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK . 
Eight bells there , forward ! 
2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
Avast the chorus ! 
Eight bells there ! 
d'ye hear , bell-boy ? 
Strike the bell eight , thou Pip ! 
thou blackling ! 
and let me call the watch . 
I 've the sort of mouth for that -- the hogshead mouth . 
So , so , -LRB- THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE , -RRB- Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s , a-h-o-y ! 
Eight bells there below ! 
Tumble up ! 
DUTCH SAILOR . 
Grand snoozing to-night , maty ; fat night for that . 
I mark this in our old Mogul 's wine ; it 's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others . 
We sing ; they sleep -- aye , lie down there , like ground-tier butts . 
At 'em again ! 
There , take this copper-pump , and hail 'em through it . 
Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses . 
Tell 'em it 's the resurrection ; they must kiss their last , and come to judgment . 
That 's the way -- THAT 'S it ; thy throat ai n't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter . 
FRENCH SAILOR . 
Hist , boys ! 
let 's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay . 
What say ye ? 
There comes the other watch . 
Stand by all legs ! 
Pip ! 
little Pip ! 
hurrah with your tambourine ! 
PIP . 
-LRB- SULKY AND SLEEPY -RRB- Do n't know where it is . 
FRENCH SAILOR . 
Beat thy belly , then , and wag thy ears . 
Jig it , men , I say ; merry 's the word ; hurrah ! 
Damn me , wo n't you dance ? 
Form , now , Indian-file , and gallop into the double-shuffle ? 
Throw yourselves ! 
Legs ! 
legs ! 
ICELAND SAILOR . 
I do n't like your floor , maty ; it 's too springy to my taste . 
I 'm used to ice-floors . 
I 'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject ; but excuse me . 
MALTESE SAILOR . 
Me too ; where 's your girls ? 
Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right , and say to himself , how d'ye do ? 
Partners ! 
I must have partners ! 
SICILIAN SAILOR . 
Aye ; girls and a green ! 
-- then I 'll hop with ye ; yea , turn grasshopper ! 
LONG-ISLAND SAILOR . 
Well , well , ye sulkies , there 's plenty more of us . 
Hoe corn when you may , say I. All legs go to harvest soon . 
Ah ! 
here comes the music ; now for it ! 
AZORE SAILOR . 
-LRB- ASCENDING , AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE . -RRB- 
Here you are , Pip ; and there 's the windlass-bitts ; up you mount ! 
Now , boys ! 
-LRB- THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE ; SOME GO BELOW ; SOME SLEEP OR LIE AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING . 
OATHS A-PLENTY . -RRB- 
AZORE SAILOR . 
-LRB- DANCING -RRB- Go it , Pip ! 
Bang it , bell-boy ! 
Rig it , dig it , stig it , quig it , bell-boy ! 
Make fire-flies ; break the jinglers ! 
PIP . 
Jinglers , you say ? 
-- there goes another , dropped off ; I pound it so . 
CHINA SAILOR . 
Rattle thy teeth , then , and pound away ; make a pagoda of thyself . 
FRENCH SAILOR . 
Merry-mad ! 
Hold up thy hoop , Pip , till I jump through it ! 
Split jibs ! 
tear yourselves ! 
TASHTEGO . 
-LRB- QUIETLY SMOKING -RRB- That 's a white man ; he calls that fun : humph ! 
I save my sweat . 
OLD MANX SAILOR . 
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over . 
I 'll dance over your grave , I will -- that 's the bitterest threat of your night-women , that beat head-winds round corners . 
O Christ ! 
to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews ! 
Well , well ; belike the whole world 's a ball , as you scholars have it ; and so 't is right to make one ballroom of it . 
Dance on , lads , you 're young ; I was once . 
3D NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
Spell oh ! 
-- whew ! 
this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm -- give us a whiff , Tash . 
-LRB- THEY CEASE DANCING , AND GATHER IN CLUSTERS . 
MEANTIME THE SKY DARKENS -- THE WIND RISES . -RRB- 
LASCAR SAILOR . 
By Brahma ! 
boys , it 'll be douse sail soon . 
The sky-born , high-tide Ganges turned to wind ! 
Thou showest thy black brow , Seeva ! 
MALTESE SAILOR . 
-LRB- RECLINING AND SHAKING HIS CAP . -RRB- 
It 's the waves -- the snow 's caps turn to jig it now . 
They 'll shake their tassels soon . 
Now would all the waves were women , then I 'd go drown , and chassee with them evermore ! 
There 's naught so sweet on earth -- heaven may not match it ! 
-- as those swift glances of warm , wild bosoms in the dance , when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe , bursting grapes . 
SICILIAN SAILOR . 
-LRB- RECLINING . -RRB- 
Tell me not of it ! 
Hark ye , lad -- fleet interlacings of the limbs -- lithe swayings -- coyings -- flutterings ! 
lip ! 
heart ! 
hip ! 
all graze : unceasing touch and go ! 
not taste , observe ye , else come satiety . 
Eh , Pagan ? 
-LRB- NUDGING . -RRB- 
TAHITAN SAILOR . 
-LRB- RECLINING ON A MAT . -RRB- 
Hail , holy nakedness of our dancing girls ! 
-- the Heeva-Heeva ! 
Ah ! 
low veiled , high palmed Tahiti ! 
I still rest me on thy mat , but the soft soil has slid ! 
I saw thee woven in the wood , my mat ! 
green the first day I brought ye thence ; now worn and wilted quite . 
Ah me ! 
-- not thou nor I can bear the change ! 
How then , if so be transplanted to yon sky ? 
Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee 's peak of spears , when they leap down the crags and drown the villages ? 
-- The blast ! 
the blast ! 
Up , spine , and meet it ! 
-LRB- LEAPS TO HIS FEET . -RRB- 
PORTUGUESE SAILOR . 
How the sea rolls swashing ` gainst the side ! 
Stand by for reefing , hearties ! 
the winds are just crossing swords , pell-mell they 'll go lunging presently . 
DANISH SAILOR . 
Crack , crack , old ship ! 
so long as thou crackest , thou holdest ! 
Well done ! 
The mate there holds ye to it stiffly . 
He 's no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat , put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns , on which the sea-salt cakes ! 
4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
He has his orders , mind ye that . 
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall , something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol -- fire your ship right into it ! 
ENGLISH SAILOR . 
Blood ! 
but that old man 's a grand old cove ! 
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale ! 
ALL . 
Aye ! 
aye ! 
OLD MANX SAILOR . 
How the three pines shake ! 
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil , and here there 's none but the crew 's cursed clay . 
Steady , helmsman ! 
steady . 
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore , and keeled hulls split at sea . 
Our captain has his birthmark ; look yonder , boys , there 's another in the sky -- lurid-like , ye see , all else pitch black . 
DAGGOO . 
What of that ? 
Who 's afraid of black 's afraid of me ! 
I 'm quarried out of it ! 
SPANISH SAILOR . 
-LRB- ASIDE . -RRB- 
He wants to bully , ah ! 
-- the old grudge makes me touchy -LRB- ADVANCING . -RRB- 
Aye , harpooneer , thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind -- devilish dark at that . 
No offence . 
DAGGOO -LRB- GRIMLY -RRB- . 
None . 
ST. JAGO 'S SAILOR . 
That Spaniard 's mad or drunk . 
But that ca n't be , or else in his one case our old Mogul 's fire-waters are somewhat long in working . 
5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR . 
What 's that I saw -- lightning ? 
Yes . 
SPANISH SAILOR . 
No ; Daggoo showing his teeth . 
DAGGOO -LRB- SPRINGING -RRB- . 
Swallow thine , mannikin ! 
White skin , white liver ! 
SPANISH SAILOR -LRB- MEETING HIM -RRB- . 
Knife thee heartily ! 
big frame , small spirit ! 
ALL . 
A row ! 
a row ! 
a row ! 
TASHTEGO -LRB- WITH A WHIFF -RRB- . 
A row a ` low , and a row aloft -- Gods and men -- both brawlers ! 
Humph ! 
BELFAST SAILOR . 
A row ! 
arrah a row ! 
The Virgin be blessed , a row ! 
Plunge in with ye ! 
ENGLISH SAILOR . 
Fair play ! 
Snatch the Spaniard 's knife ! 
A ring , a ring ! 
OLD MANX SAILOR . 
Ready formed . 
There ! 
the ringed horizon .
