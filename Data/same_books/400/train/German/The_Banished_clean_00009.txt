He resolved therefore to see the stranger some night without an invitation , and for this purpose he sought a fitting opportunity . 
His room , which he was obliged to enter every night regularly at eight o'clock , overlooked the valley below , and was situated immediately opposite to the side on which the bridge was placed . 
It was therefore out of the question to see him coming from this position . 
The large room on the second floor , which was not far from his own , was locked every night , and consequently debarred him from satisfying his curiosity from thence . 
On the landing place , to which the doors of the different rooms led , there were indeed two windows looking towards the bridge , but as they were grated and stood high , the view from them was confined to the distant country , and there was no possibility of obtaining a sight of the desired spot . 
Nothing was left for him , therefore , than to conceal himself somewhere in order to gratify his curiosity . 
On the first floor the plan was impossible , because the many people living there would subject him to discovery . 
But when he examined the gateway and the stables , which were hewn out of the solid rock , he discovered a niche near the drawbridge , concealed behind the wings of the gate , which were only shut when an enemy was before the castle . 
This was the spot which appeared best suited to secure him from discovery , and which afforded room enough to enable him to observe what was going on . 
On the left of the niche the drawbridge joined on to the gate , the stairs which led up to the dwelling rooms were on the right , in front was the entrance passage , which every one must pass who came into the castle . 
Albert determined to slip into this position on the coming night . 
At eight o'clock a page brought him his night lamp , and led him , as usual , to his apartment . 
The lord of the castle and his daughter kindly wished him good night . 
He entered his room , and dismissing his servant , who generally assisted him to undress , threw himself on his bed in his clothes . 
He listened attentively to each hour of the clock as it struck in the village , and whose sounds were wafted towards him by the night-breeze . 
He often closed his eyes , and at times fell into that state when it requires painful exertion to combat the power of sleep . 
His present object was sufficiently important to keep him on the alert , and prevent him losing the opportunity of satisfying his curiosity . 
Ten o'clock had long struck ; all was as still as death in the castle . 
He jumped up , took off his heavy boots and spurs , threw his cloak over him , and cautiously opened the door of his room . 
He held his breath , fearing to make the least noise ; the hinges of the door creaked -- he stopped to listen whether any one had heard the treacherous sound . 
Every thing remained quiet ; the moon threw a dim light on the landing place , and Albert thought himself fortunate she had not betrayed him a second time . 
He glided softly towards the winding stairs , and stopped again to listen if all was quiet ; he heard nothing but the whistling of the wind , and the rustling of the oak trees on the further side of the bridge . 
He stepped carefully down the stairs . 
The least noise sounds louder in the depth and quiet of night than at other times ; attention is awakened at the slightest movement , which would not be noticed in the day time . 
If his foot stepped upon a grain of sand , its grating sound went up the winding stairs , and startled him into the supposition that the whole house was on the alert . 
Having arrived at the first floor , he listened again , and heard nothing but the faint cracking of the dying embers on the hearth of the kitchen . 
At last he got to his destination , an expedition upon which he had expended a whole quarter of an hour 's time , which otherwise was an affair but of a moment . 
He placed himself in the niche , and drew the wing of the gate closer to him , so that it fully covered his position . 
A fissure in the door was large enough to enable him to see distinctly every thing that passed . 
Nothing appeared to move in the castle , though he thought he heard light footsteps above him , which he supposed might be those of Bertha . 
After waiting a tedious long quarter of an hour , the village clock struck eleven . 
This being the appointed time of the nocturnal visit , Albert directed all his attention to hear the stranger 's approach . 
A few minutes after he heard the dog bark , when at the same time a deep voice from the other side of the ditch hailed , and said , `` Lichtenstein ! '' 
`` Who comes there ? '' 
was answered from the castle . 
`` The man is there , '' replied the other voice , which sounded familiar to his ear as being the one he had heard in the cavern . 
The watchman , an old man , came forth from a casemate hewn out of the rock , and opened the lock of the drawbridge with a large curiously wrought key . 
Whilst he was thus employed the dog came bounding down the stairs , whining and wagging his tail , and jumped upon the old man , as if to assist him in letting fall the bridge for his master to enter . 
Bertha shortly after descended with a lantern , and assisted him with her light , for it appeared he had some difficulty in opening the lock . 
`` Make haste , Balthaser , '' she whispered to the old watchman , `` he has been waiting some time , it is cold outside , and the wind blows keen . '' 
`` I have now only to unfasten the chain , worthy lady , '' he answered ; `` you shall soon see how well my bridge falls . 
I have oiled the hinges , as you ordered me , so that they do not creek any more , and disturb Mrs. Rosel out of her slumbers . '' 
The chains rattled in their ascent , the bridge sunk gradually into its place , and the banished man , enveloped in his coarse cloak , came across . 
Though his bearing was deeply engraven on Albert 's mind , yet his strikingly bold features , his commanding eye , his open forehead , and the agile movements of his limbs , filled the young man anew with admiration . 
The nocturnal guest assisted Balthaser , the doorkeeper , to draw up the bridge , with a power which appeared almost superhuman . 
When the old man had withdrawn to his sleeping place , Albert overheard the following conversation between the visitor and Bertha . 
`` Is there any news from TÃ¼bingen ? 
Has Maxx Stumpf returned ? 
I read bad news in your countenance . '' 
`` No , sir , he has not yet returned , '' she replied ; `` my father expected him this very night . '' 
`` Oh , that the devil would give him heels ! 
I must remain here till he comes , if it be for a whole day . 
Ha ! 
a cold night , lady , '' said the exile ; `` the screech owls will be frozen in the cavern , for I left them crying in most pitiable tones . '' 
`` Yes , it is indeed cold , '' she answered ; `` I would not go down there , upon any account ; and how dreadful must it be to hear those cries ; I shudder to think of it . '' 
`` If young Albert accompanied you , you would have no objections to go , '' answered the other smiling , and chucking the blushing girl under the chin ; `` is it not so ? 
You would not hesitate to follow him there , much as you appear to dread it now . '' 
`` Ah ! 
sir , '' she replied , `` how can you talk in that way ? 
Do you know , I 'll not come down again to let you in if you take such liberties . '' 
`` Well , but I merely spoke in jest , '' said the knight , and gently pinched her glowing cheek ; `` you know how little opportunity I have in my dwelling to enjoy a joke . 
What will you give me to say a good word to your father , to induce him to make the youth your husband ? 
You are aware the old gentleman does every thing I ask him ; and if I recommend a son-in-law to him , he would accept him at all hazards . '' 
Bertha opened wide her beautiful eyes , and cast a grateful look at him . 
`` Dear sir , '' she answered , `` I will not forbid your saying a kind word for Albert , particularly as my father is well inclined towards him . '' 
`` But I shall expect some reward for my trouble . 
Everything has its price ; so what will you give ? '' 
Bertha cast her eyes to the ground . 
`` A heartfelt thank-ye , '' she replied ; `` but come , sir , my father has been waiting for us a long time . '' 
She was in the act of leading on , when the knight , taking her by the hand , detained her . 
Albert 's heart beat so hard as almost to be heard ; he broke out into a violent heat , and then became ice-cold ; he laid hold of the handle of the door , and was on the point of sallying forth to forbid the promise of a fixed price being given upon any pretext . 
`` Why are you in such haste ? '' 
he heard the man of the cavern say . 
`` Well , for one kiss only , and I will persuade your father to send for the priest on the spot , to perform the holy ceremony . '' 
He bent his head towards the offended , blushing girl . 
Albert saw every thing swimming before his eyes , and was again on the point of bursting from his place of concealment , but the determined reply of his lady love checked him from taking the rash step . 
She beheld the man with a forbidding look . 
`` It is impossible your Grace can be in earnest , '' she said ; `` otherwise you now see me for the last time . '' 
`` If you knew how much this scornful air becomes you , '' he answered , with unaltered kindness , `` you would never cease to be in anger . 
At any rate I admire your fidelity ; for when the heart is deeply engaged with one object , none other need hope for such a favour . 
But on your marriage day I will demand the favour , with the permission of your bridegroom , and then we 'll see who is right . '' 
`` That you may do , '' said Bertha , smiling , whilst she withdrew her hand from his , and led the way with the light in her hand ; `` but you had better prepare yourself for a refusal , for he is not fond of trifling on this point . '' 
`` He is uncommonly jealous , '' replied the knight , as they proceeded up stairs . 
`` I could tell you something upon that subject , which took place between him and me ; but I promised silence -- '' The sound of their voices died away gradually , and at last became indistinct to Albert 's ear . 
He breathed freely again . 
He listened and remained in his position until he satisfied himself thoroughly that no one was on the stairs or in the passages , and , taking advantage of the opportunity , slipped up into his own room much quicker than he had descended from it . 
The last words of Bertha and the exile still resounded in his ears . 
He blushed to think of his unfounded jealousy , which had again tormented him this night . 
Bertha had , unknown to herself , given him evident proofs of the purity of her heart and faithful attachment to him ; and it was only when he laid his head on his pillow and fell to sleep , that his mind was eased of the pain of having unjustly suspected her . 
When he left his room the next morning at seven o'clock , the hour which the family generally assembled at breakfast , Bertha met him on the landing place with the appearance of having been weeping . 
She took him on one side , and whispered , `` Tread softly , Albert ; the knight of the cavern is still with us ; he has been asleep about an hour ; we must not disturb him . '' 
`` The exile ! '' 
asked Albert in astonishment , `` does he dare remain here during the day ? 
what has happened ? 
is he unwell ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
answered Bertha , whilst a fresh tear hung on her eyelid , `` no ! 
he expects a messenger from TÃ¼bingen about this time , and is determined to await him . 
We begged and prayed him to depart before daybreak , but he would not listen to our warning , so firm is his resolution to remain at all hazards . '' 
`` But could not the messenger have gone to him in the cavern ? '' 
said Albert ; `` he runs too great a risk unnecessarily . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you do n't know him ; it is his bane when he once gets a thing into his head to be obstinately immoveable ; and then he is so distrustful of others , even of his best friends . 
It was quite impossible for us to persuade him to leave the castle this morning , because he might have thought , perhaps , we wished to get rid of him for our own safety . 
His principal reason for remaining is , I believe , to consult with my father , when the messenger arrives . '' 
During this conversation they remained stationary on the landing place , but Bertha now opened the door of her father 's apartment as gently as possible , and they entered together . 
This room , or what would be called in a modern establishment the gentlemen 's room , was distinguished from the saloon on the second floor from being somewhat smaller . 
It had a view of the surrounding country on three sides , through small round windows , now pierced by the sun 's morning rays . 
The ceiling and walls were wainscoted with dark brown wood , fancifully inlaid with other coloured woods . 
A few portraits of the ancestors of Lichtenstein graced the side of the wall opposite to the windows , and the tables and furniture shewed that the present occupier of the castle was a friend of old customs and times , and that his property would descend to his daughter in the same unaltered state it had been left by his great-grandfather . 
The old knight was seated at a large table in the middle of the room when they entered . 
Supporting his long-bearded chin in his hand , he sat gloomy and motionless , with his eyes fixed on a large goblet which stood before him . 
It was not quite evident to Albert whether he had been sitting up all night over his glass , or whether he was taking a draught at this early hour of the morning to recruit his strength and spirits . 
He saluted the young man as he approached the table by a slight inclination of the head , whilst a scarcely visible smile played about his mouth . 
He pointed to a goblet on the table and a stool by his side . 
Bertha understanding the hint , filled it with wine , and presented it to her lover , with that grace which marked every thing she did . 
Albert seated himself beside the old man , and drank . 
The latter drew his chair near to him , and said in a low tone of voice , `` I fear our affairs are in a bad way ! '' 
`` Have you had any intelligence ? '' 
asked Albert , in the same low tone . 
`` A peasant told me this morning , that TÃ¼bingen had treated with the League last evening . '' 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
said Albert , involuntarily . 
`` Keep quiet , and do not wake him ! 
he will learn it soon enough , '' replied the old man , pointing to the other side of the room . 
The young man looked that way . 
At one of the side windows , looking towards the deep ravine , sat the exile asleep ; his arm , resting on the ledge of the window , supported his careworn brow . 
His grey cloak had partly fallen off his shoulder , and discovered a worn-out leather jerkin , in which his powerful frame was encased . 
His curly hair hung down over his temples in disorder , and a few tufts of his smooth beard were visible from under his hand . 
The large dog lay at his feet , his head resting on his master 's foot , looking up at him with faithful eyes and watching every motion of his features . 
`` He sleeps , '' said the old man , and repressed a starting tear . 
`` He breathes light ; oh ! 
that his dreams may be comforting . 
The reality of life to him is melancholy indeed ! 
Who can help wishing he may remain unconscious of it awhile ? '' 
`` His is a hard fate ! '' 
replied Albert , casting his eye at the sleeping man . 
`` Driven from house and home -- an outcast -- a price offered to any villain who chooses to level his gun at him -- under the earth by day , and by night wandering about like a thief ! 
Truly , it is hard ; and all this because he is faithful to his lord ! '' 
`` That man has suffered much in his lifetime , '' said Lichtenstein , with a serious look . 
`` I have known him from the days of his childhood , and I can vouch for his having always wished to do what is right and just . 
The means indeed he applied to attain his object were at times not fitted to further his purpose ; on other occasions his intentions were misunderstood , and he too often allowed himself to be carried away by the violence of passion -- but where lives the man of which this might not be said ? 
Truly , he has wofully repented himself . '' 
He stopt short , fearing he had said more than he ought before Albert , who asked in vain to hear something further of his character . 
The old man sank into silence and deep thought . 
The sun having risen over the mountains and dispersed the mist which hung about the vallies , invited Albert to the window to enjoy the splendid view . 
A lovely valley , surrounded by wooded heights , with three smiling villages scattered over its surface , and a rapid stream running through it , lay at the foot of the rock of Lichtenstein . 
It was like beholding the earth from a point in the heavens . 
Leaving the valley and looking to the wooded heights , his eye rested with delight upon picturesque groups of rocks and the mountain of the Alb , behind which rises the castle of Achalm , and forms the boundary of the immediate surrounding country . 
Beyond the walls of Achalm , the distant hills were visible to the right and left . 
The rock of Lichtenstein , reaching , as it were , into the clouds , commands an extensive view of WÃ¼rtemberg , free and unbroken , into the far lowland . 
The morning sun throwing its oblique rays across the landscape , Albert was transported with the beauty of its scenery . 
The fertile fields spread before him , surrounded by the wooded hills , he compared to variegated carpets , edged , as it were , with borders of dark green and brown , deriving their different shades and colours from the tints thrown over them by the dawning day . 
And then turning to the country between Lichtenstein and the distant Asperg , he exclaimed , `` What charms for the lover of the picturesque ! 
No continuous uninterrupted plain to weary the beholder , the eye ranges from hill to mountain in pleasing variety , and rests on the luxuriant valley , with its meandering stream gently rippling along in its course . '' 
Albert stood wrapt in delight . 
He strained his eyes more and more to see and distinguish each castle and village in the far distance . 
Bertha stood beside him , and though she had enjoyed the same view from her childhood , she now shared his pleasure ; she pointed out every place , and named all the different towers to him . 
`` Where is there another spot in all Germany which can be compared to this ! '' 
said Albert ; `` I have seen vast plains , and mounted heights which command perhaps a more extended view , but such a rich combination of the picturesque and the sublime it would be difficult to find elsewhere . 
Look at the rich corn fields , the woods of fruit trees , and a little lower down there , where the hill assumes a blueish tinge , that garden of vines ! 
I have never yet envied a prince ; but to stand here , and look over those hills , and say this is mine , would be the height of my ambition ! '' 
A deep sigh close to them , started the young couple from their observations . 
They turned round , and perceived the exile standing at the window a few paces from them . 
He appeared to view the country with a wild look , which made Albert uncertain whether the conversation he had just had with Bertha , or the thought of his own forlorn state , had troubled his mind . 
He saluted the young man , and offered him his hand , and turning to the lord of the castle , asked him , `` If a messenger had arrived ? '' 
`` Schweinsberg is not yet returned , '' he answered . 
The exile retired again to the window in silence . 
Bertha filled him a goblet of wine . 
`` Be of good courage , '' she said , `` and do n't look in so disconsolate a manner over the country . 
Drink this wine , it is good old WÃ¼rtemberger , and grows under that blue mountain . '' 
`` We can not remain long melancholy , '' he answered , and turned to Albert with a forced smile , `` when the sun shines so cheerfully over WÃ¼rtemberg , and Heaven 's mildness beams in the eye of one of her fairest maidens ? 
Is it not so , young man ? 
what is the sight of these hills and vallies , compared to the gleam of such eyes and the fidelity of true hearts ? 
take your glass , and let us drink to them ! 
Nothing is irrevocably lost so long as we possess such treasures : here 's to ` Good WÃ¼rtemberg for ever ! ' '' 
`` Good WÃ¼rtemberg for ever , '' replied Albert , and touched glasses . 
The exile was going to say something more , when the old watchman entered with a face full of importance . 
`` There are two pedlars before the castle , and demand admittance , '' he announced . 
`` It 's them ! 
it 's them ! '' 
cried the exile and old Lichtenstein in the same breath , and added , `` shew them up . '' 
The servant withdrew . 
An anxious moment followed the announcement . 
No one said a word . 
The knight of Lichtenstein looked as if he could pierce the door with the eye of impatience . 
The exile endeavoured to conceal his anxiety , but the rapid changes on his expressive features indicated clearly that his whole being was in a state of excitement . 
At length footsteps were heard on the stairs approaching the apartment . 
The exile , strong as he was , trembled so much that he was obliged to hold by the table , his body was bent forward , his eye was fixed on the door , as if he would read his fate on the countenance of the messengers -- the door opened and they entered . 
Deserted as thou art , by all forsaken , Thy fortunes ruin 'd and thy power gone , Thou still shalt find fidelity unshaken , Although you find it in myself alone . 
Thy humble vassal , 'till the hour of death , I 'll hail my sovereign with my latest breath . 
L. UHLAND . 
Albert 's expectation was also raised to the highest pitch . 
His eye examined the two men as they entered , and he at once recognised the fifer of Hardt as one , and the pedlar he had met at the Golden Stag of Pfullingen as the other . 
The latter disburthened himself of a pack which he carried on his back , tore a plaister from his eye , erected himself from a bent position , which he had assumed for the purpose of disguise , and stood before the assembled group , the short-set , strong-built man , with open bold features , which the exile had already described in the cavern . 
`` Maxx Stumpf ! '' 
cried the exile in a trembling tone of voice , `` what means that gloomy countenance ? 
You bring us good news , do n't you ? 
they will open the gates to us , and with us hold out to the last man ? '' 
Maxx Stumpf von Schweinsberg looked about him in confusion . 
`` Prepare for the worst , sir ! '' 
he said , `` the intelligence I bring you is not good . '' 
`` How ? '' 
answered the other , whilst the blush of rage flew into his cheeks , and the veins of his forehead began to swell , `` how , do you mean they hesitate , they waver ? 
It is impossible ! 
be not precipitate in what you say , recollect it is of the nobles of the land of whom you speak . '' 
`` And still I will say it , '' Schweinsberg answered , making a step forward . 
`` In the face of the Emperor and the Empire , I will say they are traitors . '' 
`` Thou liest ! '' 
cried the exile with a terrible voice . 
`` Traitors , did you say ? 
Thou liest ! 
Dost thou dare to rob forty knights of their honour ? 
Ha ! 
own it , that you lie . '' 
`` Would to God I were a knight without honour -- a dog that betrays his master ! 
But the whole forty have broken their oaths -- you have lost your country . 
My Lord Duke , TÃ¼bingen is gone ! '' 
The man , whom these words more immediately concerned , sank in a chair at the window : he covered his face with his hands , his agitated breast appeared to seek in vain for breath , his whole frame trembled . 
The eyes of all were directed to him , expressive of commiseration and pain , particularly Albert 's , who now for the first time learnt the name of `` the man '' -- it was him , Duke Ulerich of WÃ¼rtemberg ! 
Recollections of the first moment he had met him , of his first visit to the cavern , of the conversation they had had , and the way which his whole bearing had surprised him and bound him to his cause , crossed his mind in one rapid flight . 
It was quite incomprehensible to him , that he had not long ago made the discovery . 
No one dared to break the silence for some time . 
The heavy breathing of the Duke only was heard , and his faithful dog , who appeared to partake of his master 's misery , added his pitiable whining to the distressing scene . 
Old Lichtenstein at length giving a sign to the knight of Schweinsberg , they both approached the Duke , and touched his cloak , in order to rouse him , but he remained immoveable and silent . 
Bertha had stood aloof , with tears in her eyes . 
She now drew near with hesitating step , put her hand on his shoulder , and , beholding him with a look of tender compassion , at last took courage to say , `` My Lord Duke ! 
it is still good WÃ¼rtemberg for ever ! '' 
A deep sigh escaping from his breast , was the only notice he took of the kind girl 's solicitude . 
Albert then approached him . 
The expression which the exile had made use of , when they first met , flashed across his mind , and he ventured to address the same words now to his afflicted friend . 
`` Man without a name , '' said he , `` why so downhearted ? 
Si fractus illabatur orbis , impavidum ferient ruinÃ¦ ! '' 
These words acted like a charm upon Ulerich . 
Whether he had adopted them as his motto , or whether it was that combination of greatness of soul , and obstinate contempt of misfortune , which formed his character , and acquired for him the name of the `` Undaunted , '' he was reanimated , as if by an electric spark , when he heard them repeated , and from that moment rose worthy of his name . 
`` Those are the true words , my young friend , '' he said at length with a firm voice , proudly raising his head , his eyes sparkling with their usual animation , `` those are the words . 
I thank you for bringing them to my mind . 
Stand forward , Maxx Stumpf , knight of Schweinsberg , relate the result of your mission . 
But first of all , give me another glass , Bertha ! '' 
`` It was last Thursday , when I left you , '' began the knight : `` Hans disguised me in this garb , and instructed me how to comport myself . 
I went to the Golden Stag at Pfullingen , just to try if any one would recognise me in it , but the hostess brought me a can of wine with all the indifference she would have done to a perfect stranger she had never seen before . 
And a city counsellor , with whom I had exchanged angry words not a week before in the same room , drank with me , supposing I had followed the vocation of pedlar from my childhood . 
That young man , '' pointing to Albert , `` was also in the room . '' 
The Duke appeared to recover his spirits , and was more cheerful . 
He asked Albert whether he had noticed the knight in his garb of pedlar , and whether he looked the character ? 
He replied , smiling , `` I think he played his part to perfection . '' 
`` From Pfullingen I went the same evening to Reutlingen . 
I entered the public room of an inn , where I met a tribe of Leaguists , consisting of citizens , from all parts , who were exulting with the Reutlingeners , for having torn down the stag horns , the emblems of your house , from their city gates . 
Though they abused you and sang burlesque songs at your expense , still they appeared to fear your name . 
On Good Friday I proceeded towards TÃ¼bingen . 
My heart beat high when I descended through the wood near the castle , and saw the beautiful valley of the Neckar before me , with the fortified towers and steeples of that place peering above the hill . '' 
The Duke compressed his lips , turned away , and looked at the distant country . 
Schweinsberg paused , sympathising in his master 's pain , who beckoned to him , however , to proceed . 
`` Descending into the plain , I wandered onward towards TÃ¼bingen . 
The town had been already occupied by the League some days , the castle still held out , and only a few troops remained in the camp , which was pitched on the hill overlooking the valley of Ammer . 
I determined to slip into the town , for the purpose of finding out how affairs stood in the castle . 
You know the little inn in the upper town , not far from the church of St. George ? 
I went there , and called for wine . 
On my way I learned that the knights of the League often assembled in the same house , and therefore I considered it the best place to attain my object . '' 
`` You risked a good deal , '' interrupted the knight of Lichtenstein : `` it was very possible some one might have wished to buy some of your wares , and then the pedlar in disguise would have been discovered . '' 
`` You forget it was a holiday , '' replied the other , `` so that I had a good excuse not to open my pack , and recommend my goods for sale , according to the custom of pedlars . 
But I had sufficient proof of the security of my disguise , for I sold a box of healing plaster to George von Fronsberg , God knows , I would gladly have come to blows with him , and given him an opportunity on the spot to make use of it . 
They were still at high mass in the church , and no one in the inn ; but I learned from the master of the house , that the knights in the castle had agreed to a truce till Easter Monday . 
When church service was over , many knights and other men came , as I expected , into the room where I was , for their morning 's potation . 
I seated myself in a corner on the bench near the stove , the proper place for people of my condition in the presence of their superiors . '' 
`` Who did you see there ? '' 
inquired the Duke . 
`` I knew some of them by sight , and guessed who others were from their conversation . 
There was Fronsberg , Alban von Closen , the Huttens , Sickingen , and many others . 
Truchses von Waldburg came in shortly after . 
When I saw him enter , I drew my cap deep over my face , for he can not have forgotten the whirl I gave him from his horse some fifteen years ago by a thrust of my lance . '' 
`` Did you see Hans von Breitenstein among the rest ? '' 
asked Albert . 
`` Breitenstein ? 
-- not that I know ; ah ! 
yes , that 's his name who will eat a leg of mutton at a sitting . 
Well , they began to talk of the siege and the truce , and some of them whispered to each other , but as I have very good ears , I heard just what of all things was most essential to know . 
Truchses related that he shot an arrow into the castle , with a note attached to it , addressed to Ludwig von Stadion . 
It appears that he must often have practised the same device , for the knights were not astonished , when he added , that he had received an answer the same day by similar means . '' 
The Duke 's countenance became clouded . 
`` Ludwig von Stadion ! '' 
he cried in agony ; `` I would have staked castles upon his fidelity ! 
I loved him so , that I satisfied all his desires , and he is the first to betray me ! '' 
`` The answer said , that he , Stadion , with many others , being tired of the contest , were more than half inclined to surrender ; George von Hewen , however , threatened to denounce them as traitors . '' 
`` I have not merited such friendship from Hewen , '' said Ulerich . 
`` I was once offended with him , for having complained that I had not acted according to his wishes . 
But how easily are we deceived in the characters of men ! 
Had any one asked me which of these two I had most faith in , I would have named Stadion as my trusty friend , and George von Hewen the doubtful one . '' 
Schweinsberg continued . 
`` The answer also said , that your Grace would probably attempt to relieve the castle ; but if that were impossible , you would repair to it in person by some secret way . 
The Leaguists spoke much upon that subject . 
They all , however , agreed that it was essential to bring the garrison to terms without delay , before you brought relief , or got into the castle ; for if you succeeded in the latter case , they feared the siege might last much longer . 
After hearing all this , I did not think it advisable to proceed immediately to the castle by the secret path , known only to a few , and shew myself to the garrison , because if Stadion had already gained the upper hand , I should have been lost . 
I resolved , therefore , to remain the day in the town ; and if before Saturday morning I heard nothing to alarm me respecting the spirit of the garrison , then to proceed to my destination , and send your Grace immediate intelligence . 
I wandered about the town and the camp unmolested until noon , seeking as much as possible always to be near some of the superior officers to assure myself of my disguise . '' 
`` That was on the Friday , the holiday ? '' 
Lichtenstein asked . 
`` Yes ; on holy Friday . 
At three o'clock in the afternoon , George von Fronsberg , with many other of the principal officers , rode to the city gate of the castle ; and hailed the besieged , inquiring whether they were building a fortification . 
I was standing among them ; and saw Stadion come on the wall , and answer , ` No , that were against the terms of the truce ; but I see , ' he added , ` you are erecting a fort in the field . ' 
George von Fronsberg cried , ` If it is so , it is without my orders . 
Who are you ? ' 
He in the castle answered , ' I am Ludwig von Stadion ; ' upon which the Leaguists smiled , and stroked their beards . 
Having satisfied the besieged , by overturning a few baskets filled with earth , which had been placed in the entrenchments to screen their works , that he had no knowledge of its having been done , Fronsberg then called to Stadion , and invited him , with other of his party , to come down and drink together . '' 
`` Did they go ? '' 
cried the Duke , impatiently , `` and forget their honour ? '' 
`` There is an open space on the castle hill beyond the ditch , whence the spectator , having a distant view of the country , can survey the valley of the Neckar , the Steinlach on the height above , the Alb in the distance , with many castles and villages , which complete the scenery . 
On this spot they placed a table and benches ; and the commanders of the League sat down to drink . 
The gate of Upper TÃ¼bingen was then opened , the bridge fell over the ditch ; when Ludwig von Stadion , with six others , came forth , bringing with them your Grace 's silver covered jugs , golden goblets , and best wine ; and having saluted your enemies with a shake of the hand , seated themselves to talk over the state of affairs over a cool tankard . '' 
`` May the devil bless them all ! '' 
interrupted the old knight of Lichtenstein , and threw his wine away ; but the Duke smiled , and nodded to Maxx Stumpf to proceed . 
`` They caroused together till after dusk ; and staggered about with heated heads . 
I kept near them , so that not one of their traitorous words escaped my ears . 
When they broke up , Trachses took Stadion by the band , ` Brother , ' said he , ` you have good wine in your cellar ; let us in soon , that we may help you to drink it out . ' 
The other laughed , shook him by the hand , and said , ` Time will teach us what to do . ' 
When I saw how affairs stood , I determined , with God 's help , at the risk of my life , to get into the castle : I therefore left them , and went to the spot where the secret subterranean way commences . 
Having succeeded in entering it unnoticed , and reached the middle , I found the portcullis down , with a sentry placed there . 
He levelled his gun at me , when he heard me coming in the dark , and demanded the parole . 
I gave , as you desired me , ` Atempto , ' the watch-word of your brave ancestor , Eberhard with the beard . 
The fellow opened his eyes wide , drew up the portcullis , and let me pass . 
With rapid steps I reached a vault , where I was obliged to remain a few moments to take a breath of fresh air , for the narrow passage is close and damp . '' 
`` Faithful Maxx ! 
clear your throat with a draught of wine , '' said Ulerich ; the knight followed his advice , and continued his story with renewed vigour . 
`` I heard the sound of many voices in the vault , apparently in contention , and following its direction , I saw a number of the garrison sitting round a large cask drinking . 
There were some of Stadion 's party , with Hewen , and many of his friends . 
The light of a lamp illumined their position , and the large goblets which were placed before them . 
It was an imposing scene , and put me in mind of a sitting of the secret tribunal . 
Having concealed myself behind a cask , I listened to their conversation . 
George von Hewen spoke stirring words , and represented to them the crime of their infidelity ; he said there was no reason why they should surrender ; that they were well provided with provisions for a long siege ; that your Grace was assembling an army for their relief ; and that the besiegers were worse off than themselves . '' 
`` Ha ! 
brave Hewen ! 
and what gave they for answer ? '' 
said the Duke . 
`` They only laughed and drank . 
` It will be long before he can get an army together . 
Where will he find money , unless he plunders ? ' 
said one of the party . 
Hewen continued : ` But if the Duke can not succeed so soon as he expected , we are nevertheless bound by our oath to hold to the last , or else be held as traitors to our lord and master . ' 
They laughed and drank again , saying , ` Who dares come forward and call us traitors ? ' 
I then called out from behind my cask , ' I will ! 
You are traitors -- false to your oaths , to the Duke , and your country ! ' 
They were terrified and thunder-struck ; Stadion let fall his goblet ; when , stepping forward , having first taken off my disguise , I stood before them , and drew your letter from under my jerkin : here is a writing from your Duke , said I ; he commands you at your peril to surrender ; he is coming himself to conquer or die under the walls . '' 
`` Oh , TÃ¼bingen ! '' 
said the Duke , with a sigh , `` fool that I was to leave you in such hands . 
I would give two of my left fingers for your sake ! 
what did I say , two fingers ? 
I would willingly lose my right hand could I purchase you with the sacrifice , and with my left lead the way to the heart of my enemies . 
And what was the answer to my words -- did they not give any ? '' 
`` The false ones eyed me with sullen looks , and appeared not to know what to do . 
Hewen , however , repeated his warning to them . 
Stadion at last said , You come too late . 
Twenty-eight knights have determined to withdraw from the contest , and leave the Duke to settle his affairs alone with the League . 
If he returns to the country with an army they will faithfully stand by him , but they can not continue to carry on the war any longer in a state of uncertainty as to the result , seeing that their opposition to the League has only subjected their houses and estates to damage and heavy contributions . 
I then requested to be led to the hall of the knights , where I would try to discover whether there were not still left honourable men sufficient to defend the castle . 
I reckoned upon the fidelity of the two Berlichingens , and many others , whose names are familiar to your Grace , as having sworn allegiance to your colours . 
But Hewen shook his head , and said I was mistaken in most of them . '' 
`` But Stammheim , Thierberg , Westerstetten , in whose faith I would have staked my existence -- did you see them ? '' 
asked the Duke . 
`` Oh , yes ! 
they were in the cellar with Stadion , and assisted to drink your wine . 
They would not allow me to go up into the castle . 
Even Hewen , with Freiberg and Heideck , who were with him , dissuaded me from it , because , they said , the two parties were already much inflamed against each other , Stadion having the majority of knights , and of the soldiers also , on his side . 
` If I went up , ' they added , ` and it should come to blows in the court of the castle , and in the hall of the knights , there would be nothing left for them , as the weakest party , than to fight for life and death . 
Willingly as they would shed their last drop of blood for you , they would rather fall before the enemy in the field of battle than be cut to pieces by their own countrymen and brothers in arms . 
Being foiled in every thing , I asked them , as a last petition , to protect your son , the young Prince Christoph , and your darling daughter , and preserve the castle to them , when they surrendered . 
Some of them consented , others remained silent , and shrugged up their shoulders . 
Exasperated , I denounced them as traitors , and giving them my curses as a Christian knight , challenged any five of them to fight with me for life and death when the war should be ended . 
Upon which I left them , and returned the same way out of the castle that I entered it . '' 
`` WÃ¼rtemberg 's honour is gone ! 
could I have thought it possible ! '' 
cried Lichtenstein . 
`` Forty-two knights , two hundred soldiers , thus to betray a fortified castle ! 
Our good name is defamed , -- futurity will brand with scorn our nobility , who deserted their Duke 's banners . 
The saying ` faithful and honourable as a WÃ¼rtemberger ' is become a term of reproach . '' 
`` We could , indeed , once boast of the truth of the saying , ` faithful as a WÃ¼rtemberger , ' '' said Duke Ulerich , whilst a tear fell on his beard . 
`` When my ancestor Eberhard once upon a time rode towards Worms , and sat at table with the electors , counts and lords , each prided himself upon the pre-eminence of his own country . 
One boasted of his wine , -- another spoke of his fruits , -- a third of his game , -- whilst a fourth talked of the metals which his mountains produced , -- but , when it came to Eberhard with the Beard to speak , he said , ' I know nothing of your treasures , but this I know , that if I seek shelter in a humble peasant 's cot , in the most secluded spot , tired and oppressed with fatigue , I am sure to find a faithful WÃ¼rtemberger at hand , upon whose lap I can lay my head in safety and sleep in peace . ' 
They all wondered in astonishment , and said , ` Count Eberhard is right , and long live the faithful WÃ¼rtemberger ! ' 
But in these times behold , when the Duke traverses a wood , they lie in wait to kill him ; and , if he places his faith in his nobles for the defence of his castles , scarcely does he turn his back but they treat with the enemy . 
May the cuckoo take such faith ! 
But go on , Maxx , I am the man to drink the dregs of the cup without the fear of seeing the bottom of it . '' 
`` Well , it 's soon said . 
I remained in TÃ¼bingen until I had convinced myself of its surrender . 
Yesterday , being Easter Monday , they came to terms ; they drew up the articles in writing , and proclaimed throughout the streets by a herald , that , at five o'clock in the evening , the garrison would march out . 
Prince Christoph , your young son , retains the castle and administration of TÃ¼bingen , but in the service and under the guardianship of the League ; and as for the rest of the country , it is said , that it will be divided among the knights . 
I have experienced many misfortunes in life , -- I killed a friend at a tilting bout , -- I have lost a dear child , and had my house burnt , -- but , as true as God and his saints are gracious to me , I never felt so much pain as at that moment when I saw the banner of the League hoisted in lieu of your Grace 's , and their red cross cover WÃ¼rtemberg 's stag horns , and bugle . '' 
So spake Maxx Stumpf von Schweinsberg . 
The sun had risen , during his narration , high above the mountains , having dispelled the mists , leaving only a slight vapour on the heights of the Asperg . 
It hung upon the horizon like a thin veil , and heightened the beauty of the scenery in its immediate neighbourhood . 
Drest in the soft verdure of spring , combined with the darker foliage of the woods , ornamented with cheerful villages and stately castles , WÃ¼rtemberg lay spread before the eye of the beholder , in all the glory of the opening day . 
The unhappy Prince surveyed the scene with dejected looks . 
Nature had blessed him with a constancy of courage , and a heart which even grief and misery were unable to subdue ; he possessed such control over his feelings that few were able to discern his inward suffering ; and when calamity overtook him , then it was that the energies of his vigorous mind were most fertile in resources , and prompted him to immediate action . 
In this truly heart-rending moment , when his last hope fell with the loss of his sole remaining castle , he concealed from his friends around him the painful conflict with which he was struggling . 
His feeling might be compared to the repentant son standing by the death-bed of a beloved mother , whose solicitude and anxiety for his welfare through life he had slighted , whose tender care of him in infancy he had forgotten , and the sacrifices she had imposed on herself to satisfy all his selfish wishes , even to the straitening of her own circumstances to meet the demands of his riotous living , he had treated with ingratitude , deeming them nothing more than his due . 
But now that her endearing eye no longer beholds him , -- now that the ear is closed which was wont to listen to his wishes and complaints , -- now that those hands no longer feel his last pressure , -- then it is that repentance assails his heart , -- then it is that his guilty conscience upbraids him with the bitter reproach of ingratitude and neglect of God 's commandment , -- to love , honour , and cherish father and mother . 
Such was the anguish of self-condemnation which at this moment oppressed the breast of Ulerich of WÃ¼rtemberg as he viewed his country , now to all appearance lost to him for ever . 
His noble nature , which he had too often abused in the blandishments of a brilliant court , and whose finer feelings had been deadened by the poisonous flattery of false friends , now upbraided him ; not so much for being the author of his own personal misfortunes as for entailing on his country the distress attendant upon the occupation of it by his enemies . 
Having stood for some time at the window , his mind harassed with these thoughts , he turned to his friends , who noticed in pleasing astonishment the calm expression of his countenance . 
They had dreaded his first burst of rage and violence , which they expected he would vent upon the treacherous conduct of his nobility . 
Instead of which , though he could not conceal the intensity of suffering he was struggling with , he was composed and resigned , and his features exhibited a mildness and resignation which they had scarcely ever seen before .
