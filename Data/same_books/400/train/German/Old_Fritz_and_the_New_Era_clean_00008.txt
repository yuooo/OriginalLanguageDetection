She looked up to him with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes , smiling . 
By this she would express her thanks for the princely gift to her husband , and swear to the General her delight , her fidelity , and love . 
He regarded her as coldly and calmly as a physician a patient . 
`` Yes , holy father , I have heard all , '' she said , with a sweet , flute-like voice . 
`` My heart is filled with gratitude and emotion . '' 
`` Prove it by assisting your husband to attain the goal for which we send him forth . 
I have already said that vice must serve virtue , Lorenza . 
Beauty is a power , and if it serves holy purposes , so is it sanctified . 
Employ your beauty to win adherents to the order , and extend the power of the Rosicrucians in every land , and among all nations . '' 
`` I swear that this shall be my holiest endeavor , '' cried Lorenza , rising . 
The General pressed her back upon the pillow , saying : `` Remain , for there is no one here for you to enchant . 
I bring you pardon for your sins , and an indulgence for every sin which you will commit , if you swear to serve faithfully the holy Church and the pious fathers of Jesus . '' 
`` I swear , '' solemnly cried Lorenza . 
`` Here is the letter of indulgence from Pius VI . 
himself , made out in your name for you . 
Take it , and perform your duty . '' 
He laid down the parchment provided with the papal seal upon her shoulder , and drawing the veil over her made the sign of the cross , saying , `` I bless you , and give you absolution for your sins . '' 
`` Bless me also , lord and master , '' cried Cagliostro , kneeling upon the lowest step to the throne . 
`` I bless you in the name of Loyola . 
Remain upon your knees , and follow me not . '' 
He extended his hands over him , and blessed him , then slowly withdrew . 
The first beams of the morning sun shone through the great window-panes , lighting up with its golden rays Cagliostro 's kneeling form . 
He remained with his head bowed until the General had passed out . 
`` He is gone ; Heaven be praised , he is gone ! '' 
`` Yes , he is gone , '' repeated Lorenza , springing from the couch . 
`` Is it true , has he given you half a million ? '' 
Cagliostro held up with triumphant air the letters . 
`` See , these addresses are upon the first banking-houses in Rome , Paris , London , and Berlin ! '' 
`` Do you believe that they are genuine ? '' 
`` I am convinced of it . '' 
`` Then we have attained our aim ; we are rich and powerful . '' 
`` No , '' answered Cagliostro , mournfully , `` we are poorer than ever . 
This money makes us slaves , makes us dependent tools . 
Did you not hear him say , ` You are admitted into the Temple , but the avenging sword of the order everywhere hangs over you . ' '' 
`` Wife , '' cried the General von Werrig , limping around the room , leaning upon his crutch , `` here is the answer from our most gracious lord and king . 
The courier arrived to-day from the war department , and sent it to me by an express . '' 
`` What is the king 's answer ? '' 
asked the general 's wife , a pale , gaunt woman , with a pock-marked face , harsh , severe features , dull gray eyes , which never beamed with emotion , and thin , bloodless lips , upon which a smile never played . 
`` What is the king 's answer ? '' 
she repeated , in a rough voice , as her husband , puffing and blowing from the effort of walking , sank down upon a chair , and dried his fat , ruby face with a red cotton pocket-handkerchief . 
`` I have not read it , '' panted the old man . 
`` I thought I would leave the honor to you , as you , my very learned wife , wrote the letter to his majesty . '' 
His wife was not in the least astonished at this thoughtful conduct of her husband . 
She impetuously seized the sealed document , and , retiring to the window-niche , slowly unfolded it , whilst the old general fixed his little gray eyes upon her emotionless face . 
His own was bloated and red , expressing the greatest anxiety and expectation . 
Perfect stillness reigned for some minutes , only the regular strokes of the pendulum were heard from the clock on the wall ; and , as the hands pointed to the expiration of the hour , a cuckoo sprang out of the tree painted over the dial , and eleven times her hoarse , croaking voice was heard . 
`` It gets every day more out of tune , '' growled the general , as he looked up to the old , yellow dial , and ran his eye over the cords which supported the weights . 
Then glancing around the room , he saw everywhere age , decay , and indigence . 
There was an old divan , with a patched , faded covering of silk , and a grandfather 's arm-chair near it , the cushion of which the general knew , by the long years of experience , to be hard as a stone . 
A round table stood near the divan , covered with a shabby woollen cover , to hide the much-thumbed , dull polish . 
A few cane-chairs against the wall , an old black-oak wardrobe near the door , and the sewing-table of Madame von Werrig in the window-niche , completed the furniture of the room . 
At the window hung faded woollen curtains , and on the green painted walls some pictures and portraits , conspicuous among them a beautiful portrait of the king , painted on copper , which represented Frederick in his youthful beauty . 
It was a morose , sullen-looking room , arranged most certainly by its feminine occupant , and harmonized exactly with her fretful face and angular figure , void of charms . 
At last the general broke the silence with submissive voice : `` I pray you , Clotilda , tell me what the king wrote . '' 
She folded the paper , joy beaming in her eyes . 
`` Granted ! 
every thing granted ! '' 
The general jumped up to embrace his wife with youthful activity , in spite of the gout . 
`` You are a capital wife , '' he cried , at the same time giving her a loud , smacking kiss upon her cold , gray cheek . 
`` It was the brightest , cleverest act of my life marrying you , Clotilda . '' 
`` I might well say the reverse , Emerentius , '' she replied , complainingly . 
`` It surely was not sensible for me , a young lady from such a genteel family , and so spoiled , to marry an officer whom the king ennobled upon the battle-field , and who possessed nothing but his captain 's pay -- a fickle man , and a gambler , too . '' 
`` Yes , Clotilda , love usurped reason , '' soothingly replied the general ; `` love is your excuse . '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
cried Madame von Werrig . 
`` Love is never an excuse ; it is folly . '' 
`` Well , let us suppose , then , that you did not marry for love , only from pure reason , because you found that it was quite time to espouse some one ; and that , in spite of your many ancestors and genteel family , no other chance was offered you , unfortunately no one but this captain , whom the king ennobled upon the battle-field of Leuthen on account of his bravery , and who was a very handsome , agreeable officer , expecting still further promotion . 
And you were not deceived . 
I was major , when the Hubertsburger treaty put an end to a gay war-life . 
You will remember I was advanced during peace ; his majesty did not forget that I cut a way for him through the enemy , and he made me lieutenant-colonel and colonel , when I was obliged to resign on account of this infamous gout , and then I received the title of general . '' 
`` Without ` excellency , ' '' replied his wife , dryly . 
`` I have not even this pleasure to be called ` excellency . ' 
It would have been a slight compensation for my sad , miserable existence , and vexed many of the female friends of my youth if they had been obliged to call me ` excellency . ' 
But my marriage brought me only cares , not even a title . '' 
`` Do not forget a lovely daughter , Clotilda . 
Our Marie is beautiful , wise , and good , and through her you will yet have tranquil happiness . 
For you say the king has granted all we wish . '' 
`` Every thing ! '' 
repeated the wife , with emphasis . 
`` We have at last finished with want and care , and can count upon an independent , quiet old age , for God has been gracious , and forced you , from the gout , to give up gambling , and we are freed from the misery which has so often threatened us from your unhappy passion . '' 
`` At the beginning , I played from passion ; afterward , I only played to win back what I had lost . '' 
`` And in that manner played away all we possessed , and played upon your word of honor , so that for years the half of our pension went to pay your gambling-debts . 
Heaven be thanked , the king did not know it , or we would have experienced still worse ! '' 
`` I pray you , beloved Clotilda , do not fret yourself needlessly about the past ; it is all over , and , as you say , I am unfortunately a prisoner in the house from the gout , which shields me from the temptation . '' 
`` I did not say unfortunately ; I said ` Heaven be praised , the gout had put an end to your fickle life . ' '' 
`` Then , thank Heaven , my dear ; we will not quarrel about it . 
It is past , and , as the king has granted all , we shall have a pleasant life now . '' 
`` We will soon receive from our son-in-law a yearly pension , which will be paid to me , and I shall spend it . '' 
The general sighed . 
`` In that case I fear that I shall not get much of it . '' 
`` At any rate , more than I have ever received from your pension . '' 
`` There is but one thing wanting , '' replied the general , evasively , `` Marie 's consent . '' 
Madame von Werrig gave a short , gruff laugh , which did not in the least brighten her sullen face . 
`` We will not ask her consent , but command it . '' 
The general remarked , timidly , shrugging his shoulders , `` Marie had a very decided character , and -- '' `` What do you hesitate to speak out for ? 
What -- and -- '' `` I think she still loves the Conrector Moritz . '' 
A second laugh , somewhat menacing , sounded like a challenge . 
`` The schoolmaster ! '' 
she cried , contemptuously . 
`` Let her dare to tell me again she loves the schoolmaster ; she the daughter of a general , and a native-born countess of the empire ! '' 
`` My dear , it was your fault -- the only fault you ever committed , perhaps . 
How could you let such a young , handsome , and agreeable man come to the house as teacher to our daughter ? '' 
`` How could I suppose my daughter was so degenerated as to love a common schoolmaster , and wish to marry him ? '' 
`` It is truly unheard of , and it would make any one angry , my dear wife , for she insists upon loving him . '' 
`` She will not insist , she will do what she is commanded to do -- my word for it ! 
But why talk about it ? 
It is better to decide the matter at once . '' 
So Frau von Werrig rose with a determined manner , and rang the small brass bell which was upon the sofa-table . 
But a few seconds elapsed before a little , crooked servant appeared at the side-door , with her dirty apron put aside by tucking the corner in her belt . 
`` Go to my daughter , and tell her to come down immediately ! '' 
The servant , instead of hastening to obey the order , remained standing upon the threshold . 
`` I dare not go , '' said she , in a hoarse , croaking voice . 
`` Fraulein told me not to disturb her to-day , for she has still two bouquets of flowers to arrange , and two lessons to give , and she is so busy that she is not at home to visitors . 
She torments herself from morning till night . '' 
`` I order you to tell Fraulein to come down at once ; we have something important to tell her . 
No contradiction ! 
go , Trude ! '' 
The servant understood the cold , commanding tone of the mother , and dared not disobey . 
`` It is nothing good that they have to tell her , '' grumbled Trude , as she hurried up the stairs which led from the first story into the little , low room in the attic , under the sloping roof . 
Here and there a few tiles could be lifted , which lighted the garret sufficiently to show the door at the end . 
`` May I come in , my dear Fraulein ? 
it is Trude . '' 
`` The door is open , '' cried a sweet voice , and Trude entered . 
It is a most charming little room , just that of a young girl . 
The bed has a snow-white covering , and white curtains , suspended from a hook in the wall around it . 
The same curtains at the low gable-windows , whose depth , so to speak , made a light anteroom to the real gloomy one in the background . 
In this little anteroom the young girl had placed all that was necessary for her pleasure and use . 
There were the most beautiful , sweet-scented flowers upon the window-stool ; in a pretty metal cage was a light-colored canary . 
There were also pretty engravings , and upon the table stood a vase filled with superb artificial flowers , and before it sat the possessor of this room , the daughter of General and Frau von Werrig , surrounded with her work-tools , paper , and colored materials -- a young girl , scarcely twenty , of a proud , dignified appearance , but simply and gracefully dressed . 
According to the fashion of the day , her hair was slightly powdered , and raised high above her broad , clear brow with a blue rosette , and ends at the side . 
The nobly-formed and beautiful face was slightly flushed , and around the month was an expression of courageous energy . 
As old Trude entered , the young girl raised her eyes from the rose-bud which she was just finishing , and looked at her . 
What beautiful black eyes they were as they sparkled underneath the delicately-arched , black eyebrows ! 
`` Now , old one , '' said she , kindly , `` what do you wish ? 
Did you forget that I wanted to work undisturbed to-day ? '' 
`` Did n't forget it , my Fraulein , but -- '' `` But you have forgotten that up here , in my attic-room , I am not your Fraulein , but your Marie , whom you have taken care of and watched over when a child , and whose best and truest friend you have been . 
Come , give me your hand , and tell me what you have to say . '' 
Old Trude shuffled hurriedly along in her leather slippers . 
Her old , homely face looked almost attractive , with its expression of glowing tenderness , as she regarded the beautiful , smiling face before her , and laid her hard brown hand in the little white one extended to her . 
`` Marie , '' she said , softly and anxiously , `` you must go down at once to your mother and father . 
They have something very important to tell you . '' 
`` Something very important ! '' 
repeated Marie , laying aside her work . 
`` Do you know what it is ? '' 
`` Nothing good , I fear , '' sighed the old woman . 
`` A soldier has been here from the war department and brought a letter for the general , and he told me that it was sent from the king 's cabinet at Breslau . '' 
`` Oh , Heaven ! 
what does it mean ? '' 
cried Marie , frightened , and springing up . 
`` Something is going to happen , I know . 
I have noticed certain expressions which escaped my father ; the proud , threatening manner of my mother ; but above all the bold importunity of that man , whom I despise as one detests vice , stupidity , and ennui . 
They will not believe that I hate him , that I rather -- '' `` Marie , are you not coming ? '' 
called the mother , with a commanding voice . 
`` I must obey , '' she said , drawing a long breath , and hastening to the door , followed by Trude , who pulled her back and held her fast upon the very first step . 
`` You have forbidden me to speak of him , but I must . '' 
Marie stood as if rooted to the spot , her face flushed , and in breathless expectation looking back to old Trude . 
`` Speak , Trude , '' she softly murmured . 
`` Marie , I saw him to-day , an hour ago ! '' 
`` Where , Trude , where did you see him ? '' 
`` Over on the corner of Frederick Street , by the baker 's . 
He stood waiting for me , as he knows I always go there . 
He had been there two hours , and feared that I was not coming . '' 
`` What did he say ? 
Quick ! 
what did he say ? '' 
`` He said that he was coming to see you to-day at twelve o'clock ; that he would rather die than live in this way . '' 
`` To-day ? 
and you have just told me of it ! '' 
`` I did not mean to say any thing at all about it ; I thought it would be better , and then you would not have to dissemble . 
But now , if any harm comes to you , you know he is coming , and will stand by you ! '' 
`` He will stand by me -- yes , he will -- '' `` Marie ! '' 
cried her mother , and her dry , gaunt figure appeared at the foot of the stairs . 
Marie flew down to the sitting-room of her parents , following her mother , who took her place in the niche at the open window without speaking to her . 
`` Marie , '' said the general 's wife , after seating herself upon the hard cushion of the divan , near which sat the general in his arm-chair , busily stroking his painful right leg -- `` Marie , take a chair , and sit near us . '' 
Marie noiselessly brought a cane-chair , and seated herself by the table , opposite her parents . 
`` We have just received a communication from the king 's cabinet , '' said the mother , solemnly . 
`` It is necessary that you should know the contents , and I will read it aloud to you . 
I expressly forbid you , however , to interrupt me while I am reading , in your impetuous manner , with your remarks , which are always of the most obstinate and disagreeable kind . 
You understand , do you , Marie ? '' 
`` Perfectly , mother ; I will listen without interrupting you , according to your command . '' 
`` This communication is naturally addressed to your father , as I wrote to the king in his name . '' 
`` I did not know that you had written to his majesty at all , dear mother . '' 
The mother cast a furious glance at the gentle , decided face of her daughter . 
`` You already forget my command and your promise to listen without interrupting me . 
I did , indeed , write to his majesty , but it is not necessary to tell you what I , or rather your father , solicited , as you will hear it in the answer from our most gracious king . 
It runs thus : ` My faithful subject : I have received your petition , and I was glad to learn by this occasion that you are well , and that you now lead a steady , reasonable life . 
Formerly you gave good cause of complaint ; for it is well known to me that you led a dissolute life , and your family suffered want and misfortune from your abominable chance-games . 
You know that I have twice paid your debts ; that at the second time I gave you my royal word of assurance that I would never pay a groschen for you again . 
If you gave yourself up to the vice , and made gambling-debts , I would send you to the fortress at Spandau , and deprive you of your pension . 
Nevertheless you played again , and commenced your vicious life anew . 
Notwithstanding which , I did not send you to prison as I threatened , and as you deserved , because I remembered that you had been a brave soldier , and did me a good service at the battle of Leuthen . 
For this reason I now also grant your request , that , as you have no son , your name and coat-of-arms may descend to your son-in-law . 
The name of Werrig-Leuthen is well worthy to be preserved , and be an example to succeeding generations . 
I give my permission for Ludwig Ebenstreit , banker , to marry your daughter and only child , and -- ' '' Marie uttered a cry of horror , and sprang from her seat . 
`` Mother ! 
-- '' `` Be still ! 
I commanded you not to interrupt me , but listen , with becoming respect , to the end , to the words ' of his majesty . '' 
And , with a louder voice , occasionally casting a severe , commanding glance at her daughter , she read on : '' ` And call himself in future Ludwig Werrig von Leuthen . 
I wish that he should honor the new name , and prove himself a true nobleman . 
Ludwig Ebenstreit must give up , or sell , without delay , his banking business , as I can not permit a nobleman to continue the business of citizen , and remain a merchant . 
A nobleman must either be a soldier or a landed proprietor ; and if your future son-in-law will not be either , he can live upon his income , which must indeed be ample . 
But I command him to spend it in the country , not go to foreign countries to spend what he has gained in the country . 
If he should do it , it will not be well with him , and he shall be brought back by force . 
You may communicate this to him , and he can judge for himself . 
I will have the letters of nobility made out for him , for which he shall pay the sum of one hundred louis d'ors to the ` Invalids ' at Berlin . 
It depends upon him whether as a true nobleman he will not give my poor ` Invalids ' a greater sum . 
The marriage shall not take place until the letters of nobility have been published in the Berlin journals , for I do not wish the daughter of a general , and a countess , to marry beneath her . 
You can prepare every thing for the wedding , and let them be married as soon as publication has been made . 
I will give the bride a thousand thalers for a dowry , that she may not go to her rich husband penniless ; the money will be paid to your daughter from the government treasury at her receipt . 
As ever I remain your well-disposed king , FREDERICK . ' 
`` And here on the margin , '' continued the general 's wife , looking over to her husband with malicious pleasure , `` the king has written a few lines in his own hand : ' I have given orders that the money shall be paid to your daughter in person , with her receipt for the same , for I know you , and know that you do not play , not because you have not the money , but the gout . 
If you had the cash and not the gout , you would play your daughter 's dowry to the devil , and that I do not wish , for a noble maiden should not marry a rich husband as poor as a church mouse . 
FREDERICK . ' '' 
A profound stillness prevailed when the reading was finished . 
The general busied himself , as usual , rubbing his gouty leg with the palm of his hand . 
Marie sat with her hands pressed upon her bosom , as if she would force back the sighs and sobs which would break forth . 
Her great , black eyes were turned to her mother with an expression of painful terror , and she searched with a deathly anxiety for a trace of sympathy and mercy upon her cold , immovable face . 
Her mother slowly folded the letter , and laid it upon the table . 
`` You know all now , Marie -- that , as it becomes parents , we have disposed of your future and your hand . 
You will submit to their wishes without murmuring or opposition , as it becomes an obedient , well-brought-up daughter , and receive the husband we have chosen for you . 
He will come today to hear your consent , and you from this day forth are the betrothed of the future Herr von Werrig . 
Of course from this very hour you will cease the highly improper and ungenteel business which you have pursued . 
You must not make any more flowers , or give any more lessons . 
The time of such degradation and humiliation is past , and my daughter can no longer be a school-mistress . 
You have only to write the receipt to-day , and I will go with you to the treasury to get the money . '' 
`` I will not write the receipt , '' said Marie , gently but firmly . 
Her mother , in the act of rising , sank back upon the divan ; and the general , apparently quite occupied with his leg , stopped rubbing , and raised his red , bloated face to his daughter in astonishment . 
`` Did I understand rightly your words , that you would not write the receipt ? '' 
`` Yes , mother , I said so ; I can not and will not write it , '' replied Marie , gently . 
`` And why can not you , and will you not write it ? '' 
said her mother , scornfully . 
`` Because I have no right to the money , and can not take it , mother , as I will never be the wife of the man you intend me to marry . '' 
The general sprang with a savage curse from his arm-chair , and would have rushed to his daughter , but his wife pushed him back into his seat , and approached Marie , who rose , regarding her mother with a firm , sad expression . 
`` Why can you not be the wife of the man we have chosen for you ? 
Answer me , WHY you can not ? '' 
`` You know , mother , '' she replied , and gradually her voice assumed a more decided tone , her cheeks reddened , and an inspired expression beamed from her eyes , and pervaded her whole being -- `` you know , mother , that I can never be the wife of Herr Ebenstreit , for I do not love him . 
I despise and abominate him , because he is a man without honor ; he knows that I do not love him , and yet he insists upon marrying me . 
If it were not so , if I did not despise and abominate him , I would not receive his suit and marry him . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
cried the general , shaking his fist at his daughter . 
`` Why not ? '' 
cried the mother , with a cold , icy glance , void of pity or anger . 
Marie encountered these looks with beaming eyes . 
`` Because I am betrothed to another , '' and the words came like a cry of joy from her heart -- `` because I am engaged to my beloved Moritz ! '' 
`` Shameless , obstinate creature , have we not forbidden it ? '' 
cried her father . 
`` Stop ! '' 
interrupted his wife , with a commanding wave of her hand , which silenced the obedient husband immediately . 
`` It belongs to me to question her , for I am her mother , and my daughter owes me submission and obedience above all things . 
-- Answer me , Marie , did you not know that we had forbidden you to speak to this man , or have any communication with him ? 
Did you not know that I , your mother , had menaced you with a curse if you married this man , or even spoke to the miserable , pitiable creature ? '' 
`` Mother , '' cried Marie , vehemently , `` he is not a poor , miserable creature . 
You may hate him , but you dare not outrage the noble , the good , and just man ! '' 
`` He is a good-for-nothing fellow , '' cried her father ; `` he has tried to win a minor behind the parents ' back . 
He is a shameful , good-for-nothing seducer . '' 
`` He is dishonorable , '' cried the general 's wife -- `` a dishonorable man , who has misused our confidence . 
We confided to him our daughter to teach , and paid him for it . 
He improved the opportunity to make a declaration of love , and stole the time from us to infatuate the heart of our daughter with flattery , and from his pupil win a bride . '' 
`` Oh , unworthy , shameful slander ! '' 
cried Marie , her eyes flashing with anger . 
`` You well know that it is a vile scandal , that Moritz was no paid teacher . 
If he had been -- if he had felt obliged to yield to the sad necessity of being paid for his valuable time , because he was poor , and forced to live by his intellect , he was a free man , and had the right to love whom he chose . 
He loves me , and I have accepted his love as the most precious , most beautiful , and most glorious gift of my life . 
Ah ! 
do not look so angry with me , father ; I can not say otherwise . 
I can not crush or deny the inmost life of my life . 
-- Oh , mother , forgive me that I can not change it ! 
You know that otherwise I have been a most obedient daughter to you in all things , although you have never taught me the happiness of possessing a loving mother ; though neither of you could ever forgive your only child for not being a son , who could inherit your name , and win a brilliant position , yet I have always loved you tenderly and truly , and never complained that the unwelcome daughter received neither love nor tenderness , only indifference and coldness from her parents . '' 
`` Beautiful , very beautiful ! '' 
replied the mother , contemptuously . 
`` Now you wish to blame us that you are a heartless and thankless daughter . 
-- We have not understood her heart , and it is our fault that her love has flown somewhere else . 
`` This is the language of romance . 
I have , indeed , read it in the romances of Herr Moritz , and my daughter has only repeated what she learned as a docile pupil from her schoolmaster . 
Very fine , to pay Herr Moritz to form our daughter into the heroine of a romance ! 
She ought to have learned the languages , but has learned only the language of romances . '' 
`` You are very severe and very cruel , mother , '' said Marie , sadly . 
`` I would not complain , only excuse myself , and implore pity and indulgence , and defend myself from the reproach of having been a cold , unloving daughter . 
Oh ! 
God knows how I have longed for your love ; that I would willingly prove that I would joyfully do every thing to embellish your life and make you happy . 
It gave me such pleasure to earn something for you with my dear flowers and lessons , and afford you a little gratification ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
now , she will reproach us with having toiled for us and sacrificed herself . 
Husband , thank yourself for the victim who worked for you , who gave her youth for us that she might strew our life with roses . '' 
`` I have had enough of this talking and whining , '' cried the general , furiously beating the table with his fist . 
`` My daughter shall not be a heroine of romance , but an obedient child , who submits to the will of her parents . 
You shall marry the man that we have chosen for you ; the king has given his consent , and it shall take place . 
I command you ! 
That is sufficient ! 
I will hear no more about it ; the thing is done with . 
Herr Ebenstreit is coming this afternoon to make you a proposal of marriage with our consent , and you must , accept him . 
I command you to do it ! '' 
`` I can not obey you ! 
Oh , do not force me to rebel against God 's holy laws ! 
Have pity upon me ! 
I have obeyed you until now , and yielded to your wishes , although I thought it would break my heart sometimes . 
You have forbidden Moritz the house , and turned him out of doors like a servant , with scorn and contempt , and he has silently borne it on my account . 
You have forbidden me to write or receive letters from him , or ever to meet him . 
My mother would curse me if I disobeyed her , and I submitted . 
I have given up every thing , sacrificed every wish , and renounced my love . 
But you can not expect more from me , or dare ask it . 
I can forego happiness , but you can not ask me to consent to be buried alive ! '' 
`` And what if we should wish it ? '' 
asked her mother . 
`` If we should demand our daughter to give up a romantic , foolish love , to become the wife of a young man who loves her , and who loves us , and who is rich enough to assure us a comfortable old age , free from care ? '' 
`` Marie , '' cried the general , in a begging and almost imploring tone , `` Marie , prove to us now that you are really a good and grateful child -- we have had so much care and want in our life , so many sorrowful days ! 
It lies in your hands to make our declining days joyous and bright , and free us from want . 
We have often grumbled against God , that He did not give us a son ; now make us to rejoice that He has given us a daughter , who will bring us a son and inherit our name through her children , and who will give us what we have never known -- prosperity and riches . 
I beg you , my dear , good child , grant your parents the few last years of their life freedom from care ! '' 
`` And I , Marie , '' said her mother , in a softened and tender tone , which Marie had never heard from her -- `` I beg you also , be a good daughter , pity your mother ! 
I have always led a joyless , unhappy life . 
I lived unmarried , a native-born countess , with proud relations , who made me feel bitterly my dependence ; when married my existence was only trouble , privations , care , and sorrow . 
I beg you , Marie , teach me to know happiness , for which I have so longed in vain ; give me independence and prosperity , which I have always desired , and never known . 
I pray , Marie , make us happy in bringing us a rich , genteel , and good son-in-law , Herr Ebenstreit . '' 
Marie , who met the scorn and threats of her mother with firmness and a proud demeanor , trembled as she heard these severe and merciless lips , always so cold and harsh , now begging and imploring . 
At first she was quite frightened , and then terrified , and covered her face with her hands , her head sinking upon her breast as her mother spoke . 
`` Speak , my daughter , '' cried the general , as his wife was silent . 
`` Speak , my dear Marie . 
Say the word , and we shall be all happy , and there will be no happier family found in Berlin , or the world even . 
Say that you will marry Ebenstreit , and we will love and bless you so long as we live . 
Do say yes , dear Marie ! '' 
Her hands fell from her face , and stretching them out toward her parents , she looked at them in despair . 
There was a fearful pause . 
`` I can not , it is impossible ! '' 
she shrieked . 
`` I can not marry this man , for I do not love him . 
I love another , whom I can never forget , whom I shall love forever . 
I love -- '' `` Herr Conrector Moritz ! '' 
announced Trude , hastily bursting open the door , and looking in with a triumphant smile . 
`` Herr Conrector Moritz wishes to pay his respects , '' called out Trude again . 
`` We do not wish to receive him , '' cried Frau von Werrig . 
`` He dare not presume to enter ! '' 
shrieked the general . 
Marie cried , `` Moritz ! 
Oh ! 
my beloved Moritz , '' rushing with outstretched arms toward her lover , who just appeared at the door . 
`` God has sent you to sustain me in this fearful hour . '' 
Old Trude peeped through the half-closed door , well satisfied to see her dear young lady folded in Moritz 's arms , and her head leaning upon his shoulder . 
`` Yes , '' she murmured , closing softly the door , `` Marie is right , God himself sent her lover in this hour , and I would not let her wicked , hard-hearted parents send him away . '' 
Quick as thought she turned the key , fastening the door , and betook herself to the farthest room , carefully closing every door between them . 
`` Now we will see for once whether they will show him the door , and pitch him out . 
No , they will be obliged to listen to him . 
Old Trude wishes it , for it will make her dear Marie happy . 
It is all the same to me if the old German tries to scratch my eyes out for it ; I will take good care to keep out of his way . 
I must go and listen once . '' 
She put her ear to the keyhole , and then her eye , to see how the quarrellers looked . 
At first the general and his wife were quite alarmed , and almost speechless as they witnessed the joyful meeting of the lovers . 
The father sprang up suddenly , with clinched fist , but instead of bitter invectives only a fearful shriek of pain was heard , as he sank groaning and whimpering into his armchair . 
The gout had again seized its victim . 
Anger had excited the general 's blood , and had also brought on the pain in his leg again . 
His wife took no notice of his cries and groans , for it was quite as agreeable to her to be the only speaker , and have her moaning husband a kind of assenting chorus . 
`` Leave each other ! '' 
she commanded , as she approached the lovers , flourishing her long shrivelled arms about . 
`` Leave each other , and leave my house ! '' 
Laying her hand on Marie 's arm , which was thrown around her lover 's neck , she endeavored to tear her away , and draw her daughter toward herself . 
But Marie clung only the more firmly , and Moritz pressed her more fervently to his heart . 
They heeded not and heard not the outburst of anger which the mother gave way to . 
They read in each other 's eyes the bliss , the joy of meeting again , and the assurance of constant , imperishable love . 
`` You are pale and thin , my beloved ! '' 
`` Sorrow for you is consuming me , Marie , but , thank Heaven , you are unchanged , and beautiful as ever ! '' 
`` Hope and love have consoled and strengthened me , Philip . '' 
`` Enough ! 
I forbid you to speak another word to each other , '' and with the power which rage lends , the mother tore Marie away . 
`` Herr Moritz , will you tell me by what right you force yourself into our house , and surprise us like a street-thief in our peaceful dwelling ? 
But no ! 
you need not tell me , I will not listen to you . 
Those who permit themselves to enter our room unasked and unwelcomed -- I will have nothing to say to them . 
Leave ! 
there is the door ! 
Out with you , off the threshold ! '' 
With calm demeanor , Moritz now approached Fran von Werrig , demanding her pardon , saying : `` You see , madame , that I am not so unwelcome here , therefore you will be obliged to let me remain . '' 
`` Yes , that she will , '' sneered Trude , outside the door . 
`` It will be difficult for her to send him off so long as I am unwilling . '' 
`` No , I will not permit it . 
We have nothing to do with each other . 
Out of my sight ! 
-- Away ! '' 
`` Away ! '' 
cried the general . 
`` Oh , the gout , the maddening pains ! 
I can not throw the bold fellow out of the house ! 
I must lie here , and writhe like a worm ! 
I can not be master of my house . 
Oh , oh ! 
what pain ! '' 
`` Stay , Philip , '' whispered Marie , as she again leaned toward Moritz . 
`` They wish to sell me and force me to a hated marriage . 
Do not yield ! 
save me ! '' 
`` You are mine , Marie ; you have sworn to me eternal constancy , and no one can compel you to marry if you do not wish to . '' 
`` We are her parents ; we can , and we will compel her , '' triumphantly cried Frau von Werrig . 
`` The king has given his consent , and if it is necessary we will drag her to the altar by force ! '' 
`` Do it , mother , and I will say no before all the world . '' 
`` We will take care that no one hears you but the priest , and he will not listen , as he knows that the king has commanded you to say yes ! '' 
`` But God will hear her , Frau von Werrig , and He will take vengeance on the cruel , heartless mother . '' 
`` I will await this vengeance , '' she sneered . 
`` It does not concern you , and you need not trouble yourself about it . 
Leave the house ! '' 
`` I came here to speak with you , and I will not go away until you have listened to me . '' 
`` Then I will leave , for I will not hear you , and I command you to follow me , Marie ! ''
