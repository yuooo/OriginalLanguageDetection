I find that a company is about to be formed to build one in your neighborhood . 
I have been asked to take shares , but first of all I thought I would ascertain your views . '' 
This intelligence was very unwelcome ; for though , after much deliberation and consultation , he had resolved , for the present , to postpone the project , the baron did not like it to be hopelessly interfered with by a rival factory . 
In a tone of vexation , he exclaimed , `` Just now , when I have , for a time , that capital to dispose of ! '' 
`` Baron , '' said Ehrenthal , heartily , `` you are a rich man , and much respected . 
Give out that you mean to set up a factory yourself and the company will be dispersed in a few days . '' 
`` You know I can not do so at present , '' said the baron , reluctantly . 
`` You can , gracious sir , if you choose . 
I am not the man to urge you to it . 
What do you want with money-making ? 
But if you say to me , ` Ehrenthal , I will set up a factory , ' why , I have capital for you as much as you like . 
I myself have a sum of ten thousand dollars ready ; you may have it any day . 
And now I will make a proposal . 
I will get you the money you want , at a moderate rate of interest ; and for the money I myself advance , you shall give me a share of the business until you are able to repay the sum . 
Should you require further money , you must take a mortgage on your property until you can replace the whole . '' 
The proposal appeared disinterested and friendly , but the baron felt a certain misgiving , and declined it . 
Accordingly , Ehrenthal had to retire , saying , `` You can think the matter over ; I shall , at all events , put off the forming of the company for a month . '' 
From that day forth the baron was deluged with letters , notes , and messages . 
First Ehrenthal wrote to say he had got the month 's delay ; then Herr Karfunkelstein , one of the projected company , wrote to say he resigned his pretensions ; then Ehrenthal wrote again , inclosing the yearly accounts of a similar factory , that the profits might be judged of . 
Then a Herr Wolfsdorf wrote to offer capital at a low rate of interest . 
Then , lastly , an unknown person of the name of Itzigveit wrote to beg that at least the baron would not enter into partnership with Ehrenthal , as was rumored in the town , for , though a rich , he was a very selfish man , and that the writer could advance capital on much better terms ; whereupon Ehrenthal wrote again that some of his enemies were , he knew , intriguing against him , and wishing to make money themselves in the baron 's promising undertaking , but that the baron must please himself ; that , for his part , he was an honorable man , and did not wish to push himself forward . 
The consequence of all these communications was , that the baron grew familiar with the thought of building his factory with borrowed money . 
However , there was one thing that offended his pride , and that was the thought of Ehrenthal as a shareholder ; so far the letter of the unknown Itzigveit had taken effect . 
During the next month he was the prey of a miserable irresolution , and his wife , in silent sorrow , observed his excitement . 
He often went to town , and often inspected similar factories . 
True , the evidence thus collected was not encouraging , but this he attributed to dread of his competition , or to unfavorable details of site or management . 
The month was over , and a letter came from Ehrenthal to beg for a decision , as some members of the company were impatient of further delay . 
It was on the evening of a hot day that the baron wandered restlessly over his grounds . 
Heavy black , clouds gathered over an arch of yellow sky . 
The grasshoppers chirped far louder than their wont . 
The little birds twittered as if in apprehension of some coming evil . 
The swallows flew low , and darted by close to the baron , as if they did not see him . 
The wild flowers along the road hung down covered with dust . 
The shepherd who passed him looked gray and spectral in the lurid light . 
The baron strolled on to the other side of the lake whence Anton had taken his last look of the lordly home . 
The castle now stood before him in a crimson glow ; every window-pane seemed on fire , and the red roses lay like drops of blood upon the dark green climbers beneath . 
And nearer and nearer rolled on the black clouds , as if to shroud the bright pile from sight . 
Not a leaf stirred , not a ripple curled the water . 
The baron looked down into the water for some living thing , a spider , a dragon-fly , and started back from the pale face that met him , and which at first he did not recognize as his own . 
There was a sultry , boding , listless gloom over his heart , as over all nature . 
Suddenly a strange shivering sound in the tree-tops -- a signal to the storm . 
Again a pause , and then down rushed the mighty wind , bending the trees , curling the lake , driving the dust in wild whirls along . 
The bright light faded from the castle , and all the landscape toned down into bluish gray . 
Then forked lightning , and a long and solemn peal . 
The baron drew himself up to his full height , and turned to meet the storm . 
Leaves and branches flew round him , big drops fell on his head , but he kept looking up at the clouds , and at the lightning that flashed from them , as though expecting a decision from on high . 
Then came the galloping of a horse 's feet , and a gay voice cried out , `` Father ! '' 
A young cavalry officer had drawn up beside him . 
`` My son ! 
my beloved son ! '' 
cried the baron , with a quivering voice ; `` you are come at the right time ; '' and he clasped the youth to his heart , and then held his hands and looked long into his face . 
All indecision , all mournful forebodings were over ; he felt again as the head of his house should feel . 
Before him stood , blooming in youth and health , the future of his family . 
He took it as an omen , as the voice of fate to him in the hour of decision . 
`` And now , '' said he , `` come home ; there is no further need for our remaining in the rain . '' 
While the baroness drew her son down by her on the sofa , and never wearied of looking at and admiring him , the baron sat at the window and watched the torrents of rain . 
Brighter grew the flashes , and shorter the interval between them and the thunder 's roll . 
`` Shut the window , '' said she ; `` the storm comes this way . '' 
`` It will do our house no harm , '' replied her husband , encouragingly . 
`` The conductor stands firm on the roof , and shines through the clouds . 
And now look there where the clouds are blackest , behind those bright green ash-trees . '' 
`` I see the spot , '' returned she . 
`` Make up your mind , '' continued he , smiling , `` always to have your beloved blue sky covered with gray smoke in that direction . 
Above those trees will rise the factory chimney . '' 
`` You mean to build ? '' 
inquired the baroness , anxiously . 
`` I do , '' was the reply . 
`` The undertaking will involve much that will be disagreeable to you and me , and will require all my energies . 
If I venture upon it , it is not for our own sake , but our children 's . 
I wish to secure this property to our family , and so to increase its return that the owner may be able amply to provide for the rest of his children , and yet leave the estate to the eldest son . 
After much painful deliberation , I have this day taken my resolve . '' 
The baron carried on his undertaking with the greatest possible spirit . 
He superintended the burning of the bricks ; he himself marked the trees destined to be cut down for the building . 
Ehrenthal had recommended a builder , and the baron had found out a manager for the concern . 
He had made careful inquiries as to this man 's past career , and congratulated himself upon the amount of his theoretical knowledge . 
Possibly this was not wholly an advantage , for plain practical men declared that he could never let a factory go quietly on , but was always interrupting the daily work with new inventions and contrivances , and was therefore both expensive and unsafe . 
But the baron , naturally enough , considered his probity and intelligence to be the main point , and valued the theoretical skill of the manager in proportion to his own ignorance . 
Pleasant as his prospects were , there were yet many drawbacks . 
Order and comfort had flown away with the storks , who had for years been accustomed to make their nests on the great barn . 
Every body suffered from the new undertaking . 
The baroness lost a corner of the park , and had the grief of seeing a dozen noble old trees felled . 
The gardener wrung his hands over the thefts committed by the strange laborers that swarmed in all directions . 
The bailiff was in perfect despair at the disorders in his jurisdiction . 
His horses and oxen were taken from him to carry timber when he wanted them to plow . 
The wants of the household increased ; the returns from the property became less and less . 
Lenore had much to do to comfort him , and brought him many pounds of tobacco from the town , that he might smoke off his annoyance . 
But the heaviest burden of course pressed upon the baron himself . 
His study was now become a place of public resort , like any tradesman 's shop . 
He had to give advice , to come to a decision , to overcome difficulties in a dozen directions at once . 
He went almost daily to town , and when he returned he was absent and morose in the midst of his family . 
His was a fair hope indeed , but it was one very difficult to realize . 
The baron found some comfort , however , in Ehrenthal 's cheerful devotedness . 
He was always useful , and fertile in expedient , and never appeared doubtful as to the result of the undertaking . 
He was now a frequent visitor , welcome to the master of the house , but less so to the ladies , who suspected him of having been the prompter of the factory scheme . 
One sunny day , Ehrenthal , with shirt-frill and diamond pin , made his appearance in his son 's room . 
`` Will you drive with me to-day to the Rothsattel 's Castle , my Bernhard ? 
I told the baron that I should bring you with me to introduce you to the family . '' 
Bernhard sprang up from his seat . 
`` But , father , I am an utter stranger to them all . '' 
`` When you have seen and spoken to them , you will no longer be a stranger , '' replied his father . 
`` They are good people -- good people , '' added he , benevolently . 
Bernhard had still some modest scruples , but they were overruled , and the two set out together -- the pale student in much excitement at the novelty of the drive , and the prospect of seeing a renowned beauty like Lenore . 
Meanwhile , his father overflowed with the praises of the family . 
`` Noble people , '' said he ; `` if you could only see the baroness as she is in her lace cap , so delicate and so refined ! 
Too refined for this world as it is ! 
Every thing so elegant ! 
To be sure , the pieces of sugar are too large , and the wine is too dear , but it all seems of a piece with their rank . '' 
`` Is Fräulein Lenore a great beauty ? '' 
inquired Bernhard . 
`` Is she very proud ? '' 
`` She is proud , but she is a beauty indeed . 
Between ourselves , I admire her more than Rosalie . '' 
`` Is she a blonde ? '' 
Ehrenthal took some time to consider . 
`` Blonde ? 
what should she be but a blonde or a brunette ? 
One thing I know , she has blue eyes . 
You can look over the farm , and do not forget to walk round the park . 
See whether you can find a spot where you would like to sit with your book . '' 
The guileless Bernhard heard in silence . 
The carriage stopped at the castle door . 
The servants announced that the baron was in his room -- the baroness not visible , but that the young lady was walking in the garden . 
Ehrenthal and his son went round the house , and saw Lenore 's tall figure slowly crossing the grass-plot . 
Ehrenthal threw himself into a deferential attitude , and presented his son , who bowed low . 
Lenore bestowed a cool sort of salutation upon the student , and said , `` If you want my father , he is up stairs in his room . '' 
`` I will go to him , then . 
Bernhard , you may , I am sure , remain with the young lady . '' 
Arrived in the baron 's room , the trader placed some thousand dollars on the table , saying , `` Here is the first sum . 
And now , what does the baron wish as to the security ? '' 
`` According to our agreement , I must give you a mortgage on the property , '' was the reply . 
`` Do you know what , baron ? 
It would never do for you to grant a fresh mortgage for every thousand dollars that I might happen to pay in ; it would be very expensive , and would bring the property into disrepute . 
Rather have a deed of mortgage drawn up for some considerable sum , say twenty thousand dollars , and let it stand in the name of the baroness ; you will then have a security that you may sell any day . 
And every time I pay you , give me a simple note of hand , pledging your word of honor that I have a claim to that amount on the mortgage . 
That is a simple plan , and remains a secret between you and me . 
And when you need no further advances , we can settle the matter finally before an attorney . 
You can make over the mortgage to me , and I return you the notes of hand , and repay you whatever may be wanted to make up the twenty thousand . 
I only ask your word of honor on a slip of paper no longer than my finger , and when the deed is ready , I should wish to have it executed in my house . 
You can not object to that . 
Any lawyer would tell you that I am not dealing in a business-like way . 
A man 's word is often broken , but if there is one thing sure and steadfast in the world , I believe it is your word of honor , baron . '' 
Ehrenthal said this with an expression of sincerity , which was not altogether assumed . 
This plan of his was the result of many a consultation with Itzig . 
He knew that the baron would require far more than twenty thousand dollars , and it was to his advantage that he should procure them easily ; besides which , he , the thorough rogue , had firm trust in the nobleman 's integrity . 
Meanwhile , Lenore had asked Bernhard whether he would like to walk in the park . 
He followed her in silence , looking timidly at the fair young aristocrat , who carried her head high , and troubled herself but little about her companion . 
When she reached the grass-plot station that had once so enchanted Anton , she stood still , and pointed to the gravel-walk , saying , `` That way leads to the lake , and this to the garden again . '' 
Bernhard looked up in amazement at the castle and its turrets , its balcony and creeping plants , and exclaimed , `` I have seen all this before , and yet I have never been here . '' 
`` And certainly , '' said Lenore , `` the castle has never been to the town ; there may be others like it . '' 
`` No , '' replied Bernhard , trying to collect his ideas , `` no ; I have seen a drawing of it in a friend 's room . 
He must know you , '' cried he , with delight ; `` and yet he never told me so . '' 
`` What is your friend 's name ? '' 
`` Anton Wohlfart . '' 
The lady turned round at once with sudden animation . 
`` Wohlfart ? 
a clerk in T. O. Schröter 's house ? 
Is it he ? 
And this gentleman is your friend ? 
How did you become acquainted with him ? '' 
And she stood before Bernhard with her hands behind her back , like a severe schoolmistress cross-examining a little thief about a stolen apple . 
Bernhard told her how he had learned to know and love Anton ; and in doing so , he lost some of his embarrassment , while the young lady lost some of her haughty indifference . 
She asked him many questions about his friend , and Bernhard grew eloquent as he replied . 
Then she led him through the park , as once she had led Anton . 
Bernhard was a son of the city . 
It was not the lofty , wide-spreading trees , nor the gay flower-beds , nor the turreted castle which made an impression on him ; his eyes were riveted on Lenore alone . 
It was a bright September evening ; the sunlight fell through the branches , and whenever Lenore 's hair caught its rays , it shone like gold . 
The proud eye , the delicate mouth , the slender limbs of the noble girl took his fancy prisoner . 
She laughed , and showed her little white teeth -- he was enraptured ; she broke off a twig , and struck the shrubs with it as she passed -- it seemed to him that they bent before her in homage to the ground . 
They came to the bridge between the park and the fields , where a few little girls ran to Lenore and kissed her hands ; she received the tribute of respect as a queen might have done . 
Two other children had made a long chain of dandelion stalks , and with it barred Bernhard 's way . 
`` Away with you , rude little things , '' cried Lenore ; `` how can you think of barring our way ? 
The gentleman comes from the castle . '' 
And Bernhard felt with pride that , for the moment , he belonged to her . 
He put his hand in his purse , and soon got rid of the children . 
`` It is long , '' said he , `` since I have seen a dandelion chain . 
I have an indistinct recollection of sitting as a little boy in a green nook , and trying to make one ; '' and , gathering a few dandelion stalks , he began the childish task . 
`` If you are so expert in such childish play , '' said Lenore , `` here is something for you , '' and she pointed to a great burdock near the road-side . 
`` Have you ever seen a cap of burs ? '' 
`` No , '' answered Bernhard , with some slight misgiving . 
`` You shall have one immediately , '' said Lenore . 
She went to the burdock ; Bernhard gathered her some handfuls of burs . 
She fitted one into the other , and made a cap with two little horns . 
`` You may put it on , '' said she , graciously . 
`` I dare not ; the very birds would be frightened . 
If you too would -- '' `` You can not expect me to wear burs , '' replied she ; `` but you shall have your wish . '' 
She led him back to a group of sunflowers in the shrubbery , and , gathering a few of them , she made a kind of helmet , which she laughingly put on . 
`` Now for your cap , '' commanded she . 
Bernhard obeyed , and his thoughtful , deeply-marked features , black coat , and white cravat looked so strange and incongruous beneath the cap of burs , that Lenore could not help laughing . 
`` Come with me , '' said she ; `` you shall look at yourself in the lake . '' 
And she led him past the site of the factory -- a rough place , with heaps of earth , tiles , beams , in utmost confusion . 
It was a holiday ; all the laborers had left , but some village children were playing about and collecting chips . 
A few steps farther on they came to a little bay , covered with water-lilies and surrounded by brushwood . 
`` How desolate it looks ! '' 
said Lenore ; `` the bushes half pulled away -- even the trees injured : all the result of this building . 
We seldom come here on account of the strange workmen . 
The village children , too , are become so bold , they make this their play-ground , and there is no keeping them away . '' 
That moment a boat came in sight . 
A little village girl , a red-faced chubby thing , stood up tottering in it , while her older brother tried to get as far from shore as with one oar he could . 
`` Look ! '' 
cried Lenore , angrily , `` the little wretches have actually taken our boat . 
Come back instantly to the shore . '' 
The children were startled , the boy dropped the oar , the little girl tottered more than before , and , in the terror of a guilty conscience , lost her balance and fell into the water . 
Her brother drifted helplessly into the bay . 
`` Save the child ! '' 
screamed Lenore . 
Bernhard ran into the lake forgetting that he could not swim , waded in a few steps , and then stood up to the breast in mud and water . 
He stretched out his arms to the spot where the child had sunk , but could not reach it . 
Meanwhile Lenore had sprung , quick as lightning , behind a bush . 
After a few seconds she returned and ran to a projecting bank . 
Bernhard looked with rapture and terror at her tall figure . 
She still wore her fantastic coronal , her light garments floated round her , her eyes were fixed upon the spot where the child would reappear . 
Raising her arms above her head , she leaped in and swam toward it , seized its frock , struck out with her free arm , and soon reached the boat . 
Exerting all her strength , she lifted the child in , and then drew the boat to land . 
Bernhard , who , pale as death , had stood watching her efforts , fought his way back to the land , gave her his hand , and drew in the boat . 
Lenore carried the unconscious child . 
Bernhard lifted out the boy , and both hurried to the gardener 's house , while the little lad ran screaming behind them . 
Lenore 's soaked garments clung closely to her beautiful form , and every movement of her fair limbs was seen almost unveiled by her companion . 
She did not heed it . 
Bernhard went with her into the room , but she hastily sent him out again ; while , with the help of the gardener 's wife , she undressed , and sought by friction and other means to restore the child to life . 
Meanwhile Bernhard stood without , his teeth chattering with cold , but in a state of excitement which made his eyes glow like fire . 
`` Is the child alive ? '' 
he called through the door . 
`` She is , '' answered Lenore from within . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
cried Bernhard ; but his thoughts rose no higher than the fair being within . 
Long he stood there shuddering and dreaming , till at length a tall figure in woolen garments came out of the door . 
It was Lenore in the clothes of the gardener 's wife , still agitated by all she had gone through , but with a happy smile on her lips . 
Bernhard , beside himself , kissed her hand more than once . 
`` You look very well , '' said Lenore , cheerfully ; `` but you will catch cold . '' 
He stood before her , wet and dripping , covered with weeds and mud . 
`` I do not feel cold , '' cried he , but his limbs shook . 
`` Go in at once , '' urged Lenore ; and , opening the door , she called to the good woman , `` Give this gentleman your husband 's clothes . '' 
Bernhard obeyed , and when he came out metamorphosed into a rustic , he found Lenore rapidly walking up and down . 
`` Come to the castle , '' said she , with all her former dignity . 
`` I should like once more to see the child , '' replied he . 
They went to the bed on which the little girl lay . 
She looked up dreamingly at Bernhard , who bent over her and kissed her forehead . 
`` She is the child of a laborer in the village , '' said the gardener 's wife . 
Unobserved by Lenore , Bernhard laid his purse on the bed . 
On their return they found Ehrenthal impatient to depart . 
His amazement at recognizing his Bernhard in the rustic before him was boundless . 
`` Give the gentleman a cloak , '' said Lenore to the servants ; `` he is benumbed with cold . 
Wrap yourself up well , or you may long have cause to remember your march among the water-lilies . '' 
And Bernhard did remember it . 
He wrapped the cloak about him , and squeezed himself up into a corner of the carriage . 
A burning heat had succeeded to the chill , and his blood rushed wildly through his veins . 
He had seen the fairest woman on the earth ; he had experienced realities more transporting , more absorbing , than any of his favorite poet 's dreams . 
He could hardly answer his father 's questions . 
There they sat side by side , cold cunning and burning passion personified . 
This excursion had been propitious to both ; the father had got the long-desired hold on the Rothsattel property , the son had had an adventure which gave a new coloring to his whole existence . 
On the baron 's estate the factory slowly rose ; in Ehrenthal 's coffers the baron 's casket was filled by notes of hand and the new deed of mortgage ; and while Bernhard 's tender frame drooped under the effects of the cold bath above described , he gave his spirit up to the intoxication of the sweetest fancies . 
One afternoon the postman brought to Fink a letter with a black seal . 
Having opened it , he went silently to his own room . 
As he did not return , Anton anxiously followed , and found Fink sitting on the sofa , his head resting on his hand . 
`` You have had bad news ? '' 
inquired Anton . 
`` My uncle is dead , '' was the reply ; `` he , the richest man , perhaps , in Wall Street , New York , has been blown up in a Mississippi steamer . 
He was an unapproachable sort of man , but in his way very kind to me , and I repaid him by folly and ingratitude . 
This thought imbitters his death to me . 
And , besides that , the fact decides my future career . '' 
`` You will leave us ! '' 
cried Anton , in dismay . 
`` I must set off to-morrow . 
My father is heir to all my uncle 's property , with the exception of some land in the Far West , to which I am left executor . 
My uncle was a great speculator , and there is much troublesome business to be settled . 
Therefore my father wishes me to go to New York as soon as possible , and I plainly see that I am wanted there . 
He has all at once conceived a high idea of my judgment and capacity for business . 
Read his letter . '' 
Anton scrupled to take it . 
`` Read it , my boy , '' said Fink , with a sad smile ; `` in my family circle , father and son write each other no secrets . '' 
Anton read . 
`` The excellent accounts which Mr. Schröter sends me of your practical sense and shrewdness in business lead me to request you to go over yourself , in which case I shall send Mr. Westlock , of our house , to assist you . '' 
Anton laid the letter down , and Fink asked , `` What say you to this praise of the principal 's ? 
You know that I had some reason to believe myself far from a favorite . '' 
`` Be that as it may , I consider the praise just , and his estimate correct , '' replied Anton . 
`` At all events , '' said Fink , `` it decides my fate . 
I shall now be what I have long wished , a landed proprietor on the other side of the Atlantic . 
And so , dear Anton , we must part , '' he continued , holding out his hand to his friend ; `` I had not thought the time would so soon come . 
But we shall meet again . '' 
`` Possibly , '' said Anton , sadly , holding the young nobleman 's hand fondly in his . 
`` But now go to Mr. Schröter ; he has the first claim to hear this . '' 
`` He knows it already ; he has had a letter from my father . '' 
`` The more reason why he should expect you . '' 
`` You are right ; let us go . '' 
Anton returned to his desk , and Fink went to the principal 's little office . 
The merchant came to meet him with a serious aspect ; and , after having expressed his sympathy , invited him to sit down , and quietly to discuss his future prospects . 
Fink replied with the utmost courtesy : `` My father 's views for me -- based on your estimate -- agree so well with my own wishes , that I must express my gratitude to you . 
Your opinion of me has been more favorable than I could have ventured to expect . 
If , however , you have really been satisfied with me , I should rejoice to hear it from your own lips . '' 
`` I have not been entirely satisfied , Herr von Fink , '' replied the merchant , with some reserve ; `` you were not in your proper place here . 
But that has not prevented my discerning that for other and more active pursuits you were eminently well fitted . 
You have , in a high degree , the faculty of governing and arranging , and you possess uncommon energy of will . 
A desk in a counting-house is not the place for such a nature . '' 
Fink bowed . 
`` Nevertheless , it was my duty , '' said he , `` to fill that place properly , and I own that I have not done so . '' 
`` You came here unaccustomed to regular work , but during the last few months you have differed but little from a really industrious counting-house clerk . 
Hence my letter to your father . '' 
Fink rose , and the merchant accompanied him to the door , saying , `` Your departure will be a great loss to one of our friends . '' 
Fink abruptly stopped , and said , `` Let him go with me to America . 
He is well fitted to make his fortune there . '' 
`` Have you spoken to him on the subject ? '' 
`` I have not . '' 
`` Then I may state my opinion unreservedly . 
Wohlfart is young , and I believe the defined and regular work of a house like this very desirable discipline for him for some years to come . 
Meanwhile , I have no right to sway his decision . 
I shall be sorry to lose him , but if he thinks he will make his fortune more rapidly with you , I have no objection to make . '' 
`` If you will allow me , I will ask him at once , '' said Fink . 
Then calling Anton into the office , he went on to say , `` Anton , I have requested Mr. Schröter to allow you to accompany me . 
It will be a great point to me to have you with me . 
You know how much attached to you I am ; we will share my new career , and get on gloriously , and you shall fix your own conditions . 
Mr. Schröter leaves you to decide . '' 
Anton stood for a moment thoughtful and perplexed ; the future so suddenly opened out to him looked fair and promising , but he soon collected himself , and , turning to the principal , inquired , `` Is it your opinion that I should do right to go ? '' 
`` I can not say it is , dear Wohlfart , '' was the merchant 's grave reply . 
`` Then I remain , '' said Anton , decidedly . 
`` Do not be angry with me , Fritz , for not following you . 
I am an orphan , and have now no home but this house and this firm . 
If Mr. Schröter will keep me , I will remain with him . '' 
Evidently touched by the words , the merchant replied : `` Remember , however , that thus deciding you give up much . 
In my counting-house you can neither become a rich man , nor have any experience of life on a large and exciting scale ; our business is limited , and the day may come when you will find this irksome . 
All that tends to your future independence , wealth , connections , and so forth , you will more readily secure in America than with me . '' 
`` My good father often used to say to me , ` Dwell in the land ; and verily thou shalt be fed . ' 
I will live according to his wish , '' said Anton , in a voice low with emotion . 
`` He is , and always will be , a mere cit , '' cried Fink , in a sort of despair . 
`` I believe that this love of country is a very sound foundation for a man 's fortune to rise upon , '' said the merchant , and there was an end of the matter . 
Fink said nothing more about the proposal , and Anton tried , by countless small attentions , to show his friend how dear he was to him , and how much he regretted his departure . 
That evening Fink said to Anton , `` Hearken , my lad ; I have a fancy to take a wife across with me . '' 
Anton looked at his friend in utter amazement , and , like one who has received a great shock and wishes to conceal it often does , he inquired , in forced merriment , `` What ! 
you will actually ask Fräulein von Baldereck -- '' `` That 's not the quarter . 
What should I do with a woman whose only thought would be how she could best amuse herself with her husband 's money ? '' 
`` But who else can you be thinking of ? 
Not of the ancient cousin of the house ? '' 
`` No , my fine fellow , but of the young lady of the house . '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , no ! '' 
cried Anton , springing up ; `` that would , indeed , be a pretty business . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
was the cool reply . 
`` Either she takes me , and I am a lucky man , or she takes me not , and I start without a wife . '' 
`` But have you ever thought of it before ? '' 
inquired Anton , uneasily . 
`` Sometimes -- indeed often during the last year . 
She is the best housewife , and the noblest , most unselfish creature in the world . '' 
Anton looked at his friend in growing astonishment . 
Not once had Fink given him the remotest hint of such a thing . 
`` But you never told me of it . '' 
`` Have you ever told me of your feelings for another young lady ? '' 
replied Fink , laughing . 
Anton blushed and was silent . 
`` I think , '' continued Fink , `` that she does not dislike me ; but whether she will go with me or not I can not tell ; however , we shall soon know , for I am going at once to ask her . '' 
Anton barred the way . 
`` Once more I implore you to reflect upon what you are going to do . '' 
`` What is there to reflect upon , you simple child ? '' 
laughed Fink ; but an unusual degree of excitement was visible in his manner . 
`` Do you then love Sabine ? '' 
asked Anton . 
`` Another of your home questions , '' replied Fink . 
`` Yes , I do love her in my own way . '' 
`` And do you mean to take her into the back woods ? '' 
`` Yes ; for she will be a high-hearted , strong-minded wife , and will give stability and worth to my life there . 
She is not fascinating -- at least one ca n't get on with her as readily as with many others ; but if I am to take a wife , I need one who can look after me . 
Believe me , the black-haired one is the very one to do that ; and now let me go ; I must find out how I stand . '' 
`` Speak at least to the principal in the first instance , '' cried Anton after him . 
`` First to herself , '' cried Fink , rushing down the stairs . 
Anton paced up and down the room . 
All that Fink had said in praise of Sabine was true ; that he warmly felt . 
He knew , too , how deep her feeling for him was , and yet he foresaw that his friend would meet with some secret obstacle or other . 
Then another thing displeased him . 
Fink had only spoken of himself ; had he thought of her happiness in the matter -- had he even felt what it would cost her to leave her beloved brother , her country , and her home ? 
True , Fink was the very man to scatter the blossoms of the New World profusely at her feet , but he was always restless ; actively employed , would he have any sympathy for the feelings of his German wife ? 
And involuntarily our hero found himself taking part against his friend , and deciding that Sabine ought not to leave the home and brother to whom she was so essential ; and , absorbed in these thoughts , Anton paced up and down , anxious and heavy-hearted . 
It grew dark , and still Fink did not return . 
Meanwhile he was announced to Sabine . 
She came hurriedly to meet him , and her cheeks were redder than usual as she said , `` My brother has told me that you must leave us . '' 
Fink began in some agitation , `` I must not , I can not leave without having spoken openly to you . 
I came here without any interest in the quiet life to which I had been so unaccustomed . 
I have here learned the worth and the happiness of a German home . 
You I have ever honored as the good spirit of the house . 
Soon after my arrival , you began to treat me with a distance of manner which I have always lamented . 
I now come to tell you how much my eyes and heart have clung to you . 
I feel that my life would be a happy one if I could henceforth ever hear your voice , and if your spirit could accompany mine along the paths of my future life . '' 
Sabine became very pale , and retreated . 
`` Say no more , Herr von Fink , '' said she , imploringly , raising her hand unconsciously , as if to avert what she foresaw . 
`` Nay , let me speak , '' rapidly continued he . 
`` I should consider it the greatest happiness if I could take with me the conviction of not being indifferent to you . 
I have not the audacity to ask you to follow me at once into an uncertain life , but give me a hope that in a year I may return and ask you to become my wife . '' 
`` Do not return , '' said Sabine , motionless as a statue , and in a voice scarcely audible ; `` I implore you to say no more . '' 
Her hands convulsively grasped the back of the chair next to her , and , supporting herself by it , she stood with bloodless cheeks , looking at her suitor through her tears with eyes so full of grief and tenderness that the wild-hearted man before her was thoroughly overcome , and lost all self-confidence -- nay , forgot his own cause in his distress at her emotion , and his anxiety to soothe it . 
`` I grieve that I should thus have shocked you , '' said he ; `` forgive me , Sabine . '' 
`` Go ! 
go ! '' 
implored Sabine , still standing as before . 
`` Let me not part from you without some comfort ; give me an answer ; the most painful were better than this silence . '' 
`` Then hear me , '' said Sabine , with unnatural calmness , while her breast heaved and her hands trembled ; `` I loved you from the first day of your arrival ; like a childish girl , I listened with rapture to the tone of your voice , and was fascinated by all your lips uttered ; but I have conquered the feeling . 
I have conquered it , '' she repeated . 
`` I dare not be yours , for I should be miserable . '' 
`` But why -- why ? '' 
inquired Fink , in genuine despair . 
`` Do not ask me , '' said Sabine , scarce audibly . 
`` I must hear my sentence from your own lips , '' cried Fink . 
`` You have played with your own life and with the life of others ; you would always be unsparing in carrying out your plans ; you would undertake what was great and noble -- that I believe -- but you would not shrink from the sacrifice of individuals . 
I can not bear such a spirit .
