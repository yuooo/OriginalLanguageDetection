They 'll only break your heart in vain . 
You had better have dealings with those that are bold , like myself . 
These live not for the sake of gain . '' 
And she was indeed disinterested . 
In Perm Foma purchased for her different new things and what-not . 
She was delighted , but later , having examined them , she said sadly : `` Do n't squander your money too freely . 
See that your father does not get angry . 
I love you anyway , without all this . '' 
She had already told him that she would go with him only as far as Kazan , where she had a married sister . 
Foma could not believe that she would leave him , and when , on the eve of their arrival at Kazan , she repeated her words , he became gloomy and began to implore her not to forsake him . 
`` Do not feel sorry in advance , '' she said . 
`` We have a whole night before us . 
You will have time to feel sorry when I bid you good-bye , if you will feel sorry at all . '' 
But he still tried to persuade her not to forsake him , and , finally -- which was to be expected -- announced his desire to marry her . 
`` So , so ! '' 
and she began to laugh . 
`` Shall I marry you while my husband is still alive ? 
My darling , my queer fellow ! 
You have a desire to marry , eh ? 
But do they marry such women as I am ? 
You will have many , many mistresses . 
Marry then , when you have overflowed , when you have had your fill of all sweets and feel like having rye bread . 
Then you may marry ! 
I have noticed that a healthy man , for his own peace , must not marry early . 
One woman will not be enough to satisfy him , and he 'll go to other women . 
And for your own happiness , you should take a wife only when you know that she alone will suffice for you . '' 
But the more she spoke , the more persistent Foma became in his desire not to part with her . 
`` Just listen to what I 'll tell you , '' said the woman , calmly . 
`` A splinter of wood is burning in your hand , and you can see well even without its light -- you had better dip it into water , so that there will be no smell of smoke and your hand will not be burned . '' 
`` I do not understand your words . '' 
`` Do understand . 
You have done me no wrong , and I do not wish to do you any . 
And , therefore , I am going away . '' 
It is hard to say what might have been the result of this dispute if an accident had not interfered with it . 
In Kazan Foma received a telegram from Mayakin , who wrote to his godson briefly : `` Come immediately on the passenger steamer . '' 
Foma 's heart contracted nervously , and a few hours later , gloomy and pale , his teeth set together , he stood on the deck of the steamer , which was leaving the harbour , and clinging to the rail with his hands , he stared motionlessly into the face of his love , who was floating far away from him together with the harbour and the shore . 
Pelageya waved her handkerchief and smiled , but he knew that she was crying , shedding many painful tears . 
From her tears the entire front of Foma 's shirt was wet , and from her tears , his heart , full of gloomy alarm , was sad and cold . 
The figure of the woman was growing smaller and smaller , as though melting away , and Foma , without lifting his eyes , stared at her and felt that aside from fear for his father and sorrow for the woman , some new , powerful and caustic sensation was awakening in his soul . 
He could not name it , but it seemed to him as something like a grudge against someone . 
The crowd in the harbour blended into a close , dark and dead spot , faceless , formless , motionless . 
Foma went away from the rail and began to pace the deck gloomily . 
The passengers , conversing aloud , seated themselves to drink tea ; the porters bustled about on the gallery , setting the tables ; somewhere below , on the stern , in the third class , a child was crying , a harmonica was wailing , the cook was chopping something with knives , the dishes were jarring -- producing a rather harsh noise . 
Cutting the waves and making foam , shuddering under the strain and sighing heavily , the enormous steamer moved rapidly against the current . 
Foma looked at the wide strip of broken , struggling , and enraged waves at the stern of the steamer , and began to feel a wild desire to break or tear something ; also to go , breast foremost , against the current and to mass its pressure against himself , against his breast and his shoulders . 
`` Fate ! '' 
said someone beside him in a hoarse and weary voice . 
This word was familiar to him : his Aunt Anfisa had often used it as an answer to his questions , and he had invested in this brief word a conception of a power , similar to the power of God . 
He glanced at the speakers : one of them was a gray little old man , with a kind face ; the other was younger , with big , weary eyes and with a little black wedge-shaped beard . 
His big gristly nose and his yellow , sunken cheeks reminded Foma of his godfather . 
`` Fate ! '' 
The old man repeated the exclamation of his interlocutor with confidence , and began to smile . 
`` Fate in life is like a fisherman on the river : it throws a baited hook toward us into the tumult of our life and we dart at it with greedy mouths . 
Then fate pulls up the rod -- and the man is struggling , flopping on the ground , and then you see his heart is broken . 
That 's how it is , my dear man . '' 
Foma closed his eyes , as if a ray of the sun had fallen full on them , and shaking his head , he said aloud : `` True ! 
That is true ! '' 
The companions looked at him fixedly : the old man , with a fine , wise smile ; the large-eyed man , unfriendly , askance . 
This confused Foma ; he blushed and walked away , thinking of Fate and wondering why it had first treated him kindly by giving him a woman , and then took back the gift from him , so simply and abusively ? 
And he now understood that the vague , caustic feeling which he carried within him was a grudge against Fate for thus sporting with him . 
He had been too much spoiled by life , to regard more plainly the first drop of poison from the cup which was just started , and he passed all the time of the journey without sleep , pondering over the old man 's words and fondling his grudge . 
This grudge , however , did not awaken in him despondency and sorrow , but rather a feeling of anger and revenge . 
Foma was met by his godfather , and to his hasty and agitated question , Mayakin , his greenish little eyes flashing excitedly , said when he seated himself in the carriage beside his godson : `` Your father has grown childish . '' 
`` Drinking ? '' 
`` Worse -- he has lost his mind completely . '' 
`` Really ? 
Oh Lord ! 
Tell me . '' 
`` Do n't you understand ? 
A certain lady is always around him . '' 
`` What about her ? '' 
exclaimed Foma , recalling his Pelageya , and for some reason or other his heart was filled with joy . 
`` She sticks to him and -- bleeds him . '' 
`` Is she a quiet one ? '' 
`` She ? 
Quiet as a fire . 
Seventy-five thousand roubles she blew out of his pocket like a feather ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
Who is she ? '' 
`` Sonka Medinskaya , the architect 's wife . '' 
`` Great God ! 
Is it possible that she -- Did my father -- Is it possible that he took her as his sweetheart ? '' 
asked Foma , with astonishment , in a low voice . 
His godfather drew back from him , and comically opening his eyes wide , said convincedly : `` You are out of your mind , too ! 
By God , you 're out of your mind ! 
Come to your senses ! 
A sweetheart at the age of sixty-three ! 
And at such a price as this . 
What are you talking about ? 
Well , I 'll tell this to Ignat . '' 
And Mayakin filled the air with a jarring , hasty laughter , at which his goat-like beard began to tremble in an uncomely manner . 
It took Foma a long time to obtain a categorical answer ; the old man , contrary to his habit , was restless and irritated ; his speech , usually fluent , was now interrupted ; he was swearing and expectorating as he spoke , and it was with difficulty that Foma learned what the matter was . 
Sophya Pavlovna Medinskaya , the wealthy architect 's wife , who was well known in the city for her tireless efforts in the line of arranging various charitable projects , persuaded Ignat to endow seventy-five thousand roubles for the erection of a lodging-house in the city and of a public library with a reading-room . 
Ignat had given the money , and already the newspapers lauded him for his generosity . 
Foma had seen the woman more than once on the streets ; she was short ; he knew that she was considered as one of the most beautiful women in the city , and that bad rumours were afoot as to her behaviour . 
`` Is that all ? '' 
exclaimed Foma , when his godfather concluded the story . 
`` And I thought God knows what ! '' 
`` You ? 
You thought ? '' 
cried Mayakin , suddenly grown angry . 
`` You thought nothing , you beardless youngster ! '' 
`` Why do you abuse me ? '' 
Foma said . 
`` Tell me , in your opinion , is seventy-five thousand roubles a big sum or not ? '' 
`` Yes , a big sum , '' said Foma , after a moment 's thought . 
`` Ah , ha ! '' 
`` But my father has much money . 
Why do you make such a fuss about it ? '' 
Yakov Tarasovich was taken aback . 
He looked into the youth 's face with contempt and asked him in a faint voice : `` And you speak like this ? '' 
`` I ? 
Who then ? '' 
`` You lie ! 
It is your young foolishness that speaks . 
Yes ! 
And my old foolishness -- brought to test a million times by life -- says that you are a young dog as yet , and it is too early for you to bark in a basso . '' 
Foma hearing this , had often been quite provoked by his godfather 's too picturesque language . 
Mayakin always spoke to him more roughly than his father , but now the youth felt very much offended by the old man and said to him reservedly , but firmly : `` You had better not abuse me without reflection , for I am no longer a small child . '' 
`` Come , come ! '' 
exclaimed Mayakin , mockingly lifting his eyebrows and squinting . 
This roused Foma 's indignation . 
He looked full into the old man 's eyes and articulated with emphasis : `` And I am telling you that I do n't want to hear any more of that undeserved abuse of yours . 
Enough ! '' 
`` Mm ! 
So-o ! 
Pardon me . '' 
Yakov Tarasovich closed his eyes , chewed a little with his lips , and , turning aside from his godson , kept silent for awhile . 
The carriage turned into a narrow street , and , noticing from afar the roof of his house , Foma involuntarily moved forward . 
At the same time Mayakin asked him with a roguish and gentle smile : `` Foma ! 
Tell me -- on whom you have sharpened your teeth ? 
Eh ? '' 
`` Why , are they sharp ? '' 
asked Foma , pleased with the manner in which Mayakin now regarded him . 
`` Pretty good . 
That 's good , dear . 
That 's very good ! 
Your father and I were afraid lest you should be a laggard . 
Well , have you learned to drink vodka ? '' 
`` I drank it . '' 
`` Rather too soon ! 
Did you drink much of it ? '' 
`` Why much ? '' 
`` Does it taste good ? '' 
`` Not very . '' 
`` So . 
Never mind , all this is not so bad . 
Only you are too outspoken . 
You are ready to confess all your sins to each and every pope that comes along . 
You must consider it is n't always necessary to do that . 
Sometimes by keeping silent you both please people and commit no sins . 
Yes . 
A man 's tongue is very seldom sober . 
Here we are . 
See , your father does not know that you have arrived . 
Is he home yet , I wonder ? '' 
He was at home : his loud , somewhat hoarse laughter was heard from the open windows of the rooms . 
The noise of the carriage , which stopped at the house , caused Ignat to look out of the window , and at the sight of his son he cried out with joy : `` Ah ! 
You 've come . '' 
After a while he pressed Foma to his breast with one hand , and , pressing the palm of his other hand against his son 's forehead , thus bending his head back , he looked into his face with beaming eyes and spoke contentedly : `` You are sunburnt . 
You 've grown strong . 
You 're a fine fellow ! 
Madame ! 
How 's my son ? 
Is n't he fine ? '' 
`` Not bad looking , '' a gentle , silver voice was heard . 
Foma glanced from behind his father 's shoulder and noticed that a slender woman with magnificent fair hair was sitting in the front corner of the room , resting her elbows on the table ; her dark eyes , her thin eyebrows and plump , red lips strikingly defined on her pale face . 
Behind her armchair stood a large philodendron-plant whose big , figured leaves were hanging down in the air over her little golden head . 
`` How do you do , Sophya Pavlovna , '' said Mayakin , tenderly , approaching her with his hand outstretched . 
`` What , are you still collecting contributions from poor people like us ? '' 
Foma bowed to her mutely , not hearing her answer to Mayakin , nor what his father was saying to him . 
The lady stared at him steadfastly and smiled to him affably and serenely . 
Her childlike figure , clothed in some kind of dark fabric , was almost blended with the crimson stuff of the armchair , while her wavy , golden hair and her pale face shone against the dark background . 
Sitting there in the corner , beneath the green leaves , she looked at once like a flower , and like an ikon . 
`` See , Sophya Pavlovna , how he is staring at you . 
An eagle , eh ? '' 
said Ignat . 
Her eyes became narrower , a faint blush leaped to her cheeks , and she burst into laughter . 
It sounded like the tinkling of a little silver bell . 
And she immediately arose , saying : `` I would n't disturb you . 
Good-bye ! '' 
When she went past Foma noiselessly , the scent of perfume came to him , and he noticed that her eyes were dark blue , and her eyebrows almost black . 
`` The sly rogue glided away , '' said Mayakin in a low voice , angrily looking after her . 
`` Well , tell us how was the trip ? 
Have you squandered much money ? '' 
roared Ignat , pushing his son into the same armchair where Medinskaya had been sitting awhile before . 
Foma looked at him askance and seated himself in another chair . 
`` Is n't she a beautiful young woman , eh ? '' 
said Mayakin , smiling , feeling Foma with his cunning eyes . 
`` If you keep on gaping at her she will eat away all your insides . '' 
Foma shuddered for some reason or other , and , saying nothing in reply , began to tell his father about the journey in a matter-of-fact tone . 
But Ignat interrupted him : `` Wait , I 'll ask for some cognac . '' 
`` And you are keeping on drinking all the time , they say , '' said Foma , disapprovingly . 
Ignat glanced at his son with surprise and curiosity , and asked : `` Is this the way to speak to your father ? '' 
Foma became confused and lowered his head . 
`` That 's it ! '' 
said Ignat , kind-heartedly , and ordered cognac to be brought to him . 
Mayakin , winking his eyes , looked at the Gordyeeffs , sighed , bid them good-bye , and , after inviting them to have tea with him in his raspberry garden in the evening , went away . 
`` Where is Aunt Anfisa ? '' 
asked Foma , feeling that now , being alone with his father , he was somewhat ill at ease . 
`` She went to the cloister . 
Well , tell me , and I will have some cognac . '' 
Foma told his father all about his affairs in a few minutes and he concluded his story with a frank confession : `` I have spent much money on myself . '' 
`` How much ? '' 
`` About six hundred roubles . '' 
`` In six weeks ! 
That 's a good deal . 
I see as a clerk you 're too expensive for me . 
Where have you squandered it all ? '' 
`` I gave away three hundred puds of grain . '' 
`` To whom ? 
How ? '' 
Foma told him all about it . 
`` Hm ! 
Well , that 's all right ! '' 
Ignat approved . 
`` That 's to show what stuff we are made of . 
That 's clear enough -- for the father 's honour -- for the honour of the firm . 
And there is no loss either , because that gives a good reputation . 
And that , my dear , is the very best signboard for a business . 
Well , what else ? '' 
`` And then , I somehow spent more . '' 
`` Speak frankly . 
It 's not the money that I am asking you about -- I just want to know how you lived there , '' insisted Ignat , regarding his son attentively and sternly . 
`` I was eating , drinking . '' 
Foma did not give in , bending his head morosely and confusedly . 
`` Drinking vodka ? '' 
`` Vodka , too . '' 
`` Ah ! 
So . 
Is n't it rather too soon ? '' 
`` Ask Yefim whether I ever drank enough to be intoxicated . '' 
`` Why should I ask Yefim ? 
You must tell me everything yourself . 
So you are drinking ? 
I do n't like it . '' 
`` But I can get along without drinking . '' 
`` Come , come ! 
Do you want some cognac ? '' 
Foma looked at his father and smiled broadly . 
And his father answered him with a kindly smile : `` Eh , you . 
Devil ! 
Drink , but look out -- know your business . 
What can you do ? 
A drunkard will sleep himself sober , a fool -- never . 
Let us understand this much at least , for our own consolation . 
And did you have a good time with girls , too ? 
Be frank ! 
Are you afraid that I will beat you , or what ? '' 
`` Yes . 
There was one on the steamer . 
I had her there from Perm to Kazan . '' 
`` So , '' Ignat sighed heavily and said , frowning : `` You 've become defiled rather too soon . '' 
`` I am twenty years old . 
And you yourself told me that in your days fellows married at the age of fifteen , '' replied Foma , confused . 
`` Then they married . 
Very well , then , let us drop the subject . 
Well , you 've had dealings with a woman . 
What of it ? 
A woman is like vaccination , you can not pass your life without her . 
As for myself , I can not play the hypocrite . 
I began to go around with women when I was younger than you are now . 
But you must be on your guard with them . '' 
Ignat became pensive and was silent for a long time , sitting motionless , his head bent low on his breast . 
`` Listen , Foma , '' he started again , sternly and firmly . 
`` I shall die before long . 
I am old . 
Something oppresses my breast . 
I breathe with difficulty . 
I 'll die . 
Then all my affairs will fall on your shoulders . 
At first your godfather will assist you -- mind him ! 
You started quite well ; you attended to everything properly ; you held the reins firmly in your hands . 
And though you did squander a big sum of money , it is evident that you did not lose your head . 
God grant the same in the future . 
You should know this : business is a living , strong beast ; you must manage it ably ; you must put a strong bridle on it or it will conquer you . 
Try to stand above your business . 
Place yourself so that it will all be under your feet ; that each little tack shall be visible to you . '' 
Foma looked at his father 's broad chest , heard his heavy voice and thought to himself : `` Oh , but you wo n't die so soon ! '' 
This thought pleased him and awakened in him a kind , warm feeling for his father . 
`` Rely upon your godfather . 
He has enough common sense in his head to supply the whole town with it . 
All he lacks is courage , or he would have risen high . 
Yes , I tell you my days on earth are numbered . 
Indeed , it is high time to prepare myself for death ; to cast everything aside ; to fast , and see to it that people bear me good-will . '' 
`` They will ! '' 
said Foma with confidence . 
`` If there were but a reason why they should . '' 
`` And the lodging-house ? '' 
Ignat looked at his son and began to laugh . 
`` Yakov has had time to tell it to you already ! 
The old miser . 
He must have abused me ? '' 
`` A little . '' 
Foma smiled . 
`` Of course ! 
Do n't I know him ? '' 
`` He spoke of it as though it were his own money . '' 
Ignat leaned back in his chair and burst into still louder laughter . 
`` The old raven , eh ? 
That 's quite true . 
Whether it be his own money or mine , it is all the same to him . 
There he is trembling now . 
He has an aim in view , the bald-headed fellow . 
Can you tell me what it is ? '' 
Foma thought awhile and said : `` I do n't know . '' 
`` Eh , you 're stupid . 
He wants to tell our fortunes . '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
`` Come now , guess ! '' 
Foma looked at his father and -- guessed it . 
His face became gloomy , he slightly raised himself from the armchair and said resolutely : `` No , I do n't want to . 
I shall not marry her ! '' 
`` Oh ? 
Why so ? 
She is a strong girl ; she is not foolish ; she 's his only child . '' 
`` And Taras ? 
The lost one ? 
But I -- I do n't want to at all ! '' 
`` The lost one is gone , consequently it is not worthwhile speaking of him . 
There is a will , dear , which says : ` All my movable and real estates shall go to my daughter , Lubov . ' 
And as to the fact that she is your godfather 's daughter , we 'll set this right . '' 
`` It is all the same , '' said Foma , firmly . 
`` I shall not marry her ! '' 
`` Well , it is rather early to speak of it now ! 
But why do you dislike her so much ? '' 
`` I do not like such as she is . '' 
`` So-o ! 
Just think of it ! 
And which women are more to your liking , sir , may I ask ? '' 
`` Those that are more simple . 
She 's always busy with her Gymnasium students and with her books . 
She 's become learned . 
She 'll be laughing at my expense , '' said Foma , emotionally . 
`` That is quite true . 
She is too bold . 
But that is a trifle . 
All sorts of rust can be removed if you try to do it . 
That 's a matter for the future . 
And your godfather is a clever old man . 
His was a peaceful , sedentary life ; sitting in one place he gave a thought to everything . 
It is worthwhile listening to him , for he can see the wrong side of each and every worldly affair . 
He is our aristocrat -- descending from Mother Yekaterina -- ha , ha ! 
He understands a great deal about himself . 
And as his stem was cut off by Taras , he decided to put you in Taras 's place , do you see ? '' 
`` No , I 'd rather select my place myself , '' said Foma , stubbornly . 
`` You are foolish as yet . '' 
Ignat smiled in reply to his son 's words . 
Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Aunt Anfisa . 
`` Foma ! 
You 've come , '' she cried out , somewhere behind the doors . 
Foma rose and went to meet her , with a gentle smile . 
Again his life streamed on slowly , calmly , monotonously . 
Again the Exchange and his father 's instructions . 
Retaining a kindly sarcastic and encouraging tone in his relation toward his son , Ignat began to treat him more strictly . 
He censured him for each and every trifle and constantly reminded him that he brought him up freely ; that he was never in his way and that he never beat him . 
`` Other fathers beat fellows like yourself with logs of wood . 
And I never even touched you with a finger . '' 
`` Evidently I did n't deserve it , '' said Foma one day , calmly . 
Ignat became angry at his son for these words and for the tone . 
`` Do n't talk so much ! '' 
he roared . 
`` You 've picked up courage because of the softness of my hand . 
You find an answer to every word I say . 
Beware ; though my hand was soft , it can nevertheless still squeeze you so that tears will gush forth from your heels . 
You 've grown up too soon , like a toad-stool , just sprung up from the ground . 
You have a bad smell already . '' 
`` Why are you so angry at me ? '' 
asked Foma , perplexed and offended , when his father chanced to be in a happy frame of mind . 
`` Because you can not tolerate it when your father grumbles at you . 
You 're ready to quarrel immediately . '' 
`` But it is offensive . 
I have not grown worse than I was before . 
Do n't I see how others live at my age ? '' 
`` Your head would n't fall off from my scolding you . 
And I scold you because I see there is something in you that is not mine . 
What it is , I do not know , but I see it is there . 
And that something is harmful to you . '' 
These words of Ignat made the son very thoughtful . 
Foma also felt something strange in himself , something which distinguished him from the youth of his age , but he , too , could not understand what it was . 
And he looked at himself with suspicion . 
Foma liked to be on the Exchange amid the bustle and talk of the sedate people who were making deals amounting to thousands of roubles ; the respect with which the less well-to-do tradesmen greeted and spoke to him -- to Foma , the son of the millionaire -- flattered him greatly . 
He felt happy and proud whenever he successfully managed some part of his father 's business , assuming all responsibility on his own shoulders , and received a smile of approval from his father for it . 
There was in him a great deal of ambition , yearning to appear as a grown-up man of business , but -- just as before his trip to Perm -- he lived as in solitude ; he still felt no longing for friends , although he now came in contact everyday with the merchants ' sons of his age . 
They had invited him more than once to join them in their sprees , but he rather rudely and disdainfully declined their invitations and even laughed at them . 
`` I am afraid . 
Your fathers may learn of your sprees , and as they 'll give you a drubbing , I might also come in for a share . '' 
What he did not like in them was that they were leading a dissipated and depraved life , without their fathers ' knowledge , and that the money they were spending was either stolen from their parents or borrowed on long-termed promissory notes , to be paid with exorbitant interest . 
They in turn did not like him for this very reserve and aversion , which contained the pride so offensive to them . 
He was timid about speaking to people older than himself , fearing lest he should appear in their eyes stupid and thick-headed . 
He often recalled Pelageya , and at first he felt melancholy whenever her image flashed before his imagination . 
But time went on , and little by little rubbed off the bright colours of this woman ; and before he was aware of it his thoughts were occupied by the slender , angel-like Medinskaya . 
She used to come up to Ignat almost every Sunday with various requests , all of which generally had but one aim -- to hasten the building of the lodging-asylum . 
In her presence Foma felt awkward , huge , heavy ; this pained him , and he blushed deeply under the endearing look of Sophya Pavlovna 's large eyes . 
He noticed that every time she looked at him , her eyes would grow darker , while her upper lip would tremble and raise itself slightly , thus displaying very small white teeth . 
This always frightened him . 
When his father noticed how steadfastly he was staring at Medinskaya he told him one day : `` Do n't be staring so much at that face . 
Look out , she is like a birch ember : from the outside it is just as modest , smooth and dark -- altogether cold to all appearances -- but take it into your hand and it will burn you . '' 
Medinskaya did not kindle in the youth any sensual passion , for there was nothing in her that resembled Pelageya , and altogether she was not at all like other women . 
He knew that shameful rumours about her were in the air , but he did not believe any of them .
