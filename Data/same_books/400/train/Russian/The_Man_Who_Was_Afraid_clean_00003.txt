He thinks it is clever to sap the life out of us . '' 
The boy heard this grumbling and knew that it was concerning his father . 
He also noticed that although Yefim was grumbling , he carried more wood on his stretcher than the others , and walked faster than the others . 
None of the sailors replied to Yefim 's grumbling , and even the one who worked with him was silent , only now and then protesting against the earnestness with which Yefim piled up the wood on the stretchers . 
`` Enough ! '' 
he would say , morosely , `` you are not loading a horse , are you ? '' 
`` And you had better keep quiet . 
You were put to the cart -- cart it and do n't kick -- and should your blood be sucked -- keep quiet again . 
What can you say ? '' 
Suddenly Ignat appeared , walked up to the sailor and , stopping in front of him , asked sternly : `` What were you talking about ? '' 
`` I am talking -- I know , '' replied Yefim , hesitating . 
`` There was no agreement -- that I must say nothing . '' 
`` And who is going to suck blood ? '' 
asked Ignat , stroking his beard . 
The sailor understood that he had been caught unawares , and seeing no way out of it , he let the log of wood fall from his hands , rubbed his palms against his pants , and , facing Ignat squarely , said rather boldly : `` And am I not right ? 
Do n't you suck it ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
`` You . '' 
Foma saw that his father swung his hand . 
A loud blow resounded , and the sailor fell heavily on the wood . 
He arose immediately and worked on in silence . 
Blood was trickling from his bruised face on to the white bark of the birch wood ; he wiped the blood off his face with the sleeve of his shirt , looked at his sleeve and , heaving a sigh , maintained silence , and when he went past Foma with the hand-harrows , two big , turbid tears were trembling on his face , near the bridge of his nose , and Foma noticed them . 
At dinner Foma was pensive and now and then glanced at his father with fear in his eyes . 
`` Why do you frown ? '' 
asked his father , gently . 
`` Frown ? '' 
`` Are you ill , perhaps ? 
Be careful . 
If there is anything , tell me . '' 
`` You are strong , '' said Foma of a sudden musingly . 
`` I ? 
That 's right . 
God has favoured me with strength . '' 
`` How hard you struck him ! '' 
exclaimed the boy in a low voice , lowering his head . 
Ignat was about to put a piece of bread with caviar into his mouth , but his hand stopped , held back by his son 's exclamation ; he looked interrogatively at Foma 's drooping head and asked : `` You mean Yefim , do n't you ? '' 
`` Yes , he was bleeding . 
And how he walked afterward , how he cried , '' said the boy in a low voice . 
`` Mm , '' roared Ignat , chewing a bite . 
`` Well , are you sorry for him ? '' 
`` It 's a pity ! '' 
said Foma , with tears in his voice . 
`` Yes . 
So that 's the kind of a fellow you are , '' said Ignat . 
Then , after a moment 's silence , he filled a wineglass with vodka , emptied it , and said sternly , in a slightly reprimanding tone : `` There is no reason why you should pity him . 
He brawled at random , and therefore got what he deserved . 
I know him : he is a good fellow , industrious , strong and not a bit foolish . 
But to argue is not his business ; I may argue , because I am the master . 
It is n't simple to be master . 
A punch would n't kill him , but will make him wiser . 
That 's the way . 
Eh , Foma ! 
You are an infant , and you do not understand these things . 
I must teach you how to live . 
It may be that my days on earth are numbered . '' 
Ignat was silent for awhile , drank some more vodka and went on instinctively : `` It is necessary to have pity on men . 
You are right in doing so . 
But you must pity them sensibly . 
First look at a man , find out what good there is in him , and what use may be made of him ! 
And if you find him to be strong and capable -- pity and assist him . 
And if he is weak and not inclined to work -- spit upon him , pass him by . 
Just keep this in mind -- the man who complains against everything , who sighs and moans all the time -- that man is worth nothing ; he merits no compassion and you will do him no good whatever , even if you help him . 
Pity for such people makes them more morose , spoils them the more . 
In your godfather 's house you saw various kinds of people -- unfortunate travellers and hangers-on , and all sorts of rabble . 
Forget them . 
They are not men , they are just shells , and are good for nothing . 
They are like bugs , fleas and other unclean things . 
Nor do they live for God 's sake -- they have no God . 
They call His name in vain , in order to move fools to pity , and , thus pitied , to fill their bellies with something . 
They live but for their bellies , and aside from eating , drinking , sleeping and moaning they can do nothing . 
And all they accomplish is the soul 's decay . 
They are in your way and you trip over them . 
A good man among them -- like fresh apples among bad ones -- may soon be spoilt , and no one will profit by it . 
You are young , that 's the trouble . 
You can not comprehend my words . 
Help him who is firm in misery . 
He may not ask you for assistance , but think of it yourself , and assist him without his request . 
And if he should happen to be proud and thus feel offended at your aid , do not allow him to see that you are lending him a helping hand . 
That 's the way it should be done , according to common sense ! 
Here , for example , two boards , let us say , fall into the mud -- one of them is a rotten one , the other , a good sound board . 
What should you do ? 
What good is there in the rotten board ? 
You had better drop it , let it stay in the mud and step on it so as not to soil your feet . 
As to the sound board , lift it up and place it in the sun ; if it can be of no use to you , someone else may avail himself of it . 
That 's the way it is , my son ! 
Listen to me and remember . 
There is no reason why Yefim should be pitied . 
He is a capable fellow , he knows his value . 
You can not knock his soul out with a box on the ear . 
I 'll just watch him for about a week , and then I 'll put him at the helm . 
And there , I am quite sure , he 'll be a good pilot . 
And if he should be promoted to captain , he would n't lose courage -- he would make a clever captain ! 
That 's the way people grow . 
I have gone through this school myself , dear . 
I , too , received more than one box on the ear when I was of his age . 
Life , my son , is not a dear mother to all of us . 
It is our exacting mistress . '' 
Ignat talked with his son about two hours , telling him of his own youth , of his toils , of men ; their terrible power , and of their weakness ; of how they live , and sometimes pretend to be unfortunate in order to live on other people 's money ; and then he told him of himself , and of how he rose from a plain working man to be proprietor of a large concern . 
The boy listened to his words , looked at him and felt as though his father were coming nearer and nearer to him . 
And though his father 's story did not contain the material of which Aunt Anfisa 's fairy-tales were brimful , there was something new in it , something clearer and more comprehensible than in her fairy-tales , and something just as interesting . 
Something powerful and warm began to throb within his little heart , and he was drawn toward his father . 
Ignat , evidently , surmised his son 's feelings by his eyes : he rose abruptly from his seat , seized him in his arms and pressed him firmly to his breast . 
And Foma embraced his neck , and , pressing his cheek to that of his father , was silent and breathed rapidly . 
`` My son , '' whispered Ignat in a dull voice , `` My darling ! 
My joy ! 
Learn while I am alive . 
Alas ! 
it is hard to live . '' 
The child 's heart trembled at this whisper ; he set his teeth together , and hot tears gushed from his eyes . 
Until this day Ignat had never kindled any particular feeling in his son : the boy was used to him ; he was tired of looking at his enormous figure , and feared him slightly , but was at the same time aware that his father would do anything for him that he wanted . 
Sometimes Ignat would stay away from home a day , two , a week , or possibly the entire summer . 
And yet Foma did not even notice his absence , so absorbed was he by his love for Aunt Anfisa . 
When Ignat returned the boy was glad , but he could hardly tell whether it was his father 's arrival that gladdened him or the playthings he brought with him . 
But now , at the sight of Ignat , the boy ran to meet him , grasped him by the hand , laughed , stared into his eyes and felt weary if he did not see him for two or three hours : His father became interesting to him , and , rousing his curiosity , he fairly developed love and respect for himself . 
Every time that they were together Foma begged his father : `` Papa , tell me about yourself . '' 
... . 
The steamer was now going up the Volga . 
One suffocating night in July , when the sky was overcast with thick black clouds , and everything on the Volga was somewhat ominously calm , they reached Kazan and anchored near Uslon at the end of an enormous fleet of vessels . 
The clinking of the anchor chains and the shouting of the crew awakened Foma ; he looked out of the window and saw , far in the distance , small lights glimmering fantastically : the water about the boat black and thick , like oil -- and nothing else could be seen . 
The boy 's heart trembled painfully and he began to listen attentively . 
A scarcely audible , melancholy song reached his ears -- mournful and monotonous as a chant on the caravan the watchmen called to one another ; the steamer hissed angrily getting up steam . 
And the black water of the river splashed sadly and quietly against the sides of the vessels . 
Staring fixedly into the darkness , until his eyes hurt , the boy discerned black piles and small lights dimly burning high above them . 
He knew that those were barges , but this knowledge did not calm him and his heart throbbed unevenly , and , in his imagination , terrifying dark images arose . 
`` O-o-o , '' a drawling cry came from the distance and ended like a wail . 
Someone crossed the deck and went up to the side of the steamer . 
`` O-o-o , '' was heard again , but nearer this time . 
`` Yefim ! '' 
some one called in a low voice on the deck . 
`` Yefimka ! '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Devil ! 
Get up ! 
Take the boat-hook . '' 
`` O-o-o , '' someone moaned near by , and Foma , shuddering , stepped back from the window . 
The queer sound came nearer and nearer and grew in strength , sobbed and died out in the darkness . 
While on the deck they whispered with alarm : `` Yefimka ! 
Get up ! 
A guest is floating ! '' 
`` Where ? '' 
came a hasty question , then bare feet began to patter about the deck , a bustle was heard , and two boat-hooks slipped down past the boy 's face and almost noiselessly plunged into the water . 
`` A gue-e-est ! '' 
Some began to sob near by , and a quiet , but very queer splash resounded . 
The boy trembled with fright at this mournful cry , but he could not tear his hands from the window nor his eyes from the water . 
`` Light the lantern . 
You ca n't see anything . '' 
`` Directly . '' 
And then a spot of dim light fell over the water . 
Foma saw that the water was rocking calmly , that a ripple was passing over it , as though the water were afflicted , and trembled for pain . 
`` Look ! 
Look ! '' 
they whispered on the deck with fright . 
At the same time a big , terrible human face , with white teeth set together , appeared on the spot of light . 
It floated and rocked in the water , its teeth seemed to stare at Foma as though saying , with a smile : `` Eh , boy , boy , it is cold . 
Goodbye ! '' 
The boat-hooks shook , were lifted in the air , were lowered again into the water and carefully began to push something there . 
`` Shove him ! 
Shove ! 
Look out , he may be thrown under the wheel . '' 
`` Shove him yourself then . '' 
The boat-hooks glided over the side of the steamer , and , scratching against it , produced a noise like the grinding of teeth . 
Foma could not close his eyes for watching them . 
The noise of feet stamping on the deck , over his head , was gradually moving toward the stern . 
And then again that moaning cry for the dead was heard : `` A gue-e-est ! '' 
`` Papa ! '' 
cried Foma in a ringing voice . 
`` Papa ! '' 
His father jumped to his feet and rushed toward him . 
`` What is that ? 
What are they doing there ? '' 
cried Foma . 
Wildly roaring , Ignat jumped out of the cabin with huge bounds . 
He soon returned , sooner than Foma , staggering and looking around him , had time to reach his father 's bed . 
`` They frightened you ? 
It 's nothing ! '' 
said Ignat , taking him up in his arms . 
`` Lie down with me . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Foma , quietly . 
`` It was nothing , my son . 
Only a drowned man . 
A man was drowned and he is floating . 
That 's nothing ! 
Do n't be afraid , he has already floated clear of us . '' 
`` Why did they push him ? '' 
interrogated the boy , firmly pressing close to his father , and shutting his eyes for fright . 
`` It was necessary to do so . 
The water might have thrown him under the wheel . 
Under ours , for instance . 
Tomorrow the police would notice it , there would be trouble , inquests , and we would be held here for examination . 
That 's why we shoved him along . 
What difference does it make to him ? 
He is dead ; it does n't pain him ; it does n't offend him . 
And the living would be troubled on his account . 
Sleep , my son . 
`` So he will float on that way ? '' 
`` He will float . 
They 'll take him out somewhere and bury him . '' 
`` And will a fish devour him ? '' 
`` Fish do not eat human bodies . 
Crabs eat them . 
They like them . '' 
Foma 's fright was melting , from the heat of his father 's body , but before his eyes the terrible sneering face was still rocking in the black water . 
`` And who is he ? '' 
`` God knows ! 
Say to God about him : ` Oh Lord , rest his soul ! ' '' 
`` Lord , rest his soul ! '' 
repeated Foma , in a whisper . 
`` That 's right . 
Sleep now , do n't fear . 
He is far away now ! 
Floating on . 
See here , be careful as you go up to the side of the ship . 
You may fall overboard . 
God forbid ! 
And -- '' `` Did he fall overboard ? '' 
`` Of course . 
Perhaps he was drunk , and that 's his end ! 
And maybe he threw himself into the water . 
There are people who do that . 
They go and throw themselves into the water and are drowned . 
Life , my dear , is so arranged that death is sometimes a holiday for one , sometimes it is a blessing for all . '' 
`` Papa . '' 
`` Sleep , sleep , dear . '' 
DURING the very first day of his school life , stupefied by the lively and hearty noise of provoking mischiefs and of wild , childish games , Foma picked out two boys from the crowd who at once seemed more interesting to him than the others . 
One had a seat in front of him . 
Foma , looking askance , saw a broad back ; a full neck , covered with freckles ; big ears ; and the back of the head closely cropped , covered with light-red hair which stood out like bristles . 
When the teacher , a bald-headed man , whose lower lip hung down , called out : `` Smolin , African ! '' 
the red-headed boy arose slowly , walked up to the teacher , calmly stared into his face , and , having listened to the problem , carefully began to make big round figures on the blackboard with chalk . 
`` Good enough ! '' 
said the teacher . 
`` Yozhov , Nicolai . 
Proceed ! '' 
One of Foma 's neighbours , a fidgety little boy with black little mouse-eyes , jumped up from his seat and passed through the aisle , striking against everything and turning his head on all sides . 
At the blackboard he seized the chalk , and , standing up on the toes of his boots , noisily began to mark the board with the chalk , creaking and filling with chalk dust , dashing off small , illegible marks . 
`` Not so loud ! '' 
said the teacher , wrinkling his yellow face and contracting his fatigued eyes . 
Yozhov spoke quickly and in a ringing voice : `` Now we know that the first peddler made 17k . 
profit . '' 
`` Enough ! 
Gordyeeff ! 
Tell me what must we do in order to find out how much the second peddler gained ? '' 
Watching the conduct of the boys , so unlike each other , Foma was thus taken unawares by the question and he kept quiet . 
`` Do n't you know ? 
How ? 
Explain it to him , Smolin . '' 
Having carefully wiped his fingers , which had been soiled with chalk , Smolin put the rag away , and , without looking at Foma , finished the problem and again began to wipe his hands , while Yozhov , smiling and skipping along as he walked , returned to his seat . 
`` Eh , you ! '' 
he whispered , seating himself beside Foma , incidentally striking his side with his fist . 
`` Why do n't you know it ? 
What was the profit altogether ? 
Thirty kopecks . 
And there were two peddlers . 
One of them got 17 . 
Well , how much did the other one get ? '' 
`` I know , '' replied Foma , in a whisper , feeling confused and examining the face of Smolin , who was sedately returning to his seat . 
He did n't like that round , freckled face , with the blue eyes , which were loaded with fat . 
And Yozhov pinched his leg and asked : `` Whose son are you ? 
The Frantic 's ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` So . 
Do you wish me to prompt you always ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And what will you give me for it ? '' 
Foma thought awhile and asked : `` And do you know it all yourself ? '' 
`` I ? 
I am the best pupil . 
You 'll see for yourself . '' 
`` Hey , there ! 
Yozhov , you are talking again ? '' 
cried the teacher , faintly . 
Yozhov jumped to his feet and said boldly : `` It 's not I , Ivan Andreyich -- it 's Gordyeeff . '' 
`` Both of them were whispering , '' announced Smolin , serenely . 
Wrinkling his face mournfully and moving his big lip comically , the teacher reprimanded them all , but his words did not prevent Yozhov from whispering immediately : `` Very well , Smolin ! 
I 'll remember you for telling . '' 
`` Well , why do you blame it all on the new boy ? '' 
asked Smolin , in a low voice , without even turning his head to them . 
`` All right , all right , '' hissed Yozhov . 
Foma was silent , looking askance at his brisk neighbour , who at once pleased him and roused in him a desire to get as far as possible away from him . 
During recess he learned from Yozhov that Smolin , too , was rich , being the son of a tan-yard proprietor , and that Yozhov himself was the son of a guard at the Court of Exchequer , and very poor . 
The last was clearly evident by the adroit boy 's costume , made of gray fustian and adorned with patches on the knees and elbows ; by his pale , hungry-looking face ; and , by his small , angular and bony figure . 
This boy spoke in a metallic alto , elucidating his words with grimaces and gesticulations , and he often used words whose meaning was known but to himself . 
`` We 'll be friends , '' he announced to Foma . 
`` Why did you complain to the teacher about me ? '' 
Gordyeeff reminded Yozhov , looking at him suspiciously . 
`` There ! 
What 's the difference to you ? 
You are a new scholar and rich . 
The teacher is not exacting with the rich . 
And I am a poor hanger-on ; he does n't like me , because I am impudent and because I never bring him any presents . 
If I had been a bad pupil he would have expelled me long ago . 
You know I 'll go to the Gymnasium from here . 
I 'll pass the second class and then I 'll leave . 
Already a student is preparing me for the second class . 
There I 'll study so that they ca n't hold me back ! 
How many horses do you have ? '' 
`` Three . 
What do you need to study so much for ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` Because I am poor . 
The poor must study hard so that they may become rich . 
They become doctors , functionaries , officers . 
I shall be a ` tinkler . ' 
A sword at my side , spur on my boots . 
Cling , cling ! 
And what are you going to be ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' said Foma , pensively , examining his companion . 
`` You need not be anything . 
And are you fond of pigeons ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` What a good-for-nothing you are ! 
Oh ! 
Eh ! '' 
Yozhov imitated Foma 's slow way of speaking . 
`` How many pigeons do you have ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` Eh , you ! 
Rich , and yet you have no pigeons . 
Even I have three . 
If my father had been rich I would have had a hundred pigeons and chased them all day long . 
Smolin has pigeons , too , fine ones ! 
Fourteen . 
He made me a present of one . 
Only , he is greedy . 
All the rich are greedy . 
And you , are you greedy , too ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' said Foma , irresolutely . 
`` Come up to Smolin 's and the three of us together will chase the pigeons . '' 
`` Very well . 
If they let me . '' 
`` Why , does not your father like you ? '' 
`` He does like me . '' 
`` Well , then , he 'll let you go . 
Only do n't tell him that I am coming . 
Perhaps he would not let you go with me . 
Tell him you want to go to Smolin 's . 
Smolin ! '' 
A plump boy came up to them , and Yozhov accosted him , shaking his head reproachfully : `` Eh , you red-headed slanderer ! 
It is n't worth while to be friends with you , blockhead ! '' 
`` Why do you abuse me ? '' 
asked Smolin , calmly , examining Foma fixedly . 
`` I am not abusing you ; I am telling the truth , '' Yozhov explained , straightening himself with animation . 
`` Listen ! 
Although you are a kissel , but -- let it go ! 
We 'll come up to see you on Sunday after mass . '' 
`` Come , '' Smolin nodded his head . 
`` We 'll come up . 
They 'll ring the bell soon . 
I must run to sell the siskin , '' declared Yozhov , pulling out of his pocket a paper package , wherein some live thing was struggling . 
And he disappeared from the school-yard as mercury from the palm of a hand . 
`` What a queer fellow he is ! '' 
said Foma , dumfounded by Yozhov 's adroitness and looking at Smolin interrogatively . 
`` He is always like this . 
He 's very clever , '' the red-headed boy explained . 
`` And cheerful , too , '' added Foma . 
`` Cheerful , too , '' Smolin assented . 
Then they became silent , looking at each other . 
`` Will you come up with him to my house ? '' 
asked the red-headed boy . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Come up . 
It 's nice there . '' 
Foma said nothing to this . 
Then Smolin asked him : `` Have you many friends ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` Neither did I have any friends before I went to school . 
Only cousins . 
Now you 'll have two friends at once . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Foma . 
`` Are you glad ? '' 
`` I 'm glad . '' 
`` When you have lots of friends , it is lively . 
And it is easier to study , too -- they prompt you . '' 
`` And are you a good pupil ? '' 
`` Of course ! 
I do everything well , '' said Smolin , calmly . 
The bell began to bang as though it had been frightened and was hastily running somewhere . 
Sitting in school , Foma began to feel somewhat freer , and compared his friends with the rest of the boys . 
He soon learned that they both were the very best boys in school and that they were the first to attract everybody 's attention , even as the two figures 5 and 7 , which had not yet been wiped off the blackboard . 
And Foma felt very much pleased that his friends were better than any of the other boys . 
They all went home from school together , but Yozhov soon turned into some narrow side street , while Smolin walked with Foma up to his very house , and , departing , said : `` You see , we both go home the same way , too . '' 
At home Foma was met with pomp : his father made him a present of a heavy silver spoon , with an ingenious monogram on it , and his aunt gave him a scarf knitted by herself . 
They were awaiting him for dinner , having prepared his favourite dishes for him , and as soon as he took off his coat , seated him at the table and began to ply him with questions . 
`` Well , how was it ? 
How did you like the school ? '' 
asked Ignat , looking lovingly at his son 's rosy , animated face . 
`` Pretty good . 
It 's nice ! '' 
replied Foma . 
`` My darling ! '' 
sighed his aunt , with feeling , `` look out , hold your own with your friends . 
As soon as they offend you tell your teachers about it . '' 
`` Go on . 
What else will you tell him ? '' 
Ignat smiled . 
`` Never do that ! 
Try to get square with every offender yourself , punish him with your own hand , not with somebody else 's . 
Are there any good fellows there ? '' 
`` There are two , '' Foma smiled , recalling Yozhov . 
`` One of them is so bold -- terrible ! ''
