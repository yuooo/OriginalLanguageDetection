So you see , we have arranged to lock them up in all sorts of houses and that they might be kept there cheaply , we have compelled those old and feeble beggars to work and we need give no alms now , and since our streets have been cleared of the various ragged beggars , we do not see their terrible distress and poverty , and we may , therefore , think that all men on earth are well-fed , shod and clothed . 
That 's what all these different houses are for , for the concealment of the truth , for the banishment of Christ from our life ! 
Is this clear to you ? '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
said Foma , confused by the old man 's clever words . 
`` And this is not all . 
The pool is not yet baled out to the bottom ! '' 
exclaimed Mayakin , swinging his hand in the air with animation . 
The wrinkles of his face were in motion ; his long , ravenous nose was stirring , and in his voice rang notes of irritability and emotion . 
`` Now , let us look at this thing from the other side . 
Who contributes most in favour of the poor , for the support of these houses , asylums , poor-houses ? 
The rich people , the merchants , our body of merchants . 
Very well ! 
And who commands our life and regulates it ? 
The nobles , the functionaries and all sorts of other people , not belonging to our class . 
From them come the laws , the newspapers , science -- everything from them . 
Before , they were land-owners , now their land was snatched away from them -- and they started out in service . 
Very well ! 
But who are the most powerful people today ? 
The merchant is the supreme power in an empire , because he has the millions on his side ! 
Is n't that so ? '' 
`` True ! '' 
assented Foma , eager to hear the sooner that which was to follow , and which was already sparkling in the eyes of his godfather . 
`` Just mark this , '' the old man went on distinctly and impressively . 
`` We merchants had no hand in the arrangement of life , nor do we have a voice or a hand in it today . 
Life was arranged by others , and it is they that multiplied all sorts of scabs in life -- idlers and poor unfortunates ; and since by multiplying them they obstructed life and spoilt it -- it is , justly judging , now their duty to purify it . 
But we are purifying it , we contribute money for the poor , we look after them -- we , judge it for yourself , why should we mend another 's rags , since we did not tear them ? 
Why should we repair a house , since others have lived in it and since it belongs to others ? 
Were it not wiser for us to step aside and watch until a certain time how rottenness is multiplying and choking those that are strangers to us ? 
They can not conquer it , they have not the means to do it . 
Then they will turn to us and say : ` Pray , help us , gentlemen ! ' 
and we 'll tell them : ` Let us have room for our work ! 
Rank us among the builders of this same life ! ' 
And as soon as they do this we , too , will have to clear life at one sweep of all sorts of filth and chaff . 
Then the Emperor will see with his clear eyes who are really his faithful servants , and how much wisdom they have saved up while their hands were idle . 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` Of course , I do ! '' 
exclaimed Foma . 
When his godfather spoke of the functionaries , Foma reminded himself of the people that were present at the dinner ; he recalled the brisk secretary , and a thought flashed through his mind that this stout little man has in all probability an income of no more than a thousand roubles a year , while he , Foma , has a million . 
But that man lives so easily and freely , while he , Foma , does not know how to live , is indeed abashed to live . 
This comparison and his godfather 's speech roused in him a whirl of thoughts , but he had time to grasp and express only one of them : `` Indeed , do we work for the sake of money only ? 
What 's the use of money if it can give us no power ? '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
said Mayakin , winking his eyes . 
`` Eh ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , offended . 
`` How about my father ? 
Have you spoken to him ? '' 
`` I spoke to him for twenty years . '' 
`` Well , how about him ? '' 
`` My words did not reach him . 
The crown of your father 's head was rather thick . 
His soul was open to all , while his mind was hidden away far within him . 
Yes , he made a blunder , and I am very sorry about the money . '' 
`` I am not sorry for the money . '' 
`` You should have tried to earn even a tenth part of it , then speak . '' 
`` May I come in ? '' 
came Luba 's voice from behind the door . 
`` Yes , step right in , '' said the father . 
`` Will you have lunch now ? '' 
she asked , entering . 
`` Let us have it . '' 
She walked up to the sideboard and soon the dishes were rattling . 
Yakov Tarasovich looked at her , moved his lips , and suddenly striking Foma 's knee with his hand , he said to him : `` That 's the way , my godson ! 
Think . '' 
Foma responded with a smile and thought : `` But he 's clever -- cleverer than my father . '' 
But another voice within him immediately replied : `` Cleverer , but worse . '' 
FOMA 'S dual relation toward Mayakin grew stronger and stronger as time went on ; listening to his words attentively and with eager curiosity , he felt that each meeting with his godfather was strengthening in him the feeling of hostility toward the old man . 
Sometimes Yakov Tarasovich roused in his godson a feeling akin to fear , sometimes even physical aversion . 
The latter usually came to Foma whenever the old man was pleased with something and laughed . 
From laughter the old man 's wrinkles would tremble , thus changing the expression of his face every now and then ; his dry , thin lips would stretch out and move nervously , displaying black broken teeth , and his red little beard was as though aflame . 
His laughter sounded like the squeaking of rusty hinges , and altogether the old man looked like a lizard at play . 
Unable to conceal his feelings , Foma often expressed them to Mayakin rather rudely , both in words and in gesture , but the old man , pretending not to notice it , kept a vigilant eye on him , directing his each and every step . 
Wholly absorbed by the steamship affairs of the young Gordyeeff , he even neglected his own little shop , and allowed Foma considerable leisure time . 
Thanks to Mayakin 's important position in town and to his extensive acquaintance on the Volga , business was splendid , but Mayakin 's zealous interest in his affairs strengthened Foma 's suspicions that his godfather was firmly resolved to marry him to Luba , and this made the old man more repulsive to him . 
He liked Luba , but at the same time she seemed suspicious and dangerous for him . 
She did not marry , and Mayakin never said a word about it ; he gave no evening parties , invited none of the youths to his house and did not allow Luba to leave the house . 
And all her girl friends were married already . 
Foma admired her words and listened to her just as eagerly as to her father ; but whenever she started to speak of Taras with love and anguish , it seemed to him that she was hiding another man under that name , perhaps that same Yozhov , who according to her words , had to leave the university for some reason or other , and go to Moscow . 
There was a great deal of simplemindedness and kindness in her , which pleased Foma , and ofttimes her words awakened in him a feeling of pity for her ; it seemed to him that she was not alive , that she was dreaming though awake . 
His conduct at the funeral feast for his father became known to all the merchants and gave him a bad reputation . 
On the Exchange , he noticed , everybody looked at him sneeringly , malevolently , and spoke to him in some peculiar way . 
One day he heard behind him a low exclamation , full of contempt : `` Gordyeeff ! 
Milksop ! '' 
He felt that this was said of him , but he did not turn around to see who it was that flung those words at him . 
The rich people , who had inspired him with timidity before , were now losing in his eyes the witchery of their wealth and wisdom . 
They had more than once snatched out of his hands this or that profitable contract ; he clearly saw that they would do it again , and they all seemed to him alike -- greedy for money , always ready to cheat one another . 
When he imparted to his godfather his observation , the old man said : `` How then ? 
Business is just the same as war -- a hazardous affair . 
There they fight for the purse , and in the purse is the soul . '' 
`` I do n't like this , '' announced Foma . 
`` Neither do I like everything -- there 's too much fraud . 
`` But to be fair in business matters is utterly impossible ; you must be shrewd ! 
In business , dear , on approaching a man you must hold honey in your left hand , and clutch a knife in your right . 
Everybody would like to buy five copecks ' worth for a half a copeck . '' 
`` Well , this is n't too good , '' said Foma , thoughtfully . 
`` But it will be good later . 
When you have taken the upper hand , then it will be good . 
Life , dear Foma , is very simple : either bite everybody , or lie in the gutter . '' 
The old man smiled , and the broken teeth in his mouth roused in Foma the keen thought : `` You have bitten many , it seems . '' 
`` There 's but one word -- battle ! '' 
repeated the old man . 
`` Is this the real one ? '' 
asked Foma , looking at Mayakin searchingly . 
`` That is , what do you mean -- the real ? '' 
`` Is there nothing better than this ? 
Does this contain everything ? '' 
`` Where else should it be ? 
Everybody lives for himself . 
Each of us wishes the best for himself . 
And what is the best ? 
To go in front of others , to stand above them . 
So that everybody is trying to attain the first place in life -- one by this means , another by that means . 
But everyone is positively anxious to be seen from afar , like a tower . 
And man was indeed appointed to go upward . 
Even the Book of Job says : ` Man is born unto trouble , as the sparks , to fly upward . ' 
Just see : even children at play always wish to surpass one another . 
And each and every game has its climax , which makes it interesting . 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` I understand this ! '' 
said Foma , firmly and confidently . 
`` But you must also feel this . 
With understanding alone you can not go far , and you must desire , and desire so that a big mountain should seem to you but a hillock , and the sea but a puddle . 
Eh ! 
When I was of your age I had an easy life , while you are only taking aim . 
But then , good fruit does not ripen early . '' 
The old man 's monotonous speeches soon accomplished what they were intended to do . 
Foma listened to them and made clear to himself the aim of life . 
He must be better than others , he resolved , and the ambition , kindled by the old man , took deep root in his heart . 
It took root within his heart , but did not fill it up , for Foma 's relations toward Medinskaya assumed that character , which they were bound to assume . 
He longed for her , he always yearned to see her ; while in her presence he became timid , awkward and stupid ; he knew it and suffered on this account . 
He frequently visited her , but it was hard to find her at home alone ; perfumed dandies like flies over a piece of sugar -- were always flitting about her . 
They spoke to her in French , sang and laughed , while he looked at them in silence , tortured by anger and jealousy . 
His legs crossed , he sat somewhere in a corner of her richly furnished drawing-room , where it was extremely difficult to walk without overturning or at least striking against something -- Foma sat and watched them sternly . 
Over the soft rugs she was noiselessly passing hither and thither , casting to him kind glances and smiles , while her admirers were fawning upon her , and they all , like serpents , were cleverly gliding by the various little tables , chairs , screens , flower-stands -- a storehouse full of beautiful and frail things , scattered about the room with a carelessness equally dangerous to them and to Foma . 
But when he walked there , the rugs did not drown his footsteps , and all these things caught at his coat , trembled and fell . 
Beside the piano stood a sailor made of bronze , whose hand was lifted , ready to throw the life-saving ring ; on this ring were ropes of wire , and these always pulled Foma by the hair . 
All this provoked laughter among Sophya Pavlovna and her admirers , and Foma suffered greatly , changing from heat to cold . 
But he felt no less uncomfortable even when alone with her . 
Greeting him with a kindly smile , she would take a seat beside him in one of the cosy corners of her drawing-room and would usually start her conversation by complaining to him of everybody : `` You would n't believe how glad I am to see you ! '' 
Bending like a cat , she would gaze into his eyes with her dark glance , in which something avidious would now flash up . 
`` I love to speak to you , '' she said , musically drawling her words . 
`` I 've grown tired of all the rest of them . 
They 're all so boring , ordinary and worn-out , while you are fresh , sincere . 
You do n't like those people either , do you ? '' 
`` I ca n't bear them ! '' 
replied Foma , firmly . 
`` And me ? '' 
she asked softly . 
Foma turned his eyes away from her and said , with a sigh : `` How many times have you asked me that ? '' 
`` Is it hard for you to tell me ? '' 
`` It is n't hard , but what for ? '' 
`` I must know it . '' 
`` You are making sport of me , '' said Foma , sternly . 
And she opened her eyes wide and inquired in a tone of great astonishment : `` How do I make sport of you ? 
What does it mean to make sport ? '' 
And her face looked so angelic that he could not help believing her . 
`` I love you ! 
I love you ! 
It is impossible not to love you ! '' 
said he hotly , and immediately added sadly , lowering his voice : `` But you do n't need it ! '' 
`` There you have it ! '' 
sighed Medinskaya , satisfied , drawing back from him . 
`` I am always extremely pleased to hear you say this , with so much youthfulness and originality . 
Would you like to kiss my hand ? '' 
Without saying a word he seized her thin , white little hand and carefully bending down to it , he passionately kissed it for a long time . 
Smiling and graceful , not in the least moved by his passion , she freed her hand from his . 
Pensively , she looked at him with that strange glitter in her eyes , which always confused Foma ; she examined him as something rare and extremely curious , and said : `` How much strength and power and freshness of soul you possess ! 
Do you know ? 
You merchants are an altogether new race , an entire race with original traditions , with an enormous energy of body and soul . 
Take you , for instance -- you are a precious stone , and you should be polished . 
Oh ! '' 
Whenever she told him : `` You , '' or `` according to your merchant fashion , '' it seemed to Foma that she was pushing him away from her with these words . 
This at once saddened and offended him . 
He was silent , looking at her small maidenly figure , which was always somehow particularly well dressed , always sweet-scented like a flower . 
Sometimes he was seized with a wild , coarse desire to embrace and kiss her . 
But her beauty and the fragility of her thin , supple body awakened in him a fear of breaking and disfiguring her , and her calm , caressing voice and the clear , but somewhat cautious look of her eyes chilled his passion ; it seemed to him as though she were looking straight into his soul , divining all his thoughts . 
But these bursts of emotion were rare . 
Generally the youth regarded Medinskaya with adoration , admiring everything in her -- her beauty , her words , her dresses . 
And beside this adoration there was in him a painfully keen consciousness of his remoteness from her , of her supremacy over him . 
These relations were established between them within a short time ; after two or three meetings Medinskaya was in full possession of the youth and she slowly began to torture him . 
Evidently she liked to have a healthy , strong youth at her mercy ; she liked to rouse and tame the animal in him merely with her voice and glance , and confident of the power of her superiority , she found pleasure in thus playing with him . 
On leaving her , he was usually half-sick from excitement , bearing her a grudge , angry with himself , filled with many painful and intoxicating sensations . 
And about two days later he would come to undergo the same torture again . 
One day he asked her timidly : `` Sophya Pavlovna ! 
Have you ever had any children ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I thought not ! '' 
exclaimed Foma with delight . 
She cast at him the look of a very naive little girl , and said : `` What made you think so ? 
And why do you want to know whether I had any children or not ? '' 
Foma blushed , and , bending his head , began to speak to her in a heavy voice , as though he was lifting every word from the ground and as though each word weighed a few puds . 
`` You see -- a woman who -- has given birth to children -- such a woman has altogether different eyes . '' 
`` So ? 
What kind are they then ? '' 
`` Shameless ! '' 
Foma blurted out . 
Medinskaya broke into her silver laughter , and Foma , looking at her , also began to laugh . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
said he , at length . 
`` Perhaps I 've said something wrong , improper . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
You can not say anything improper . 
You are a pure , amiable boy . 
And so , my eyes are not shameless ? '' 
`` Yours are like an angel 's ! '' 
announced Foma with enthusiasm , looking at her with beaming eyes . 
And she glanced at him , as she had never done before ; her look was that of a mother , a sad look of love mingled with fear for the beloved . 
`` Go , dear one . 
I am tired ; I need a rest , '' she said to him , as she rose without looking at him . 
He went away submissively . 
For some time after this incident her attitude toward him was stricter and more sincere , as though she pitied him , but later their relations assumed the old form of the cat-and-mouse play . 
Foma 's relation toward Medinskaya could not escape his godfather 's notice , and one day the old man asked him , with a malicious grimace : `` Foma ! 
You had better feel your head more often so that you may not lose it by accident . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Foma . 
`` I speak of Sonka . 
You are going to see her too often . '' 
`` What has that to do with you ? '' 
said Foma , rather rudely . 
`` And why do you call her Sonka ? '' 
`` It 's nothing to me . 
I would lose nothing if you should be fleeced . 
And as to calling her Sonka -- everybody knows that is her name . 
So does everybody know that she likes to rake up the fire with other people 's hands . '' 
`` She is clever ! '' 
announced Foma , firmly , frowning and hiding his hands in his pockets . 
`` She is intelligent . '' 
`` Clever , that 's true ! 
How cleverly she arranged that entertainment ; there was an income of two thousand four hundred roubles , the expenses -- one thousand nine hundred ; the expenses really did not even amount to a thousand roubles , for everybody does everything for her for nothing . 
Intelligent ! 
She will educate you , and especially will those idlers that run around her . '' 
`` They 're not idlers , they are clever people ! '' 
replied Foma , angrily , contradicting himself now . 
`` And I learn from them . 
What am I ? 
I know nothing . 
What was I taught ? 
While there they speak of everything -- and each one has his word to say . 
Do not hinder me from being like a man . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
How you 've learned to speak ! 
With so much anger , like the hail striking against the roof ! 
Very well , be like a man , but in order to be like a man it might be less dangerous for you to go to the tavern ; the people there are after all better than Sophya 's people . 
And you , young man , you should have learned to discriminate one person from another . 
Take Sophya , for instance : What does she represent ? 
An insect for the adornment of nature and nothing more ! '' 
Intensely agitated , Foma set his teeth together and walked away from Mayakin , thrusting his hands still deeper into his pockets . 
But the old man soon started again a conversation about Medinskaya . 
They were on their way back from the bay after an inspection of the steamers , and seated in a big and commodious sledge , they were enthusiastically discussing business matters in a friendly way . 
It was in March . 
The water under the sledge-runners was bubbling , the snow was already covered with a rather dirty fleece , and the sun shone warmly and merrily in the clear sky . 
`` Will you go to your lady as soon as we arrive ? '' 
asked Mayakin , unexpectedly , interrupting their business talk . 
`` I will , '' said Foma , shortly , and with displeasure . 
`` Mm . 
Tell me , how often do you give her presents ? '' 
asked Mayakin , plainly and somewhat intimately . 
`` What presents ? 
What for ? '' 
Foma wondered . 
`` You make her no presents ? 
You do n't say . 
Does she live with you then merely so , for love 's sake ? '' 
Foma boiled up with anger and shame , turned abruptly toward the old man and said reproachfully : `` Eh ! 
You are an old man , and yet you speak so that it is a shame to listen to you ! 
To say such a thing ! 
Do you think she would come down to this ? '' 
Mayakin smacked his lips and sang out in a mournful voice : `` What a blockhead you are ! 
What a fool ! '' 
and suddenly grown angry , he spat out : `` Shame upon you ! 
All sorts of brutes drank out of the pot , nothing but the dregs remained , and now a fool has made a god unto himself of this dirty pot . 
Devil ! 
You just go up to her and tell her plainly : ' I want to be your lover . 
I am a young man , do n't charge me much for it . ' '' 
`` Godfather ! '' 
said Foma , sternly , in a threatening voice , `` I can not bear to hear such words . 
If it were someone else . '' 
`` But who except myself would caution you ? 
Good God ! '' 
Mayakin cried out , clasping his hands . 
`` So she has led you by the nose all winter long ! 
What a nose ! 
What a beast she is ! '' 
The old man was agitated ; in his voice rang vexation , anger , even tears Foma had never before seen him in such a state , and looking at him , he was involuntarily silent . 
`` She will ruin you ! 
Oh Lord ! 
The Babylonian prostitute ! '' 
Mayakin 's eyes were blinking , his lips were trembling , and in rude , cynical words he began to speak of Medinskaya , irritated , with a wrathful jar in his voice . 
Foma felt that the old man spoke the truth . 
He now began to breathe with difficulty and he felt that his mouth had a dry , bitter taste . 
`` Very well , father , enough , '' he begged softly and sadly , turning aside from Mayakin . 
`` Eh , you ought to get married as soon as possible ! '' 
exclaimed the old man with alarm . 
`` For Christ 's sake , do not speak , '' uttered Foma in a dull voice . 
Mayakin glanced at his godson and became silent . 
Foma 's face looked drawn ; he grew pale , and there was a great deal of painful , bitter stupor in his half-open lips and in his sad look . 
On the right and on the left of the road a field stretched itself , covered here and there with patches of winter-raiment . 
Rooks were hopping busily about over the black spots , where the snow had melted . 
The water under the sledge-runners was splashing , the muddy snow was kicked up by the hoofs of the horses . 
`` How foolish man is in his youth ! '' 
exclaimed Mayakin , in a low voice . 
Foma did not look at him . 
`` Before him stands the stump of a tree , and yet he sees the snout of a beast -- that 's how he frightens himself . 
Oh , oh ! '' 
`` Speak more plainly , '' said Foma , sternly . 
`` What is there to say ? 
The thing is clear : girls are cream ; women are milk ; women are near , girls are far . 
Consequently , go to Sonka , if you can not do without it , and tell her plainly . 
That 's how the matter stands . 
Fool ! 
If she is a sinner , you can get her more easily . 
Why are you so angry , then ? 
Why so bristled up ? '' 
`` You do n't understand , '' said Foma , in a low voice . 
`` What is it I do not understand ? 
I understand everything ! '' 
`` The heart . 
Man has a heart , '' sighed the youth . 
Mayakin winked his eyes and said : `` Then he has no mind . '' 
WHEN Foma arrived in the city he was seized with sad , revengeful anger . 
He was burning with a passionate desire to insult Medinskaya , to abuse her . 
His teeth firmly set together , his hands thrust deep into his pockets , he walked for a few hours in succession about the deserted rooms of his house , he sternly knitted his brow , and constantly threw his chest forward . 
His breast was too narrow to hold his heart , which was filled with wrath . 
He stamped the floor with heavy and measured steps , as though he were forging his anger . 
`` The vile wretch -- disguised herself as an angel ! '' 
Pelageya vividly arose in his memory , and he whispered malignantly and bitterly : `` Though a fallen woman , she is better . 
She did not play the hypocrite . 
She at once unfolded her soul and her body , and her heart is surely just as her breast -- white and sound . '' 
Sometimes Hope would whisper timidly in his ear : `` Perhaps all that was said of her was a lie . '' 
But he recalled the eager certainty of his godfather , and the power of his words , and this thought perished . 
He set his teeth more firmly together and threw his chest still more forward . 
Evil thoughts like splinters of wood stuck into his heart , and his heart was shattered by the acute pain they caused . 
By disparaging Medinskaya , Mayakin made her more accessible to his godson , and Foma soon understood this . 
A few days passed , and Foma 's agitated feelings became calm , absorbed by the spring business cares . 
The sorrow for the loss of the individual deadened the spite he owed the woman , and the thought of the woman 's accessibility increased his passion for her . 
And somehow , without perceiving it himself , he suddenly understood and resolved that he ought to go up to Sophya Pavlovna and tell her plainly , openly , just what he wanted of her -- that 's all ! 
He even felt a certain joy at this resolution , and he boldly started off to Medinskaya , thinking on the way only how to tell her best all that was necessary . 
The servants of Medinskaya were accustomed to his visits , and to his question whether the lady was at home the maid replied : `` Please go into the drawing-room . 
She is there alone . '' 
He became somewhat frightened , but noticing in the mirror his stately figure neatly clad with a frock-coat , and his swarthy , serious face in a frame of a downy black beard , set with large dark eyes -- he raised his shoulders and confidently stepped forward through the parlour . 
Strange sounds of a string instrument were calmly floating to meet him ; they seemed to burst into quiet , cheerless laughter , complaining of something , tenderly stirring the heart , as though imploring it for attention and having no hopes of getting it . 
Foma did not like to hear music -- it always filled him with sadness . 
Even when the `` machine '' in the tavern played some sad tune , his heart filled with melancholy anguish , and he would either ask them to stop the `` machine '' or would go away some little distance feeling that he could not listen calmly to these tunes without words , but full of lamentation and tears . 
And now he involuntarily stopped short at the door of the drawing-room . 
A curtain of long strings of parti-coloured glass beads hung over the door . 
The beads had been strung so as to form a fantastic figure of some kind of plants ; the strings were quietly shaking and it seemed that pale shadows of flowers were soaring in the air . 
This transparent curtain did not hide the inside of the drawing-room from Foma 's eyes . 
Seated on a couch in her favourite corner , Medinskaya played the mandolin . 
A large Japanese umbrella , fastened up to the wall , shaded the little woman in black by its mixture of colours ; the high bronze lamp under a red lamp-shade cast on her the light of sunset . 
The mild sounds of the slender strings were trembling sadly in the narrow room , which was filled with soft and fragrant twilight . 
Now the woman lowered the mandolin on her knees and began running her fingers over the strings , also to examine fixedly something before her . 
Foma heaved a sigh . 
A soft sound of music soared about Medinskaya , and her face was forever changing as though shadows were falling on it , falling and melting away under the flash of her eyes . 
Foma looked at her and saw that when alone she was not quite so good-looking as in the presence of people -- now her face looked older , more serious -- her eyes had not the expression of kindness and gentleness , they had a rather tired and weary look . 
And her pose , too , was weary , as if the woman were about to stir but could not . 
Foma noticed that the feeling which prompted him to come to her was now changing in his heart into some other feeling . 
He scraped with his foot along the floor and coughed . 
`` Who is that ? '' 
asked the woman , starting with alarm . 
And the strings trembled , issuing an alarmed sound . 
`` It is I , '' said Foma , pushing aside the strings of the beads . 
`` Ah ! 
But how quietly you 've entered . 
I am glad to see you . 
Be seated ! 
Why did n't you come for such a long time ? '' 
Holding out her hand to him , she pointed with the other at a small armchair beside her , and her eyes were gaily smiling . 
`` I was out on the bay inspecting my steamers , '' said Foma , with exaggerated ease , moving his armchair nearer to the couch . 
`` Is there much snow yet on the fields ? '' 
`` As much as one may want . 
But it is already melting considerably . 
There is water on the roads everywhere . '' 
He looked at her and smiled . 
Evidently Medinskaya noticed the ease of his behaviour and something new in his smile , for she adjusted her dress and drew farther away from him . 
Their eyes met -- and Medinskaya lowered her head . 
`` Melting ! '' 
said she , thoughtfully , examining the ring on her little finger . 
`` Ye-es , streams everywhere . '' 
Foma informed her , admiring his boots . 
`` That 's good . 
Spring is coming . '' 
`` Now it wo n't be delayed long . '' 
`` Spring is coming , '' repeated Medinskaya , softly , as if listening to the sounds of her words . 
`` People will start to fall in love , '' said Foma , with a smile , and for some reason or other firmly rubbed his hands . 
`` Are you preparing yourself ? '' 
asked Medinskaya , drily . 
`` I have no need for it . 
I have been ready long ago . 
I am already in love for all my life . '' 
She cast a glance at him , and started to play again , looking at the strings and saying pensively : `` Spring . 
How good it is that you are but beginning to live . 
The heart is full of power , and there is nothing dark in it . '' 
`` Sophya Pavlovna ! '' 
exclaimed Foma , softly . 
She interrupted him with a caressing gesture . 
`` Wait , dearest ! 
Today I can tell you something good . 
Do you know , a person who has lived long has such moments that when he looks into his heart he unexpectedly finds there something long forgotten . 
For years it lay somewhere in the depth of his heart , but lost none of the fragrance of youth , and when memory touches it , then spring comes over that person , breathing upon him the vivifying freshness of the morning of his life .
