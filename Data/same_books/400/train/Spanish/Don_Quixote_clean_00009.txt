No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly , and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument . 
At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard , at another in the stable ; and as they were all attention , wondering , Cardenio came to the door and said , `` Listen , whoever is not asleep , and you will hear a muleteer 's voice that enchants as it chants . '' 
`` We are listening to it already , senor , '' said Dorothea ; on which Cardenio went away ; and Dorothea , giving all her attention to it , made out the words of the song to be these : Ah me , Love 's mariner am I On Love 's deep ocean sailing ; I know not where the haven lies , I dare not hope to gain it . 
One solitary distant star Is all I have to guide me , A brighter orb than those of old That Palinurus lighted . 
And vaguely drifting am I borne , I know not where it leads me ; I fix my gaze on it alone , Of all beside it heedless . 
But over-cautious prudery , And coyness cold and cruel , When most I need it , these , like clouds , Its longed-for light refuse me . 
Bright star , goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest , When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I 'll know that death is near me . 
The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice , so , shaking her from side to side , she woke her , saying : `` Forgive me , child , for waking thee , but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard , perhaps , in all thy life . '' 
Clara awoke quite drowsy , and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said , asked her what it was ; she repeated what she had said , and Clara became attentive at once ; but she had hardly heard two lines , as the singer continued , when a strange trembling seized her , as if she were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague , and throwing her arms round Dorothea she said : `` Ah , dear lady of my soul and life ! 
why did you wake me ? 
The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician . '' 
`` What art thou talking about , child ? '' 
said Dorothea . 
`` Why , they say this singer is a muleteer ! '' 
`` Nay , he is the lord of many places , '' replied Clara , `` and that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him , unless he be willing to surrender it . '' 
Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl , for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of , so she said to her : `` You speak in such a way that I can not understand you , Senora Clara ; explain yourself more clearly , and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you ? 
But do not tell me anything now ; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports , for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air . '' 
`` Let him , in Heaven 's name , '' returned Clara ; and not to hear him she stopped both ears with her hands , at which Dorothea was again surprised ; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this fashion : Sweet Hope , my stay , That onward to the goal of thy intent Dost make thy way , Heedless of hindrance or impediment , Have thou no fear If at each step thou findest death is near . 
No victory , No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know ; Unblest is he That a bold front to Fortune dares not show , But soul and sense In bondage yieldeth up to indolence . 
If Love his wares Do dearly sell , his right must be contest ; What gold compares With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest ? 
And all men know What costeth little that we rate but low . 
Love resolute Knows not the word `` impossibility ; '' And though my suit Beset by endless obstacles I see , Yet no despair Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there . 
Here the voice ceased and Clara 's sobs began afresh , all which excited Dorothea 's curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet and weeping so bitter , so she again asked her what it was she was going to say before . 
On this Clara , afraid that Luscinda might overhear her , winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else , and said : `` This singer , dear senora , is the son of a gentleman of Aragon , lord of two villages , who lives opposite my father 's house at Madrid ; and though my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter , and lattice-work in summer , in some way -- I know not how -- this gentleman , who was pursuing his studies , saw me , whether in church or elsewhere , I can not tell , and , in fact , fell in love with me , and gave me to know it from the windows of his house , with so many signs and tears that I was forced to believe him , and even to love him , without knowing what it was he wanted of me . 
One of the signs he used to make me was to link one hand in the other , to show me he wished to marry me ; and though I should have been glad if that could be , being alone and motherless I knew not whom to open my mind to , and so I left it as it was , showing him no favour , except when my father , and his too , were from home , to raise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly , at which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad . 
Meanwhile the time for my father 's departure arrived , which he became aware of , but not from me , for I had never been able to tell him of it . 
He fell sick , of grief I believe , and so the day we were going away I could not see him to take farewell of him , were it only with the eyes . 
But after we had been two days on the road , on entering the posada of a village a day 's journey from this , I saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer , and so well disguised , that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible for me to recognise him . 
But I knew him , and I was surprised , and glad ; he watched me , unsuspected by my father , from whom he always hides himself when he crosses my path on the road , or in the posadas where we halt ; and , as I know what he is , and reflect that for love of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship , I am ready to die of sorrow ; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes . 
I know not with what object he has come ; or how he could have got away from his father , who loves him beyond measure , having no other heir , and because he deserves it , as you will perceive when you see him . 
And moreover , I can tell you , all that he sings is out of his own head ; for I have heard them say he is a great scholar and poet ; and what is more , every time I see him or hear him sing I tremble all over , and am terrified lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our loves . 
I have never spoken a word to him in my life ; and for all that I love him so that I could not live without him . 
This , dear senora , is all I have to tell you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much ; and from it alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer , but a lord of hearts and towns , as I told you already . '' 
`` Say no more , Dona Clara , '' said Dorothea at this , at the same time kissing her a thousand times over , `` say no more , I tell you , but wait till day comes ; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so that it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves . '' 
`` Ah , senora , '' said Dona Clara , `` what end can be hoped for when his father is of such lofty position , and so wealthy , that he would think I was not fit to be even a servant to his son , much less wife ? 
And as to marrying without the knowledge of my father , I would not do it for all the world . 
I would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and leave me ; perhaps with not seeing him , and the long distance we shall have to travel , the pain I suffer now may become easier ; though I daresay the remedy I propose will do me very little good . 
I do n't know how the devil this has come about , or how this love I have for him got in ; I such a young girl , and he such a mere boy ; for I verily believe we are both of an age , and I am not sixteen yet ; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day , next , my father says . '' 
Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Dona Clara spoke . 
`` Let us go to sleep now , senora , '' said she , `` for the little of the night that I fancy is left to us : God will soon send us daylight , and we will set all to rights , or it will go hard with me . '' 
With this they fell asleep , and deep silence reigned all through the inn . 
The only persons not asleep were the landlady 's daughter and her servant Maritornes , who , knowing the weak point of Don Quixote 's humour , and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback , resolved , the pair of them , to play some trick upon him , or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense . 
As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to throw out the straw . 
At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves , and observed Don Quixote on his horse , leaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs , that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with each of them ; and they could hear him , too , saying in a soft , tender , loving tone , `` Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso , perfection of all beauty , summit and crown of discretion , treasure house of grace , depositary of virtue , and finally , ideal of all that is good , honourable , and delectable in this world ! 
What is thy grace doing now ? 
Art thou , perchance , mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath exposed himself to so great perils , and all to serve thee ? 
Give me tidings of her , oh luminary of the three faces ! 
Perhaps at this moment , envious of hers , thou art regarding her , either as she paces to and fro some gallery of her sumptuous palaces , or leans over some balcony , meditating how , whilst preserving her purity and greatness , she may mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake , what glory should recompense my sufferings , what repose my toil , and lastly what death my life , and what reward my services ? 
And thou , oh sun , that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise betimes and come forth to see my lady ; when thou seest her I entreat of thee to salute her on my behalf : but have a care , when thou shalt see her and salute her , that thou kiss not her face ; for I shall be more jealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly , or on the banks of the Peneus -LRB- for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion -RRB- in thy jealousy and love . '' 
Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady 's daughter began to signal to him , saying , `` Senor , come over here , please . '' 
At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the light of the moon , which then was in its full splendour , that some one was calling to him from the hole in the wall , which seemed to him to be a window , and what is more , with a gilt grating , as rich castles , such as he believed the inn to be , ought to have ; and it immediately suggested itself to his imagination that , as on the former occasion , the fair damsel , the daughter of the lady of the castle , overcome by love for him , was once more endeavouring to win his affections ; and with this idea , not to show himself discourteous , or ungrateful , he turned Rocinante 's head and approached the hole , and as he perceived the two wenches he said : `` I pity you , beauteous lady , that you should have directed your thoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth , for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable of submission to any other than her whom , the first moment his eyes beheld her , he made absolute mistress of his soul . 
Forgive me , noble lady , and retire to your apartment , and do not , by any further declaration of your passion , compel me to show myself more ungrateful ; and if , of the love you bear me , you should find that there is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you , provided it be not love itself , demand it of me ; for I swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant , though it be that you require of me a lock of Medusa 's hair , which was all snakes , or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial . '' 
`` My mistress wants nothing of that sort , sir knight , '' said Maritornes at this . 
`` What then , discreet dame , is it that your mistress wants ? '' 
replied Don Quixote . 
`` Only one of your fair hands , '' said Maritornes , `` to enable her to vent over it the great passion which has brought her to this loophole , so much to the risk of her honour ; for if the lord her father had heard her , the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear . '' 
`` I should like to see that tried , '' said Don Quixote ; `` but he had better beware of that , if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of a love-stricken daughter . '' 
Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had asked , and making up her mind what to do , she got down from the hole and went into the stable , where she took the halter of Sancho Panza 's ass , and in all haste returned to the hole , just as Don Quixote had planted himself standing on Rocinante 's saddle in order to reach the grated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be ; and giving her his hand , he said , `` Lady , take this hand , or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of the earth ; take , I say , this hand which no other hand of woman has ever touched , not even hers who has complete possession of my entire body . 
I present it to you , not that you may kiss it , but that you may observe the contexture of the sinews , the close network of the muscles , the breadth and capacity of the veins , whence you may infer what must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand . '' 
`` That we shall see presently , '' said Maritornes , and making a running knot on the halter , she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft . 
Don Quixote , feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist , exclaimed , `` Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand ; treat it not so harshly , for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has given you , nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part ; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so cruelly . '' 
But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote 's , for as soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off , ready to die with laughing , leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossible for him to release himself . 
He was , as has been said , standing on Rocinante , with his arm passed through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door , and in mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to stir one side or the other ; so he did not dare to make the least movement , although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of Rocinante , he had good reason to expect that he would stand without budging for a whole century . 
Finding himself fast , then , and that the ladies had retired , he began to fancy that all this was done by enchantment , as on the former occasion when in that same castle that enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him ; and he cursed in his heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle again , after having come off so badly the first time ; it being a settled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure , and have not succeeded in it , it is a sign that it is not reserved for them but for others , and that therefore they need not try it again . 
Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself , but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in vain . 
It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move , but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle , he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off . 
Then it was he wished for the sword of Amadis , against which no enchantment whatever had any power ; then he cursed his ill fortune ; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted , for that he believed he was beyond all doubt ; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso ; then he called to his worthy squire Sancho Panza , who , buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass , was oblivious , at that moment , of the mother that bore him ; then he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid ; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to succour him ; and then , at last , morning found him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull , for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering , which he believed would last for ever , inasmuch as he was enchanted ; and of this he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred , much or little , and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in this state , without eating or drinking or sleeping , until the malign influence of the stars was overpast , or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant him . 
But he was very much deceived in this conclusion , for daylight had hardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback , well equipped and accoutred , with firelocks across their saddle-bows . 
They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn , which was still shut ; on seeing which , Don Quixote , even there where he was , did not forget to act as sentinel , and said in a loud and imperious tone , `` Knights , or squires , or whatever ye be , ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle ; for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep , or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress until the sun 's rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth . 
Withdraw to a distance , and wait till it is broad daylight , and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you . '' 
`` What the devil fortress or castle is this , '' said one , `` to make us stand on such ceremony ? 
If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us ; we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on , for we are in haste . '' 
`` Do you think , gentlemen , that I look like an innkeeper ? '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` I do n't know what you look like , '' replied the other ; `` but I know that you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle . '' 
`` A castle it is , '' returned Don Quixote , `` nay , more , one of the best in this whole province , and it has within it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the crown on the head . '' 
`` It would be better if it were the other way , '' said the traveller , `` the sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand ; but if so , may be there is within some company of players , with whom it is a common thing to have those crowns and sceptres you speak of ; for in such a small inn as this , and where such silence is kept , I do not believe any people entitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters . '' 
`` You know but little of the world , '' returned Don Quixote , `` since you are ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry . '' 
But the comrades of the spokesman , growing weary of the dialogue with Don Quixote , renewed their knocks with great vehemence , so much so that the host , and not only he but everybody in the inn , awoke , and he got up to ask who knocked . 
It happened at this moment that one of the horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante , who melancholy , dejected , and with drooping ears stood motionless , supporting his sorely stretched master ; and as he was , after all , flesh , though he looked as if he were made of wood , he could not help giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him attentions . 
But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his footing ; and slipping off the saddle , he would have come to the ground , but for being suspended by the arm , which caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off ; and he hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet , which was all the worse for him ; for , finding how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly , he struggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing ; just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado , when they are fixed at `` touch and no touch , '' who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch themselves , deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground . 
So loud , in fact , were the shouts of Don Quixote , that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste , came out in dismay , and ran to see who was uttering such cries , and those who were outside joined him . 
Maritornes , who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry , suspecting what it was , ran to the loft and , without anyone seeing her , untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended , and down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers , who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so . 
He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist , and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante , braced his buckler on his arm , put his lance in rest , and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming : `` Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause , provided my lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so , I give him the lie , challenge him and defy him to single combat . '' 
The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote ; but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was , and not to mind him as he was out of his senses . 
They then asked the landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn , one dressed like a muleteer , and of such and such an appearance , describing that of Dona Clara 's lover . 
The landlord replied that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for ; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come , said , `` He is here no doubt , for this is the coach he is following : let one of us stay at the gate , and the rest go in to look for him ; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn , lest he should escape over the wall of the yard . '' 
`` So be it , '' said another ; and while two of them went in , one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn ; observing all which , the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions , though he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given him . 
It was by this time broad daylight ; and for that reason , as well as in consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made , everybody was awake and up , but particularly Dona Clara and Dorothea ; for they had been able to sleep but badly that night , the one from agitation at having her lover so near her , the other from curiosity to see him . 
Don Quixote , when he saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge , was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath ; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise , when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged , he would have attacked the whole of them , and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves . 
But considering that it would not become him , nor be right , to begin any new emprise until he had established Micomicona in her kingdom , he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers ; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer , without a thought of anyone coming in search of him , much less finding him . 
The man laid hold of him by the arm , saying , `` It becomes you well indeed , Senor Don Luis , to be in the dress you wear , and well the bed in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you . '' 
The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held him , but presently recognised him as one of his father 's servants , at which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word ; while the servant went on to say , `` There is nothing for it now , Senor Don Luis , but to submit quietly and return home , unless it is your wish that my lord , your father , should take his departure for the other world , for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence . '' 
`` But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress ? '' 
said Don Luis . 
`` It was a student to whom you confided your intentions , '' answered the servant , `` that disclosed them , touched with pity at the distress he saw your father suffer on missing you ; he therefore despatched four of his servants in quest of you , and here we all are at your service , better pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you . '' 
`` That shall be as I please , or as heaven orders , '' returned Don Luis . 
`` What can you please or heaven order , '' said the other , `` except to agree to go back ? 
Anything else is impossible . '' 
All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at whose side Don Luis lay , and rising , he went to report what had taken place to Don Fernando , Cardenio , and the others , who had by this time dressed themselves ; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as `` Don , '' and what words had passed , and how he wanted him to return to his father , which the youth was unwilling to do . 
With this , and what they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him , they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was , and even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him ; so they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant . 
Dorothea at this instant came out of her room , followed by Dona Clara all in a tremor ; and calling Cardenio aside , she told him in a few words the story of the musician and Dona Clara , and he at the same time told her what had happened , how his father 's servants had come in search of him ; but in telling her so , he did not speak low enough but that Dona Clara heard what he said , at which she was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground . 
Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room , as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right , and they did as he desired . 
All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him , urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment 's delay . 
He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life , honour , and heart were at stake . 
The servants pressed him , saying that most certainly they would not return without him , and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not . 
`` You shall not do that , '' replied Don Luis , `` unless you take me dead ; though however you take me , it will be without life . '' 
By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute , but particularly Cardenio , Don Fernando , his companions , the Judge , the curate , the barber , and Don Quixote ; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer . 
Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man 's story , asked the men who wanted to take him away , what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will . 
`` Our object , '' said one of the four , `` is to save the life of his father , who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman 's disappearance . '' 
Upon this Don Luis exclaimed , `` There is no need to make my affairs public here ; I am free , and I will return if I please ; and if not , none of you shall compel me . '' 
`` Reason will compel your worship , '' said the man , `` and if it has no power over you , it has power over us , to make us do what we came for , and what it is our duty to do . '' 
`` Let us hear what the whole affair is about , '' said the Judge at this ; but the man , who knew him as a neighbour of theirs , replied , `` Do you not know this gentleman , Senor Judge ? 
He is the son of your neighbour , who has run away from his father 's house in a dress so unbecoming his rank , as your worship may perceive . '' 
The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him , and embracing him said , `` What folly is this , Senor Don Luis , or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way , and in this dress , which so ill becomes your condition ? '' 
Tears came into the eyes of the young man , and he was unable to utter a word in reply to the Judge , who told the four servants not to be uneasy , for all would be satisfactorily settled ; and then taking Don Luis by the hand , he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there . 
But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn , the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the night there , seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four men wanted , had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed ; but the landlord , who minded his own affairs more than other people 's , caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning , abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them to reply with their fists , and so they began to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry out , and call for help . 
The landlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don Quixote , and to him the daughter said , `` Sir knight , by the virtue God has given you , help my poor father , for two wicked men are beating him to a mummy . '' 
To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied , `` Fair damsel , at the present moment your request is inopportune , for I am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me ; but that which I can do for you is what I will now mention : run and tell your father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle , and on no account to allow himself to be vanquished , while I go and request permission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress ; and if she grants it , rest assured I will relieve him from it . '' 
`` Sinner that I am , '' exclaimed Maritornes , who stood by ; `` before you have got your permission my master will be in the other world . '' 
`` Give me leave , senora , to obtain the permission I speak of , '' returned Don Quixote ; `` and if I get it , it will matter very little if he is in the other world ; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world can do ; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately satisfied ; '' and without saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea , requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle , who now stood in grievous jeopardy . 
The princess granted it graciously , and he at once , bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword , hastened to the inn-gate , where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly ; but as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still , though Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband . 
`` I hesitate , '' said Don Quixote , `` because it is not lawful for me to draw sword against persons of squirely condition ; but call my squire Sancho to me ; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business . '' 
Thus matters stood at the inn-gate , where there was a very lively exchange of fisticuffs and punches , to the sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath of Maritornes , the landlady , and her daughter , who were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote , and the hard treatment their master , husband and father was undergoing . 
But let us leave him there ; for he will surely find some one to help him , and if not , let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his strength allows him to do ; and let us go back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him privately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed . 
To which the youth , pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was troubled by some great sorrow , and shedding a flood of tears , made answer : `` Senor , I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when , through heaven 's will and our being near neighbours , I first saw Dona Clara , your daughter and my lady , from that instant I made her the mistress of my will , and if yours , my true lord and father , offers no impediment , this very day she shall become my wife . 
For her I left my father 's house , and for her I assumed this disguise , to follow her whithersoever she may go , as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star . 
She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were filled with tears . 
You know already , senor , the wealth and noble birth of my parents , and that I am their sole heir ; if this be a sufficient inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy , accept me at once as your son ; for if my father , influenced by other objects of his own , should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself , time has more power to alter and change things , than human will . '' 
With this the love-smitten youth was silent , while the Judge , after hearing him , was astonished , perplexed , and surprised , as well at the manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of his heart , as at the position in which he found himself , not knowing what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected . 
All the answer , therefore , he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for the present , and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day , so that there might be time to consider what was best for all parties . 
Don Luis kissed his hands by force , nay , bathed them with his tears , in a way that would have touched a heart of marble , not to say that of the Judge , who , as a shrewd man , had already perceived how advantageous the marriage would be to his daughter ; though , were it possible , he would have preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father of Don Luis , who he knew looked for a title for his son . 
The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord , for , by persuasion and Don Quixote 's fair words more than by threats , they had paid him what he demanded , and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master 's decision , when the devil , who never sleeps , contrived that the barber , from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino 's helmet , and Sancho Panza the trappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own , should at this instant enter the inn ; which said barber , as he led his ass to the stable , observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the pack-saddle ; and the moment he saw it he knew it , and made bold to attack Sancho , exclaiming , `` Ho , sir thief , I have caught you ! 
hand over my basin and my pack-saddle , and all my trappings that you robbed me of . '' 
Sancho , finding himself so unexpectedly assailed , and hearing the abuse poured upon him , seized the pack-saddle with one hand , and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood . 
The barber , however , was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the pack-saddle ; on the contrary , he raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant . 
`` Here , in the name of the king and justice ! '' 
he cried , `` this thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my property . '' 
`` You lie , '' said Sancho , `` I am no highwayman ; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these spoils . '' 
Don Quixote was standing by at the time , highly pleased to see his squire 's stoutness , both offensive and defensive , and from that time forth he reckoned him a man of mettle , and in his heart resolved to dub him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself , feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him . 
In the course of the altercation , among other things the barber said , `` Gentlemen , this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death , and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it , and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie ; only try it , and if it does not fit him like a glove , call me a rascal ; and what is more , the same day I was robbed of this , they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin , never yet handselled , that would fetch a crown any day . '' 
At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering ; and interposing between the two , and separating them , he placed the pack-saddle on the ground , to lie there in sight until the truth was established , and said , `` Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was , is , and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in fair war , and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession . 
With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself ; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon 's steed , and with it adorn his own ; I allowed him , and he took it ; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle , I can give no explanation except the usual one , that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry . 
To confirm all which , run , Sancho my son , and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin . '' 
`` Egad , master , '' said Sancho , `` if we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward , Mambrino 's helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow 's caparison is a pack-saddle . '' 
`` Do as I bid thee , '' said Don Quixote ; `` it can not be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment . '' 
Sancho hastened to where the basin was , and brought it back with him , and when Don Quixote saw it , he took hold of it and said : `` Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of ; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess , that this helmet is the identical one I took from him , without anything added to or taken from it . '' 
`` There is no doubt of that , '' said Sancho , `` for from the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it , when he let loose those unlucky men in chains ; and if had not been for this basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time , for there was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair . '' 
`` What do you think now , gentlemen , '' said the barber , `` of what these gentles say , when they want to make out that this is a helmet ? '' 
`` And whoever says the contrary , '' said Don Quixote , `` I will let him know he lies if he is a knight , and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times . '' 
Our own barber , who was present at all this , and understood Don Quixote 's humour so thoroughly , took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement ; so addressing the other barber he said : `` Senor barber , or whatever you are , you must know that I belong to your profession too , and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years , and I know the implements of the barber craft , every one of them , perfectly well ; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth , and I know also what a helmet is , and a morion , and a headpiece with a visor , and other things pertaining to soldiering , I meant to say to soldiers ' arms ; and I say-saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments -- that this piece we have now before us , which this worthy gentleman has in his hands , not only is no barber 's basin , but is as far from being one as white is from black , and truth from falsehood ; I say , moreover , that this , although it is a helmet , is not a complete helmet . '' 
`` Certainly not , '' said Don Quixote , `` for half of it is wanting , that is to say the beaver . '' 
`` It is quite true , '' said the curate , who saw the object of his friend the barber ; and Cardenio , Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him , and even the Judge , if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis 's affair , would have helped to carry on the joke ; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings . 
`` God bless me ! '' 
exclaimed their butt the barber at this ; `` is it possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a helmet ? 
Why , this is a thing that would astonish a whole university , however wise it might be ! 
That will do ; if this basin is a helmet , why , then the pack-saddle must be a horse 's caparison , as this gentleman has said . '' 
`` To me it looks like a pack-saddle , '' said Don Quixote ; `` but I have already said that with that question I do not concern myself . '' 
`` As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison , '' said the curate , `` it is only for Senor Don Quixote to say ; for in these matters of chivalry all these gentlemen and I bow to his authority . '' 
`` By God , gentlemen , '' said Don Quixote , `` so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it , that I will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains ; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment . 
The first time , an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble , nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his ; and last night I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours , without knowing how or why I came by such a mishap . 
So that now , for me to come forward to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter , would be to risk a rash decision . 
As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have already given an answer ; but as to the question whether this is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion , but will leave it to your worships ' better judgment . 
Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself , the enchantments of this place have nothing to do with you , and your faculties are unfettered , and you can see things in this castle as they really and truly are , and not as they appear to me . '' 
`` There can be no question , '' said Don Fernando on this , `` but that Senor Don Quixote has spoken very wisely , and that with us rests the decision of this matter ; and that we may have surer ground to go on , I will take the votes of the gentlemen in secret , and declare the result clearly and fully . '' 
To those who were in the secret of Don Quixote 's humour all this afforded great amusement ; but to those who knew nothing about it , it seemed the greatest nonsense in the world , in particular to the four servants of Don Luis , as well as to Don Luis himself , and to three other travellers who had by chance come to the inn , and had the appearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood , as indeed they were ; but the one who above all was at his wits ' end , was the barber whose basin , there before his very eyes , had been turned into Mambrino 's helmet , and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse . 
All laughed to see Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes , and whispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison ; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote , he said aloud , `` The fact is , my good fellow , that I am tired collecting such a number of opinions , for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I desire to know , who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this is the pack-saddle of an ass , and not the caparison of a horse , nay , of a thoroughbred horse ; so you must submit , for , in spite of you and your ass , this is a caparison and no pack-saddle , and you have stated and proved your case very badly . '' 
`` May I never share heaven , '' said the poor barber , `` if your worships are not all mistaken ; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to me a pack-saddle and not a caparison ; but , ` laws go , ' - I say no more ; and indeed I am not drunk , for I am fasting , except it be from sin . '' 
The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the absurdities of Don Quixote , who now observed : `` There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to him , and to whom God has given it , may St. Peter add his blessing . '' 
But said one of the four servants , `` Unless , indeed , this is a deliberate joke , I can not bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those present are , or seem to be , can venture to declare and assert that this is not a basin , and that not a pack-saddle ; but as I perceive that they do assert and declare it , I can only come to the conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself ; for I swear by '' -- and here he rapped out a round oath - `` all the people in the world will not make me believe that this is not a barber 's basin and that a jackass 's pack-saddle . '' 
`` It might easily be a she-ass 's , '' observed the curate . 
`` It is all the same , '' said the servant ; `` that is not the point ; but whether it is or is not a pack-saddle , as your worships say . '' 
On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood , who had been listening to the dispute and controversy , unable to restrain his anger and impatience , exclaimed , `` It is a pack-saddle as sure as my father is my father , and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk . '' 
`` You lie like a rascally clown , '' returned Don Quixote ; and lifting his pike , which he had never let out of his hand , he delivered such a blow at his head that , had not the officer dodged it , it would have stretched him at full length . 
The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground , and the rest of the officers , seeing their comrade assaulted , raised a shout , calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood . 
The landlord , who was of the fraternity , ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword , and ranged himself on the side of his comrades ; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him , lest he should escape from them in the confusion ; the barber , seeing the house turned upside down , once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the same ; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers ; Don Luis cried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don Quixote , and Cardenio and Don Fernando , who were supporting him ; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice , the landlady was screaming , her daughter was wailing , Maritornes was weeping , Dorothea was aghast , Luscinda terror-stricken , and Dona Clara in a faint . 
The barber cudgelled Sancho , and Sancho pommelled the barber ; Don Luis gave one of his servants , who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him from escaping , a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood ; the Judge took his part ; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouring him heartily ; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood ; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries , shouts , shrieks , confusion , terror , dismay , mishaps , sword-cuts , fisticuffs , cudgellings , kicks , and bloodshed ; and in the midst of all this chaos , complication , and general entanglement , Don Quixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante 's camp ; and , in a voice that shook the inn like thunder , he cried out : `` Hold all , let all sheathe their swords , let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives ! '' 
All paused at his mighty voice , and he went on to say , `` Did I not tell you , sirs , that this castle was enchanted , and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it ? 
In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your own eyes how the discord of Agramante 's camp has come hither , and been transferred into the midst of us . 
See how they fight , there for the sword , here for the horse , on that side for the eagle , on this for the helmet ; we are all fighting , and all at cross purposes . 
Come then , you , Senor Judge , and you , senor curate ; let the one represent King Agramante and the other King Sobrino , and make peace among us ; for by God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another for such trifling cause . '' 
The officers , who did not understand Don Quixote 's mode of speaking , and found themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando , Cardenio , and their companions , were not to be appeased ; the barber was , however , for both his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle ; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master ; while the four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so . 
The landlord alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman , who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn ; but at length the uproar was stilled for the present ; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment , and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote 's imagination . 
All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the Judge and the curate , the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him to return with them at once ; and while he was discussing the matter with them , the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando , Cardenio , and the curate as to what he ought to do in the case , telling them how it stood , and what Don Luis had said to him . 
It was agreed at length that Don Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was , and that it was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia , where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to ; for , otherwise , it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at present , though they tore him to pieces . 
On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father how matters stood , and that the other should remain to wait upon Don Luis , and not leave him until they came back for him , or his father 's orders were known . 
Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged ; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace , feeling himself slighted and made a fool of , and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement , resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances . 
It came about in this wise : the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged , and withdrew from the contest , considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle ; but one of them , the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando , recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents , he had one against Don Quixote , whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free , as Sancho had , with very good reason , apprehended . 
Suspecting how it was , then , he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote 's features corresponded ; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of , and setting himself to read it deliberately , for he was not a quick reader , as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote , and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face , and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it . 
As soon as he had satisfied himself , folding up the parchment , he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe , and shouted aloud , `` Help for the Holy Brotherhood ! 
and that you may see I demand it in earnest , read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested . '' 
The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true , and that it agreed with Don Quixote 's appearance , who , on his part , when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown , worked up to the highest pitch of wrath , and all his joints cracking with rage , with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might , so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold . 
The landlord , who had perforce to support his brother officers , ran at once to aid them . 
The landlady , when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh quarrel , lifted up her voice afresh , and its note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter , calling upon heaven and all present for help ; and Sancho , seeing what was going on , exclaimed , `` By the Lord , it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle , for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it ! '' 
Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote , and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held , the one the coat collar , the other the throat of his adversary ; for all this , however , the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help , and deliver him over bound into their power , as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood , on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways . 
Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words , and said very calmly , `` Come now , base , ill-born brood ; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage , to release the captives , to succour the miserable , to raise up the fallen , to relieve the needy ? 
Infamous beings , who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry , or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow , not to say the presence , of any knight-errant ! 
Come now ; band , not of officers , but of thieves ; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood ; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am ? 
Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions , that their law is their sword , their charter their prowess , and their edicts their will ? 
Who , I say again , was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight , and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry ? 
What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax , duty , queen 's pin-money , king 's dues , toll or ferry ? 
What tailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes ? 
What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot ? 
What king did not seat him at his table ? 
What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure ? 
And , lastly , what knight-errant has there been , is there , or will there ever be in the world , not bold enough to give , single-handed , four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way ? '' 
While Don Quixote was talking in this strain , the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses , as they might perceive by his deeds and his words , and that they need not press the matter any further , for even if they arrested him and carried him off , they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman ; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote 's madness , but only to execute his superior 's orders , and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked . 
`` For all that , '' said the curate , `` you must not take him away this time , nor will he , it is my opinion , let himself be taken away . '' 
In short , the curate used such arguments , and Don Quixote did such mad things , that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits , and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified , and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza , who still continued their altercation with much bitterness . 
In the end they , as officers of justice , settled the question by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were , if not perfectly contented , at least to some extent satisfied ; for they changed the pack-saddles , but not the girths or head-stalls ; and as to Mambrino 's helmet , the curate , under the rose and without Don Quixote 's knowing it , paid eight reals for the basin , and the barber executed a full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore , amen . 
These two disputes , which were the most important and gravest , being settled , it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him ; and good luck and better fortune , having already begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn , were pleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue ; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished ; which gave Dona Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her face just then without seeing the joy of her heart . 
Zoraida , though she did not fully comprehend all she saw , was grave or gay without knowing why , as she watched and studied the various countenances , but particularly her Spaniard 's , whom she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul . 
The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord 's notice , and he demanded Don Quixote 's reckoning , together with the amount of the damage to his wine-skins , and the loss of his wine , swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho 's ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing . 
The curate settled all amicably , and Don Fernando paid ; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score ; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante 's camp , as Don Quixote said , but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus : for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate , and to the unexampled generosity of Don Fernando . 
Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels , his squire 's as well as his own , Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue the journey he had begun , and bring to a close that great adventure for which he had been called and chosen ; and with this high resolve he went and knelt before Dorothea , who , however , would not allow him to utter a word until he had risen ; so to obey her he rose , and said , `` It is a common proverb , fair lady , that ` diligence is the mother of good fortune , ' and experience has often shown in important affairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful termination ; but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than in war , where quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy , and win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself . 
All this I say , exalted and esteemed lady , because it seems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is useless , and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out some day ; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him , and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold , against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little ? 
Therefore , lady , let us , as I say , forestall his schemes by our activity , and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune ; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary . '' 
Don Quixote held his peace and said no more , calmly awaiting the reply of the beauteous princess , who , with commanding dignity and in a style adapted to Don Quixote 's own , replied to him in these words , `` I give you thanks , sir knight , for the eagerness you , like a good knight to whom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy , display to afford me aid in my sore trouble ; and heaven grant that your wishes and mine may be realised , so that you may see that there are women in this world capable of gratitude ; as to my departure , let it be forthwith , for I have no will but yours ; dispose of me entirely in accordance with your good pleasure ; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her person , and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions , must not think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain . '' 
`` On , then , in God 's name , '' said Don Quixote ; `` for , when a lady humbles herself to me , I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and placing her on the throne of her ancestors . 
Let us depart at once , for the common saying that in delay there is danger , lends spurs to my eagerness to take the road ; and as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any that can daunt or intimidate me , saddle Rocinante , Sancho , and get ready thy ass and the queen 's palfrey , and let us take leave of the castellan and these gentlemen , and go hence this very instant . '' 
Sancho , who was standing by all the time , said , shaking his head , `` Ah ! 
master , master , there is more mischief in the village than one hears of , begging all good bodies ' pardon . '' 
`` What mischief can there be in any village , or in all the cities of the world , you booby , that can hurt my reputation ? '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` If your worship is angry , '' replied Sancho , `` I will hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say , and what a good servant should tell his master . '' 
`` Say what thou wilt , '' returned Don Quixote , `` provided thy words be not meant to work upon my fears ; for thou , if thou fearest , art behaving like thyself ; but I like myself , in not fearing . '' 
`` It is nothing of the sort , as I am a sinner before God , '' said Sancho , `` but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady , who calls herself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon , is no more so than my mother ; for , if she was what she says , she would not go rubbing noses with one that is here every instant and behind every door . '' 
Dorothea turned red at Sancho 's words , for the truth was that her husband Don Fernando had now and then , when the others were not looking , gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned , and Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom ; she , however , being unable or not caring to answer him , allowed him to proceed , and he continued , `` This I say , senor , because , if after we have travelled roads and highways , and passed bad nights and worse days , one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours , there is no need for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante , put the pad on the ass , or get ready the palfrey ; for it will be better for us to stay quiet , and let every jade mind her spinning , and let us go to dinner . '' 
Good God , what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the audacious words of his squire ! 
So great was it , that in a voice inarticulate with rage , with a stammering tongue , and eyes that flashed living fire , he exclaimed , `` Rascally clown , boorish , insolent , and ignorant , ill-spoken , foul-mouthed , impudent backbiter and slanderer ! 
Hast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these illustrious ladies ? 
Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless thoughts in thy muddled imagination ? 
Begone from my presence , thou born monster , storehouse of lies , hoard of untruths , garner of knaveries , inventor of scandals , publisher of absurdities , enemy of the respect due to royal personages ! 
Begone , show thyself no more before me under pain of my wrath ; '' and so saying he knitted his brows , puffed out his cheeks , gazed around him , and stamped on the ground violently with his right foot , showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart ; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and terrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed him , and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the angry presence of his master . 
But the ready-witted Dorothea , who by this time so well understood Don Quixote 's humour , said , to mollify his wrath , `` Be not irritated at the absurdities your good squire has uttered , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , for perhaps he did not utter them without cause , and from his good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would bear false witness against anyone . 
We may therefore believe , without any hesitation , that since , as you say , sir knight , everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment , Sancho , I say , may possibly have seen , through this diabolical medium , what he says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty . '' 
`` I swear by God Omnipotent , '' exclaimed Don Quixote at this , `` your highness has hit the point ; and that some vile illusion must have come before this sinner of a Sancho , that made him see what it would have been impossible to see by any other means than enchantments ; for I know well enough , from the poor fellow 's goodness and harmlessness , that he is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody . '' 
`` True , no doubt , '' said Don Fernando , `` for which reason , Senor Don Quixote , you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your favour , sicut erat in principio , before illusions of this sort had taken away his senses . '' 
Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him , and the curate went for Sancho , who came in very humbly , and falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master , who having presented it to him and allowed him to kiss it , gave him his blessing and said , `` Now , Sancho my son , thou wilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee , that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment . '' 
`` So it is , I believe , '' said Sancho , `` except the affair of the blanket , which came to pass in reality by ordinary means . '' 
`` Believe it not , '' said Don Quixote , `` for had it been so , I would have avenged thee that instant , or even now ; but neither then nor now could I , nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong . '' 
They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was , and the landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho 's flights , at which they laughed not a little , and at which Sancho would have been no less out of countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all enchantment . 
For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch that he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth , without any deception whatever about it , that he had been blanketed by beings of flesh and blood , and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms , as his master believed and protested . 
The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn ; and as it seemed to them time to depart , they devised a plan so that , without giving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don Quixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona , the curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they proposed , and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home ; and in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after this fashion . 
They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars , large enough to hold Don Quixote comfortably ; and then Don Fernando and his companions , the servants of Don Luis , and the officers of the Brotherhood , together with the landlord , by the directions and advice of the curate , covered their faces and disguised themselves , some in one way , some in another , so as to appear to Don Quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in the castle . 
This done , in profound silence they entered the room where he was asleep , taking his rest after the past frays , and advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly , not dreaming of anything of the kind happening , they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot , so that , when he awoke startled , he was unable to move , and could only marvel and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him ; upon which he at once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him , and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted castle , and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he could neither move nor help himself ; precisely what the curate , the concoctor of the scheme , expected would happen . 
Of all that were there Sancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own proper character , and he , though he was within very little of sharing his master 's infirmity , did not fail to perceive who all these disguised figures were ; but he did not dare to open his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of his master ; nor did the latter utter a word , waiting to the upshot of his mishap ; which was that bringing in the cage , they shut him up in it and nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open . 
They then took him on their shoulders , and as they passed out of the room an awful voice -- as much so as the barber , not he of the pack-saddle but the other , was able to make it -- was heard to say , `` O Knight of the Rueful Countenance , let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict thee , for this must needs be , for the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee ; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together , having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony . 
And from this marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father ; and this shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs . 
And thou , O most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side , beard on face , or nose to smell with , be not dismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes ; for soon , if it so please the Framer of the universe , thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself , and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false ; and I assure thee , on the authority of the sage Mentironiana , that thy wages shall be paid thee , as thou shalt see in due season . 
Follow then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight , for it is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you ; and as it is not permitted to me to say more , God be with thee ; for I return to that place I wot of ; '' and as he brought the prophecy to a close he raised his voice to a high pitch , and then lowered it to such a soft tone , that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what they heard seriously . 
Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard , for he at once comprehended its meaning perfectly , and perceived it was promised to him that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso , from whose blessed womb should proceed the whelps , his sons , to the eternal glory of La Mancha ; and being thoroughly and firmly persuaded of this , he lifted up his voice , and with a deep sigh exclaimed , `` Oh thou , whoever thou art , who hast foretold me so much good , I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests , that he leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying me away , ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me ; for , let this but come to pass , and I shall glory in the pains of my prison , find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me , and regard this bed whereon they stretch me , not as a hard battle-field , but as a soft and happy nuptial couch ; and touching the consolation of Sancho Panza , my squire , I rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil fortune ; for if , by his ill luck or mine , it may not happen to be in my power to give him the island I have promised , or any equivalent for it , at least his wages shall not be lost ; for in my will , which is already made , I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him , measured , not by his many faithful services , but by the means at my disposal . '' 
Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands , for , being tied together , he could not kiss one ; and then the apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart . 
When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way , he said , `` Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read ; but never yet have I read , seen , or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights-errant in this fashion , or at the slow pace that these lazy , sluggish animals promise ; for they always take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness , enveloped in a dark thick cloud , or on a chariot of fire , or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind ; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart ! 
By God , it puzzles me ! 
But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by ; and it may be , too , that as I am a new knight in the world , and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers , they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted . 
What thinkest thou of the matter , Sancho my son ? '' 
`` I do n't know what to think , '' answered Sancho , `` not being as well read as your worship in errant writings ; but for all that I venture to say and swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic . '' 
`` Catholic ! '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` Father of me ! 
how can they be Catholic when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do this , and bring me to this condition ? 
And if thou wouldst prove it , touch them , and feel them , and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air , and no consistency except in appearance . '' 
`` By God , master , '' returned Sancho , `` I have touched them already ; and that devil , that goes about there so busily , has firm flesh , and another property very different from what I have heard say devils have , for by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells ; but this one smells of amber half a league off . '' 
Sancho was here speaking of Don Fernando , who , like a gentleman of his rank , was very likely perfumed as Sancho said . 
`` Marvel not at that , Sancho my friend , '' said Don Quixote ; `` for let me tell thee devils are crafty ; and even if they do carry odours about with them , they themselves have no smell , because they are spirits ; or , if they have any smell , they can not smell of anything sweet , but of something foul and fetid ; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever they go , and can get no ease whatever from their torments , and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment , it is impossible that they can smell sweet ; if , then , this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber , either thou art deceiving thyself , or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil . '' 
Such was the conversation that passed between master and man ; and Don Fernando and Cardenio , apprehensive of Sancho 's making a complete discovery of their scheme , towards which he had already gone some way , resolved to hasten their departure , and calling the landlord aside , they directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho 's ass , which he did with great alacrity . 
In the meantime the curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far as his village , he paying them so much a day . 
Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante 's saddle and the basin on the other , and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante 's bridle , and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets ; but before the cart was put in motion , out came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell , pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune ; and to them Don Quixote said : `` Weep not , good ladies , for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession I profess ; and if these reverses did not befall me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant ; for such things never happen to knights of little renown and fame , because nobody in the world thinks about them ; to valiant knights they do , for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means . 
Nevertheless , virtue is of herself so mighty , that , in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster its first inventor knew , she will come victorious out of every trial , and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens . 
Forgive me , fair ladies , if , through inadvertence , I have in aught offended you ; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done so to any ; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanter has consigned me ; and should I find myself released therefrom , the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in memory by me , that I may acknowledge , recognise , and requite them as they deserve . '' 
While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote , the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and his companions , to the captain , his brother , and the ladies , now all made happy , and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda . 
They all embraced one another , and promised to let each other know how things went with them , and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him , to tell him what became of Don Quixote , assuring him that there was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it , and that he too , on his part , would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know , about his marriage , Zoraida 's baptism , Don Luis 's affair , and Luscinda 's return to her home . 
The curate promised to comply with his request carefully , and they embraced once more , and renewed their promises . 
The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers , saying he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of `` The Ill-advised Curiosity '' had been found , and that he might take them all away with him as their owner had not since returned ; for , as he could not read , he did not want them himself . 
The curate thanked him , and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words , `` Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo , '' by which he perceived that it was a novel , and as that of `` The Ill-advised Curiosity '' had been good he concluded this would be so too , as they were both probably by the same author ; so he kept it , intending to read it when he had an opportunity . 
He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same , both masked , so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote , and set out following in the rear of the cart . 
The order of march was this : first went the cart with the owner leading it ; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood , as has been said , with their muskets ; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass , leading Rocinante by the bridle ; and behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules , with faces covered , as aforesaid , and a grave and serious air , measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen . 
Don Quixote was seated in the cage , with his hands tied and his feet stretched out , leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh . 
Thus slowly and silently they made , it might be , two leagues , until they reached a valley which the carter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his oxen , and he said so to the curate , but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a little farther , as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by he knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the one where they proposed to halt ; and his advice was taken and they continued their journey . 
Just at that moment the curate , looking back , saw coming on behind them six or seven mounted men , well found and equipped , who soon overtook them , for they were travelling , not at the sluggish , deliberate pace of oxen , but like men who rode canons ' mules , and in haste to take their noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a league off . 
The quick travellers came up with the slow , and courteous salutations were exchanged ; and one of the new comers , who was , in fact , a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him , observing the regular order of the procession , the cart , the officers , Sancho , Rocinante , the curate and the barber , and above all Don Quixote caged and confined , could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man in that fashion ; though , from the badges of the officers , he already concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood . 
One of the officers to whom he had put the question , replied , `` Let the gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way , senor , for we do not know . '' 
Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said , `` Haply , gentlemen , you are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry ? 
Because if you are I will tell you my misfortunes ; if not , there is no good in my giving myself the trouble of relating them ; '' but here the curate and the barber , seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote , came forward , in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem from being discovered . 
The canon , replying to Don Quixote , said , `` In truth , brother , I know more about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando 's elements of logic ; so if that be all , you may safely tell me what you please . '' 
`` In God 's name , then , senor , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` if that be so , I would have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and fraud of wicked enchanters ; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked than loved by the good . 
I am a knight-errant , and not one of those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record , but of those who , in defiance and in spite of envy itself , and all the magicians that Persia , or Brahmans that India , or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced , will place their names in the temple of immortality , to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come , whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms . '' 
`` What Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha says , '' observed the curate , `` is the truth ; for he goes enchanted in this cart , not from any fault or sins of his , but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and valour hateful . 
This , senor , is the Knight of the Rueful Countenance , if you have ever heard him named , whose valiant achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble , notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to hide them . '' 
When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment , and could not make out what had befallen him ; and all his attendants were in the same state of amazement . 
At this point Sancho Panza , who had drawn near to hear the conversation , said , in order to make everything plain , `` Well , sirs , you may like or dislike what I am going to say , but the fact of the matter is , my master , Don Quixote , is just as much enchanted as my mother . 
He is in his full senses , he eats and he drinks , and he has his calls like other men and as he had yesterday , before they caged him . 
And if that 's the case , what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted ? 
For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people neither eat , nor sleep , nor talk ; and my master , if you do n't stop him , will talk more than thirty lawyers . '' 
Then turning to the curate he exclaimed , `` Ah , senor curate , senor curate ! 
do you think I do n't know you ? 
Do you think I do n't guess and see the drift of these new enchantments ? 
Well then , I can tell you I know you , for all your face is covered , and I can tell you I am up to you , however you may hide your tricks . 
After all , where envy reigns virtue can not live , and where there is niggardliness there can be no liberality . 
Ill betide the devil ! 
if it had not been for your worship my master would be married to the Princess Micomicona this minute , and I should be a count at least ; for no less was to be expected , as well from the goodness of my master , him of the Rueful Countenance , as from the greatness of my services . 
But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts , that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel , and that those who were up yesterday are down to-day . 
I am sorry for my wife and children , for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom , they will see him come back a horse-boy . 
I have said all this , senor curate , only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my master ; and have a care that God does not call you to account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way , and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up . 
`` Trim those lamps there ! '' 
exclaimed the barber at this ; `` so you are of the same fraternity as your master , too , Sancho ? 
By God , I begin to see that you will have to keep him company in the cage , and be enchanted like him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry . 
It was an evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises , and that island you long so much for found its way into your head . '' 
`` I am not with child by anyone , '' returned Sancho , `` nor am I a man to let myself be got with child , if it was by the King himself . 
Though I am poor I am an old Christian , and I owe nothing to nobody , and if I long for an island , other people long for worse . 
Each of us is the son of his own works ; and being a man I may come to be pope , not to say governor of an island , especially as my master may win so many that he will not know whom to give them to . 
Mind how you talk , master barber ; for shaving is not everything , and there is some difference between Peter and Peter . 
I say this because we all know one another , and it will not do to throw false dice with me ; and as to the enchantment of my master , God knows the truth ; leave it as it is ; it only makes it worse to stir it . '' 
The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to conceal ; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon to ride on a little in advance , so that he might tell him the mystery of this man in the cage , and other things that would amuse him . 
The canon agreed , and going on ahead with his servants , listened with attention to the account of the character , life , madness , and ways of Don Quixote , given him by the curate , who described to him briefly the beginning and origin of his craze , and told him the whole story of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage , together with the plan they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness . 
The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote 's strange story , and when it was finished he said , `` To tell the truth , senor curate , I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State ; and though , led by idle and false taste , I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed , I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end ; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing ; and one has nothing more in it than another ; this no more than that . 
And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian , nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction , exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time . 
And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse , I do not know how they can succeed , when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense . 
For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination brings before it ; and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure . 
What beauty , then , or what proportion of the parts to the whole , or of the whole to the parts , can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake ? 
And when they want to give us a picture of a battle , after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side of the enemy , let the hero of the book be opposed to them , and we have perforce to believe , whether we like it or not , that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm . 
And then , what shall we say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some unknown wandering knight ? 
What mind , that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured , can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind , and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies , or some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw ? 
And if , in answer to this , I am told that the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction , and therefore are not bound to regard niceties of truth , I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth , and gives the more pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it . 
Plots in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader , and be constructed in such a way that , reconciling impossibilities , smoothing over difficulties , keeping the mind on the alert , they may surprise , interest , divert , and entertain , so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other ; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature , wherein lies the perfection of writing . 
I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its numbers , so that the middle agrees with the beginning , and the end with the beginning and middle ; on the contrary , they construct them with such a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure . 
And besides all this they are harsh in their style , incredible in their achievements , licentious in their amours , uncouth in their courtly speeches , prolix in their battles , silly in their arguments , absurd in their travels , and , in short , wanting in everything like intelligent art ; for which reason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed . '' 
The curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of sound understanding , and that there was good reason in what he said ; so he told him that , being of the same opinion himself , and bearing a grudge to books of chivalry , he had burned all Don Quixote 's , which were many ; and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them , and of those he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared , with which the canon was not a little amused , adding that though he had said so much in condemnation of these books , still he found one good thing in them , and that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for displaying itself ; for they presented a wide and spacious field over which the pen might range freely , describing shipwrecks , tempests , combats , battles , portraying a valiant captain with all the qualifications requisite to make one , showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of the enemy , eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers , ripe in counsel , rapid in resolve , as bold in biding his time as in pressing the attack ; now picturing some sad tragic incident , now some joyful and unexpected event ; here a beauteous lady , virtuous , wise , and modest ; there a Christian knight , brave and gentle ; here a lawless , barbarous braggart ; there a courteous prince , gallant and gracious ; setting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals , the greatness and generosity of nobles . 
`` Or again , '' said he , `` the author may show himself to be an astronomer , or a skilled cosmographer , or musician , or one versed in affairs of state , and sometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if he likes . 
He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses , the piety of AEneas , the valour of Achilles , the misfortunes of Hector , the treachery of Sinon , the friendship of Euryalus , the generosity of Alexander , the boldness of Caesar , the clemency and truth of Trajan , the fidelity of Zopyrus , the wisdom of Cato , and in short all the faculties that serve to make an illustrious man perfect , now uniting them in one individual , again distributing them among many ; and if this be done with charm of style and ingenious invention , aiming at the truth as much as possible , he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that , when finished , will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek , which , as I said before , is to give instruction and pleasure combined ; for the unrestricted range of these books enables the author to show his powers , epic , lyric , tragic , or comic , and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy and oratory are capable of ; for the epic may be written in prose just as well as in verse . '' 
`` It is as you say , senor canon , '' said the curate ; `` and for that reason those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the rules of art , by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse . '' 
`` I myself , at any rate , '' said the canon , `` was once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be observed ; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets written ; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it , I showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading , to learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listening to nonsense , and from all I obtained flattering approval ; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it , as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession , as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise ; and , though it is better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many , I have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public , to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part . 
`` But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of finishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that are acted now-a-days , which was in this wise : if those that are now in vogue , as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history , are , all or most of them , downright nonsense and things that have neither head nor tail , and yet the public listens to them with delight , and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it ; and if the authors who write them , and the players who act them , say that this is what they must be , for the public wants this and will have nothing else ; and that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen intelligent people to understand them , while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their composition ; and that for themselves it is better to get bread from the many than praise from the few ; then my book will fare the same way , after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles I have spoken of , and I shall be ` the tailor of the corner . ' 
And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted , and that they would attract more people , and get more credit , by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art , than by absurd ones , they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it . 
`` I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows , ` Tell me , do you not recollect that a few years ago , there were three tragedies acted in Spain , written by a famous poet of these kingdoms , which were such that they filled all who heard them with admiration , delight , and interest , the ignorant as well as the wise , the masses as well as the higher orders , and brought in more money to the performers , these three alone , than thirty of the best that have been since produced ? ' '' 
` No doubt , ' replied the actor in question , ` you mean the `` Isabella , '' the `` Phyllis , '' and the `` Alexandra . '' ' '' 
` Those are the ones I mean , ' said I ; ` and see if they did not observe the principles of art , and if , by observing them , they failed to show their superiority and please all the world ; so that the fault does not lie with the public that insists upon nonsense , but with those who do n't know how to produce something else . 
`` The Ingratitude Revenged '' was not nonsense , nor was there any in `` The Numantia , '' nor any to be found in `` The Merchant Lover , '' nor yet in `` The Friendly Fair Foe , '' nor in some others that have been written by certain gifted poets , to their own fame and renown , and to the profit of those that brought them out ; ' some further remarks I added to these , with which , I think , I left him rather dumbfoundered , but not so satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him of his error . '' 
`` You have touched upon a subject , senor canon , '' observed the curate here , `` that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in vogue at the present day , quite as strong as that which I bear to the books of chivalry ; for while the drama , according to Tully , should be the mirror of human life , the model of manners , and the image of the truth , those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense , models of folly , and images of lewdness . 
For what greater nonsense can there be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first act , and in the second a grown-up bearded man ? 
Or what greater absurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler , a young man as a poltroon , a lackey using fine language , a page giving sage advice , a king plying as a porter , a princess who is a kitchen-maid ? 
And then what shall I say of their attention to the time in which the action they represent may or can take place , save that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe , the second in Asia , the third finished in Africa , and no doubt , had it been in four acts , the fourth would have ended in America , and so it would have been laid in all four quarters of the globe ? 
And if truth to life is the main thing the drama should keep in view , how is it possible for any average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed to pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne , and the principal personage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre , like Godfrey of Bouillon , there being years innumerable between the one and the other ? 
or , if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced , or bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed up with it , all , not only without any semblance of probability , but with obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable ? 
And the worst of it is , there are ignorant people who say that this is perfection , and that anything beyond this is affected refinement . 
And then if we turn to sacred dramas -- what miracles they invent in them ! 
What apocryphal , ill-devised incidents , attributing to one saint the miracles of another ! 
And even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that they think some such miracle , or transformation as they call it , will come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play . 
All this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history , nay more , to the reproach of the wits of Spain ; for foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous and ignorant , when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we produce . 
Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief object well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to be performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless amusement occasionally , and keep it from those evil humours which idleness is apt to engender ; and that , as this may be attained by any sort of play , good or bad , there is no need to lay down laws , or bind those who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made , since , as I say , the object sought for may be secured by any sort . 
To this I would reply that the same end would be , beyond all comparison , better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so ; for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play , the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests , instructed by the serious parts , full of admiration at the incidents , his wits sharpened by the arguments , warned by the tricks , all the wiser for the examples , inflamed against vice , and in love with virtue ; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull ; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all these qualities will not entertain , satisfy , and please much more than one wanting in them , like the greater number of those which are commonly acted now-a-days . 
Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this ; for some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults , and know what they ought to do ; but as plays have become a salable commodity , they say , and with truth , that the actors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion ; and so the poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work . 
And that this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written , with so much brilliancy , so much grace and gaiety , such polished versification , such choice language , such profound reflections , and in a word , so rich in eloquence and elevation of style , that he has filled the world with his fame ; and yet , in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors , they have not all , as some of them have , come as near perfection as they ought . 
Others write plays with such heedlessness that , after they have been acted , the actors have to fly and abscond , afraid of being punished , as they often have been , for having acted something offensive to some king or other , or insulting to some noble family . 
All which evils , and many more that I say nothing of , would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the capital to examine all plays before they were acted , not only those produced in the capital itself , but all that were intended to be acted in Spain ; without whose approval , seal , and signature , no local magistracy should allow any play to be acted . 
In that case actors would take care to send their plays to the capital , and could act them in safety , and those who write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work , standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the matter ; and so good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained ; as well the amusement of the people , as the credit of the wits of Spain , the interest and safety of the actors , and the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them . 
And if the same or some other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry , no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described , enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of eloquence , and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment , not merely of the idle but of the very busiest ; for the bow can not be always bent , nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful amusement . '' 
The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation , when the barber , coming forward , joined them , and said to the curate , `` This is the spot , senor licentiate , that I said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen , while we take our noontide rest . '' 
`` And so it seems , '' returned the curate , and he told the canon what he proposed to do , on which he too made up his mind to halt with them , attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes ; and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate , to whom he had begun to take a fancy , and also to learn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote , he desired some of his servants to go on to the inn , which was not far distant , and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole party , as he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was ; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule , which by this time ought to have reached the inn , carried provisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley . 
`` In that case , '' said the canon , `` take all the beasts there , and bring the sumpter mule back . '' 
While this was going on , Sancho , perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber , of whom he had his suspicions , present all the time , approached the cage in which Don Quixote was placed , and said , `` Senor , to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment , and that is that these two here , with their faces covered , are the curate of our village and the barber ; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion , out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds ; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted , but hoodwinked and made a fool of . 
And to prove this I want to ask you one thing ; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer , you will be able to lay your finger on the trick , and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits . '' 
`` Ask what thou wilt , Sancho my son , '' returned Don Quixote , `` for I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest . 
As to what thou sayest , that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber , our neighbours and acquaintances , it is very possible that they may seem to be those same persons ; but that they are so in reality and in fact , believe it not on any account ; what thou art to believe and think is that , if they look like them , as thou sayest , it must be that those who have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness ; for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please , and they may have taken those of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost , and lead thee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of Theseus ; and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind , and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to me ; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here in company with us , and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage , and know in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut me in , what wouldst thou have me say or think , but that my enchantment is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted ? 
So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest , for they are as much so as I am a Turk . 
But touching thy desire to ask me something , say on , and I will answer thee , though thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning . '' 
`` May Our Lady be good to me ! '' 
said Sancho , lifting up his voice ; `` and is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains that you can not see that what I say is the simple truth , and that malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment ? 
But as it is so , I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted . 
Now tell me , so may God deliver you from this affliction , and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea - '' `` Leave off conjuring me , '' said Don Quixote , `` and ask what thou wouldst know ; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision . '' 
`` That is what I want , '' said Sancho ; `` and what I would know , and have you tell me , without adding or leaving out anything , but telling the whole truth as one expects it to be told , and as it is told , by all who profess arms , as your worship professes them , under the title of knights-errant - '' `` I tell thee I will not lie in any particular , '' said Don Quixote ; `` finish thy question ; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations , requirements , and precautions , Sancho . '' 
`` Well , I rely on the goodness and truth of my master , '' said Sancho ; `` and so , because it bears upon what we are talking about , I would ask , speaking with all reverence , whether since your worship has been shut up and , as you think , enchanted in this cage , you have felt any desire or inclination to go anywhere , as the saying is ? '' 
`` I do not understand ` going anywhere , ' '' said Don Quixote ; `` explain thyself more clearly , Sancho , if thou wouldst have me give an answer to the point . '' 
`` Is it possible , '' said Sancho , `` that your worship does not understand ` going anywhere ' ? 
Why , the schoolboys know that from the time they were babes . 
Well then , you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what can not be avoided ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
now I understand thee , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote ; `` yes , often , and even this minute ; get me out of this strait , or all will not go right . '' 
`` Aha , I have caught you , '' said Sancho ; `` this is what in my heart and soul I was longing to know . 
Come now , senor , can you deny what is commonly said around us , when a person is out of humour , ' I do n't know what ails so-and-so , that he neither eats , nor drinks , nor sleeps , nor gives a proper answer to any question ; one would think he was enchanted ' ? 
From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat , or drink , or sleep , or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted ; but not those that have the desire your worship has , and drink when drink is given them , and eat when there is anything to eat , and answer every question that is asked them . '' 
`` What thou sayest is true , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` but I have already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments , and it may be that in the course of time they have been changed one for another , and that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do , though they did not do so before ; so it is vain to argue or draw inferences against the usage of the time . 
I know and feel that I am enchanted , and that is enough to ease my conscience ; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted , and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage , defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress , who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection . '' 
`` Still for all that , '' replied Sancho , `` I say that , for your greater and fuller satisfaction , it would be well if your worship were to try to get out of this prison -LRB- and I promise to do all in my power to help , and even to take you out of it -RRB- , and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante , who seems to be enchanted too , he is so melancholy and dejected ; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again ; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage ; in which , on the faith of a good and loyal squire , I promise to shut myself up along with your worship , if so be you are so unfortunate , or I so stupid , as not to be able to carry out my plan . '' 
`` I am content to do as thou sayest , brother Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely ; but thou wilt see , Sancho , how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune . '' 
The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate , the canon , and the barber , who had already dismounted , were waiting for them . 
The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot , the freshness of which seemed to invite , not enchanted people like Don Quixote , but wide-awake , sensible folk like his squire , who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little ; for if they did not let him out , the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required . 
The curate understood him , and said he would very gladly comply with his request , only that he feared his master , finding himself at liberty , would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again . 
`` I will answer for his not running away , '' said Sancho . 
`` And I also , '' said the canon , `` especially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent . '' 
Don Quixote , who was listening to all this , said , `` I give it ; - moreover one who is enchanted as I am can not do as he likes with himself ; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three ages , and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying . '' 
-- And that being so , they might as well release him , particularly as it would be to the advantage of all ; for , if they did not let him out , he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance . 
The canon took his hand , tied together as they both were , and on his word and promise they unbound him , and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage . 
The first thing he did was to stretch himself all over , and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said , `` I still trust in God and in his blessed mother , O flower and mirror of steeds , that we shall soon see ourselves , both of us , as we wish to be , thou with thy master on thy back , and I mounted upon thee , following the calling for which God sent me into the world . '' 
And so saying , accompanied by Sancho , he withdrew to a retired spot , from which he came back much relieved and more eager than ever to put his squire 's scheme into execution . 
The canon gazed at him , wondering at the extraordinary nature of his madness , and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such excellent sense , and only lose his stirrups , as has been already said , when the subject of chivalry was broached . 
And so , moved by compassion , he said to him , as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival of the provisions : `` Is it possible , gentle sir , that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted , and the like , all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is ? 
How can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world , or all that multitude of famous knights , all those emperors of Trebizond , all those Felixmartes of Hircania , all those palfreys , and damsels-errant , and serpents , and monsters , and giants , and marvellous adventures , and enchantments of every kind , and battles , and prodigious encounters , splendid costumes , love-sick princesses , squires made counts , droll dwarfs , love letters , billings and cooings , swashbuckler women , and , in a word , all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain ? 
For myself , I can only say that when I read them , so long as I do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity , they give me a certain amount of pleasure ; but when I come to consider what they are , I fling the very best of them at the wall , and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand , as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration , and as founders of new sects and modes of life , and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain .
