`` Thou art a bad Christian , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote on hearing this , `` for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it : but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance to trifles . 
What lame leg hast thou got by it , what broken rib , what cracked head , that thou canst not forget that jest ? 
For jest and sport it was , properly regarded , and had I not seen it in that light I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen , who , if she were alive now , or if my Dulcinea had lived then , might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as she is ; '' and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft ; and said Sancho , `` Let it pass for a jest as it can not be revenged in earnest , but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was , and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders . 
But putting that aside , will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass , which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here ? 
for , from the way he took to his heels and bolted , he is not likely ever to come back for it ; and by my beard but the grey is a good one . '' 
`` I have never been in the habit , '' said Don Quixote , `` of taking spoil of those whom I vanquish , nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away their horses and leave them to go on foot , unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his own in the combat , in which case it is lawful to take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war ; therefore , Sancho , leave this horse , or ass , or whatever thou wilt have it to be ; for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it . '' 
`` God knows I should like to take it , '' returned Sancho , `` or at least to change it for my own , which does not seem to me as good a one : verily the laws of chivalry are strict , since they can not be stretched to let one ass be changed for another ; I should like to know if I might at least change trappings . '' 
`` On that head I am not quite certain , '' answered Don Quixote , `` and the matter being doubtful , pending better information , I say thou mayest change them , if so be thou hast urgent need of them . '' 
`` So urgent is it , '' answered Sancho , `` that if they were for my own person I could not want them more ; '' and forthwith , fortified by this licence , he effected the mutatio capparum , rigging out his beast to the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it . 
This done , they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule , and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills , without casting a look in that direction , in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them ; and , all anger and gloom removed , they mounted and , without taking any fixed road -LRB- not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights-errant -RRB- , they set out , guided by Rocinante 's will , which carried along with it that of his master , not to say that of the ass , which always followed him wherever he led , lovingly and sociably ; nevertheless they returned to the high road , and pursued it at a venture without any other aim . 
As they went along , then , in this way Sancho said to his master , `` Senor , would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you ? 
For since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot in my stomach , and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I do n't want to be spoiled . '' 
`` Say , on , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` and be brief in thy discourse , for there is no pleasure in one that is long . '' 
`` Well then , senor , '' returned Sancho , `` I say that for some days past I have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads , where , even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved , there is no one to see or know of them , and so they must be left untold for ever , to the loss of your worship 's object and the credit they deserve ; therefore it seems to me it would be better -LRB- saving your worship 's better judgment -RRB- if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand , in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your person , your great might , and greater understanding , on perceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us , each according to his merits ; and there you will not be at a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever . 
Of my own I say nothing , as they will not go beyond squirely limits , though I make bold to say that , if it be the practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires , I think mine must not be left out . '' 
`` Thou speakest not amiss , Sancho , '' answered Don Quixote , `` but before that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world , as it were on probation , seeking adventures , in order that , by achieving some , name and fame may be acquired , such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds , and that the boys , the instant they see him enter the gate of the city , may all follow him and surround him , crying , ` This is the Knight of the Sun ' - or the Serpent , or any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds . 
` This , ' they will say , ` is he who vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength ; he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years . ' 
So from one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements ; and presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace , and as soon as he beholds the knight , recognising him by his arms and the device on his shield , he will as a matter of course say , ` What ho ! 
Forth all ye , the knights of my court , to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh hither ! ' 
At which command all will issue forth , and he himself , advancing half-way down the stairs , will embrace him closely , and salute him , kissing him on the cheek , and will then lead him to the queen 's chamber , where the knight will find her with the princess her daughter , who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known world . 
Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon her , and each will seem to the other something more divine than human , and , without knowing how or why they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love , and sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech . 
Thence they will lead him , no doubt , to some richly adorned chamber of the palace , where , having removed his armour , they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself , and if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a doublet . 
When night comes he will sup with the king , queen , and princess ; and all the time he will never take his eyes off her , stealing stealthy glances , unnoticed by those present , and she will do the same , and with equal cautiousness , being , as I have said , a damsel of great discretion . 
The tables being removed , suddenly through the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame , between two giants , who comes with a certain adventure , the work of an ancient sage ; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in the world . 
`` The king will then command all those present to essay it , and none will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight , to the great enhancement of his fame , whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so high . 
And the best of it is that this king , or prince , or whatever he is , is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself , and the stranger knight , after having been some days at his court , requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war . 
The king will grant it very readily , and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him ; and that night he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps , which looks upon a garden , and at which he has already many times conversed with her , the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess . 
He will sigh , she will swoon , the damsel will fetch water , much distressed because morning approaches , and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered ; at last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight , who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times , bathing them with his tears . 
It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes , and the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as possible , which he will promise to do with many oaths ; once more he kisses her hands , and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die . 
He betakes him thence to his chamber , flings himself on his bed , can not sleep for sorrow at parting , rises early in the morning , goes to take leave of the king , queen , and princess , and , as he takes his leave of the pair , it is told him that the princess is indisposed and can not receive a visit ; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure , his heart is pierced , and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain . 
The confidante is present , observes all , goes to tell her mistress , who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not knowing who this knight is , and whether he is of kingly lineage or not ; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy , gentleness , and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who was royal and illustrious ; her anxiety is thus relieved , and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her parents , and at the end of two days she appears in public . 
Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure ; he fights in the war , conquers the king 's enemy , wins many cities , triumphs in many battles , returns to the court , sees his lady where he was wont to see her , and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his services ; the king is unwilling to give her , as he knows not who he is , but nevertheless , whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be , the princess comes to be his bride , and her father comes to regard it as very good fortune ; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom , I know not what , for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map . 
The father dies , the princess inherits , and in two words the knight becomes king . 
And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank . 
He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess 's , who will be , no doubt , the one who was confidante in their amour , and is daughter of a very great duke . '' 
`` That 's what I want , and no mistake about it ! '' 
said Sancho . 
`` That 's what I 'm waiting for ; for all this , word for word , is in store for your worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance . '' 
`` Thou needst not doubt it , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote , `` for in the same manner , and by the same steps as I have described here , knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors ; all we want now is to find out what king , Christian or pagan , is at war and has a beautiful daughter ; but there will be time enough to think of that , for , as I have told thee , fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the court . 
There is another thing , too , that is wanting ; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter , and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe , I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage , or even second cousin to an emperor ; for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point , however much my famous deeds may deserve it ; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned . 
True it is I am a gentleman of known house , of estate and property , and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct ; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king ; for I would have thee know , Sancho , that there are two kinds of lineages in the world ; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes , whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down ; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords ; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are , and the others are what they formerly were not . 
And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous , with which the king , my father-in-law that is to be , ought to be satisfied ; and should he not be , the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier , she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father ; if not , then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please ; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents . '' 
`` It comes to this , too , '' said Sancho , `` what some naughty people say , ` Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force ; ' though it would fit better to say , ' A clear escape is better than good men 's prayers . ' 
I say so because if my lord the king , your worship 's father-in-law , will not condescend to give you my lady the princess , there is nothing for it but , as your worship says , to seize her and transport her . 
But the mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom , the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go , unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess , and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders things ; for his master , I suppose , may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife . '' 
`` Nobody can object to that , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` Then since that may be , '' said Sancho , `` there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God , and let fortune take what course it will . '' 
`` God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants , '' said Don Quixote , `` and mean be he who thinks himself mean . '' 
`` In God 's name let him be so , '' said Sancho : `` I am an old Christian , and to fit me for a count that 's enough . '' 
`` And more than enough for thee , '' said Don Quixote ; `` and even wert thou not , it would make no difference , because I being the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee , for when I make thee a count , then thou art at once a gentleman ; and they may say what they will , but by my faith they will have to call thee ` your lordship , ' whether they like it or not . '' 
`` Not a doubt of it ; and I 'll know how to support the tittle , '' said Sancho . 
`` Title thou shouldst say , not tittle , '' said his master . 
`` So be it , '' answered Sancho . 
`` I say I will know how to behave , for once in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood , and the beadle 's gown sat so well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same brotherhood . 
What will it be , then , when I put a duke 's robe on my back , or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count ? 
I believe they 'll come a hundred leagues to see me . '' 
`` Thou wilt look well , '' said Don Quixote , `` but thou must shave thy beard often , for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt , that if thou dost not shave it every second day at least , they will see what thou art at the distance of a musket shot . '' 
`` What more will it be , '' said Sancho , `` than having a barber , and keeping him at wages in the house ? 
and even if it be necessary , I will make him go behind me like a nobleman 's equerry . '' 
`` Why , how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them ? '' 
asked Don Quixote . 
`` I will tell you , '' answered Sancho . 
`` Years ago I was for a month at the capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they said was a very great man , and a man following him on horseback in every turn he took , just as if he was his tail . 
I asked why this man did not join the other man , instead of always going behind him ; they answered me that he was his equerry , and that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons behind them , and ever since then I know it , for I have never forgotten it . '' 
`` Thou art right , '' said Don Quixote , `` and in the same way thou mayest carry thy barber with thee , for customs did not come into use all together , nor were they all invented at once , and thou mayest be the first count to have a barber to follow him ; and , indeed , shaving one 's beard is a greater trust than saddling one 's horse . '' 
`` Let the barber business be my look-out , '' said Sancho ; `` and your worship 's be it to strive to become a king , and make me a count . '' 
`` So it shall be , '' answered Don Quixote , and raising his eyes he saw what will be told in the following chapter . 
Cide Hamete Benengeli , the Arab and Manchegan author , relates in this most grave , high-sounding , minute , delightful , and original history that after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one , Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck , like beads , on a great iron chain , and all with manacles on their hands . 
With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot ; those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets , those on foot with javelins and swords , and as soon as Sancho saw them he said : `` That is a chain of galley slaves , on the way to the galleys by force of the king 's orders . '' 
`` How by force ? '' 
asked Don Quixote ; `` is it possible that the king uses force against anyone ? '' 
`` I do not say that , '' answered Sancho , `` but that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king 's galleys . '' 
`` In fact , '' replied Don Quixote , `` however it may be , these people are going where they are taking them by force , and not of their own will . '' 
`` Just so , '' said Sancho . 
`` Then if so , '' said Don Quixote , `` here is a case for the exercise of my office , to put down force and to succour and help the wretched . '' 
`` Recollect , your worship , '' said Sancho , `` Justice , which is the king himself , is not using force or doing wrong to such persons , but punishing them for their crimes . '' 
The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up , and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner . 
One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty , that they were going to the galleys , and that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know . 
`` Nevertheless , '' replied Don Quixote , `` I should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune ; '' to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him : `` Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches , this is no time to take them out or read them ; come and ask themselves ; they can tell if they choose , and they will , for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities . '' 
With this permission , which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it , he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case . 
He made answer that it was for being a lover . 
`` For that only ? '' 
replied Don Quixote ; `` why , if for being lovers they send people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago . '' 
`` The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of , '' said the galley slave ; `` mine was that I loved a washerwoman 's basket of clean linen so well , and held it so close in my embrace , that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me , I should never have let it go of my own will to this moment ; I was caught in the act , there was no occasion for torture , the case was settled , they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back , and three years of gurapas besides , and that was the end of it . '' 
`` What are gurapas ? '' 
asked Don Quixote . 
`` Gurapas are galleys , '' answered the galley slave , who was a young man of about four-and-twenty , and said he was a native of Piedrahita . 
Don Quixote asked the same question of the second , who made no reply , so downcast and melancholy was he ; but the first answered for him , and said , `` He , sir , goes as a canary , I mean as a musician and a singer . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said Don Quixote , `` for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys too ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' answered the galley slave , `` for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering . '' 
`` On the contrary , I have heard say , '' said Don Quixote , `` that he who sings scares away his woes . '' 
`` Here it is the reverse , '' said the galley slave ; `` for he who sings once weeps all his life . '' 
`` I do not understand it , '' said Don Quixote ; but one of the guards said to him , `` Sir , to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity to confess under torture ; they put this sinner to the torture and he confessed his crime , which was being a cuatrero , that is a cattle-stealer , and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the galleys , besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the back ; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat , and snub , and jeer , and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay ; for , say they , ` nay ' has no more letters in it than ` yea , ' and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence ; and to my thinking they are not very far out . '' 
`` And I think so too , '' answered Don Quixote ; then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others , and the man answered very readily and unconcernedly , `` I am going for five years to their ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats . '' 
`` I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` That , '' said the galley slave , `` is like a man having money at sea when he is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants ; I say so because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your worship now offers me , I would have greased the notary 's pen and freshened up the attorney 's wit with them , so that to-day I should be in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo , and not on this road coupled like a greyhound . 
But God is great ; patience -- there , that 's enough of it . '' 
Don Quixote passed on to the fourth , a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his breast , who on hearing himself asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word , but the fifth acted as his tongue and said , `` This worthy man is going to the galleys for four years , after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback . '' 
`` That means , '' said Sancho Panza , `` as I take it , to have been exposed to shame in public . '' 
`` Just so , '' replied the galley slave , `` and the offence for which they gave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker , nay body-broker ; I mean , in short , that this gentleman goes as a pimp , and for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him . '' 
`` If that touch had not been thrown in , '' said Don Quixote , `` he would not deserve , for mere pimping , to row in the galleys , but rather to command and be admiral of them ; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one , being the office of persons of discretion , one very necessary in a well-ordered state , and only to be exercised by persons of good birth ; nay , there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them , as in other offices , and recognised number , as with the brokers on change ; in this way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people , such as women more or less silly , and pages and jesters of little standing and experience , who on the most urgent occasions , and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed , let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths , and know not which is their right hand . 
I should like to go farther , and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the state , but this is not the fit place for it ; some day I will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it ; all I say now is , that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp ; though I know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple folk fancy , for our will is free , nor is there herb or charm that can force it . 
All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons , pretending that they have power to cause love , for , as I say , it is an impossibility to compel the will . '' 
`` It is true , '' said the good old man , `` and indeed , sir , as far as the charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty ; as to that of being a pimp I can not deny it ; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it , for my only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet , without quarrels or troubles ; but my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from , with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives me a moment 's ease ; '' and again he fell to weeping as before , and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms . 
Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was , and the man answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last one . 
`` I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine , and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine ; in short , I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear : it was all proved against me , I got no favour , I had no money , I was near having my neck stretched , they sentenced me to the galleys for six years , I accepted my fate , it is the punishment of my fault ; I am a young man ; let life only last , and with that all will come right . 
If you , sir , have anything wherewith to help the poor , God will repay it to you in heaven , and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the life and health of your worship , that they may be as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves . '' 
This one was in the dress of a student , and one of the guards said he was a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar . 
Behind all these there came a man of thirty , a very personable fellow , except that when he looked , his eyes turned in a little one towards the other . 
He was bound differently from the rest , for he had to his leg a chain so long that it was wound all round his body , and two rings on his neck , one attached to the chain , the other to what they call a `` keep-friend '' or `` friend 's foot , '' from which hung two irons reaching to his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured by a big padlock , so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth nor lower his head to his hands . 
Don Quixote asked why this man carried so many more chains than the others . 
The guard replied that it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together , and was so daring and such a villain , that though they marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him , but were in dread of his making his escape . 
`` What crimes can he have committed , '' said Don Quixote , `` if they have not deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys ? '' 
`` He goes for ten years , '' replied the guard , `` which is the same thing as civil death , and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte , otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla . '' 
`` Gently , senor commissary , '' said the galley slave at this , `` let us have no fixing of names or surnames ; my name is Gines , not Ginesillo , and my family name is Pasamonte , not Parapilla as you say ; let each one mind his own business , and he will be doing enough . '' 
`` Speak with less impertinence , master thief of extra measure , '' replied the commissary , `` if you do n't want me to make you hold your tongue in spite of your teeth . '' 
`` It is easy to see , '' returned the galley slave , `` that man goes as God pleases , but some one shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not . '' 
`` Do n't they call you so , you liar ? '' 
said the guard . 
`` They do , '' returned Gines , `` but I will make them give over calling me so , or I will be shaved , where , I only say behind my teeth . 
If you , sir , have anything to give us , give it to us at once , and God speed you , for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others ; if you want to know about mine , let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte , whose life is written by these fingers . '' 
`` He says true , '' said the commissary , `` for he has himself written his story as grand as you please , and has left the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals . '' 
`` And I mean to take it out of pawn , '' said Gines , `` though it were in for two hundred ducats . '' 
`` Is it so good ? '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` So good is it , '' replied Gines , `` that a fig for ` Lazarillo de Tormes , ' and all of that kind that have been written , or shall be written compared with it : all I will say about it is that it deals with facts , and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them . '' 
`` And how is the book entitled ? '' 
asked Don Quixote . 
`` The ` Life of Gines de Pasamonte , ' '' replied the subject of it . 
`` And is it finished ? '' 
asked Don Quixote . 
`` How can it be finished , '' said the other , `` when my life is not yet finished ? 
All that is written is from my birth down to the point when they sent me to the galleys this last time . '' 
`` Then you have been there before ? '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years before now , and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are like , '' replied Gines ; `` and it is no great grievance to me to go back to them , for there I shall have time to finish my book ; I have still many things left to say , and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enough leisure ; though I do not want much for what I have to write , for I have it by heart . '' 
`` You seem a clever fellow , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` And an unfortunate one , '' replied Gines , `` for misfortune always persecutes good wit . '' 
`` It persecutes rogues , '' said the commissary . 
`` I told you already to go gently , master commissary , '' said Pasamonte ; `` their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here , but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you ; if not , by the life of-never mind - ; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring ; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better ; and now let us march on , for we have had quite enough of this entertainment . '' 
The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats , but Don Quixote came between them , and begged him not to ill-use him , as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free ; and turning to the whole chain of them he said : `` From all you have told me , dear brethren , make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults , the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure , and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will , and that perhaps this one 's want of courage under torture , that one 's want of money , the other 's want of advocacy , and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side . 
All which presents itself now to my mind , urging , persuading , and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I belong , and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the strong . 
But as I know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair , I will ask these gentlemen , the guards and commissary , to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace , as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more favourable circumstances ; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free . 
Moreover , sirs of the guard , '' added Don Quixote , `` these poor fellows have done nothing to you ; let each answer for his own sins yonder ; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good ; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others , they being therein no way concerned . 
This request I make thus gently and quietly , that , if you comply with it , I may have reason for thanking you ; and , if you will not voluntarily , this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force . '' 
`` Nice nonsense ! '' 
said the commissary ; `` a fine piece of pleasantry he has come out with at last ! 
He wants us to let the king 's prisoners go , as if we had any authority to release them , or he to order us to do so ! 
Go your way , sir , and good luck to you ; put that basin straight that you 've got on your head , and do n't go looking for three feet on a cat . '' '' 
'T is you that are the cat , rat , and rascal , '' replied Don Quixote , and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a lance-thrust ; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket . 
The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event , but recovering presence of mind , those on horseback seized their swords , and those on foot their javelins , and attacked Don Quixote , who was waiting for them with great calmness ; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves , seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves , had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung . 
Such was the confusion , that the guards , now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose , now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them , did nothing at all that was of any use . 
Sancho , on his part , gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte , who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered , and who , attacking the prostrate commissary , took from him his sword and the musket , with which , aiming at one and levelling at another , he , without ever discharging it , drove every one of the guards off the field , for they took to flight , as well to escape Pasamonte 's musket , as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them . 
Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair , because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood , who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders ; and he said so to his master , and entreated him to leave the place at once , and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by . 
`` That is all very well , '' said Don Quixote , `` but I know what must be done now ; '' and calling together all the galley slaves , who were now running riot , and had stripped the commissary to the skin , he collected them round him to hear what he had to say , and addressed them as follows : `` To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth , and one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude ; I say so because , sirs , ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have received of me ; in return for which I desire , and it is my good pleasure that , laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks , ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El Toboso , and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso , and say to her that her knight , he of the Rueful Countenance , sends to commend himself to her ; and that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notable adventure , up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty ; and this done ye may go where ye will , and good fortune attend you . '' 
Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all , saying , `` That which you , sir , our deliverer , demand of us , is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with , because we can not go together along the roads , but only singly and separate , and each one his own way , endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood , which , no doubt , will come out in search of us . 
What your worship may do , and fairly do , is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship 's intention , and this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day , running or resting , in peace or in war ; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt , I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso , is to imagine that it is now night , though it is not yet ten in the morning , and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree . '' 
`` Then by all that 's good , '' said Don Quixote -LRB- now stirred to wrath -RRB- , `` Don son of a bitch , Don Ginesillo de Paropillo , or whatever your name is , you will have to go yourself alone , with your tail between your legs and the whole chain on your back . '' 
Pasamonte , who was anything but meek -LRB- being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free -RRB- , finding himself abused in this fashion , gave the wink to his companions , and falling back they began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler , and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass . 
Sancho planted himself behind his ass , and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them . 
Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground ; and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him , snatched the basin from his head , and with it struck three or four blows on his shoulders , and as many more on the ground , knocking it almost to pieces . 
They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour , and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them . 
From Sancho they took his coat , leaving him in his shirt-sleeves ; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle , they went each one his own way , more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded , than about burdening themselves with the chain , or going to present themselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso . 
The ass and Rocinante , Sancho and Don Quixote , were all that were left upon the spot ; the ass with drooping head , serious , shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over ; Rocinante stretched beside his master , for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone ; Sancho stripped , and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood ; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so much . 
Seeing himself served in this way , Don Quixote said to his squire , `` I have always heard it said , Sancho , that to do good to boors is to throw water into the sea . 
If I had believed thy words , I should have avoided this trouble ; but it is done now , it is only to have patience and take warning for the future . '' 
`` Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk , '' returned Sancho ; `` but , as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed me , believe me now , and a still greater one will be avoided ; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood , and they do n't care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world ; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute . '' 
`` Thou art a coward by nature , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` but lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate , and that I never do as thou dost advise , this once I will take thy advice , and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest ; but it must be on one condition , that never , in life or in death , thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear , but only in compliance with thy entreaties ; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein , and from this time to that , and from that to this , I give thee lie , and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it ; and answer me not again ; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger , above all from this , which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it , I am ready to take my stand here and await alone , not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread , but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel , and the Seven Maccabees , and Castor and Pollux , and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world . '' 
`` Senor , '' replied Sancho , `` to retire is not to flee , and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope , and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow , and not risk all in one day ; and let me tell you , though I am a clown and a boor , I have got some notion of what they call safe conduct ; so repent not of having taken my advice , but mount Rocinante if you can , and if not I will help you ; and follow me , for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now . '' 
Don Quixote mounted without replying , and , Sancho leading the way on his ass , they entered the side of the Sierra Morena , which was close by , as it was Sancho 's design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almodovar del Campo , and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them . 
He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves , a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle , seeing how they pillaged and ransacked . 
That night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena , where it seemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days , at least as many as the stores he carried might last , and so they encamped between two rocks and among some cork trees ; but fatal destiny , which , according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith , directs , arranges , and settles everything in its own way , so ordered it that Gines de Pasamonte , the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain , driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood , which he had good reason to dread , resolved to take hiding in the mountains ; and his fate and fear led him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs , just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep : and as the wicked are always ungrateful , and necessity leads to evildoing , and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future , Gines , who was neither grateful nor well-principled , made up his mind to steal Sancho Panza 's ass , not troubling himself about Rocinante , as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell . 
While Sancho slept he stole his ass , and before day dawned he was far out of reach . 
Aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to Sancho Panza , for he found that his Dapple was missing , and seeing himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the world , so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him saying , `` O son of my bowels , born in my very house , my children 's plaything , my wife 's joy , the envy of my neighbours , relief of my burdens , and lastly , half supporter of myself , for with the six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my charges . '' 
Don Quixote , when he heard the lament and learned the cause , consoled Sancho with the best arguments he could , entreating him to be patient , and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him . 
Sancho took comfort at this , dried his tears , suppressed his sobs , and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote . 
He on his part was rejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains , as they seemed to him to be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of . 
They brought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds , and he went along reflecting on these things , so absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything else . 
Nor had Sancho any other care -LRB- now that he fancied he was travelling in a safe quarter -RRB- than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were left of the clerical spoils , and so he marched behind his master laden with what Dapple used to carry , emptying the sack and packing his paunch , and so long as he could go that way , he would not have given a farthing to meet with another adventure . 
While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted , and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object that lay upon the ground , on which he hastened to join him and help him if it were needful , and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it , half or rather wholly rotten and torn ; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to take them up , and his master directed him to see what the valise contained . 
Sancho did so with great alacrity , and though the valise was secured by a chain and padlock , from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see its contents , which were four shirts of fine holland , and other articles of linen no less curious than clean ; and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns , and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed : `` Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something ! '' 
Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound ; this Don Quixote asked of him , telling him to take the money and keep it for himself . 
Sancho kissed his hands for the favour , and cleared the valise of its linen , which he stowed away in the provision sack . 
Considering the whole matter , Don Quixote observed : `` It seems to me , Sancho -- and it is impossible it can be otherwise-that some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked and slain by footpads , who brought him to this remote spot to bury him . '' 
`` That can not be , '' answered Sancho , `` because if they had been robbers they would not have left this money . '' 
`` Thou art right , '' said Don Quixote , `` and I can not guess or explain what this may mean ; but stay ; let us see if in this memorandum book there is anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we want to know . '' 
He opened it , and the first thing he found in it , written roughly but in a very good hand , was a sonnet , and reading it aloud that Sancho might hear it , he found that it ran as follows : SONNET Or Love is lacking in intelligence , Or to the height of cruelty attains , Or else it is my doom to suffer pains Beyond the measure due to my offence . 
But if Love be a God , it follows thence That he knows all , and certain it remains No God loves cruelty ; then who ordains This penance that enthrals while it torments ? 
It were a falsehood , Chloe , thee to name ; Such evil with such goodness can not live ; And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame , I only know it is my fate to die . 
To him who knows not whence his malady A miracle alone a cure can give . 
`` There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme , '' said Sancho , `` unless by that clue there 's in it , one may draw out the ball of the whole matter . '' 
`` What clue is there ? '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it , '' said Sancho . 
`` I only said Chloe , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` and that no doubt , is the name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains ; and , faith , he must be a tolerable poet , or I know little of the craft . '' 
`` Then your worship understands rhyming too ? '' 
`` And better than thou thinkest , '' replied Don Quixote , `` as thou shalt see when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso , for I would have thee know , Sancho , that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and great musicians , for both of these accomplishments , or more properly speaking gifts , are the peculiar property of lovers-errant : true it is that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in them . '' 
`` Read more , your worship , '' said Sancho , `` and you will find something that will enlighten us . '' 
Don Quixote turned the page and said , `` This is prose and seems to be a letter . '' 
`` A correspondence letter , senor ? '' 
`` From the beginning it seems to be a love letter , '' replied Don Quixote . 
`` Then let your worship read it aloud , '' said Sancho , `` for I am very fond of love matters . '' 
`` With all my heart , '' said Don Quixote , and reading it aloud as Sancho had requested him , he found it ran thus : Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint . 
Ungrateful one , thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy , but not more worthy ; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own . 
What thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low ; by it I believed thee to be an angel , by them I know thou art a woman . 
Peace be with thee who hast sent war to me , and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee , so that thou repent not of what thou hast done , and I reap not a revenge I would not have . 
When he had finished the letter , Don Quixote said , `` There is less to be gathered from this than from the verses , except that he who wrote it is some rejected lover ; '' and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he found more verses and letters , some of which he could read , while others he could not ; but they were all made up of complaints , laments , misgivings , desires and aversions , favours and rejections , some rapturous , some doleful . 
While Don Quixote examined the book , Sancho examined the valise , not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did not search , peer into , and explore , or seam that he did not rip , or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces , lest anything should escape for want of care and pains ; so keen was the covetousness excited in him by the discovery of the crowns , which amounted to near a hundred ; and though he found no more booty , he held the blanket flights , balsam vomits , stake benedictions , carriers ' fisticuffs , missing alforjas , stolen coat , and all the hunger , thirst , and weariness he had endured in the service of his good master , cheap at the price ; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove . 
The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could be , conjecturing from the sonnet and letter , from the money in gold , and from the fineness of the shirts , that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some desperate course ; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire , he saw nothing else for it but to push on , taking whatever road Rocinante chose -- which was where he could make his way -- firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure . 
As he went along , then , occupied with these thoughts , he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility . 
As well as he could make out he was unclad , with a thick black beard , long tangled hair , and bare legs and feet , his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places . 
He was bareheaded , and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described , the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and noted all these trifles , and though he made the attempt , he was unable to follow him , for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground , he being , moreover , slow-paced and sluggish by nature . 
Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise , and made up his mind to go in search of him , even though he should have to wander a year in those mountains before he found him , and so he directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain , while he himself went by the other , and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight . 
`` I could not do that , '' said Sancho , `` for when I separate from your worship fear at once lays hold of me , and assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies ; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time forth I am not going to stir a finger 's width from your presence . '' 
`` It shall be so , '' said he of the Rueful Countenance , `` and I am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my courage , which will never fail thee , even though the soul in thy body fail thee ; so come on now behind me slowly as well as thou canst , and make lanterns of thine eyes ; let us make the circuit of this ridge ; perhaps we shall light upon this man that we saw , who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found . '' 
To which Sancho made answer , `` Far better would it be not to look for him , for , if we find him , and he happens to be the owner of the money , it is plain I must restore it ; it would be better , therefore , that without taking this needless trouble , I should keep possession of it until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered ; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it , and then the king will hold me harmless . '' 
`` Thou art wrong there , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` for now that we have a suspicion who the owner is , and have him almost before us , we are bound to seek him and make restitution ; and if we do not see him , the strong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he were so ; and so , friend Sancho , let not our search for him give thee any uneasiness , for if we find him it will relieve mine . '' 
And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur , and Sancho followed him on foot and loaded , and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine , dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws , a mule saddled and bridled , all which still further strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle-pad . 
As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his flock , and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge of them , a man advanced in years . 
Don Quixote called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood . 
He shouted in return , asking what had brought them to that spot , seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats , or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around . 
Sancho in return bade him come down , and they would explain all to him . 
The goatherd descended , and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood , he said , `` I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there , and , faith , it has been lying there now these six months ; tell me , have you come upon its master about here ? '' 
`` We have come upon nobody , '' answered Don Quixote , `` nor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this . '' 
`` I found it too , '' said the goatherd , `` but I would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft , for the devil is crafty , and things rise up under one 's feet to make one fall without knowing why or wherefore . '' 
`` That 's exactly what I say , '' said Sancho ; `` I found it too , and I would not go within a stone 's throw of it ; there I left it , and there it lies just as it was , for I do n't want a dog with a bell . '' 
`` Tell me , good man , '' said Don Quixote , `` do you know who is the owner of this property ? '' 
`` All I can tell you , '' said the goatherd , `` is that about six months ago , more or less , there arrived at a shepherd 's hut three leagues , perhaps , away from this , a youth of well-bred appearance and manners , mounted on that same mule which lies dead here , and with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say you found and did not touch . 
He asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired ; we told him that it was where we now are ; and so in truth it is , for if you push on half a league farther , perhaps you will not be able to find your way out ; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here , for there is no road or path that leads to this spot . 
I say , then , that on hearing our answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him , leaving us all charmed with his good looks , and wondering at his question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra ; and after that we saw him no more , until some days afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds , and without saying a word to him , came up to him and gave him several cuffs and kicks , and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried , and having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness . 
When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra , at the end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree . 
He came out to meet us with great gentleness , with his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun , that we hardly recognised him but that his clothes , though torn , convinced us , from the recollection we had of them , that he was the person we were looking for . 
He saluted us courteously , and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at seeing him going about in this guise , as it was binding upon him in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been imposed upon him . 
We asked him to tell us who he was , but we were never able to find out from him : we begged of him too , when he was in want of food , which he could not do without , to tell us where we should find him , as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness ; or if this were not to his taste , at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by force from the shepherds . 
He thanked us for the offer , begged pardon for the late assault , and promised for the future to ask it in God 's name without offering violence to anybody . 
As for fixed abode , he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him ; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we not joined him in it , comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now ; for , as I said , he was a graceful and gracious youth , and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding , and rustics as we were that listened to him , even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain . 
`` But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent , keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time , during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction ; and with no little pity , for from his behaviour , now staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid , again closing them , compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows , we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him ; and before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth , for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown himself , and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged him off him , he would have beaten or bitten him to death , all the while exclaiming , ` Oh faithless Fernando , here , here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast done me ; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine , abode and dwelling of all iniquity , but of deceit and fraud above all ; and to these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and charging him with treachery and faithlessness . 
`` We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty , and without another word he left us , and rushing off plunged in among these brakes and brambles , so as to make it impossible for us to follow him ; from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time , and that some one called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to show . 
All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions , and they have been many , on which he has crossed our path , at one time to beg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry , at another to take it from them by force ; for when there is a fit of madness upon him , even though the shepherds offer it freely , he will not accept it but snatches it from them by dint of blows ; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the love of God , courteously and civilly , and receives it with many thanks and not a few tears . 
And to tell you the truth , sirs , '' continued the goatherd , `` it was yesterday that we resolved , I and four of the lads , two of them our servants , and the other two friends of mine , to go in search of him until we find him , and when we do to take him , whether by force or of his own consent , to the town of Almodovar , which is eight leagues from this , and there strive to cure him -LRB- if indeed his malady admits of a cure -RRB- , or learn when he is in his senses who he is , and if he has relatives to whom we may give notice of his misfortune . 
This , sirs , is all I can say in answer to what you have asked me ; and be sure that the owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked . '' 
For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side , and he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd , and more eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was ; and in his heart he resolved , as he had done before , to search for him all over the mountain , not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him . 
But chance arranged matters better than he expected or hoped , for at that very moment , in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood , the youth he wished to find made his appearance , coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand , much more at a distance . 
His garb was what has been described , save that as he drew near , Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned , from which he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank . 
Approaching them , the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy . 
Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal politeness , and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing and grace to embrace him , and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had known him for a long time . 
The other , whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance , as Don Quixote was of the Rueful , after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and , placing his hands on Don Quixote 's shoulders , stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him , not less amazed , perhaps , at the sight of the face , figure , and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him . 
To be brief , the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One , and he said what will be told farther on . 
The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra , who began by saying : `` Of a surety , senor , whoever you are , for I know you not , I thank you for the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me , and would I were in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me ; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them . '' 
`` Mine , '' replied Don Quixote , `` is to be of service to you , so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you , and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour ; and to search for you with all possible diligence , if search had been necessary . 
And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that refuse admission to any sort of consolation , it was my purpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it , so far as I could ; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it . 
And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy , I entreat you , senor , by that which I perceive you possess in so high a degree , and likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life , to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast , dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show . 
And I swear , '' added Don Quixote , `` by the order of knighthood which I have received , and by my vocation of knight-errant , if you gratify me in this , to serve you with all the zeal my calling demands of me , either in relieving your misfortune if it admits of relief , or in joining you in lamenting it as I promised to do . '' 
The Knight of the Thicket , hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk in this strain , did nothing but stare at him , and stare at him again , and again survey him from head to foot ; and when he had thoroughly examined him , he said to him : `` If you have anything to give me to eat , for God 's sake give it me , and after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill you have displayed towards me . '' 
Sancho from his sack , and the goatherd from his pouch , furnished the Ragged One with the means of appeasing his hunger , and what they gave him he ate like a half-witted being , so hastily that he took no time between mouthfuls , gorging rather than swallowing ; and while he ate neither he nor they who observed him uttered a word . 
As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him , which they did , and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock . 
On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass , and the others did the same , all keeping silence , until the Ragged One , settling himself in his place , said : `` If it is your wish , sirs , that I should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes , you must promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption , for the instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end . '' 
These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire had told him , when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the river and the story remained unfinished ; but to return to the Ragged One , he went on to say : `` I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes , for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh ones , and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the recital , though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity . '' 
Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others , and with this assurance he began as follows : `` My name is Cardenio , my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia , my family noble , my parents rich , my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it ; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven . 
In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire ; such was the beauty of Luscinda , a damsel as noble and as rich as I , but of happier fortunes , and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine . 
This Luscinda I loved , worshipped , and adored from my earliest and tenderest years , and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood . 
Our parents were aware of our feelings , and were not sorry to perceive them , for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us , a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth . 
We grew up , and with our growth grew the love between us , so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety 's sake to refuse me admission to his house , in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets , and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame ; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens , which can make known the heart 's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues ; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue . 
Ah heavens ! 
how many letters did I write her , and how many dainty modest replies did I receive ! 
how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings , described its ardent longings , revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires ! 
At length growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her , I resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward , to ask her of her father for my lawful wife , which I did . 
To this his answer was that he thanked me for the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as honoured by the bestowal of his treasure ; but that as my father was alive it was his by right to make this demand , for if it were not in accordance with his full will and pleasure , Luscinda was not to be taken or given by stealth . 
I thanked him for his kindness , reflecting that there was reason in what he said , and that my father would assent to it as soon as I should tell him , and with that view I went the very same instant to let him know what my desires were . 
When I entered the room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand , which , before I could utter a word , he gave me , saying , ` By this letter thou wilt see , Cardenio , the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee . ' 
This Duke Ricardo , as you , sirs , probably know already , is a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia . 
I took and read the letter , which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it , which was that he would send me immediately to him , as he wished me to become the companion , not servant , of his eldest son , and would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me . 
On reading the letter my voice failed me , and still more when I heard my father say , ` Two days hence thou wilt depart , Cardenio , in accordance with the duke 's wish , and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve ; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel . 
The time for my departure arrived ; I spoke one night to Luscinda , I told her all that had occurred , as I did also to her father , entreating him to allow some delay , and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me : he gave me the promise , and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered . 
Finally , I presented myself to the duke , and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work , the old servants growing envious of me , and regarding the duke 's inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves . 
But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke 's second son , Fernando by name , a gallant youth , of noble , generous , and amorous disposition , who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody ; for though the elder was attached to me , and showed me kindness , he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando . 
It so happened , then , that as between friends no secret remains unshared , and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship , he made all his thoughts known to me , and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little . 
He was deeply in love with a peasant girl , a vassal of his father 's , the daughter of wealthy parents , and herself so beautiful , modest , discreet , and virtuous , that no one who knew her was able to decide in which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled . 
The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that , in order to gain his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions , he determined to pledge his word to her to become her husband , for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an impossibility . 
Bound to him as I was by friendship , I strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course ; but perceiving I produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo , his father , acquainted with the matter ; but Don Fernando , being sharp-witted and shrewd , foresaw and apprehended this , perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke ; and so , to mislead and deceive me , he told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months , and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going , both of us , to my father 's house under the pretence , which he would make to the duke , of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city , which produces the best in the world . 
When I heard him say so , even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined , prompted by my affection , seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to see my Luscinda . 
With this thought and wish I commended his idea and encouraged his design , advising him to put it into execution as quickly as possible , as , in truth , absence produced its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings . 
But , as afterwards appeared , when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of husband , and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safety to himself , being in dread of what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly . 
It happened , then , that as with young men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite , which , as its final object is enjoyment , comes to an end on obtaining it , and that which seemed to be love takes to flight , as it can not pass the limit fixed by nature , which fixes no limit to true love -- what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled , and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love , he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise . 
`` The duke gave him permission , and ordered me to accompany him ; we arrived at my city , and my father gave him the reception due to his rank ; I saw Luscinda without delay , and , though it had not been dead or deadened , my love gathered fresh life . 
To my sorrow I told the story of it to Don Fernando , for I thought that in virtue of the great friendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him . 
I extolled her beauty , her gaiety , her wit , so warmly , that my praises excited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions . 
To my misfortune I yielded to it , showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another . 
As she appeared to him in her dressing-gown , she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection ; speech failed him , his head turned , he was spell-bound , and in the end love-smitten , as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune ; and to inflame still further his passion , which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone , it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage , so delicate , so modest , and so tender , that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the world . 
It is true , and I own it now , that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise Luscinda , it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth , and I began to fear , and with reason to feel distrust of him , for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda , and he would start the subject himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably , a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy ; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of Luscinda ; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me against . 
Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me , under the pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both . 
It so happened , then , that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read , one that she was very fond of , Amadis of Gaul - '' Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned , than he said : `` Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry , no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding , for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting ; so , as far as I am concerned , you need waste no more words in describing her beauty , worth , and intelligence ; for , on merely hearing what her taste was , I declare her to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world ; and I wish your worship had , along with Amadis of Gaul , sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece , for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya , and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel , and the admirable verses of his bucolics , sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness , wit , and ease ; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied , and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village , for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life ; -- though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now , thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters ; -- but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse ; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned , I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat , or those of the moon moisture ; pardon me , therefore , and proceed , for that is more to the purpose now . '' 
While Don Quixote was saying this , Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon his breast , and seemed plunged in deep thought ; and though twice Don Quixote bade him go on with his story , he neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply ; but after some time he raised his head and said , `` I can not get rid of the idea , nor will anyone in the world remove it , or make me think otherwise -- and he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima . '' 
`` That is not true , by all that 's good , '' said Don Quixote in high wrath , turning upon him angrily , as his way was ; `` and it is a very great slander , or rather villainy . 
Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady , and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a quack ; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel , and I will give him to know it , on foot or on horseback , armed or unarmed , by night or by day , or as he likes best . '' 
Cardenio was looking at him steadily , and his mad fit having now come upon him , he had no disposition to go on with his story , nor would Don Quixote have listened to it , so much had what he had heard about Madasima disgusted him . 
Strange to say , he stood up for her as if she were in earnest his veritable born lady ; to such a pass had his unholy books brought him . 
Cardenio , then , being , as I said , now mad , when he heard himself given the lie , and called a scoundrel and other insulting names , not relishing the jest , snatched up a stone that he found near him , and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote 's breast that he laid him on his back . 
Sancho Panza , seeing his master treated in this fashion , attacked the madman with his closed fist ; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet , and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction ; the goatherd , who came to the rescue , shared the same fate ; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain . 
Sancho rose , and with the rage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it , ran to take vengeance on the goatherd , accusing him of not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit , for if they had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves . 
The goatherd replied that he had said so , and that if he had not heard him , that was no fault of his . 
Sancho retorted , and the goatherd rejoined , and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard , and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them , they would have knocked one another to pieces . 
`` Leave me alone , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , '' said Sancho , grappling with the goatherd , `` for of this fellow , who is a clown like myself , and no dubbed knight , I can safely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me , fighting with him hand to hand like an honest man . '' 
`` That is true , '' said Don Quixote , `` but I know that he is not to blame for what has happened . '' 
With this he pacified them , and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio , as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story . 
The goatherd told him , as he had told him before , that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was ; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses . 
Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd , and once more mounting Rocinante bade Sancho follow him , which he having no ass , did very discontentedly . 
They proceeded slowly , making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain , Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master , and longing for him to begin , so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him ; but unable to keep silence so long he said to him : `` Senor Don Quixote , give me your worship 's blessing and dismissal , for I 'd like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I like ; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive . 
If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete , it would not be so bad , because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head , and so put up with my ill-fortune ; but it is a hard case , and not to be borne with patience , to go seeking adventures all one 's life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings , brickbats and punches , and with all this to have to sew up one 's mouth without daring to say what is in one 's heart , just as if one were dumb . '' 
`` I understand thee , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` thou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed ; consider it removed , and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains . '' 
`` So be it , '' said Sancho ; `` let me speak now , for God knows what will happen by-and-by ; and to take advantage of the permit at once , I ask , what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa , or whatever her name is , or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not ? 
for if your worship had let that pass -- and you were not a judge in the matter -- it is my belief the madman would have gone on with his story , and the blow of the stone , and the kicks , and more than half a dozen cuffs would have been escaped . '' 
`` In faith , Sancho , '' answered Don Quixote , `` if thou knewest as I do what an honourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was , I know thou wouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth that uttered such blasphemies , for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon . 
The truth of the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great prudence and sound judgment , and served as governor and physician to the queen , but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment ; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he was saying , remember when he said it he was out of his wits . '' 
`` That is what I say , '' said Sancho ; `` there was no occasion for minding the words of a madman ; for if good luck had not helped your worship , and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast , a fine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder , God confound her ! 
And then , would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman ? '' 
`` Against men in their senses or against madmen , '' said Don Quixote , `` every knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women , whoever they may be , much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as Queen Madasima , for whom I have a particular regard on account of her amiable qualities ; for , besides being extremely beautiful , she was very wise , and very patient under her misfortunes , of which she had many ; and the counsel and society of the Master Elisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation ; hence the ignorant and ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his mistress ; and they lie , I say it once more , and will lie two hundred times more , all who think and say so . '' 
`` I neither say nor think so , '' said Sancho ; `` let them look to it ; with their bread let them eat it ; they have rendered account to God whether they misbehaved or not ; I come from my vineyard , I know nothing ; I am not fond of prying into other men 's lives ; he who buys and lies feels it in his purse ; moreover , naked was I born , naked I find myself , I neither lose nor gain ; but if they did , what is that to me ? 
many think there are flitches where there are no hooks ; but who can put gates to the open plain ? 
moreover they said of God - '' `` God bless me , '' said Don Quixote , `` what a set of absurdities thou art stringing together ! 
What has what we are talking about got to do with the proverbs thou art threading one after the other ? 
for God 's sake hold thy tongue , Sancho , and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and do n't meddle in what does not concern thee ; and understand with all thy five senses that everything I have done , am doing , or shall do , is well founded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry , for I understand them better than all the world that profess them . '' 
`` Senor , '' replied Sancho , `` is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go astray through these mountains without path or road , looking for a madman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began , not his story , but your worship 's head and my ribs , and end by breaking them altogether for us ? '' 
`` Peace , I say again , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` for let me tell thee it is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these regions as that which I have of performing among them an achievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world ; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on all that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous . '' 
`` And is it very perilous , this achievement ? '' 
`` No , '' replied he of the Rueful Countenance ; `` though it may be in the dice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes ; but all will depend on thy diligence . '' 
`` On my diligence ! '' 
said Sancho . 
`` Yes , '' said Don Quixote , `` for if thou dost return soon from the place where I mean to send thee , my penance will be soon over , and my glory will soon begin . 
But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense , waiting to see what comes of my words , I would have thee know , Sancho , that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant -- I am wrong to say he was one ; he stood alone , the first , the only one , the lord of all that were in the world in his time . 
A fig for Don Belianis , and for all who say he equalled him in any respect , for , my oath upon it , they are deceiving themselves ! 
I say , too , that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows ; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state ; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses , in whose person and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience ; as Virgil , too , shows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain ; not representing or describing them as they were , but as they ought to be , so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity . 
In the same way Amadis was the polestar , day-star , sun of valiant and devoted knights , whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate . 
This , then , being so , I consider , friend Sancho , that the knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry . 
Now one of the instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence , worth , valour , endurance , fortitude , and love , was when he withdrew , rejected by the Lady Oriana , to do penance upon the Pena Pobre , changing his name into that of Beltenebros , a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted . 
So , as it is easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder , cutting off serpents ' heads , slaying dragons , routing armies , destroying fleets , and breaking enchantments , and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose , I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers me its forelock . '' 
`` What is it in reality , '' said Sancho , `` that your worship means to do in such an out-of-the-way place as this ? '' 
`` Have I not told thee , '' answered Don Quixote , `` that I mean to imitate Amadis here , playing the victim of despair , the madman , the maniac , so as at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland , when at the fountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and through grief thereat went mad , and plucked up trees , troubled the waters of the clear springs , slew destroyed flocks , burned down huts , levelled houses , dragged mares after him , and perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record ? 
And though I have no intention of imitating Roland , or Orlando , or Rotolando -LRB- for he went by all these names -RRB- , step by step in all the mad things he did , said , and thought , I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential ; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis , who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow , gained as much fame as the most famous . '' 
`` It seems to me , '' said Sancho , `` that the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for those follies and penances ; but what cause has your worship for going mad ? 
What lady has rejected you , or what evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor or Christian ? '' 
`` There is the point , '' replied Don Quixote , `` and that is the beauty of this business of mine ; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has cause ; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation , and let my lady know , if I do this in the dry , what I would do in the moist ; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady till death , Dulcinea del Toboso ; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day , in absence all ills are felt and feared ; and so , friend Sancho , waste no time in advising me against so rare , so happy , and so unheard-of an imitation ; mad I am , and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea ; and if it be such as my constancy deserves , my insanity and penance will come to an end ; and if it be to the opposite effect , I shall become mad in earnest , and , being so , I shall suffer no more ; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me , enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me , or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me . 
But tell me , Sancho , hast thou got Mambrino 's helmet safe ? 
for I saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not , by which the fineness of its temper may be seen . '' 
To which Sancho made answer , `` By the living God , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , I can not endure or bear with patience some of the things that your worship says ; and from them I begin to suspect that all you tell me about chivalry , and winning kingdoms and empires , and giving islands , and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant , must be all made up of wind and lies , and all pigments or figments , or whatever we may call them ; for what would anyone think that heard your worship calling a barber 's basin Mambrino 's helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time , but that one who says and maintains such things must have his brains addled ? 
I have the basin in my sack all dinted , and I am taking it home to have it mended , to trim my beard in it , if , by God 's grace , I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other . '' 
`` Look here , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` by him thou didst swear by just now I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in the world has or ever had . 
Is it possible that all this time thou hast been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings , and to go always by contraries ? 
And not because it really is so , but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us , and turn things as they please , and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us ; thus what seems to thee a barber 's basin seems to me Mambrino 's helmet , and to another it will seem something else ; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrine 's helmet seem a basin to everybody , for , being held in such estimation as it is , all the world would pursue me to rob me of it ; but when they see it is only a barber 's basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it ; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it , and left it on the ground without taking it , for , by my faith , had he known it he would never have left it behind . 
Keep it safe , my friend , for just now I have no need of it ; indeed , I shall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born , if I have a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance . '' 
Thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an isolated peak among the others that surrounded it . 
Past its base there flowed a gentle brook , all around it spread a meadow so green and luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it , and forest trees in abundance , and shrubs and flowers , added to the charms of the spot . 
Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his choice for the performance of his penance , and as he beheld it exclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses : `` This is the place , oh , ye heavens , that I select and choose for bewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me : this is the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of yon little brook , and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees , in testimony and token of the pain my persecuted heart is suffering . 
Oh , ye rural deities , whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot , give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful one , the end and limit of all human beauty ! 
Oh , ye wood nymphs and dryads , that dwell in the thickets of the forest , so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never disturb your sweet repose , help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at listening to it ! 
Oh , Dulcinea del Toboso , day of my night , glory of my pain , guide of my path , star of my fortune , so may Heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it , bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence from thee has brought me , and make that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity ! 
Oh , lonely trees , that from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude , give me some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is not distasteful to you ! 
Oh , thou , my squire , pleasant companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes , fix well in thy memory what thou shalt see me do here , so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole cause of all , '' and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante , and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle , and giving him a slap on the croup , said , `` He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself , oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot ; begone where thou wilt , for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo 's hippogriff , nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear , could equal thee in speed . '' 
Seeing this Sancho said , `` Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble of stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple ! 
By my faith he would not have gone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise ; though if he were here I would not let anyone strip him , for there would be no occasion , as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him , inasmuch as his master , which I was while it was God 's pleasure , was nothing of the sort ; and indeed , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , if my departure and your worship 's madness are to come off in earnest , it will be as well to saddle Rocinante again in order that he may supply the want of Dapple , because it will save me time in going and returning : for if I go on foot I do n't know when I shall get there or when I shall get back , as I am , in truth , a bad walker . '' 
`` I declare , Sancho , '' returned Don Quixote , `` it shall be as thou wilt , for thy plan does not seem to me a bad one , and three days hence thou wilt depart , for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and say for her sake , that thou mayest be able to tell it . '' 
`` But what more have I to see besides what I have seen ? '' 
said Sancho . 
`` Much thou knowest about it ! '' 
said Don Quixote . 
`` I have now got to tear up my garments , to scatter about my armour , knock my head against these rocks , and more of the same sort of thing , which thou must witness . '' 
`` For the love of God , '' said Sancho , `` be careful , your worship , how you give yourself those knocks on the head , for you may come across such a rock , and in such a way , that the very first may put an end to the whole contrivance of this penance ; and I should think , if indeed knocks on the head seem necessary to you , and this business can not be done without them , you might be content -- as the whole thing is feigned , and counterfeit , and in joke -- you might be content , I say , with giving them to yourself in the water , or against something soft , like cotton ; and leave it all to me ; for I 'll tell my lady that your worship knocked your head against a point of rock harder than a diamond . '' 
`` I thank thee for thy good intentions , friend Sancho , '' answered Don Quixote , `` but I would have thee know that all these things I am doing are not in joke , but very much in earnest , for anything else would be a transgression of the ordinances of chivalry , which forbid us to tell any lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy ; and to do one thing instead of another is just the same as lying ; so my knocks on the head must be real , solid , and valid , without anything sophisticated or fanciful about them , and it will be needful to leave me some lint to dress my wounds , since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam we lost . '' 
`` It was worse losing the ass , '' replied Sancho , `` for with him lint and all were lost ; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of that accursed liquor , for my soul , not to say my stomach , turns at hearing the very name of it ; and I beg of you , too , to reckon as past the three days you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do , for I take them as seen already and pronounced upon , and I will tell wonderful stories to my lady ; so write the letter and send me off at once , for I long to return and take your worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving you . '' 
`` Purgatory dost thou call it , Sancho ? '' 
said Don Quixote , `` rather call it hell , or even worse if there be anything worse . '' 
`` For one who is in hell , '' said Sancho , `` nulla est retentio , as I have heard say . '' 
`` I do not understand what retentio means , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` Retentio , '' answered Sancho , `` means that whoever is in hell never comes nor can come out of it , which will be the opposite case with your worship or my legs will be idle , that is if I have spurs to enliven Rocinante : let me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea , and I will tell her such things of the follies and madnesses -LRB- for it is all one -RRB- that your worship has done and is still doing , that I will manage to make her softer than a glove though I find her harder than a cork tree ; and with her sweet and honeyed answer I will come back through the air like a witch , and take your worship out of this purgatory that seems to be hell but is not , as there is hope of getting out of it ; which , as I have said , those in hell have not , and I believe your worship will not say anything to the contrary . '' 
`` That is true , '' said he of the Rueful Countenance , `` but how shall we manage to write the letter ? '' 
`` And the ass-colt order too , '' added Sancho . 
`` All shall be included , '' said Don Quixote ; `` and as there is no paper , it would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees , as the ancients did , or on tablets of wax ; though that would be as hard to find just now as paper . 
But it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and even more than conveniently written , and that is in the note-book that belonged to Cardenio , and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper , in a good hand , at the first village thou comest to where there is a schoolmaster , or if not , any sacristan will copy it ; but see thou give it not to any notary to copy , for they write a law hand that Satan could not make out . '' 
`` But what is to be done about the signature ? '' 
said Sancho . 
`` The letters of Amadis were never signed , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` That is all very well , '' said Sancho , `` but the order must needs be signed , and if it is copied they will say the signature is false , and I shall be left without ass-colts . '' 
`` The order shall go signed in the same book , '' said Don Quixote , `` and on seeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it ; as to the loveletter thou canst put by way of signature , ` Yours till death , the Knight of the Rueful Countenance . ' 
And it will be no great matter if it is in some other person 's hand , for as well as I recollect Dulcinea can neither read nor write , nor in the whole course of her life has she seen handwriting or letter of mine , for my love and hers have been always platonic , not going beyond a modest look , and even that so seldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth will one day devour ; and perhaps even of those four times she has not once perceived that I was looking at her : such is the retirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales have brought her up . '' 
`` So , so ! '' 
said Sancho ; `` Lorenzo Corchuelo 's daughter is the lady Dulcinea del Toboso , otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo ? '' 
`` She it is , '' said Don Quixote , `` and she it is that is worthy to be lady of the whole universe . '' 
`` I know her well , '' said Sancho , `` and let me tell you she can fling a crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town . 
Giver of all good ! 
but she is a brave lass , and a right and stout one , and fit to be helpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be , who may make her his lady : the whoreson wench , what sting she has and what a voice ! 
I can tell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father 's , and though they were better than half a league off they heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower ; and the best of her is that she is not a bit prudish , for she has plenty of affability , and jokes with everybody , and has a grin and a jest for everything . 
So , Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance , I say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake , but you have a good right to give way to despair and hang yourself ; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well , though the devil should take you ; and I wish I were on my road already , simply to see her , for it is many a day since I saw her , and she must be altered by this time , for going about the fields always , and the sun and the air spoil women 's looks greatly . 
But I must own the truth to your worship , Senor Don Quixote ; until now I have been under a great mistake , for I believed truly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love with , or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you have sent her , such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves , and many more no doubt , for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I was not yet your squire . 
But all things considered , what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo , I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso , to have the vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and going down on their knees before her ? 
Because may be when they came she 'd be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor , and they 'd be ashamed to see her , and she 'd laugh , or resent the present . '' 
`` I have before now told thee many times , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` that thou art a mighty great chatterer , and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at sharpness ; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational I am , I would have thee listen to a short story . 
Thou must know that a certain widow , fair , young , independent , and rich , and above all free and easy , fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother ; his superior came to know of it , and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance , ' I am surprised , senora , and not without good reason , that a woman of such high standing , so fair , and so rich as you are , should have fallen in love with such a mean , low , stupid fellow as So-and-so , when in this house there are so many masters , graduates , and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears , saying this one I 'll take , that I wo n't take ; ' but she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour , ` My dear sir , you are very much mistaken , and your ideas are very old-fashioned , if you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so , fool as he seems ; because for all I want with him he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle . ' 
In the same way , Sancho , for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth . 
It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them , had any such mistresses .
