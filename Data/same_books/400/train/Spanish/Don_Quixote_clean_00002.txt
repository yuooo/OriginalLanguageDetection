Sancho Panza , when he saw the friar on the ground , dismounting briskly from his ass , rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown . 
At that instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for . 
Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won . 
The muleteers , who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils , seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach , fell upon Sancho , knocked him down , and leaving hardly a hair in his beard , belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground ; and without any more delay helped the friar to mount , who , trembling , terrified , and pale , as soon as he found himself in the saddle , spurred after his companion , who was standing at a distance looking on , watching the result of the onslaught ; then , not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun , they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them . 
Don Quixote was , as has been said , speaking to the lady in the coach : `` Your beauty , lady mine , '' said he , `` may now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure , for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine ; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer , know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha , knight-errant and adventurer , and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso : and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to El Toboso , and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you free . '' 
One of the squires in attendance upon the coach , a Biscayan , was listening to all Don Quixote was saying , and , perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on , but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso , he made at him , and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion , `` Begone , caballero , and ill go with thee ; by the God that made me , unless thou quittest coach , slayest thee as art here a Biscayan . '' 
Don Quixote understood him quite well , and answered him very quietly , `` If thou wert a knight , as thou art none , I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness , miserable creature . '' 
To which the Biscayan returned , `` I no gentleman ! 
-- I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian : if thou droppest lance and drawest sword , soon shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat : Biscayan on land , hidalgo at sea , hidalgo at the devil , and look , if thou sayest otherwise thou liest . '' '' ' 
`` You will see presently , '' said Agrajes , ' '' replied Don Quixote ; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword , braced his buckler on his arm , and attacked the Biscayan , bent upon taking his life . 
The Biscayan , when he saw him coming on , though he wished to dismount from his mule , in which , being one of those sorry ones let out for hire , he had no confidence , had no choice but to draw his sword ; it was lucky for him , however , that he was near the coach , from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield ; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies . 
The others strove to make peace between them , but could not , for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him . 
The lady in the coach , amazed and terrified at what she saw , ordered the coachman to draw aside a little , and set herself to watch this severe struggle , in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler , which , given to one without armour , would have cleft him to the waist . 
Don Quixote , feeling the weight of this prodigious blow , cried aloud , saying , `` O lady of my soul , Dulcinea , flower of beauty , come to the aid of this your knight , who , in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty , finds himself in this extreme peril . '' 
To say this , to lift his sword , to shelter himself well behind his buckler , and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant , determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow . 
The Biscayan , seeing him come on in this way , was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing , and resolved to follow his example , so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion , being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule , which , dead tired and never meant for this kind of game , could not stir a step . 
On , then , as aforesaid , came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan , with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half , while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand , and under the protection of his cushion ; and all present stood trembling , waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall , and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain , that God might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves . 
But it spoils all , that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending , giving as excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth . 
It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion , or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight ; and this being his persuasion , he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history , which , heaven favouring him , he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part . 
In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted , ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate ; and at this so critical point the delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found . 
This distressed me greatly , because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that , so it seemed to me , was missing of such an interesting tale . 
It appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellous achievements ; a thing that was never wanting to any of those knights-errant who , they say , went after adventures ; for every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose , who not only recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies , however secret they might be ; and such a good knight could not have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in abundance . 
And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated , and I laid the blame on Time , the devourer and destroyer of all things , that had either concealed or consumed it . 
On the other hand , it struck me that , inasmuch as among his books there had been found such modern ones as `` The Enlightenment of Jealousy '' and the `` Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares , '' his story must likewise be modern , and that though it might not be written , it might exist in the memory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood . 
This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard , Don Quixote of La Mancha , light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry , and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry , righting wrongs , succouring widows , and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about , whip in hand , on their palfreys , with all their virginity about them , from mountain to mountain and valley to valley -- for , if it were not for some ruffian , or boor with a hood and hatchet , or monstrous giant , that forced them , there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years , in all which time they had never slept a day under a roof , went to their graves as much maids as the mothers that bore them . 
I say , then , that in these and other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise , nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history ; though I know well that if Heaven , chance and good fortune had not helped me , the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively . 
The discovery of it occurred in this way . 
One day , as I was in the Alcana of Toledo , a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer , and , as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets , led by this natural bent of mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale , and saw that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic , and as I was unable to read them though I could recognise them , I looked about to see if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me ; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter , for even had I sought one for an older and better language I should have found him . 
In short , chance provided me with one , who when I told him what I wanted and put the book into his hands , opened it in the middle and after reading a little in it began to laugh . 
I asked him what he was laughing at , and he replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way of a note . 
I bade him tell it to me ; and he still laughing said , `` In the margin , as I told you , this is written : ` This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history , had , they say , the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting pigs . ' '' 
When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named , I was struck with surprise and amazement , for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained the history of Don Quixote . 
With this idea I pressed him to read the beginning , and doing so , turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian , he told me it meant , `` History of Don Quixote of La Mancha , written by Cide Hamete Benengeli , an Arab historian . '' 
It required great caution to hide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears , and snatching it from the silk mercer , I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half a real ; and if he had had his wits about him and had known how eager I was for them , he might have safely calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain . 
I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral , and begged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue , without omitting or adding anything to them , offering him whatever payment he pleased . 
He was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat , and promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch ; but to make the matter easier , and not to let such a precious find out of my hands , I took him to my house , where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here . 
In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life , they planted in the same attitude as the history describes , their swords raised , and the one protected by his buckler , the other by his cushion , and the Biscayan 's mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off . 
The Biscayan had an inscription under his feet which said , `` Don Sancho de Azpeitia , '' which no doubt must have been his name ; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that said , `` Don Quixote . '' 
Rocinante was marvellously portrayed , so long and thin , so lank and lean , with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption , that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him . 
Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his ass , at whose feet was another label that said , `` Sancho Zancas , '' and according to the picture , he must have had a big belly , a short body , and long shanks , for which reason , no doubt , the names of Panza and Zancas were given him , for by these two surnames the history several times calls him . 
Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned , but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the history ; and no history can be bad so long as it is true . 
If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth , it can only be that its author was an Arab , as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation ; though , as they are such enemies of ours , it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it . 
And this is my own opinion ; for , where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a knight , he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence ; which is ill done and worse contrived , for it is the business and duty of historians to be exact , truthful , and wholly free from passion , and neither interest nor fear , hatred nor love , should make them swerve from the path of truth , whose mother is history , rival of time , storehouse of deeds , witness for the past , example and counsel for the present , and warning for the future . 
In this I know will be found all that can be desired in the pleasantest , and if it be wanting in any good quality , I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of the subject . 
To be brief , its Second Part , according to the translation , began in this way : With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high , it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven , and earth , and hell , with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves . 
The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow , which was delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course , that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight ; but that good fortune which reserved him for greater things , turned aside the sword of his adversary , so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder , it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour , carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear , all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground , leaving him in a sorry plight . 
Good God ! 
Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this fashion ? 
All that can be said is , it was such that he again raised himself in his stirrups , and , grasping his sword more firmly with both hands , he came down on the Biscayan with such fury , smiting him full over the cushion and over the head , that -- even so good a shield proving useless -- as if a mountain had fallen on him , he began to bleed from nose , mouth , and ears , reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule , as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck ; at the same time , however , he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped his arms , and the mule , taking fright at the terrible blow , made off across the plain , and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground . 
Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly , and , when he saw him fall , leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him , and , presenting the point of his sword to his eyes , bade him surrender , or he would cut his head off . 
The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word , and it would have gone hard with him , so blind was Don Quixote , had not the ladies in the coach , who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror , hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire 's life ; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity , `` In truth , fair ladies , I am well content to do what ye ask of me ; but it must be on one condition and understanding , which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso , and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea , that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her . '' 
The terrified and disconsolate ladies , without discussing Don Quixote 's demand or asking who Dulcinea might be , promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded . 
`` Then , on the faith of that promise , '' said Don Quixote , `` I shall do him no further harm , though he well deserves it of me . '' 
Now by this time Sancho had risen , rather the worse for the handling of the friars ' muleteers , and stood watching the battle of his master , Don Quixote , and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to grant him the victory , and that he might thereby win some island to make him governor of , as he had promised . 
Seeing , therefore , that the struggle was now over , and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante , he approached to hold the stirrup for him , and , before he could mount , he went on his knees before him , and taking his hand , kissed it saying , `` May it please your worship , Senor Don Quixote , to give me the government of that island which has been won in this hard fight , for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands . '' 
To which Don Quixote replied , `` Thou must take notice , brother Sancho , that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands , but of cross-roads , in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less : have patience , for adventures will present themselves from which I may make you , not only a governor , but something more . '' 
Sancho gave him many thanks , and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk , helped him to mount Rocinante , and mounting his ass himself , proceeded to follow his master , who at a brisk pace , without taking leave , or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach , turned into a wood that was hard by . 
Sancho followed him at his ass 's best trot , but Rocinante stepped out so that , seeing himself left behind , he was forced to call to his master to wait for him . 
Don Quixote did so , reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up , who on reaching him said , `` It seems to me , senor , it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church , for , seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left , it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us , and , faith , if they do , before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it . '' 
`` Peace , '' said Don Quixote ; `` where hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice , however many homicides he may have committed ? '' 
`` I know nothing about omecils , '' answered Sancho , `` nor in my life have had anything to do with one ; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields , and in that other matter I do not meddle . '' 
`` Then thou needst have no uneasiness , my friend , '' said Don Quixote , `` for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans , much more out of those of the Brotherhood . 
But tell me , as thou livest , hast thou seen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world ; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack , more spirit in maintaining it , more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing ? '' 
`` The truth is , '' answered Sancho , `` that I have never read any history , for I can neither read nor write , but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days of my life , and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said ; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound , for a great deal of blood flows from that ear , and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas . '' 
`` All that might be well dispensed with , '' said Don Quixote , `` if I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras , for time and medicine are saved by one single drop . '' 
`` What vial and what balsam is that ? '' 
said Sancho Panza . 
`` It is a balsam , '' answered Don Quixote , `` the receipt of which I have in my memory , with which one need have no fear of death , or dread dying of any wound ; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the body -- as is wont to happen frequently , -- but neatly and with great nicety , ere the blood congeal , to place that portion of the body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle , taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly . 
Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned , and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple . '' 
`` If that be so , '' said Panza , `` I renounce henceforth the government of the promised island , and desire nothing more in payment of my many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme liquor , for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an ounce anywhere , and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and honour ; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it . '' 
`` With less than three reals , six quarts of it may be made , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` Sinner that I am ! '' 
said Sancho , `` then why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me ? '' 
`` Peace , friend , '' answered Don Quixote ; `` greater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee ; and for the present let us see to the dressing , for my ear pains me more than I could wish . '' 
Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas ; but when Don Quixote came to see his helmet shattered , he was like to lose his senses , and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven , be said , `` I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest extent , to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin -LRB- and that was not to eat bread from a table-cloth , nor embrace his wife , and other points which , though I can not now call them to mind , I here grant as expressed -RRB- until I take complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me . '' 
Hearing this , Sancho said to him , `` Your worship should bear in mind , Senor Don Quixote , that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso , he will have done all that he was bound to do , and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence . '' 
`` Thou hast said well and hit the point , '' answered Don Quixote ; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him , but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good ; and think not , Sancho , that I am raising smoke with straw in doing so , for I have one to imitate in the matter , since the very same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino 's helmet , which cost Sacripante so dear . '' 
`` Senor , '' replied Sancho , `` let your worship send all such oaths to the devil , for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience ; just tell me now , if for several days to come we fall in with no man armed with a helmet , what are we to do ? 
Is the oath to be observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in your clothes , and not to sleep in a house , and a thousand other mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of Mantua , which your worship is now wanting to revive ? 
Let your worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads , nothing but carriers and carters , who not only do not wear helmets , but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives . '' 
`` Thou art wrong there , '' said Don Quixote , `` for we shall not have been above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica . '' 
`` Enough , '' said Sancho ; `` so be it then , and God grant us success , and that the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon come , and then let me die . '' 
`` I have already told thee , Sancho , '' said Don Quixote , `` not to give thyself any uneasiness on that score ; for if an island should fail , there is the kingdom of Denmark , or of Sobradisa , which will fit thee as a ring fits the finger , and all the more that , being on terra firma , thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself . 
But let us leave that to its own time ; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas , because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of , for I swear to thee by God , this ear is giving me great pain . '' 
`` I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread , '' said Sancho , `` but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like your worship . '' 
`` How little thou knowest about it , '' answered Don Quixote ; `` I would have thee to know , Sancho , that it is the glory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month , and even when they do eat , that it should be of what comes first to hand ; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have , for , though they are very many , among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating , unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them , and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance . 
And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions , because , in fact , they were men like ourselves , it is plain too that , wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook , their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me ; so that , friend Sancho , let not that distress thee which pleases me , and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry . '' 
`` Pardon me , your worship , '' said Sancho , `` for , as I can not read or write , as I said just now , I neither know nor comprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry : henceforward I will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship , as you are a knight ; and for myself , as I am not one , I will furnish them with poultry and other things more substantial . '' 
`` I do not say , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote , `` that it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of ; only that their more usual diet must be those , and certain herbs they found in the fields which they knew and I know too . '' 
`` A good thing it is , '' answered Sancho , `` to know those herbs , for to my thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice . '' 
And here taking out what he said he had brought , the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably . 
But anxious to find quarters for the night , they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare , mounted at once , and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in ; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some goatherds , so they determined to pass the night there , and it was as much to Sancho 's discontent not to have reached a house , as it was to his master 's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven , for he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry . 
He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds , and Sancho , having as best he could put up Rocinante and the ass , drew towards the fragrance that came from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire ; and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot to the stomach , he refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed them from the fire , and laying sheepskins on the ground , quickly spread their rude table , and with signs of hearty good-will invited them both to share what they had . 
Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves , having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside down . 
Don Quixote seated himself , and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup , which was made of horn . 
Seeing him standing , his master said to him : `` That thou mayest see , Sancho , the good that knight-errantry contains in itself , and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world , I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people , and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord , and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from ; for the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love , that it levels all . '' 
`` Great thanks , '' said Sancho , `` but I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to eat , I can eat it as well , or better , standing , and by myself , than seated alongside of an emperor . 
And indeed , if the truth is to be told , what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more relish for me , even though it be bread and onions , than the turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly , drink little , wipe my mouth every minute , and can not sneeze or cough if I want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude . 
So , senor , as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry , exchange them for other things which may be of more use and advantage to me ; for these , though I fully acknowledge them as received , I renounce from this moment to the end of the world . '' 
`` For all that , '' said Don Quixote , `` thou must seat thyself , because him who humbleth himself God exalteth ; '' and seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down beside himself . 
The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and knights-errant , and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their guests , who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big as one 's fist . 
The course of meat finished , they spread upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns , and with them they put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar . 
All this while the horn was not idle , for it went round so constantly , now full , now empty , like the bucket of a water-wheel , that it soon drained one of the two wine-skins that were in sight . 
When Don Quixote had quite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns , and contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion : `` Happy the age , happy the time , to which the ancients gave the name of golden , not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our iron one was gained without toil , but because they that lived in it knew not the two words `` mine '' and `` thine '' ! 
In that blessed age all things were in common ; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit . 
The clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance . 
The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees , offering without usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand . 
The mighty cork trees , unenforced save of their own courtesy , shed the broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes , a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone . 
Then all was peace , all friendship , all concord ; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy , sustain , and delight the children that then possessed her . 
Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill , with flowing locks , and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide . 
Nor were their ornaments like those in use to-day , set off by Tyrian purple , and silk tortured in endless fashions , but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy , wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them . 
Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them , nor sought to commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage . 
Fraud , deceit , or malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity . 
Justice held her ground , undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of interest , that now so much impair , pervert , and beset her . 
Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge , for then there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged . 
Maidens and modesty , as I have said , wandered at will alone and unattended , without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault , and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure . 
But now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe , not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her ; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity , and , despite of all seclusion , lead them to ruin . 
In defence of these , as time advanced and wickedness increased , the order of knights-errant was instituted , to defend maidens , to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy . 
To this order I belong , brother goatherds , to whom I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire ; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant , yet , seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me , it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for yours . '' 
All this long harangue -LRB- which might very well have been spared -RRB- our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age ; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds , who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply . 
Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns , and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin , which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool . 
Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing , at the end of which one of the goatherds said , `` That your worship , senor knight-errant , may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will , we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing : he will be here before long , and he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love , and what is more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection . '' 
The goatherd had hardly done speaking , when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears ; and shortly after , the player came up , a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty . 
His comrades asked him if he had supped , and on his replying that he had , he who had already made the offer said to him : `` In that case , Antonio , thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little , that the gentleman , our guest , may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians : we have told him of thy accomplishments , and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true ; so , as thou livest , pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee , and that was so much liked in the town . '' 
`` With all my heart , '' said the young man , and without waiting for more pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak , and tuning his rebeck , presently began to sing to these words . 
ANTONIO 'S BALLAD Thou dost love me well , Olalla ; Well I know it , even though Love 's mute tongues , thine eyes , have never By their glances told me so . 
For I know my love thou knowest , Therefore thine to claim I dare : Once it ceases to be secret , Love need never feel despair . 
True it is , Olalla , sometimes Thou hast all too plainly shown That thy heart is brass in hardness , And thy snowy bosom stone . 
Yet for all that , in thy coyness , And thy fickle fits between , Hope is there -- at least the border Of her garment may be seen . 
Lures to faith are they , those glimpses , And to faith in thee I hold ; Kindness can not make it stronger , Coldness can not make it cold . 
If it be that love is gentle , In thy gentleness I see Something holding out assurance To the hope of winning thee . 
If it be that in devotion Lies a power hearts to move , That which every day I show thee , Helpful to my suit should prove . 
Many a time thou must have noticed -- If to notice thou dost care -- How I go about on Monday Dressed in all my Sunday wear . 
Love 's eyes love to look on brightness ; Love loves what is gaily drest ; Sunday , Monday , all I care is Thou shouldst see me in my best . 
No account I make of dances , Or of strains that pleased thee so , Keeping thee awake from midnight Till the cocks began to crow ; Or of how I roundly swore it That there 's none so fair as thou ; True it is , but as I said it , By the girls I 'm hated now . 
For Teresa of the hillside At my praise of thee was sore ; Said , `` You think you love an angel ; It 's a monkey you adore ; `` Caught by all her glittering trinkets , And her borrowed braids of hair , And a host of made-up beauties That would Love himself ensnare . '' ' 
T was a lie , and so I told her , And her cousin at the word Gave me his defiance for it ; And what followed thou hast heard . 
Mine is no high-flown affection , Mine no passion par amours -- As they call it -- what I offer Is an honest love , and pure . 
Cunning cords the holy Church has , Cords of softest silk they be ; Put thy neck beneath the yoke , dear ; Mine will follow , thou wilt see . 
Else -- and once for all I swear it By the saint of most renown -- If I ever quit the mountains , ' T will be in a friar 's gown . 
Here the goatherd brought his song to an end , and though Don Quixote entreated him to sing more , Sancho had no mind that way , being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs ; so said he to his master , `` Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night , for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to spend the night in singing . '' 
`` I understand thee , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` I perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music . '' 
`` It 's sweet to us all , blessed be God , '' said Sancho . 
`` I do not deny it , '' replied Don Quixote ; `` but settle thyself where thou wilt ; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping ; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again , for it is giving me more pain than it need . '' 
Sancho did as he bade him , but one of the goatherds , seeing the wound , told him not to be uneasy , as he would apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed ; and gathering some leaves of rosemary , of which there was a great quantity there , he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt , and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage , assuring him that no other treatment would be required , and so it proved . 
Just then another young man , one of those who fetched their provisions from the village , came up and said , `` Do you know what is going on in the village , comrades ? '' 
`` How could we know it ? '' 
replied one of them . 
`` Well , then , you must know , '' continued the young man , `` this morning that famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died , and it is rumoured that he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of Guillermo the Rich , she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of a shepherdess . '' 
`` You mean Marcela ? '' 
said one . 
`` Her I mean , '' answered the goatherd ; `` and the best of it is , he has directed in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor , and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is , because , as the story goes -LRB- and they say he himself said so -RRB- , that was the place where he first saw her . 
And he has also left other directions which the clergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they savour of paganism . 
To all which his great friend Ambrosio the student , he who , like him , also went dressed as a shepherd , replies that everything must be done without any omission according to the directions left by Chrysostom , and about this the village is all in commotion ; however , report says that , after all , what Ambrosio and all the shepherds his friends desire will be done , and to-morrow they are coming to bury him with great ceremony where I said . 
I am sure it will be something worth seeing ; at least I will not fail to go and see it even if I knew I should not return to the village tomorrow . '' 
`` We will do the same , '' answered the goatherds , `` and cast lots to see who must stay to mind the goats of all . '' 
`` Thou sayest well , Pedro , '' said one , `` though there will be no need of taking that trouble , for I will stay behind for all ; and do n't suppose it is virtue or want of curiosity in me ; it is that the splinter that ran into my foot the other day will not let me walk . '' 
`` For all that , we thank thee , '' answered Pedro . 
Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the shepherdess , to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains , who had been a student at Salamanca for many years , at the end of which he returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and deeply read . 
`` Above all , they said , he was learned in the science of the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon , for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time . '' 
`` Eclipse it is called , friend , not cris , the darkening of those two luminaries , '' said Don Quixote ; but Pedro , not troubling himself with trifles , went on with his story , saying , `` Also he foretold when the year was going to be one of abundance or estility . '' 
`` Sterility , you mean , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` Sterility or estility , '' answered Pedro , `` it is all the same in the end . 
And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him grew very rich because they did as he advised them , bidding them ` sow barley this year , not wheat ; this year you may sow pulse and not barley ; the next there will be a full oil crop , and the three following not a drop will be got . ' '' 
`` That science is called astrology , '' said Don Quixote . 
`` I do not know what it is called , '' replied Pedro , `` but I know that he knew all this and more besides . 
But , to make an end , not many months had passed after he returned from Salamanca , when one day he appeared dressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin , having put off the long gown he wore as a scholar ; and at the same time his great friend , Ambrosio by name , who had been his companion in his studies , took to the shepherd 's dress with him . 
I forgot to say that Chrysostom , who is dead , was a great man for writing verses , so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve , and plays for Corpus Christi , which the young men of our village acted , and all said they were excellent . 
When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd 's dress , they were lost in wonder , and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change . 
About this time the father of our Chrysostom died , and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land , no small number of cattle and sheep , and a large sum of money , of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner , and indeed he was deserving of it all , for he was a very good comrade , and kind-hearted , and a friend of worthy folk , and had a countenance like a benediction . 
Presently it came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago , with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love . 
And I must tell you now , for it is well you should know it , who this girl is ; perhaps , and even without any perhaps , you will not have heard anything like it all the days of your life , though you should live more years than sarna . '' 
`` Say Sarra , '' said Don Quixote , unable to endure the goatherd 's confusion of words . 
`` The sarna lives long enough , '' answered Pedro ; `` and if , senor , you must go finding fault with words at every step , we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth . '' 
`` Pardon me , friend , '' said Don Quixote ; `` but , as there is such a difference between sarna and Sarra , I told you of it ; however , you have answered very rightly , for sarna lives longer than Sarra : so continue your story , and I will not object any more to anything . '' 
`` I say then , my dear sir , '' said the goatherd , `` that in our village there was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom , who was named Guillermo , and upon whom God bestowed , over and above great wealth , a daughter at whose birth her mother died , the most respected woman there was in this neighbourhood ; I fancy I can see her now with that countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other ; and moreover active , and kind to the poor , for which I trust that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other world . 
Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife , leaving his daughter Marcela , a child and rich , to the care of an uncle of hers , a priest and prebendary in our village . 
The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother 's , which was very great , and yet it was thought that the daughter 's would exceed it ; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful , and the greater number were in love with her past redemption . 
Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement , but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that , as well for it as for her great wealth , her uncle was asked , solicited , and importuned , to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round , and by the persons of highest quality in them . 
But he , being a good Christian man , though he desired to give her in marriage at once , seeing her to be old enough , was unwilling to do so without her consent , not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl 's property brought him while he put off her marriage ; and , faith , this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town . 
For I would have you know , Sir Errant , that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at , and rest assured , as I am , that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him , especially in villages . '' 
`` That is the truth , '' said Don Quixote ; `` but go on , for the story is very good , and you , good Pedro , tell it with very good grace . '' 
`` May that of the Lord not be wanting to me , '' said Pedro ; `` that is the one to have . 
To proceed ; you must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage , begging her to marry and make a choice according to her own taste , she never gave any other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet , and that being so young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony . 
At these , to all appearance , reasonable excuses that she made , her uncle ceased to urge her , and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her own liking . 
For , said he -- and he said quite right -- parents are not to settle children in life against their will . 
But when one least looked for it , lo and behold ! 
one day the demure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess ; and , in spite of her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her , took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village , and tending her own flock . 
And so , since she appeared in public , and her beauty came to be seen openly , I could not well tell you how many rich youths , gentlemen and peasants , have adopted the costume of Chrysostom , and go about these fields making love to her . 
One of these , as has been already said , was our deceased friend , of whom they say that he did not love but adore her . 
But you must not suppose , because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence , and of so little or rather no retirement , that she has given any occasion , or even the semblance of one , for disparagement of her purity and modesty ; on the contrary , such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches over her honour , that of all those that court and woo her not one has boasted , or can with truth boast , that she has given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire . 
For although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds , and treats them courteously and kindly , should any one of them come to declare his intention to her , though it be one as proper and holy as that of matrimony , she flings him from her like a catapult . 
And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague had got into it , for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her , but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair ; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted , and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her character ; and if you should remain here any time , senor , you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her . 
Not far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches , and there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela , and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty . 
Here one shepherd is sighing , there another is lamenting ; there love songs are heard , here despairing elegies . 
One will pass all the hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock , and there , without having closed his weeping eyes , the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft of sense ; and another without relief or respite to his sighs , stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide , makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens , and over one and the other , over these and all , the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless . 
And all of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride will come to , and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme . 
All that I have told you being such well-established truth , I am persuaded that what they say of the cause of Chrysostom 's death , as our lad told us , is the same . 
And so I advise you , senor , fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial , which will be well worth seeing , for Chrysostom had many friends , and it is not half a league from this place to where he directed he should be buried . '' 
`` I will make a point of it , '' said Don Quixote , `` and I thank you for the pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale . '' 
`` Oh , '' said the goatherd , `` I do not know even the half of what has happened to the lovers of Marcela , but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with some shepherd on the road who can tell us ; and now it will be well for you to go and sleep under cover , for the night air may hurt your wound , though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of an untoward result . '' 
Sancho Panza , who was wishing the goatherd 's loquacity at the devil , on his part begged his master to go into Pedro 's hut to sleep . 
He did so , and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea , in imitation of the lovers of Marcela . 
Sancho Panza settled himself between Rocinante and his ass , and slept , not like a lover who had been discarded , but like a man who had been soundly kicked . 
Bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east , when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of Chrysostom they would bear him company . 
Don Quixote , who desired nothing better , rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once , which he did with all despatch , and with the same they all set out forthwith . 
They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander . 
Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand , and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress , with three servants on foot accompanying them . 
Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting , and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going , they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial , so they went on all together . 
One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him , `` It seems to me , Senor Vivaldo , that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral , for remarkable it can not but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us , of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess . '' 
`` So I think too , '' replied Vivaldo , `` and I would delay not to say a day , but four , for the sake of seeing it . '' 
Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and Chrysostom . 
The traveller answered that the same morning they had met these shepherds , and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise ; which one of them gave , describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess called Marcela , and the loves of many who courted her , together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were going . 
In short , he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote . 
This conversation dropped , and another was commenced by him who was called Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful . 
To which Don Quixote replied , `` The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any other fashion ; easy life , enjoyment , and repose were invented for soft courtiers , but toil , unrest , and arms were invented and made for those alone whom the world calls knights-errant , of whom I , though unworthy , am the least of all . '' 
The instant they heard this all set him down as mad , and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was , Vivaldo proceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant . 
`` Have not your worships , '' replied Don Quixote , `` read the annals and histories of England , in which are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur , whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus , with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition , and commonly received all over that kingdom of Great Britain , that this king did not die , but was changed by magic art into a raven , and that in process of time he is to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre ; for which reason it can not be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a raven ? 
Well , then , in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was instituted , and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred , precisely as is there related , the go-between and confidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintanona , whence came that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain -- O never surely was there knight So served by hand of dame , As served was he Sir Lancelot hight When he from Britain came -- with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and war . 
Handed down from that time , then , this order of chivalry went on extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world ; and in it , famous and renowned for their deeds , were the mighty Amadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation , and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania , and the never sufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco , and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece . 
This , then , sirs , is to be a knight-errant , and what I have spoken of is the order of his chivalry , of which , as I have already said , I , though a sinner , have made profession , and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I profess , and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures , resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy . '' 
By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of Don Quixote 's being out of his senses and of the form of madness that overmastered him , at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt on first becoming acquainted with it ; and Vivaldo , who was a person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament , in order to beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain , the scene of the burial , sought to give him an opportunity of going on with his absurdities . 
So he said to him , `` It seems to me , Senor Knight-errant , that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in the world , and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere . '' 
`` As austere it may perhaps be , '' replied our Don Quixote , `` but so necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt . 
For , if the truth is to be told , the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order . 
My meaning , is , that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world , but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for , defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords , not under shelter but in the open air , a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter . 
Thus are we God 's ministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein . 
And as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it can not be conducted without exceeding great sweat , toil , and exertion , it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak . 
I do not mean to say , nor does it enter into my thoughts , that the knight-errant 's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell ; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one , a hungrier and thirstier , a wretcheder , raggeder , and lousier ; for there is no reason to doubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives . 
And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors , in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat ; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes . '' 
`` That is my own opinion , '' replied the traveller ; `` but one thing among many others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant , and that is that when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives , they never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to God , as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril ; instead of which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were their gods , a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism . '' 
`` Sir , '' answered Don Quixote , `` that can not be on any account omitted , and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise : for it is usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant , who on engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him , should turn his eyes towards her softly and lovingly , as though with them entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake , and even though no one hear him , he is bound to say certain words between his teeth , commending himself to her with all his heart , and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories . 
Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God , for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task . '' 
`` For all that , '' answered the traveller , `` I feel some doubt still , because often I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant , and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field , and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge , and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies ; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist 's lance , and as for the other , it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground ; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this ; it would have been better if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a Christian . 
Moreover , it is my belief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to , for they are not all in love . '' 
`` That is impossible , '' said Don Quixote : `` I say it is impossible that there could be a knight-errant without a lady , because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars : most certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant without an amour , and for the simple reason that without one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard , and one who had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood , not by the door , but over the wall like a thief and a robber . '' 
`` Nevertheless , '' said the traveller , `` if I remember rightly , I think I have read that Don Galaor , the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul , never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself , and yet he was not the less esteemed , and was a very stout and famous knight . '' 
To which our Don Quixote made answer , `` Sir , one solitary swallow does not make summer ; moreover , I know that knight was in secret very deeply in love ; besides which , that way of falling in love with all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control . 
But , in short , it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his will , to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly , for he prided himself on being a reticent knight . '' 
`` Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love , '' said the traveller , `` it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so , as you are of the order ; and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent as Don Galaor , I entreat you as earnestly as I can , in the name of all this company and in my own , to inform us of the name , country , rank , and beauty of your lady , for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be . '' 
At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said , `` I can not say positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I serve her ; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me , that her name is Dulcinea , her country El Toboso , a village of La Mancha , her rank must be at least that of a princess , since she is my queen and lady , and her beauty superhuman , since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her ; for her hairs are gold , her forehead Elysian fields , her eyebrows rainbows , her eyes suns , her cheeks roses , her lips coral , her teeth pearls , her neck alabaster , her bosom marble , her hands ivory , her fairness snow , and what modesty conceals from sight such , I think and imagine , as rational reflection can only extol , not compare . '' 
`` We should like to know her lineage , race , and ancestry , '' said Vivaldo . 
To which Don Quixote replied , `` She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii , Caii , or Scipios , nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini , nor of the Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia , nor yet of the Rebellas or Villanovas of Valencia ; Palafoxes , Nuzas , Rocabertis , Corellas , Lunas , Alagones , Urreas , Foces , or Gurreas of Aragon ; Cerdas , Manriques , Mendozas , or Guzmans of Castile ; Alencastros , Pallas , or Meneses of Portugal ; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha , a lineage that though modern , may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come , and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot of the trophy of Orlando 's arms , saying , ` These let none move Who dareth not his might with Roland prove . ' '' 
`` Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo , '' said the traveller , `` I will not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha , though , to tell the truth , no such surname has until now ever reached my ears . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said Don Quixote , `` has that never reached them ? '' 
The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the conversation of the pair , and even the very goatherds and shepherds perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was . 
Sancho Panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth , knowing who he was and having known him from his birth ; and all that he felt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso , because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso . 
They were going along conversing in this way , when they saw descending a gap between two high mountains some twenty shepherds , all clad in sheepskins of black wool , and crowned with garlands which , as afterwards appeared , were , some of them of yew , some of cypress . 
Six of the number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers and branches , on seeing which one of the goatherds said , `` Those who come there are the bearers of Chrysostom 's body , and the foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him . '' 
They therefore made haste to reach the spot , and did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground , and four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock . 
They greeted each other courteously , and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier , and on it , covered with flowers , they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd , to all appearance of one thirty years of age , and showing even in death that in life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing . 
Around him on the bier itself were laid some books , and several papers open and folded ; and those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the others who were there preserved a strange silence , until one of those who had borne the body said to another , `` Observe carefully , Ambrosia if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of , since you are anxious that what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with . '' 
`` This is the place , '' answered Ambrosia `` for in it many a time did my poor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune . 
Here it was , he told me , that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race , and here , too , for the first time he declared to her his passion , as honourable as it was devoted , and here it was that at last Marcela ended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched life to a close ; here , in memory of misfortunes so great , he desired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion . '' 
Then turning to Don Quixote and the travellers he went on to say , `` That body , sirs , on which you are looking with compassionate eyes , was the abode of a soul on which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches . 
That is the body of Chrysostom , who was unrivalled in wit , unequalled in courtesy , unapproached in gentle bearing , a phoenix in friendship , generous without limit , grave without arrogance , gay without vulgarity , and , in short , first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune . 
He loved deeply , he was hated ; he adored , he was scorned ; he wooed a wild beast , he pleaded with marble , he pursued the wind , he cried to the wilderness , he served ingratitude , and for reward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life , cut short by a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man , as these papers which you see could fully prove , had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to the earth . '' 
`` You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner himself , '' said Vivaldo , `` for it is neither right nor proper to do the will of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable ; it would not have been reasonable in Augustus Caesar had he permitted the directions left by the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect . 
So that , Senor Ambrosia while you consign your friend 's body to the earth , you should not consign his writings to oblivion , for if he gave the order in bitterness of heart , it is not right that you should irrationally obey it . 
On the contrary , by granting life to those papers , let the cruelty of Marcela live for ever , to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger ; or I and all of us who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend , and we know , too , your friendship , and the cause of his death , and the directions he gave at the close of his life ; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela , the love of Chrysostom , and the loyalty of your friendship , together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes . 
Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here , and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion , and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence , we beg of you , excellent Ambrosia , or at least I on my own account entreat you , that instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them . '' 
And without waiting for the shepherd 's answer , he stretched out his hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him ; seeing which Ambrosio said , `` Out of courtesy , senor , I will grant your request as to those you have taken , but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the remainder . '' 
Vivaldo , who was eager to see what the papers contained , opened one of them at once , and saw that its title was `` Lay of Despair . '' 
Ambrosio hearing it said , `` That is the last paper the unhappy man wrote ; and that you may see , senor , to what an end his misfortunes brought him , read it so that you may be heard , for you will have time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug . '' 
`` I will do so very willingly , '' said Vivaldo ; and as all the bystanders were equally eager they gathered round him , and he , reading in a loud voice , found that it ran as follows . 
THE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire The ruthless rigour of thy tyranny From tongue to tongue , from land to land proclaimed , The very Hell will I constrain to lend This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe To serve my need of fitting utterance . 
And as I strive to body forth the tale Of all I suffer , all that thou hast done , Forth shall the dread voice roll , and bear along Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain . 
Then listen , not to dulcet harmony , But to a discord wrung by mad despair Out of this bosom 's depths of bitterness , To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine . 
The lion 's roar , the fierce wolf 's savage howl , The horrid hissing of the scaly snake , The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed , The crow 's ill-boding croak , the hollow moan Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea , The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull , The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove , The envied owl 's sad note , the wail of woe That rises from the dreary choir of Hell , Commingled in one sound , confusing sense , Let all these come to aid my soul 's complaint , For pain like mine demands new modes of song . 
No echoes of that discord shall be heard Where Father Tagus rolls , or on the banks Of olive-bordered Betis ; to the rocks Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told , And by a lifeless tongue in living words ; Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores , Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls ; Or in among the poison-breathing swarms Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile . 
For , though it be to solitudes remote The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound Thy matchless cruelty , my dismal fate Shall carry them to all the spacious world . 
Disdain hath power to kill , and patience dies Slain by suspicion , be it false or true ; And deadly is the force of jealousy ; Long absence makes of life a dreary void ; No hope of happiness can give repose To him that ever fears to be forgot ; And death , inevitable , waits in hall . 
But I , by some strange miracle , live on A prey to absence , jealousy , disdain ; Racked by suspicion as by certainty ; Forgotten , left to feed my flame alone . 
And while I suffer thus , there comes no ray Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom ; Nor do I look for it in my despair ; But rather clinging to a cureless woe , All hope do I abjure for evermore . 
Can there be hope where fear is ? 
Were it well , When far more certain are the grounds of fear ? 
Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy , If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears ? 
Who would not give free access to distrust , Seeing disdain unveiled , and -- bitter change ! 
-- All his suspicions turned to certainties , And the fair truth transformed into a lie ? 
Oh , thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love , Oh , Jealousy ! 
put chains upon these hands , And bind me with thy strongest cord , Disdain . 
But , woe is me ! 
triumphant over all , My sufferings drown the memory of you . 
And now I die , and since there is no hope Of happiness for me in life or death , Still to my fantasy I 'll fondly cling . 
I 'll say that he is wise who loveth well , And that the soul most free is that most bound In thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love . 
I 'll say that she who is mine enemy In that fair body hath as fair a mind , And that her coldness is but my desert , And that by virtue of the pain he sends Love rules his kingdom with a gentle sway . 
Thus , self-deluding , and in bondage sore , And wearing out the wretched shred of life To which I am reduced by her disdain , I 'll give this soul and body to the winds , All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store . 
Thou whose injustice hath supplied the cause That makes me quit the weary life I loathe , As by this wounded bosom thou canst see How willingly thy victim I become , Let not my death , if haply worth a tear , Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes ; I would not have thee expiate in aught The crime of having made my heart thy prey ; But rather let thy laughter gaily ring And prove my death to be thy festival . 
Fool that I am to bid thee ! 
well I know Thy glory gains by my untimely end . 
And now it is the time ; from Hell 's abyss Come thirsting Tantalus , come Sisyphus Heaving the cruel stone , come Tityus With vulture , and with wheel Ixion come , And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil ; And all into this breast transfer their pains , And -LRB- if such tribute to despair be due -RRB- Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge Over a corse unworthy of a shroud . 
Let the three-headed guardian of the gate , And all the monstrous progeny of hell , The doleful concert join : a lover dead Methinks can have no fitter obsequies . 
Lay of despair , grieve not when thou art gone Forth from this sorrowing heart : my misery Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth ; Then banish sadness even in the tomb . 
The `` Lay of Chrysostom '' met with the approbation of the listeners , though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of Marcela 's reserve and propriety , for Chrysostom complained in it of jealousy , suspicion , and absence , all to the prejudice of the good name and fame of Marcela ; to which Ambrosio replied as one who knew well his friend 's most secret thoughts , `` Senor , to remove that doubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from Marcela , from whom he had voluntarily separated himself , to try if absence would act with him as it is wont ; and as everything distresses and every fear haunts the banished lover , so imaginary jealousies and suspicions , dreaded as if they were true , tormented Chrysostom ; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken , and with her envy itself should not and can not find any fault save that of being cruel , somewhat haughty , and very scornful . '' 
`` That is true , '' said Vivaldo ; and as he was about to read another paper of those he had preserved from the fire , he was stopped by a marvellous vision -LRB- for such it seemed -RRB- that unexpectedly presented itself to their eyes ; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave there appeared the shepherdess Marcela , so beautiful that her beauty exceeded its reputation . 
Those who had never till then beheld her gazed upon her in wonder and silence , and those who were accustomed to see her were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before . 
But the instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her , with manifest indignation : `` Art thou come , by chance , cruel basilisk of these mountains , to see if in thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thy cruelty has robbed of life ; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thy humours that thou art come ; or like another pitiless Nero to look down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers ; or in thy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse , as the ungrateful daughter trampled on her father Tarquin 's ? 
Tell us quickly for what thou art come , or what it is thou wouldst have , for , as I know the thoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life , I will make all these who call themselves his friends obey thee , though he be dead . '' 
`` I come not , Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named , '' replied Marcela , `` but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all those who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom 's death ; and therefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention , for will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense . 
Heaven has made me , so you say , beautiful , and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me ; and for the love you show me you say , and even urge , that I am bound to love you . 
By that natural understanding which God has given me I know that everything beautiful attracts love , but I can not see how , by reason of being loved , that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it ; besides , it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly , and ugliness being detestable , it is very absurd to say , `` I love thee because thou art beautiful , thou must love me though I be ugly . '' 
But supposing the beauty equal on both sides , it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike , for it is not every beauty that excites love , some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection ; and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart , the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any ; for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations , and true love , I have heard it said , is indivisible , and must be voluntary and not compelled . 
If this be so , as I believe it to be , why do you desire me to bend my will by force , for no other reason but that you say you love me ? 
Nay -- tell me -- had Heaven made me ugly , as it has made me beautiful , could I with justice complain of you for not loving me ? 
Moreover , you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of mine , for , be it what it may , Heaven of its bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it ; and as the viper , though it kills with it , does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries , as it is a gift of nature , neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful ; for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword ; the one does not burn , the other does not cut , those who do not come too near . 
Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind , without which the body , though it be so , has no right to pass for beautiful ; but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body , why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it ? 
I was born free , and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields ; in the trees of the mountains I find society , the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors , and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and charms . 
I am a fire afar off , a sword laid aside . 
Those whom I have inspired with love by letting them see me , I have by words undeceived , and if their longings live on hope -- and I have given none to Chrysostom or to any other -- it can not justly be said that the death of any is my doing , for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed him ; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were honourable , and that therefore I was bound to yield to them , I answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to me his purity of purpose , I told him that mine was to live in perpetual solitude , and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty ; and if , after this open avowal , he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind , what wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation ? 
If I had encouraged him , I should be false ; if I had gratified him , I should have acted against my own better resolution and purpose . 
He was persistent in spite of warning , he despaired without being hated . 
Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge . 
Let him who has been deceived complain , let him give way to despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain , let him flatter himself whom I shall entice , let him boast whom I shall receive ; but let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise , upon whom I practise no deception , whom I neither entice nor receive . 
It has not been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate , and to expect me to love by choice is idle . 
Let this general declaration serve for each of my suitors on his own account , and let it be understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he dies , for she who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any , and candour is not to be confounded with scorn . 
Let him who calls me wild beast and basilisk , leave me alone as something noxious and evil ; let him who calls me ungrateful , withhold his service ; who calls me wayward , seek not my acquaintance ; who calls me cruel , pursue me not ; for this wild beast , this basilisk , this ungrateful , cruel , wayward being has no kind of desire to seek , serve , know , or follow them . 
If Chrysostom 's impatience and violent passion killed him , why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be blamed ? 
If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees , why should he who would have me preserve it among men , seek to rob me of it ? 
I have , as you know , wealth of my own , and I covet not that of others ; my taste is for freedom , and I have no relish for constraint ; I neither love nor hate anyone ; I do not deceive this one or court that , or trifle with one or play with another . 
The modest converse of the shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations ; my desires are bounded by these mountains , and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens , steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode . '' 
With these words , and not waiting to hear a reply , she turned and passed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by , leaving all who were there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty . 
Some -- those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright eyes -- made as though they would follow her , heedless of the frank declaration they had heard ; seeing which , and deeming this a fitting occasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels , Don Quixote , laying his hand on the hilt of his sword , exclaimed in a loud and distinct voice : `` Let no one , whatever his rank or condition , dare to follow the beautiful Marcela , under pain of incurring my fierce indignation . 
She has shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found with her for the death of Chrysostom , and also how far she is from yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers , for which reason , instead of being followed and persecuted , she should in justice be honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world , for she shows that she is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution . '' 
Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote , or because Ambrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend , none of the shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until , having finished the grave and burned Chrysostom 's papers , they laid his body in it , not without many tears from those who stood by . 
They closed the grave with a heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to have prepared , with an epitaph which was to be to this effect : Beneath the stone before your eyes The body of a lover lies ; In life he was a shepherd swain , In death a victim to disdain . 
Ungrateful , cruel , coy , and fair , Was she that drove him to despair , And Love hath made her his ally For spreading wide his tyranny . 
They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches , and all expressing their condolence with his friend ambrosio , took their Vivaldo and his companion did the same ; and Don Quixote bade farewell to his hosts and to the travellers , who pressed him to come with them to Seville , as being such a convenient place for finding adventures , for they presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener than anywhere else . 
Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for the disposition they showed to do him a favour , and said that for the present he would not , and must not go to Seville until he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers , of whom report said they were full . 
Seeing his good intention , the travellers were unwilling to press him further , and once more bidding him farewell , they left him and pursued their journey , in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote . 
He , on his part , resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela , and make offer to her of all the service he could render her ; but things did not fall out with him as he expected , according to what is related in the course of this veracious history , of which the Second Part ends here . 
The sage Cide Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of Chrysostom , he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had seen the shepherdess Marcela enter , and after having wandered for more than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her , they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass , beside which ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the hours of the noontide heat , which by this time was beginning to come on oppressively . 
Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted , and turning Rocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance , they ransacked the alforjas , and without any ceremony very peacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them . 
Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante , feeling sure , from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence , that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety . 
Chance , however , and the devil , who is not always asleep , so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers , whose way it is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound ; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans ' purpose very well . 
It so happened , then , that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies , and abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them , he , without asking leave of his master , got up a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his wishes to them ; they , however , it seemed , preferred their pasture to him , and received him with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a saddle to cover him ; but what must have been worse to him was that the carriers , seeing the violence he was offering to their mares , came running up armed with stakes , and so belaboured him that they brought him sorely battered to the ground . 
By this time Don Quixote and Sancho , who had witnessed the drubbing of Rocinante , came up panting , and said Don Quixote to Sancho : `` So far as I can see , friend Sancho , these are not knights but base folk of low birth : I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes . '' 
`` What the devil vengeance can we take , '' answered Sancho , `` if they are more than twenty , and we no more than two , or , indeed , perhaps not more than one and a half ? '' 
`` I count for a hundred , '' replied Don Quixote , and without more words he drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the example of his master , Sancho did the same ; and to begin with , Don Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he wore , together with a great portion of his shoulder . 
The Yanguesans , seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many , betook themselves to their stakes , and driving the two into the middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy ; in fact , at the second blow they brought Sancho to the ground , and Don Quixote fared the same way , all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing , and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante , who had not yet risen ; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish hands . 
Then , seeing the mischief they had done , the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey , leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood . 
Sancho was the first to come to , and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice , `` Senor Don Quixote , ah , Senor Don Quixote ! '' 
`` What wouldst thou , brother Sancho ? '' 
answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho . 
`` I would like , if it were possible , '' answered Sancho Panza , `` your worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas , if it be that you have any to hand there ; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds . '' 
`` If I only had it here , wretch that I am , what more should we want ? '' 
said Don Quixote ; `` but I swear to thee , Sancho Panza , on the faith of a knight-errant , ere two days are over , unless fortune orders otherwise , I mean to have it in my possession , or my hand will have lost its cunning . '' 
`` But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet ? '' 
answered Sancho Panza . 
`` For myself I must say I can not guess how many , '' said the battered knight Don Quixote ; `` but I take all the blame upon myself , for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself , and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me ; for which reason , brother Sancho , it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee , for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us . 
It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against them , for I shall not do so at all ; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart 's content , and if any knights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might ; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal to '' -- so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan . 
But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master 's admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply , `` Senor , I am a man of peace , meek and quiet , and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and children to support and bring up ; so let it be likewise a hint to your worship , as it can not be a mandate , that on no account will I draw sword either against clown or against knight , and that here before God I forgive the insults that have been offered me , whether they have been , are , or shall be offered me by high or low , rich or poor , noble or commoner , not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever . '' 
To all which his master said in reply , `` I wish I had breath enough to speak somewhat easily , and that the pain I feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee , Panza , the mistake thou makest . 
Come now , sinner , suppose the wind of fortune , hitherto so adverse , should turn in our favour , filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have promised thee , how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it ? 
Why , thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one , nor possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship ; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more , and try , as they say , what chance may do for them ; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern , and valour to attack and defend himself , whatever may befall him . '' 
`` In what has now befallen us , '' answered Sancho , `` I 'd have been well pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of , but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for arguments . 
See if your worship can get up , and let us help Rocinante , though he does not deserve it , for he was the main cause of all this thrashing . 
I never thought it of Rocinante , for I took him to be a virtuous person and as quiet as myself . 
After all , they say right that it takes a long time to come to know people , and that there is nothing sure in this life . 
Who would have said that , after such mighty slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant , there was coming , travelling post and at the very heels of them , such a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders ? '' 
`` And yet thine , Sancho , '' replied Don Quixote , `` ought to be used to such squalls ; but mine , reared in soft cloth and fine linen , it is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap , and if it were not that I imagine -- why do I say imagine ? 
-- know of a certainty that all these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms , I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation . '' 
To this the squire replied , `` Senor , as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry , tell me if they happen very often , or if they have their own fixed times for coming to pass ; because it seems to me that after two harvests we shall be no good for the third , unless God in his infinite mercy helps us . '' 
`` Know , friend Sancho , '' answered Don Quixote , `` that the life of knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses , and neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to become kings and emperors , as experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted ; and I could tell thee now , if the pain would let me , of some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned ; and those same , both before and after , experienced divers misfortunes and miseries ; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician , who , it is positively asserted , holding him captive , gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court ; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus , being caught in a certain pitfall , which opened under his feet in a certain castle , on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground , where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters , of sand and snow-water , that well-nigh finished him ; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage , a great friend of his , it would have gone very hard with the poor knight ; so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk , for greater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we suffer . 
For I would have thee know , Sancho , that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity , and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words : if , for instance , the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand , though it be in fact a piece of wood , it can not be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled . 
I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity ; for the arms those men carried , with which they pounded us , were nothing more than their stakes , and not one of them , so far as I remember , carried rapier , sword , or dagger . '' 
`` They gave me no time to see that much , '' answered Sancho , `` for hardly had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet , stretching me where I now lie , and where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness , which the pain of the blows does , for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders . '' 
`` For all that let me tell thee , brother Panza , '' said Don Quixote , `` that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to , and no pain which death does not remove . '' 
`` And what greater misfortune can there be , '' replied Panza , `` than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it ? 
If our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters , it would not be so bad ; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost wo n't be enough to put us right . '' 
`` No more of that : pluck strength out of weakness , Sancho , as I mean to do , '' returned Don Quixote , `` and let us see how Rocinante is , for it seems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast . '' 
`` There is nothing wonderful in that , '' replied Sancho , `` since he is a knight-errant too ; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free where we come out scotched . '' 
`` Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it , '' said Don Quixote ; `` I say so because this little beast may now supply the want of Rocinante , carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of my wounds . 
And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted , for I remember having read how the good old Silenus , the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter , when he entered the city of the hundred gates , went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass . '' 
`` It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says , '' answered Sancho , `` but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack of manure . '' 
To which Don Quixote replied , `` Wounds received in battle confer honour instead of taking it away ; and so , friend Panza , say no more , but , as I told thee before , get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best , and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds . '' 
`` And yet I have heard your worship say , '' observed Panza , `` that it is very meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts , and that they esteem it very good fortune . '' 
`` That is , '' said Don Quixote , `` when they can not help it , or when they are in love ; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two years on rocks , in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven , without their ladies knowing anything of it ; and one of these was Amadis , when , under the name of Beltenebros , he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for -- I know not if it was eight years or eight months , for I am not very sure of the reckoning ; at any rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana had against him ; but no more of this now , Sancho , and make haste before a mishap like Rocinante 's befalls the ass . '' 
`` The very devil would be in it in that case , '' said Sancho ; and letting off thirty `` ohs , '' and sixty sighs , and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there , he raised himself , stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright , but with all his pains he saddled his ass , who too had gone astray somewhat , yielding to the excessive licence of the day ; he next raised up Rocinante , and as for him , had he possessed a tongue to complain with , most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have been behind him . 
To be brief , Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein , and taking the ass by the halter , he proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be ; and , as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better , he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight , and on it he perceived an inn , which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle . 
Sancho insisted that it was an inn , and his master that it was not one , but a castle , and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it , and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy . 
The innkeeper , seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass , asked Sancho what was amiss with him . 
Sancho answered that it was nothing , only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised . 
The innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have , for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours , so she at once set about tending Don Quixote , and made her young daughter , a very comely girl , help her in taking care of her guest . 
There was besides in the inn , as servant , an Asturian lass with a broad face , flat poll , and snub nose , blind of one eye and not very sound in the other . 
The elegance of her shape , to be sure , made up for all her defects ; she did not measure seven palms from head to foot , and her shoulders , which overweighted her somewhat , made her contemplate the ground more than she liked . 
This graceful lass , then , helped the young girl , and the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many years as a straw-loft , in which there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote 's , and , though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules , had much the advantage of it , as Don Quixote 's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not very even trestles , a mattress , that for thinness might have passed for a quilt , full of pellets which , were they not seen through the rents to be wool , would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness , two sheets made of buckler leather , and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing one in the reckoning . 
On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself , and the hostess and her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe , while Maritornes -- for that was the name of the Asturian -- held the light for them , and while plastering him , the hostess , observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places , remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall . 
It was not blows , Sancho said , but that the rock had many points and projections , and that each of them had left its mark . 
`` Pray , senora , '' he added , `` manage to save some tow , as there will be no want of some one to use it , for my loins too are rather sore . '' 
`` Then you must have fallen too , '' said the hostess . 
`` I did not fall , '' said Sancho Panza , `` but from the shock I got at seeing my master fall , my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks . '' 
`` That may well be , '' said the young girl , `` for it has many a time happened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to the ground , and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken as if I had really fallen . '' 
`` There is the point , senora , '' replied Sancho Panza , `` that I without dreaming at all , but being more awake than I am now , find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master , Don Quixote . '' 
`` How is the gentleman called ? '' 
asked Maritornes the Asturian . 
`` Don Quixote of La Mancha , '' answered Sancho Panza , `` and he is a knight-adventurer , and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past . '' 
`` What is a knight-adventurer ? '' 
said the lass . 
`` Are you so new in the world as not to know ? ''
