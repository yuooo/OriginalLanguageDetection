`` What ! 
deprive you of it , monseigneur ? 
never ! '' 
`` What am I to do , then ? '' 
`` Allow me to share yours with you . '' 
Fouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly . 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
he said , `` you have just left the king . '' 
`` I have , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room ? '' 
`` Monseigneur -- '' `` Very well , Monsieur d'Artagnan , very well . 
You are the master here . '' 
`` I assure you , monseigneur , that I do not wish to abuse -- '' Fouquet turned to his valet , and said , `` Leave us . '' 
When the man had left , he said to D'Artagnan , `` You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I ? '' 
`` A man of your superior intelligence can not have come to talk with a man like myself , at such an hour as the present , without grave motives . '' 
`` Do not interrogate me . '' 
`` On the contrary . 
What do you want with me ? '' 
`` Nothing more than the pleasure of your society . '' 
`` Come into the garden , then , '' said the superintendent suddenly , `` or into the park . '' 
`` No , '' replied the musketeer , hastily , `` no . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` The fresh air -- '' `` Come , admit at once that you arrest me , '' said the superintendent to the captain . 
`` Never ! '' 
said the latter . 
`` You intend to look after me , then ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , I do , upon my honor . '' 
`` Upon your honor -- ah ! 
that is quite another thing ! 
So I am to be arrested in my own house . '' 
`` Do not say such a thing . '' 
`` On the contrary , I will proclaim it aloud . '' 
`` If you do so , I shall be compelled to request you to be silent . '' 
`` Very good ! 
Violence towards me , and in my own house , too . '' 
`` We do not seem to understand one another at all . 
Stay a moment ; there is a chess-board there ; we will have a game , if you have no objections . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , I am in disgrace , then ? '' 
`` Not at all ; but -- '' `` I am prohibited , I suppose , from withdrawing from your sight . '' 
`` I do not understand a word you are saying , monseigneur ; and if you wish me to withdraw , tell me so . '' 
`` My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , your mode of action is enough to drive me mad ; I was almost sinking for want of sleep , but you have completely awakened me . '' 
`` I shall never forgive myself , I am sure ; and if you wish to reconcile me with myself , why , go to sleep in your bed in my presence ; and I shall be delighted . '' 
`` I am under surveillance , I see . '' 
`` I will leave the room if you say any such thing . '' 
`` You are beyond my comprehension . '' 
`` Good night , monseigneur , '' said D'Artagnan , as he pretended to withdraw . 
Fouquet ran after him . 
`` I will not lie down , '' he said . 
`` Seriously , and since you refuse to treat me as a man , and since you finesse with me , I will try and set you at bay , as a hunter does a wild boar . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , pretending to smile . 
`` I shall order my horses , and set off for Paris , '' said Fouquet , sounding the captain of the musketeers . 
`` If that be the case , monseigneur , it is very difficult . '' 
`` You will arrest me , then ? '' 
`` No , but I shall go along with you . '' 
`` That is quite sufficient , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' returned Fouquet , coldly . 
`` It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man of intelligence and resource ; but with me all this is quite superfluous . 
Let us come to the point . 
Do me a service . 
Why do you arrest me ? 
What have I done ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know nothing about what you may have done ; but I do not arrest you -- this evening , at least ! '' 
`` This evening ! '' 
said Fouquet , turning pale , `` but to-morrow ? '' 
`` It is not to-morrow just yet , monseigneur . 
Who can ever answer for the morrow ? '' 
`` Quick , quick , captain ! 
let me speak to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` Alas ! 
that is quite impossible , monseigneur . 
I have strict orders to see that you hold no communication with any one . '' 
`` With M. d'Herblay , captain -- with your friend ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , is M. d'Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be prevented holding any communication ? '' 
Fouquet colored , and then assuming an air of resignation , he said : `` You are right , monsieur ; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have evoked . 
A fallen man can not assert his right to anything , even from those whose fortunes he may have made ; for a still stronger reason , he can not claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the happiness of doing a service . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` It is perfectly true , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; you have always acted in the most admirable manner towards me -- in such a manner , indeed , as most becomes the man who is destined to arrest me . 
You , at least , have never asked me anything . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the Gascon , touched by his eloquent and noble tone of grief , `` will you -- I ask it as a favor -- pledge me your word as a man of honor that you will not leave this room ? '' 
`` What is the use of it , dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , since you keep watch and ward over me ? 
Do you suppose I should contend against the most valiant sword in the kingdom ? '' 
`` It is not that , at all , monseigneur ; but that I am going to look for M. d'Herblay , and , consequently , to leave you alone . '' 
Fouquet uttered a cry of delight and surprise . 
`` To look for M. d'Herblay ! 
to leave me alone ! '' 
he exclaimed , clasping his hands together . 
`` Which is M. d'Herblay 's room ? 
The blue room is it not ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend , yes . '' 
`` Your friend ! 
thank you for that word , monseigneur ; you confer it upon me to-day , at least , if you have never done so before . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you have saved me . '' 
`` It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room , and to return ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Nearly so . '' 
`` And then to wake Aramis , who sleeps very soundly , when he is asleep , I put that down at another five minutes ; making a total of fifteen minutes ' absence . 
And now , monseigneur , give me your word that you will not in any way attempt to make your escape , and that when I return I shall find you here again . '' 
`` I give it , monsieur , '' replied Fouquet , with an expression of the warmest and deepest gratitude . 
D'Artagnan disappeared . 
Fouquet looked at him as he quitted the room , waited with a feverish impatience until the door was closed behind him , and as soon as it was shut , flew to his keys , opened two or three secret doors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room , looked vainly for certain papers , which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mande , and which he seemed to regret not having found in them ; then hurriedly seizing hold of letters , contracts , papers , writings , he heaped them up into a pile , which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble hearth of the fireplace , not even taking time to draw from the interior of it the vases and pots of flowers with which it was filled . 
As soon as he had finished , like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger , and whose strength abandons him as soon as the danger is past , he sank down , completely overcome , on a couch . 
When D'Artagnan returned , he found Fouquet in the same position ; the worthy musketeer had not the slightest doubt that Fouquet , having given his word , would not even think of failing to keep it , but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would turn his -LRB- D'Artagnan 's -RRB- absence to the best advantage in getting rid of all the papers , memorandums , and contracts , which might possibly render his position , which was even now serious enough , more dangerous than ever . 
And so , lifting up his head like a dog who has regained the scent , he perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on finding in the atmosphere , and having found it , made a movement of his head in token of satisfaction . 
As D'Artagnan entered , Fouquet , on his side , raised his head , and not one of D'Artagnan 's movements escaped him . 
And then the looks of the two men met , and they both saw that they had understood each other without exchanging a syllable . 
`` Well ! '' 
asked Fouquet , the first to speak , `` and M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` Upon my word , monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` M. d'Herblay must be desperately fond of walking out at night , and composing verses by moonlight in the park of Vaux , with some of your poets , in all probability , for he is not in his own room . '' 
`` What ! 
not in his own room ? '' 
cried Fouquet , whose last hope thus escaped him ; for unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes could assist him , he perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance from no other quarter . 
`` Or , indeed , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` if he is in his own room , he has very good reasons for not answering . '' 
`` But surely you did not call him in such a manner that he could have heard you ? '' 
`` You can hardly suppose , monseigneur , that having already exceeded my orders , which forbade me leaving you a single moment -- you can hardly suppose , I say , that I should have been mad enough to rouse the whole house and allow myself to be seen in the corridor of the bishop of Vannes , in order that M. Colbert might state with positive certainty that I gave you time to burn your papers . '' 
`` My papers ? '' 
`` Of course ; at least that is what I should have done in your place . 
When any one opens a door for me I always avail myself of it . '' 
`` Yes , yes , and I thank you , for I have availed myself of it . '' 
`` And you have done perfectly right . 
Every man has his own peculiar secrets with which others have nothing to do . 
But let us return to Aramis , monseigneur . '' 
`` Well , then , I tell you , you could not have called loud enough , or Aramis would have heard you . '' 
`` However softly any one may call Aramis , monseigneur , Aramis always hears when he has an interest in hearing . 
I repeat what I said before -- Aramis was not in his own room , or Aramis had certain reasons for not recognizing my voice , of which I am ignorant , and of which you may be even ignorant yourself , notwithstanding your liege-man is His Greatness the Lord Bishop of Vannes . '' 
Fouquet drew a deep sigh , rose from his seat , took three or four turns in his room , and finished by seating himself , with an expression of extreme dejection , upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings , and costliest lace . 
D'Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the deepest and sincerest pity . 
`` I have seen a good many men arrested in my life , '' said the musketeer , sadly ; `` I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested , though I was very young then . 
I have seen M. de Conde arrested with the princes ; I have seen M. de Retz arrested ; I have seen M. Broussel arrested . 
Stay a moment , monseigneur , it is disagreeable to have to say , but the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was that poor fellow Broussel . 
You were very near doing as he did , putting your dinner napkin in your portfolio , and wiping your mouth with your papers . 
Mordioux ! 
Monseigneur Fouquet , a man like you ought not to be dejected in this manner . 
Suppose your friends saw you ? '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' returned the surintendant , with a smile full of gentleness , `` you do not understand me ; it is precisely because my friends are not looking on , that I am as you see me now . 
I do not live , exist even , isolated from others ; I am nothing when left to myself . 
Understand that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of my time in making friends , whom I hoped to render my stay and support . 
In times of prosperity , all these cheerful , happy voices -- rendered so through and by my means -- formed in my honor a concert of praise and kindly actions . 
In the least disfavor , these humbler voices accompanied in harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart . 
Isolation I have never yet known . 
Poverty -LRB- a phantom I have sometimes beheld , clad in rags , awaiting me at the end of my journey through life -RRB- -- poverty has been the specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past , which they poetize and caress , and which has attracted me towards them . 
Poverty ! 
I accept it , acknowledge it , receive it , as a disinherited sister ; for poverty is neither solitude , nor exile , nor imprisonment . 
Is it likely I shall ever be poor , with such friends as Pelisson , as La Fontaine , as Moliere ? 
with such a mistress as -- Oh ! 
if you knew how utterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment , and how you , who separate me from all I love , seem to resemble the image of solitude , of annihilation -- death itself . '' 
`` But I have already told you , Monsieur Fouquet , '' replied D'Artagnan , moved to the depths of his soul , `` that you are woefully exaggerating . 
The king likes you . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Fouquet , shaking his head . 
`` M. Colbert hates you . '' 
`` M. Colbert ! 
What does that matter to me ? '' 
`` He will ruin you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I defy him to do that , for I am ruined already . '' 
At this singular confession of the superintendent , D'Artagnan cast his glance all round the room ; and although he did not open his lips , Fouquet understood him so thoroughly , that he added : `` What can be done with such wealth of substance as surrounds us , when a man can no longer cultivate his taste for the magnificent ? 
Do you know what good the greater part of the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy , confer upon us ? 
merely to disgust us , by their very splendor even , with everything which does not equal it ! 
Vaux ! 
you will say , and the wonders of Vaux ! 
What of it ? 
What boot these wonders ? 
If I am ruined , how shall I fill with water the urns which my Naiads bear in their arms , or force the air into the lungs of my Tritons ? 
To be rich enough , Monsieur d'Artagnan , a man must be too rich . '' 
D'Artagnan shook his head . 
`` Oh ! 
I know very well what you think , '' replied Fouquet , quickly . 
`` If Vaux were yours , you would sell it , and would purchase an estate in the country ; an estate which should have woods , orchards , and land attached , so that the estate should be made to support its master . 
With forty millions you might -- '' `` Ten millions , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Not a million , my dear captain . 
No one in France is rich enough to give two millions for Vaux , and to continue to maintain it as I have done ; no one could do it , no one would know how . '' 
`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` in any case , a million is not abject misery . '' 
`` It is not far from it , my dear monsieur . 
But you do not understand me . 
No ; I will not sell my residence at Vaux ; I will give it to you , if you like ; '' and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the shoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice . 
`` Give it to the king ; you will make a better bargain . '' 
`` The king does not require me to give it to him , '' said Fouquet ; `` he will take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace , if it pleases him to do so ; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see it perish . 
Do you know , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that if the king did not happen to be under my roof , I would take this candle , go straight to the dome , and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks which are in reserve there , and would reduce my palace to ashes . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , negligently . 
`` At all events , you would not be able to burn the gardens , and that is the finest feature of the place . '' 
`` And yet , '' resumed Fouquet , thoughtfully , `` what was I saying ? 
Great heavens ! 
burn Vaux ! 
destroy my palace ! 
But Vaux is not mine ; these wonderful creations are , it is true , the property , as far as sense of enjoyment goes , of the man who has paid for them ; but as far as duration is concerned , they belong to those who created them . 
Vaux belongs to Lebrun , to Lenotre , to Pelisson , to Levau , to La Fontaine , to Moliere ; Vaux belongs to posterity , in fact . 
You see , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that my very house has ceased to be my own . '' 
`` That is all well and good , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` the idea is agreeable enough , and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it . 
That idea , indeed , makes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether ; and I now fail to recognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur . 
If you are ruined , monsieur , look at the affair manfully , for you too , mordioux ! 
belong to posterity , and have no right to lessen yourself in any way . 
Stay a moment ; look at me , I who seem to exercise in some degree a kind of superiority over you , because I am arresting you ; fate , which distributes their different parts to the comedians of this world , accorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than yours has been . 
I am one of those who think that the parts which kings and powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth than the parts of beggars or lackeys . 
It is far better on the stage -- on the stage , I mean , of another theater than the theater of this world -- it is far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language , than to walk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes , or to get one 's backbone gently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick . 
In one word , you have been a prodigal with money , you have ordered and been obeyed -- have been steeped to the lips in enjoyment ; while I have dragged my tether after me , have been commanded and have obeyed , and have drudged my life away . 
Well , although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you , monseigneur , I do declare to you , that the recollection of what I have done serves me as a spur , and prevents me from bowing my old head too soon . 
I shall remain unto the very end a trooper ; and when my turn comes , I shall fall perfectly straight , all in a heap , still alive , after having selected my place beforehand . 
Do as I do , Monsieur Fouquet , you will not find yourself the worse for it ; a fall happens only once in a lifetime to men like yourself , and the chief thing is , to take it gracefully when the chance presents itself . 
There is a Latin proverb -- the words have escaped me , but I remember the sense of it very well , for I have thought over it more than once -- which says , ` The end crowns the work ! ' '' 
Fouquet rose from his seat , passed his arm round D'Artagnan 's neck , and clasped him in a close embrace , whilst with the other hand he pressed his hand . 
`` An excellent homily , '' he said , after a moment 's pause . 
`` A soldier 's , monseigneur . '' 
`` You have a regard for me , in telling me all that . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more , and then , a moment after , he said : `` Where can M. d'Herblay be ? 
I dare not ask you to send for him . '' 
`` You would not ask me , because I would not do it , Monsieur Fouquet . 
People would learn it , and Aramis , who is not mixed up with the affair , might possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace . '' 
`` I will wait here till daylight , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Yes ; that is best . '' 
`` What shall we do when daylight comes ? '' 
`` I know nothing at all about it , monseigneur . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , will you do me a favor ? '' 
`` Most willingly . '' 
`` You guard me , I remain ; you are acting in the full discharge of your duty , I suppose ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good , then ; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like ; and I infinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed to the compliment . 
`` But , forget that you are Monsieur d'Artagnan , captain of the musketeers ; forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet , surintendant of the finances ; and let us talk about my affairs . '' 
`` That is rather a delicate subject . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` Yes ; but , for your sake , Monsieur Fouquet , I will do what may almost be regarded as an impossibility . '' 
`` Thank you . 
What did the king say to you ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Ah ! 
is that the way you talk ? '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` What do you think of my situation ? '' 
`` I do not know . '' 
`` However , unless you have some ill feeling against me -- '' `` Your position is a difficult one . '' 
`` In what respect ? '' 
`` Because you are under your own roof . '' 
`` However difficult it may be , I understand it very well . '' 
`` Do you suppose that , with any one else but yourself , I should have shown so much frankness ? '' 
`` What ! 
so much frankness , do you say ? 
you , who refuse to tell me the slightest thing ? '' 
`` At all events , then , so much ceremony and consideration . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I have nothing to say in that respect . '' 
`` One moment , monseigneur : let me tell you how I should have behaved towards any one but yourself . 
It might be that I happened to arrive at your door just as your guests or your friends had left you -- or , if they had not gone yet , I should wait until they were leaving , and should then catch them one after the other , like rabbits ; I should lock them up quietly enough , I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor , and with one hand upon you , before you suspected the slightest thing amiss , I should keep you safely until my master 's breakfast in the morning . 
In this way , I should just the same have avoided all publicity , all disturbance , all opposition ; but there would also have been no warning for M. Fouquet , no consideration for his feelings , none of those delicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially courteous in their natures , whenever the decisive moment may arrive . 
Are you satisfied with the plan ? '' 
`` It makes me shudder . '' 
`` I thought you would not like it . 
It would have been very disagreeable to have made my appearance to-morrow , without any preparation , and to have asked you to deliver up your sword . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur , I should have died of shame and anger . '' 
`` Your gratitude is too eloquently expressed . 
I have not done enough to deserve it , I assure you . '' 
`` Most certainly , monsieur , you will never get me to believe that . '' 
`` Well , then , monseigneur , if you are satisfied with what I have done , and have somewhat recovered from the shock which I prepared you for as much as I possibly could , let us allow the few hours that remain to pass away undisturbed . 
You are harassed , and should arrange your thoughts ; I beg you , therefore , go to sleep , or pretend to go to sleep , either on your bed , or in your bed ; I will sleep in this armchair ; and when I fall asleep , my rest is so sound that a cannon would not wake me . '' 
Fouquet smiled . 
`` I expect , however , '' continued the musketeer , `` the case of a door being opened , whether a secret door , or any other ; or the case of any one going out of , or coming into , the room -- for anything like that my ear is as quick and sensitive as the ear of a mouse . 
Creaking noises make me start . 
It arises , I suppose , from a natural antipathy to anything of the kind . 
Move about as much as you like ; walk up and down in any part of the room , write , efface , destroy , burn , -- nothing like that will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from snoring , but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door , for I should start up in a moment , and that would shake my nerves and make me ill . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said Fouquet , `` you are certainly the most witty and the most courteous man I ever met with ; and you will leave me only one regret , that of having made your acquaintance so late . '' 
D'Artagnan drew a deep sigh , which seemed to say , `` Alas ! 
you have perhaps made it too soon . '' 
He then settled himself in his armchair , while Fouquet , half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm , was meditating on his misadventures . 
In this way , both of them , leaving the candles burning , awaited the first dawn of the day ; and when Fouquet happened to sigh too loudly , D'Artagnan only snored the louder . 
Not a single visit , not even from Aramis , disturbed their quietude : not a sound even was heard throughout the whole vast palace . 
Outside , however , the guards of honor on duty , and the patrol of musketeers , paced up and down ; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel walks . 
It seemed to act as an additional soporific for the sleepers , while the murmuring of the wind through the trees , and the unceasing music of the fountains whose waters tumbled in the basin , still went on uninterruptedly , without being disturbed at the slight noises and items of little moment that constitute the life and death of human nature . 
In vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned in the Bastile , and tearing , in sheer despair , the bolts and bars of his dungeon , the rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to present , as a complete antithesis , the picture of Philippe lying asleep beneath the royal canopy . 
We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric is always bad , and always scatters , in places where they have no right to grow , the flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history . 
But we shall , on the present occasion , carefully avoid polishing the antithesis in question , but shall proceed to draw another picture as minutely as possible , to serve as foil and counterfoil to the one in the preceding chapter . 
The young prince alighted from Aramis 's room , in the same way the king had descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus . 
The dome gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis 's pressure , and Philippe stood beside the royal bed , which had ascended again after having deposited its prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean passage . 
Alone , in the presence of all the luxury which surrounded him ; alone , in the presence of his power ; alone , with the part he was about to be forced to act , Philippe for the first time felt his heart , and mind , and soul expand beneath the influence of a thousand mutable emotions , which are the vital throbs of a king 's heart . 
He could not help changing color when he looked upon the empty bed , still tumbled by his brother 's body . 
This mute accomplice had returned , after having completed the work it had been destined to perform ; it returned with the traces of the crime ; it spoke to the guilty author of that crime , with the frank and unreserved language which an accomplice never fears to use in the company of his companion in guilt ; for it spoke the truth . 
Philippe bent over the bed , and perceived a pocket-handkerchief lying on it , which was still damp from the cold sweat which had poured from Louis XIV . 
's face . 
This sweat-bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe , as the gore of Abel frightened Cain . 
`` I am face to face with my destiny , '' said Philippe , his eyes on fire , and his face a livid white . 
`` Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy ? 
Though I am compelled to follow out , at every moment , the sovereign power and authority I have usurped , shall I cease to listen to the scruples of my heart ? 
Yes ! 
the king has lain on this bed ; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this pillow ; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief : and yet , I hesitate to throw myself on the bed , or to press in my hand the handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother 's arms . 
Away with such weakness ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , who asserts that a man 's action should be always one degree above his thoughts ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , whose thoughts are of and for himself alone , who regards himself as a man of honor , so long as he injures or betrays his enemies only . 
I , I alone , should have occupied this bed , if Louis XIV . 
had not , owing to my mother 's criminal abandonment , stood in my way ; and this handkerchief , embroidered with the arms of France , would in right and justice belong to me alone , if , as M. d'Herblay observes , I had been left my royal cradle . 
Philippe , son of France , take your place on that bed ; Philippe , sole king of France , resume the blazonry that is yours ! 
Philippe , sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII. , your father , show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who , at this moment , has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to . '' 
With these words , Philippe , notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling , and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will , threw himself on the royal bed , and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis XIV . 
had lain , while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother 's tears . 
With his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow , Philippe perceived above him the crown of France , suspended , as we have stated , by angels with outspread golden wings . 
A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion 's den , but can hardly hope to sleep there quietly . 
Philippe listened attentively to every sound ; his heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror and misfortune ; but confident in his own strength , which was confirmed by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination , he waited until some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself . 
He hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him , like those phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle . 
But nothing approached . 
Silence , that mortal enemy of restless hearts , and of ambitious minds , shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king of France , who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown . 
Towards the morning a shadow , rather than a body , glided into the royal chamber ; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any surprise . 
`` Well , M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` Well , sire , all is accomplished . '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Exactly as we expected . '' 
`` Did he resist ? '' 
`` Terribly ! 
tears and entreaties . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` A perfect stupor . '' 
`` But at last ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
at last , a complete victory , and absolute silence . '' 
`` Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` The resemblance , however -- '' `` Was the cause of the success . '' 
`` But the prisoner can not fail to explain himself . 
Think well of that . 
I have myself been able to do as much as that , on former occasion . '' 
`` I have already provided for every chance . 
In a few days , sooner if necessary , we will take the captive out of his prison , and will send him out of the country , to a place of exile so remote -- '' `` People can return from their exile , Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` To a place of exile so distant , I was going to say , that human strength and the duration of human life would not be enough for his return . '' 
Once more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the young king . 
`` And M. du Vallon ? '' 
asked Philippe in order to change the conversation . 
`` He will be presented to you to-day , and confidentially will congratulate you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run . '' 
`` What is to be done with him ? '' 
`` With M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` Yes ; confer a dukedom on him , I suppose . '' 
`` A dukedom , '' replied Aramis , smiling in a significant manner . 
`` Why do you laugh , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea . '' 
`` Cautious , why so ? '' 
`` Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become a troublesome witness , and you wish to get rid of him . '' 
`` What ! 
in making him a duke ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you would assuredly kill him , for he would die from joy , and the secret would die with him . '' 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , phlegmatically ; `` I should lose a very good friend . '' 
At this moment , and in the middle of this idle conversation , under the light tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride at their mutual success , Aramis heard something which made him prick up his ears . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Philippe . 
`` The dawn , sire . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , before you retired to bed last night , you probably decided to do something this morning at break of day . '' 
`` Yes , I told my captain of the musketeers , '' replied the young man hurriedly , `` that I should expect him . '' 
`` If you told him that , he will certainly be here , for he is a most punctual man . '' 
`` I hear a step in the vestibule . '' 
`` It must be he . '' 
`` Come , let us begin the attack , '' said the young king resolutely . 
`` Be cautious for Heaven 's sake . 
To begin the attack , and with D'Artagnan , would be madness . 
D'Artagnan knows nothing , he has seen nothing ; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree , but if he comes into this room the first this morning , he will be sure to detect something of what has taken place , and which he would imagine it his business to occupy himself about . 
Before we allow D'Artagnan to penetrate into this room , we must air the room thoroughly , or introduce so many people into it , that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different persons . '' 
`` But how can I send him away , since I have given him a rendezvous ? '' 
observed the prince , impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an antagonist . 
`` I will take care of that , '' replied the bishop , `` and in order to begin , I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man . '' 
`` He , too , is striking a blow , for I hear him at the door , '' added the prince , hurriedly . 
And , in fact , a knock at the door was heard at that moment . 
Aramis was not mistaken ; for it was indeed D'Artagnan who adopted that mode of announcing himself . 
We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet , but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep , and as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices of the superintendent 's room , D'Artagnan rose from his armchair , arranged his sword , brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve , like a private soldier getting ready for inspection . 
`` Are you going out ? '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . 
And you ? '' 
`` I shall remain . '' 
`` You pledge your word ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good . 
Besides , my only reason for going out is to try and get that reply , -- you know what I mean ? '' 
`` That sentence , you mean -- '' `` Stay , I have something of the old Roman in me . 
This morning , when I got up , I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the aiguillettes , and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off . 
That is an infallible sign . '' 
`` Of prosperity ? '' 
`` Yes , be sure of it ; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to my back , it always signified a punishment from M. de Treville , or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin . 
Every time my sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt , it always predicted some disagreeable commission or another for me to execute , and I have had showers of them all my life through . 
Every time , too , my sword danced about in its sheath , a duel , fortunate in its result , was sure to follow : whenever it dangled about the calves of my legs , it signified a slight wound ; every time it fell completely out of the scabbard , I was booked , and made up my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle , with two or three months under surgical bandages into the bargain . '' 
`` I did not know your sword kept you so well informed , '' said Fouquet , with a faint smile , which showed how he was struggling against his own weakness . 
`` Is your sword bewitched , or under the influence of some imperial charm ? '' 
`` Why , you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own body . 
I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them by feeling something the matter with their legs , or a throbbing of their temples . 
With me , it is my sword that warns me . 
Well , it told me of nothing this morning . 
But , stay a moment -- look here , it has just fallen of its own accord into the last hole of the belt . 
Do you know what that is a warning of ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Well , that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very day . '' 
`` Well , '' said the surintendant , more astonished than annoyed by this frankness , `` if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your sword , I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me . '' 
`` You ! 
arrest you ! '' 
`` Of course . 
The warning -- '' `` Does not concern you , since you have been arrested ever since yesterday . 
It is not you I shall have to arrest , be assured of that . 
That is the reason why I am delighted , and also the reason why I said that my day will be a happy one . '' 
And with these words , pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness of manner , the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the king . 
He was on the point of leaving the room , when Fouquet said to him , `` One last mark of kindness . '' 
`` What is it , monseigneur ? '' 
`` M. d'Herblay ; let me see Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` I am going to try and get him to come to you . ''
