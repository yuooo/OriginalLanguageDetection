`` Pooh ! 
my agent has seen them all this morning . '' 
`` Even M. Percerin ? '' 
`` Who is M. Percerin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
only the king 's tailor ! '' 
`` Oh , ah , yes , '' said Porthos , who wished to appear to know the king 's tailor , but now heard his name mentioned for the first time ; `` to M. Percerin 's , by Jove ! 
I was afraid he would be too busy . '' 
`` Doubtless he will be ; but be at ease , Porthos ; he will do for me what he would n't do for another . 
Only you must allow yourself to be measured ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Porthos , with a sigh , '' 't is vexatious , but what would you have me do ? '' 
`` Do ? 
As others do ; as the king does . '' 
`` What ! 
do they measure the king , too ? 
does he put up with it ? '' 
`` The king is a beau , my good friend , and so are you , too , whatever you may say about it . '' 
Porthos smiled triumphantly . 
`` Let us go to the king 's tailor , '' he said ; `` and since he measures the king , I think , by my faith , I may do worse than allow him to measure me ! '' 
The king 's tailor , Messire Jean Percerin , occupied a rather large house in the Rue St. Honore , near the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . 
He was a man of great taste in elegant stuffs , embroideries , and velvets , being hereditary tailor to the king . 
The preferment of his house reached as far back as the time of Charles IX. ; from whose reign dated , as we know , fancy in bravery difficult enough to gratify . 
The Percerin of that period was a Huguenot , like Ambrose Pare , and had been spared by the Queen of Navarre , the beautiful Margot , as they used to write and say , too , in those days ; because , in sooth , he was the only one who could make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear , seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical defects , which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal . 
Percerin being saved , made , out of gratitude , some beautiful black bodices , very inexpensively indeed , for Queen Catherine , who ended by being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people , on whom she had long looked with detestation . 
But Percerin was a very prudent man ; and having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a Protestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine , and having observed that her smiles were more frequent than usual , he speedily turned Catholic with all his family ; and having thus become irreproachable , attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France . 
Under Henry III. , gay king as he was , this position was as grand as the height of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras . 
Now Percerin had been a clever man all his life , and by way of keeping up his reputation beyond the grave , took very good care not to make a bad death of it , and so contrived to die very skillfully ; and that at the very moment he felt his powers of invention declining . 
He left a son and a daughter , both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear ; the son , a cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule ; the daughter , apt at embroidery , and at designing ornaments . 
The marriage of Henry IV . 
and Marie de Medici , and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen , together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere , king of the beaux of the period , made the fortune of the second generation of Percerins . 
M. Concino Concini , and his wife Galligai , who subsequently shone at the French court , sought to Italianize the fashion , and introduced some Florentine tailors ; but Percerin , touched to the quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem , entirely defeated these foreigners , and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his compatriots , and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would never employ any other , and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre . 
And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin 's workshop , which the Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human body it contained . 
Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown Percerin , the king , Louis XIII. , had the generosity to bear no malice to his tailor , and to retain him in his service . 
At the time that Louis the Just afforded this great example of equity , Percerin had brought up two sons , one of whom made his debut at the marriage of Anne of Austria , invented that admirable Spanish costume , in which Richelieu danced a saraband , made the costumes for the tragedy of `` Mirame , '' and stitched on to Buckingham 's mantle those famous pearls which were destined to be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre . 
A man becomes easily notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham , a M. de Cinq-Mars , a Mademoiselle Ninon , a M. de Beaufort , and a Marion de Lorme . 
And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory when his father died . 
This same Percerin III. , old , famous and wealthy , yet further dressed Louis XIV. ; and having no son , which was a great cause of sorrow to him , seeing that with himself his dynasty would end , he had brought up several hopeful pupils . 
He possessed a carriage , a country house , men-servants the tallest in Paris ; and by special authority from Louis XIV. , a pack of hounds . 
He worked for MM . 
de Lyonne and Letellier , under a sort of patronage ; but politic man as he was , and versed in state secrets , he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert . 
This is beyond explanation ; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition . 
Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen , intangible ideas ; they act without themselves knowing why . 
The great Percerin -LRB- for , contrary to the rule of dynasties , it was , above all , the last of the Percerins who deserved the name of Great -RRB- , the great Percerin was inspired when he cut a robe for the queen , or a coat for the king ; he could mount a mantle for Monsieur , the clock of a stocking for Madame ; but , in spite of his supreme talent , he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable fit for M. Colbert . 
`` That man , '' he used often to say , `` is beyond my art ; my needle can never dot him down . '' 
We need scarcely say that Percerin was M. Fouquet 's tailor , and that the superintendent highly esteemed him . 
M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old , nevertheless still fresh , and at the same time so dry , the courtiers used to say , that he was positively brittle . 
His renown and his fortune were great enough for M. le Prince , that king of fops , to take his arm when talking over the fashions ; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their accounts in arrear with him ; for Master Percerin would for the first time make clothes upon credit , but the second never , unless paid for the former order . 
It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown , instead of running after customers , made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones . 
And so Percerin declined to fit bourgeois , or those who had but recently obtained patents of nobility . 
A story used to circulate that even M. de Mazarin , in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal , one fine day slipped letters of nobility into his pocket . 
It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D'Artagnan took the despairing Porthos ; who , as they were going along , said to his friend , `` Take care , my good D'Artagnan , not to compromise the dignity of a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin , who will , I expect , be very impertinent ; for I give you notice , my friend , that if he is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him . '' 
`` Presented by me , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` you have nothing to fear , even though you were what you are not . '' 
`` Ah ! 
't is because -- '' `` What ? 
Have you anything against Percerin , Porthos ? '' 
`` I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` The fellow refused to supply me . '' 
`` Oh , a misunderstanding , no doubt , which it will be now exceedingly easy to set right . 
Mouston must have made a mistake . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
`` He has confused the names . '' 
`` Possibly . 
That rascal Mouston never can remember names . '' 
`` I will take it all upon myself . '' 
`` Very good . '' 
`` Stop the carriage , Porthos ; here we are . '' 
`` Here ! 
how here ? 
We are at the Halles ; and you told me the house was at the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec . '' '' 
'T is true , but look . '' 
`` Well , I do look , and I see -- '' `` What ? '' '' 
Pardieu ! 
that we are at the Halles ! '' 
`` You do not , I suppose , want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in front of us ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of it . 
Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or forty others which have arrived before us . '' 
`` No , you are right , indeed . 
What a number of people ! 
And what are they all about ? '' '' 
'T is very simple . 
They are waiting their turn . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their quarters ? '' 
`` No ; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin 's house . '' 
`` And we are going to wait too ? '' 
`` Oh , we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud . '' 
`` What are we to do , then ? '' 
`` Get down , pass through the footmen and lackeys , and enter the tailor 's house , which I will answer for our doing , if you go first . '' 
`` Come along , then , '' said Porthos . 
They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the establishment . 
The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin 's doors were closed , while a servant , standing before them , was explaining to the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M. Percerin could not receive anybody . 
It was bruited about outside still , on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom he favored , in confidence , that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes for the king , and that , owing to the urgency of the case , he was meditating in his office on the ornaments , colors , and cut of these five suits . 
Some , contented with this reason , went away again , contented to repeat the tale to others , but others , more tenacious , insisted on having the doors opened , and among these last three Blue Ribbons , intended to take parts in a ballet , which would inevitably fail unless the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great Percerin himself . 
D'Artagnan , pushing on Porthos , who scattered the groups of people right and left , succeeded in gaining the counter , behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer queries . 
-LRB- We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos like the rest , but D'Artagnan , showing himself , pronounced merely these words , `` The king 's order , '' and was let in with his friend . -RRB- 
The poor fellows had enough to do , and did their best , to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their master , leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence ; and when wounded pride , or disappointed expectation , brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke , he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter . 
The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture . 
Our captain of musketeers , a man of sure and rapid observation , took it all in at a glance ; and having run over the groups , his eye rested on a man in front of him . 
This man , seated upon a stool , scarcely showed his head above the counter that sheltered him . 
He was about forty years of age , with a melancholy aspect , pale face , and soft luminous eyes . 
He was looking at D'Artagnan and the rest , with his chin resting upon his hand , like a calm and inquiring amateur . 
Only on perceiving , and doubtless recognizing , our captain , he pulled his hat down over his eyes . 
It was this action , perhaps , that attracted D'Artagnan 's attention . 
If so , the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely different from what he had desired . 
In other respects his costume was plain , and his hair evenly cut enough for customers , who were not close observers , to take him for a mere tailor 's apprentice , perched behind the board , and carefully stitching cloth or velvet . 
Nevertheless , this man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his fingers . 
D'Artagnan was not deceived , -- not he ; and he saw at once that if this man was working at anything , it certainly was not at velvet . 
`` Eh ! '' 
said he , addressing this man , `` and so you have become a tailor 's boy , Monsieur Moliere ! '' 
`` Hush , M. d'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the man , softly , `` you will make them recognize me . '' 
`` Well , and what harm ? '' 
`` The fact is , there is no harm , but -- '' `` You were going to say there is no good in doing it either , is it not so ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
no ; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures . '' 
`` Go on -- go on , Monsieur Moliere . 
I quite understand the interest you take in the plates -- I will not disturb your studies . '' 
`` Thank you . '' 
`` But on one condition ; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is . '' 
`` Oh ! 
willingly ; in his own room . 
Only -- '' `` Only that one ca n't enter it ? '' 
`` Unapproachable . '' 
`` For everybody ? '' 
`` Everybody . 
He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my observations , and then he went away . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur Moliere , but you will go and tell him I am here . '' 
`` I ! '' 
exclaimed Moliere , in the tone of a courageous dog , from which you snatch the bone it has legitimately gained ; `` I disturb myself ! 
Ah ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , how hard you are upon me ! '' 
`` If you do n't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here , my dear Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan , in a low tone , `` I warn you of one thing : that I wo n't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me . '' 
Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture , `` This gentleman , is it not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds and hearts of men . 
The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one , for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber . 
During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away , leaving at every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace , as the waves leave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands , when they retire with the ebbing tide . 
In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared , making another sign to D'Artagnan from under the hangings . 
The latter hurried after him , with Porthos in the rear , and after threading a labyrinth of corridors , introduced him to M. Percerin 's room . 
The old man , with his sleeves turned up , was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered brocade , so as the better to exhibit its luster . 
Perceiving D'Artagnan , he put the silk aside , and came to meet him , by no means radiant with joy , and by no means courteous , but , take it altogether , in a tolerably civil manner . 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers will excuse me , I am sure , for I am engaged . '' 
`` Eh ! 
yes , on the king 's costumes ; I know that , my dear Monsieur Percerin . 
You are making three , they tell me . '' 
`` Five , my dear sir , five . '' 
`` Three or five , 't is all the same to me , my dear monsieur ; and I know that you will make them most exquisitely . '' 
`` Yes , I know . 
Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world , I do not deny it ; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word , they must first be made ; and to do this , captain , I am pressed for time . '' 
`` Oh , bah ! 
there are two days yet ; 't is much more than you require , Monsieur Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , in the coolest possible manner . 
Percerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be contradicted , even in his whims ; but D'Artagnan did not pay the least attention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume . 
`` My dear M. Percerin , '' he continued , `` I bring you a customer . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed Percerin , crossly . 
`` M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
Percerin attempted a bow , which found no favor in the eyes of the terrible Porthos , who , from his first entry into the room , had been regarding the tailor askance . 
`` A very good friend of mine , '' concluded D'Artagnan . 
`` I will attend to monsieur , '' said Percerin , `` but later . '' 
`` Later ? 
but when ? '' 
`` When I have time . '' 
`` You have already told my valet as much , '' broke in Porthos , discontentedly . 
`` Very likely , '' said Percerin ; `` I am nearly always pushed for time . '' 
`` My friend , '' returned Porthos , sententiously , `` there is always time to be found when one chooses to seek it . '' 
Percerin turned crimson ; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by age . 
`` Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere . '' 
`` Come , come , Percerin , '' interposed D'Artagnan , `` you are not in a good temper to-day . 
Well , I will say one more word to you , which will bring you on your knees ; monsieur is not only a friend of mine , but more , a friend of M. Fouquet 's . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , `` that is another thing . '' 
Then turning to Porthos , `` Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` I am attached to myself , '' shouted Porthos , at the very moment that the tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue . 
Moliere was all observation , D'Artagnan laughed , Porthos swore . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you will make a dress for the baron . 
'T is I who ask you . '' 
`` To you I will not say nay , captain . '' 
`` But that is not all ; you will make it for him at once . '' '' 
'T is impossible within eight days . '' 
`` That , then , is as much as to refuse , because the dress is wanted for the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` I repeat that it is impossible , '' returned the obstinate old man . 
`` By no means , dear Monsieur Percerin , above all if I ask you , '' said a mild voice at the door , a silvery voice which made D'Artagnan prick up his ears . 
It was the voice of Aramis . 
`` Monsieur d'Herblay ! '' 
cried the tailor . 
`` Aramis , '' murmured D'Artagnan . 
`` Ah ! 
our bishop ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Good morning , D'Artagnan ; good morning , Porthos ; good-morning , my dear friends , '' said Aramis . 
`` Come , come , M. Percerin , make the baron 's dress ; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet . '' 
And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner . 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming , and addressing Moliere , said to him , in an undertone , `` You see before you , my dear monsieur , a man who considers himself disgraced , if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him ; study this type for me , Master Aristophanes , and profit by it . '' 
Moliere had no need of encouragement , and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` if you will come with me , I will make them take your measure without touching you . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos , `` how do you make that out , my friend ? '' 
`` I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your dress . 
It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of quality , who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them . 
We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these -- '' '' Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin . 
Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , laughing , `` and do we write no more poems now , either ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
D'Artagnan , '' exclaimed Aramis , `` I have long ago given up all such tomfoolery . '' 
`` True , '' repeated D'Artagnan , only half convinced . 
As for Percerin , he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades . 
`` Do n't you perceive , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` that we are greatly boring this good gentleman , my dear D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
murmured the musketeer , aside ; `` that is , I am boring you , my friend . '' 
Then aloud , `` Well , then , let us leave ; I have no further business here , and if you are as disengaged as I , Aramis -- '' `` No , not I -- I wished -- '' `` Ah ! 
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , -- `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before . 
Percerin never moved . 
Aramis roused him violently , by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was engaged . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said he , `` I have , near hand , M. Lebrun , one of M. Fouquet 's painters . '' 
`` Ah , very good , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` but why Lebrun ? '' 
Aramis looked at D'Artagnan , who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark Antony . 
`` And you wish that I should make him a dress , similar to those of the Epicureans ? '' 
answered Percerin . 
And while saying this , in an absent manner , the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade . 
`` An Epicurean 's dress ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , in a tone of inquiry . 
`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . '' 
`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how -- do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! '' 
`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are -- what nobody will know -- what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the attentive musketeer ; perceiving with his wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now , and that the hour of battle was approaching . 
`` Let us see , '' said Percerin , incredulously . 
`` Why , now , '' continued Aramis , `` does M. Fouquet give the king a fete ? 
-- Is it not to please him ? '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said Percerin . 
D'Artagnan nodded assent . 
`` By delicate attentions ? 
by some happy device ? 
by a succession of surprises , like that of which we were talking ? 
-- the enrolment of our Epicureans . '' 
`` Admirable . '' 
`` Well , then ; this is the surprise we intend . 
M. Lebrun here is a man who draws most excellently . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Percerin ; `` I have seen his pictures , and observed that his dresses were highly elaborated . 
That is why I at once agreed to make him a costume -- whether to agree with those of the Epicureans , or an original one . '' 
`` My dear monsieur , we accept your offer , and shall presently avail ourselves of it ; but just now , M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you will make for himself , but of those you are making for the king . '' 
Percerin made a bound backwards , which D'Artagnan -- calmest and most appreciative of men , did not consider overdone , so many strange and startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded . 
`` The king 's dresses ! 
Give the king 's dresses to any mortal whatever ! 
Oh ! 
for once , monseigneur , your grace is mad ! '' 
cried the poor tailor in extremity . 
`` Help me now , D'Artagnan , '' said Aramis , more and more calm and smiling . 
`` Help me now to persuade monsieur , for you understand ; do you not ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! 
-- not exactly , I declare . '' 
`` What ! 
you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux ; and that the portrait , which be a striking resemblance , ought to be dressed exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes , yes , '' said the musketeer , nearly convinced , so plausible was this reasoning . 
`` Yes , my dear Aramis , you are right ; it is a happy idea . 
I will wager it is one of your own , Aramis . '' 
`` Well , I do n't know , '' replied the bishop ; `` either mine or M. Fouquet 's . '' 
Then scanning Percerin , after noticing D'Artagnan 's hesitation , `` Well , Monsieur Percerin , '' he asked , `` what do you say to this ? '' 
`` I say , that -- '' `` That you are , doubtless , free to refuse . 
I know well -- and I by no means count upon compelling you , my dear monsieur . 
I will say more , I even understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet 's idea ; you dread appearing to flatter the king . 
A noble spirit , M. Percerin , a noble spirit ! '' 
The tailor stammered . 
`` It would , indeed , be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince , '' continued Aramis ; `` but as the surintendant told me , ` if Percerin refuse , tell him that it will not at all lower him in my opinion , and I shall always esteem him , only -- ' '' '' ` Only ? ' '' 
repeated Percerin , rather troubled . '' 
` Only , ' '' continued Aramis , '' ' I shall be compelled to say to the king , ' -- you understand , my dear Monsieur Percerin , that these are M. Fouquet 's words , -- ' I shall be constrained to say to the king , `` Sire , I had intended to present your majesty with your portrait , but owing to a feeling of delicacy , slightly exaggerated perhaps , although creditable , M. Percerin opposed the project . '' ' '' 
`` Opposed ! '' 
cried the tailor , terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him ; `` I to oppose the desire , the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to please the king ! 
Oh , what a hateful word you have uttered , monseigneur . 
Oppose ! 
Oh , 't is not I who said it , Heaven have mercy on me . 
I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it ! 
Is it not true , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that I have opposed nothing ? '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral . 
He felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it , whether comedy or tragedy ; he was at his wit 's end at not being able to fathom it , but in the meanwhile wished to keep clear . 
But already Percerin , goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he stood in the way of a pleasant surprise , had offered Lebrun a chair , and proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses , the fifth being still in the workmen 's hands ; and these masterpieces he successively fitted upon four lay figures , which , imported into France in the time of Concini , had been given to Percerin II . 
by Marshal d'Onore , after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their competition . 
The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses . 
But Aramis , who was closely watching all the phases of his toil , suddenly stopped him . 
`` I think you have not quite got it , my dear Lebrun , '' he said ; `` your colors will deceive you , and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance which is absolutely requisite . 
Time is necessary for attentively observing the finer shades . '' 
`` Quite true , '' said Percerin , `` but time is wanting , and on that head , you will agree with me , monseigneur , I can do nothing . '' 
`` Then the affair will fail , '' said Aramis , quietly , `` and that because of a want of precision in the colors . '' 
Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity -- a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience . 
`` What in the world , now , is the meaning of this imbroglio ? '' 
the musketeer kept saying to himself . 
`` That will never do , '' said Aramis : `` M. Lebrun , close your box , and roll up your canvas . '' 
`` But , monsieur , '' cried the vexed painter , `` the light is abominable here . '' 
`` An idea , M. Lebrun , an idea ! 
If we had a pattern of the materials , for example , and with time , and a better light -- '' `` Oh , then , '' cried Lebrun , `` I would answer for the effect . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing ; they want a pattern of each of the materials . 
Mordioux ! 
Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
-- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . '' 
Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes , Percerin put back the dresses into the closet , Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were secure , -- and they all left the study . 
Bourgeois Gentilhomme . 
D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber ; but no longer an irritated Porthos , or a disappointed Porthos , but Porthos radiant , blooming , fascinating , and chattering with Moliere , who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry , and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater , but not even ever anything so great . 
Aramis went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand , which lost itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend , -- an operation which Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness . 
But the friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him , the bishop of Vannes passed over to Moliere . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said he , `` will you come with me to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` I will go anywhere you like , monseigneur , '' answered Moliere . 
`` To Saint-Mande ! '' 
cried Porthos , surprised at seeing the proud bishop of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor . 
`` What , Aramis , are you going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically . 
`` Yes , I ask you , what has he done for you ? '' 
`` My friend , he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished : he has taken my measure without touching me ! '' 
`` Ah , bah !
