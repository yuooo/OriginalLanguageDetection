It was , as we have said , the 15th of August . 
The sun poured down its burning rays upon the heathen deities of marble and bronze : it raised the temperature of the water in the conch shells , and ripened , on the walls , those magnificent peaches , of which the king , fifty years later , spoke so regretfully , when , at Marly , on an occasion of a scarcity of the finer sorts of peaches being complained of , in the beautiful gardens there -- gardens which had cost France double the amount that had been expended on Vaux -- the great king observed to some one : `` You are far too young to have eaten any of M. Fouquet 's peaches . '' 
Oh , fame ! 
Oh , blazon of renown ! 
Oh , glory of this earth ! 
That very man whose judgment was so sound and accurate where merit was concerned -- he who had swept into his coffers the inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet , who had robbed him of Lenotre and Lebrun , and had sent him to rot for the remainder of his life in one of the state prisons -- merely remembered the peaches of that vanquished , crushed , forgotten enemy ! 
It was to little purpose that Fouquet had squandered thirty millions of francs in the fountains of his gardens , in the crucibles of his sculptors , in the writing-desks of his literary friends , in the portfolios of his painters ; vainly had he fancied that thereby he might be remembered . 
A peach -- a blushing , rich-flavored fruit , nestling in the trellis work on the garden-wall , hidden beneath its long , green leaves , -- this little vegetable production , that a dormouse would nibble up without a thought , was sufficient to recall to the memory of this great monarch the mournful shade of the last surintendant of France . 
With a perfect reliance that Aramis had made arrangements fairly to distribute the vast number of guests throughout the palace , and that he had not omitted to attend to any of the internal regulations for their comfort , Fouquet devoted his entire attention to the ensemble alone . 
In one direction Gourville showed him the preparations which had been made for the fireworks ; in another , Moliere led him over the theater ; at last , after he had visited the chapel , the salons , and the galleries , and was again going downstairs , exhausted with fatigue , Fouquet saw Aramis on the staircase . 
The prelate beckoned to him . 
The surintendant joined his friend , and , with him , paused before a large picture scarcely finished . 
Applying himself , heart and soul , to his work , the painter Lebrun , covered with perspiration , stained with paint , pale from fatigue and the inspiration of genius , was putting the last finishing touches with his rapid brush . 
It was the portrait of the king , whom they were expecting , dressed in the court suit which Percerin had condescended to show beforehand to the bishop of Vannes . 
Fouquet placed himself before this portrait , which seemed to live , as one might say , in the cool freshness of its flesh , and in its warmth of color . 
He gazed upon it long and fixedly , estimated the prodigious labor that had been bestowed upon it , and , not being able to find any recompense sufficiently great for this Herculean effort , he passed his arm round the painter 's neck and embraced him . 
The surintendant , by this action , had utterly ruined a suit of clothes worth a thousand pistoles , but he had satisfied , more than satisfied , Lebrun . 
It was a happy moment for the artist ; it was an unhappy moment for M. Percerin , who was walking behind Fouquet , and was engaged in admiring , in Lebrun 's painting , the suit that he had made for his majesty , a perfect objet d'art , as he called it , which was not to be matched except in the wardrobe of the surintendant . 
His distress and his exclamations were interrupted by a signal which had been given from the summit of the mansion . 
In the direction of Melun , in the still empty , open plain , the sentinels of Vaux had just perceived the advancing procession of the king and the queens . 
His majesty was entering Melun with his long train of carriages and cavaliers . 
`` In an hour -- '' said Aramis to Fouquet . 
`` In an hour ! '' 
replied the latter , sighing . 
`` And the people who ask one another what is the good of these royal fetes ! '' 
continued the bishop of Vannes , laughing , with his false smile . 
`` Alas ! 
I , too , who am not the people , ask myself the same thing . '' 
`` I will answer you in four and twenty hours , monseigneur . 
Assume a cheerful countenance , for it should be a day of true rejoicing . '' 
`` Well , believe me or not , as you like , D'Herblay , '' said the surintendant , with a swelling heart , pointing at the cortege of Louis , visible in the horizon , `` he certainly loves me but very little , and I do not care much more for him ; but I can not tell you how it is , that since he is approaching my house -- '' `` Well , what ? '' 
`` Well , since I know he is on his way here , as my guest , he is more sacred than ever for me ; he is my acknowledged sovereign , and as such is very dear to me . '' 
`` Dear ? 
yes , '' said Aramis , playing upon the word , as the Abbe Terray did , at a later period , with Louis XV . 
`` Do not laugh , D'Herblay ; I feel that , if he really seemed to wish it , I could love that young man . '' 
`` You should not say that to me , '' returned Aramis , `` but rather to M. Colbert . '' 
`` To M. Colbert ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet . 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because he would allow you a pension out of the king 's privy purse , as soon as he becomes surintendant , '' said Aramis , preparing to leave as soon as he had dealt this last blow . 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
returned Fouquet , with a gloomy look . 
`` To my own apartment , in order to change my costume , monseigneur . '' 
`` Whereabouts are you lodging , D'Herblay ? '' 
`` In the blue room on the second story . '' 
`` The room immediately over the king 's room ? '' 
`` Precisely . '' 
`` You will be subject to very great restraint there . 
What an idea to condemn yourself to a room where you can not stir or move about ! '' 
`` During the night , monseigneur , I sleep or read in my bed . '' 
`` And your servants ? '' 
`` I have but one attendant with me . 
I find my reader quite sufficient . 
Adieu , monseigneur ; do not overfatigue yourself ; keep yourself fresh for the arrival of the king . '' 
`` We shall see you by and by , I suppose , and shall see your friend Du Vallon also ? '' 
`` He is lodging next to me , and is at this moment dressing . '' 
And Fouquet , bowing , with a smile , passed on like a commander-in-chief who pays the different outposts a visit after the enemy has been signaled in sight . 
-LSB- 2 -RSB- The king had , in point of fact , entered Melun with the intention of merely passing through the city . 
The youthful monarch was most eagerly anxious for amusements ; only twice during the journey had he been able to catch a glimpse of La Valliere , and , suspecting that his only opportunity of speaking to her would be after nightfall , in the gardens , and after the ceremonial of reception had been gone through , he had been very desirous to arrive at Vaux as early as possible . 
But he reckoned without his captain of the musketeers , and without M. Colbert . 
Like Calypso , who could not be consoled at the departure of Ulysses , our Gascon could not console himself for not having guessed why Aramis had asked Percerin to show him the king 's new costumes . 
`` There is not a doubt , '' he said to himself , `` that my friend the bishop of Vannes had some motive in that ; '' and then he began to rack his brains most uselessly . 
D'Artagnan , so intimately acquainted with all the court intrigues , who knew the position of Fouquet better than even Fouquet himself did , had conceived the strangest fancies and suspicions at the announcement of the fete , which would have ruined a wealthy man , and which became impossible , utter madness even , for a man so poor as he was . 
And then , the presence of Aramis , who had returned from Belle-Isle , and been nominated by Monsieur Fouquet inspector-general of all the arrangements ; his perseverance in mixing himself up with all the surintendant 's affairs ; his visits to Baisemeaux ; all this suspicious singularity of conduct had excessively troubled and tormented D'Artagnan during the last two weeks . 
`` With men of Aramis 's stamp , '' he said , `` one is never the stronger except sword in hand . 
So long as Aramis continued a soldier , there was hope of getting the better of him ; but since he has covered his cuirass with a stole , we are lost . 
But what can Aramis 's object possibly be ? '' 
And D'Artagnan plunged again into deep thought . 
`` What does it matter to me , after all , '' he continued , `` if his only object is to overthrow M. Colbert ? 
And what else can he be after ? '' 
And D'Artagnan rubbed his forehead -- that fertile land , whence the plowshare of his nails had turned up so many and such admirable ideas in his time . 
He , at first , thought of talking the matter over with Colbert , but his friendship for Aramis , the oath of earlier days , bound him too strictly . 
He revolted at the bare idea of such a thing , and , besides , he hated the financier too cordially . 
Then , again , he wished to unburden his mind to the king ; but yet the king would not be able to understand the suspicions which had not even a shadow of reality at their base . 
He resolved to address himself to Aramis , direct , the first time he met him . 
`` I will get him , '' said the musketeer , `` between a couple of candles , suddenly , and when he least expects it , I will place my hand upon his heart , and he will tell me -- What will he tell me ? 
Yes , he will tell me something , for mordioux ! 
there is something in it , I know . '' 
Somewhat calmer , D'Artagnan made every preparation for the journey , and took the greatest care that the military household of the king , as yet very inconsiderable in numbers , should be well officered and well disciplined in its meager and limited proportions . 
The result was that , through the captain 's arrangements , the king , on arriving at Melun , saw himself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards , as well as a picket of the French guards . 
It might almost have been called a small army . 
M. Colbert looked at the troops with great delight : he even wished they had been a third more in number . 
`` But why ? '' 
said the king . 
`` In order to show greater honor to M. Fouquet , '' replied Colbert . 
`` In order to ruin him the sooner , '' thought D'Artagnan . 
When this little army appeared before Melun , the chief magistrates came out to meet the king , and to present him with the keys of the city , and invited him to enter the Hotel de Ville , in order to partake of the wine of honor . 
The king , who expected to pass through the city and to proceed to Vaux without delay , became quite red in the face from vexation . 
`` Who was fool enough to occasion this delay ? '' 
muttered the king , between his teeth , as the chief magistrate was in the middle of a long address . 
`` Not I , certainly , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` but I believe it was M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert , having heard his name pronounced , said , `` What was M. d'Artagnan good enough to say ? '' 
`` I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king 's progress , so that he might taste the vin de Brie . 
Was I right ? '' 
`` Quite so , monsieur . '' 
`` In that case , then , it was you whom the king called some name or other . '' 
`` What name ? '' 
`` I hardly know ; but wait a moment -- idiot , I think it was -- no , no , it was fool or dolt . 
Yes ; his majesty said that the man who had thought of the vin de Melun was something of the sort . '' 
D'Artagnan , after this broadside , quietly caressed his mustache ; M. Colbert 's large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever . 
D'Artagnan , seeing how ugly anger made him , did not stop half-way . 
The orator still went on with his speech , while the king 's color was visibly increasing . '' 
Mordioux ! '' 
said the musketeer , coolly , `` the king is going to have an attack of determination of blood to the head . 
Where the deuce did you get hold of that idea , Monsieur Colbert ? 
You have no luck . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said the financier , drawing himself up , `` my zeal for the king 's service inspired me with the idea . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Melun is a city , an excellent city , which pays well , and which it would be imprudent to displease . '' 
`` There , now ! 
I , who do not pretend to be a financier , saw only one idea in your idea . '' 
`` What was that , monsieur ? '' 
`` That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet , who is making himself quite giddy on his donjons yonder , in waiting for us . '' 
This was a home-stroke , hard enough in all conscience . 
Colbert was completely thrown out of the saddle by it , and retired , thoroughly discomfited . 
Fortunately , the speech was now at an end ; the king drank the wine which was presented to him , and then every one resumed the progress through the city . 
The king bit his lips in anger , for the evening was closing in , and all hope of a walk with La Valliere was at an end . 
In order that the whole of the king 's household should enter Vaux , four hours at least were necessary , owing to the different arrangements . 
The king , therefore , who was boiling with impatience , hurried forward as much as possible , in order to reach it before nightfall . 
But , at the moment he was setting off again , other and fresh difficulties arose . 
`` Is not the king going to sleep at Melun ? '' 
said Colbert , in a low tone of voice , to D'Artagnan . 
M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day , to address himself in that manner to the chief of the musketeers ; for the latter guessed that the king 's intention was very far from that of remaining where he was . 
D'Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and strongly accompanied ; and desired that his majesty would not enter except with all the escort . 
On the other hand , he felt that these delays would irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure . 
In what way could he possibly reconcile these difficulties ? 
D'Artagnan took up Colbert 's remark , and determined to repeated it to the king . 
`` Sire , '' he said , `` M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not intend to sleep at Melun . '' 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
What for ? '' 
exclaimed Louis XIV . 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
Who , in Heaven 's name , can have thought of such a thing , when M. Fouquet is expecting us this evening ? '' 
`` It was simply , '' replied Colbert , quickly , `` the fear of causing your majesty the least delay ; for , according to established etiquette , you can not enter any place , with the exception of your own royal residences , until the soldiers ' quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster , and the garrison properly distributed . '' 
D'Artagnan listened with the greatest attention , biting his mustache to conceal his vexation ; and the queens were not less interested . 
They were fatigued , and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any farther ; more especially , in order to prevent the king walking about in the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court , for , if etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms , the ladies of honor , as soon as they had performed the services required of them , had no restrictions placed upon them , but were at liberty to walk about as they pleased . 
It will easily be conjectured that all these rival interests , gathering together in vapors , necessarily produced clouds , and that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest . 
The king had no mustache to gnaw , and therefore kept biting the handle of his whip instead , with ill-concealed impatience . 
How could he get out of it ? 
D'Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible , and Colbert as sulky as he could . 
Who was there he could get in a passion with ? 
`` We will consult the queen , '' said Louis XIV. , bowing to the royal ladies . 
And this kindness of consideration softened Maria Theresa 's heart , who , being of a kind and generous disposition , when left to her own free-will , replied : `` I shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes . '' 
`` How long will it take us to get to Vaux ? '' 
inquired Anne of Austria , in slow and measured accents , placing her hand upon her bosom , where the seat of her pain lay . 
`` An hour for your majesty 's carriages , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` the roads are tolerably good . '' 
The king looked at him . 
`` And a quarter of an hour for the king , '' he hastened to add . 
`` We should arrive by daylight ? '' 
said Louis XIV . 
`` But the billeting of the king 's military escort , '' objected Colbert , softly , `` will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed , however quick he may be . '' 
`` Double ass that you are ! '' 
thought D'Artagnan ; `` if I had any interest or motive in demolishing your credit with the king , I could do it in ten minutes . 
If I were in the king 's place , '' he added aloud , `` I should , in going to M. Fouquet , leave my escort behind me ; I should go to him as a friend ; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards ; I should consider that I was acting more nobly , and should be invested with a still more sacred character by doing so . '' 
Delight sparkled in the king 's eyes . 
`` That is indeed a very sensible suggestion . 
We will go to see a friend as friends ; the gentlemen who are with the carriages can go slowly : but we who are mounted will ride on . '' 
And he rode off , accompanied by all those who were mounted . 
Colbert hid his ugly head behind his horse 's neck . 
`` I shall be quits , '' said D'Artagnan , as he galloped along , `` by getting a little talk with Aramis this evening . 
And then , M. Fouquet is a man of honor . 
Mordioux ! 
I have said so , and it must be so . '' 
And this was the way how , towards seven o'clock in the evening , without announcing his arrival by the din of trumpets , and without even his advanced guard , without out-riders or musketeers , the king presented himself before the gate of Vaux , where Fouquet , who had been informed of his royal guest 's approach , had been waiting for the last half-hour , with his head uncovered , surrounded by his household and his friends . 
M. Fouquet held the stirrup of the king , who , having dismounted , bowed most graciously , and more graciously still held out his hand to him , which Fouquet , in spite of a slight resistance on the king 's part , carried respectfully to his lips . 
The king wished to wait in the first courtyard for the arrival of the carriages , nor had he long to wait , for the roads had been put into excellent order by the superintendent , and a stone would hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way from Melun to Vaux ; so that the carriages , rolling along as though on a carpet , brought the ladies to Vaux , without jolting or fatigue , by eight o'clock . 
They were received by Madame Fouquet , and at the moment they made their appearance , a light as bright as day burst forth from every quarter , trees , vases , and marble statues . 
This species of enchantment lasted until their majesties had retired into the palace . 
All these wonders and magical effects which the chronicler has heaped up , or rather embalmed , in his recital , at the risk of rivaling the brain-born scenes of romancers ; these splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and nature corrected , together with every delight and luxury combined for the satisfaction of all the senses , as well as the imagination , Fouquet did in real truth offer to his sovereign in that enchanting retreat of which no monarch could at that time boast of possessing an equal . 
We do not intend to describe the grand banquet , at which the royal guests were present , nor the concerts , nor the fairy-like and more than magic transformations and metamorphoses ; it will be enough for our purpose to depict the countenance the king assumed , which , from being gay , soon wore a very gloomy , constrained , and irritated expression . 
He remembered his own residence , royal though it was , and the mean and indifferent style of luxury that prevailed there , which comprised but little more than what was merely useful for the royal wants , without being his own personal property . 
The large vases of the Louvre , the older furniture and plate of Henry II. , of Francis I. , and of Louis XI. , were but historic monuments of earlier days ; nothing but specimens of art , the relics of his predecessors ; while with Fouquet , the value of the article was as much in the workmanship as in the article itself . 
Fouquet ate from a gold service , which artists in his own employ had modeled and cast for him alone . 
Fouquet drank wines of which the king of France did not even know the name , and drank them out of goblets each more valuable than the entire royal cellar . 
What , too , was to be said of the apartments , the hangings , the pictures , the servants and officers , of every description , of his household ? 
What of the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by order ; stiff formality by personal , unrestrained comfort ; the happiness and contentment of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed the host ? 
The perfect swarm of busily engaged persons moving about noiselessly ; the multitude of guests , -- who were , however , even less numerous than the servants who waited on them , -- the myriad of exquisitely prepared dishes , of gold and silver vases ; the floods of dazzling light , the masses of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses had been despoiled , redundant with luxuriance of unequaled scent and beauty ; the perfect harmony of the surroundings , which , indeed , was no more than the prelude of the promised fete , charmed all who were there ; and they testified their admiration over and over again , not by voice or gesture , but by deep silence and rapt attention , those two languages of the courtier which acknowledge the hand of no master powerful enough to restrain them . 
As for the king , his eyes filled with tears ; he dared not look at the queen . 
Anne of Austria , whose pride was superior to that of any creature breathing , overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which she treated everything handed to her . 
The young queen , kind-hearted by nature and curious by disposition , praised Fouquet , ate with an exceedingly good appetite , and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed upon the table . 
Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names . 
The fruits came from his own stores ; he had often cultivated them himself , having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic fruits and plants . 
The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the replies , but was only the more humiliated ; he thought the queen a little too familiar in her manners , and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno a little too much , in being too proud and haughty ; his chief anxiety , however , was himself , that he might remain cold and distant in his behavior , bordering lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple admiration . 
But Fouquet had foreseen all this ; he was , in fact , one of those men who foresee everything . 
The king had expressly declared that , so long as he remained under Fouquet 's roof , he did not wish his own different repasts to be served in accordance with the usual etiquette , and that he would , consequently , dine with the rest of society ; but by the thoughtful attention of the surintendant , the king 's dinner was served up separately , if one may so express it , in the middle of the general table ; the dinner , wonderful in every respect , from the dishes of which was composed , comprised everything the king liked and generally preferred to anything else . 
Louis had no excuse -- he , indeed , who had the keenest appetite in his kingdom -- for saying that he was not hungry . 
Nay , M. Fouquet did even better still ; he certainly , in obedience to the king 's expressed desire , seated himself at the table , but as soon as the soups were served , he arose and personally waited on the king , while Madame Fouquet stood behind the queen-mother 's armchair . 
The disdain of Juno and the sulky fits of temper of Jupiter could not resist this excess of kindly feeling and polite attention . 
The queen ate a biscuit dipped in a glass of San-Lucar wine ; and the king ate of everything , saying to M. Fouquet : `` It is impossible , monsieur le surintendant , to dine better anywhere . '' 
Whereupon the whole court began , on all sides , to devour the dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked as though a cloud of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and growing crops . 
As soon , however , as his hunger was appeased , the king became morose and overgloomed again ; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he fancied he had previously manifested , and particularly on account of the deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet . 
D'Artagnan , who ate a good deal and drank but little , without allowing it to be noticed , did not lose a single opportunity , but made a great number of observations which he turned to good profit . 
When the supper was finished , the king expressed a wish not to lose the promenade . 
The park was illuminated ; the moon , too , as if she had placed herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux , silvered the trees and lake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light . 
The air was strangely soft and balmy ; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through the thickly set avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet . 
The fete was complete in every respect , for the king , having met La Valliere in one of the winding paths of the wood , was able to press her hand and say , `` I love you , '' without any one overhearing him except M. d'Artagnan , who followed , and M. Fouquet , who preceded him . 
The dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on . 
The king having requested to be shown to his room , there was immediately a movement in every direction . 
The queens passed to their own apartments , accompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes ; the king found his musketeers awaiting him on the grand flight of steps , for M. Fouquet had brought them on from Melun and had invited them to supper . 
D'Artagnan 's suspicions at once disappeared . 
He was weary , he had supped well , and wished , for once in his life , thoroughly to enjoy a fete given by a man who was in every sense of the word a king . 
`` M. Fouquet , '' he said , `` is the man for me . '' 
The king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of Morpheus , of which we owe some cursory description to our readers . 
It was the handsomest and largest in the palace . 
Lebrun had painted on the vaulted ceiling the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus inflicts on kings as well as on other men . 
Everything that sleep gives birth to that is lovely , its fairy scenes , its flowers and nectar , the wild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses , had the painter elaborated on his frescoes . 
It was a composition as soft and pleasing in one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in another . 
The poisoned chalice , the glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper ; wizards and phantoms with terrific masks , those half-dim shadows more alarming than the approach of fire or the somber face of midnight , these , and such as these , he had made the companions of his more pleasing pictures . 
No sooner had the king entered his room than a cold shiver seemed to pass through him , and on Fouquet asking him the cause of it , the king replied , as pale as death : `` I am sleepy , that is all . '' 
`` Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once ? '' 
`` No ; I have to talk with a few persons first , '' said the king . 
`` Will you have the goodness to tell M. Colbert I wish to see him . '' 
Fouquet bowed and left the room . 
D'Artagnan had determined to lose no time , and in fact he never was in the habit of doing so . 
After having inquired for Aramis , he had looked for him in every direction until he had succeeded in finding him . 
Besides , no sooner had the king entered Vaux , than Aramis had retired to his own room , meditating , doubtless , some new piece of gallant attention for his majesty 's amusement . 
D'Artagnan desired the servants to announce him , and found on the second story -LRB- in a beautiful room called the Blue Chamber , on account of the color of its hangings -RRB- the bishop of Vannes in company with Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans . 
Aramis came forward to embrace his friend , and offered him the best seat . 
As it was after awhile generally remarked among those present that the musketeer was reserved , and wished for an opportunity for conversing secretly with Aramis , the Epicureans took their leave . 
Porthos , however , did not stir ; for true it is that , having dined exceedingly well , he was fast asleep in his armchair ; and the freedom of conversation therefore was not interrupted by a third person . 
Porthos had a deep , harmonious snore , and people might talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear of disturbing him . 
D'Artagnan felt that he was called upon to open the conversation . 
`` Well , and so we have come to Vaux , '' he said . 
`` Why , yes , D'Artagnan . 
And how do you like the place ? '' 
`` Very much , and I like M. Fouquet , also . '' 
`` Is he not a charming host ? '' 
`` No one could be more so . '' 
`` I am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner towards M. Fouquet , but that his majesty grew much more cordial afterwards . '' 
`` You did not notice it , then , since you say you have been told so ? '' 
`` No ; I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about the theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place to-morrow . '' 
`` Ah , indeed ! 
you are the comptroller-general of the fetes here , then ? '' 
`` You know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of the imagination is called into activity ; I have always been a poet in one way or another . '' 
`` Yes , I remember the verses you used to write , they were charming . '' 
`` I have forgotten them , but I am delighted to read the verses of others , when those others are known by the names of Moliere , Pelisson , La Fontaine , etc. '' `` Do you know what idea occurred to me this evening , Aramis ? '' 
`` No ; tell me what it was , for I should never be able to guess it , you have so many . '' 
`` Well , the idea occurred to me , that the true king of France is not Louis XIV . '' '' 
What ! '' 
said Aramis , involuntarily , looking the musketeer full in the eyes . 
`` No , it is Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
Aramis breathed again , and smiled . 
`` Ah ! 
you are like all the rest , jealous , '' he said . 
`` I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned that pretty phrase . '' 
D'Artagnan , in order to throw Aramis off his guard , related Colbert 's misadventures with regard to the vin de Melun . 
`` He comes of a mean race , does Colbert , '' said Aramis . 
`` Quite true . '' 
`` When I think , too , '' added the bishop , `` that that fellow will be your minister within four months , and that you will serve him as blindly as you did Richelieu or Mazarin -- '' `` And as you serve M. Fouquet , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` With this difference , though , that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert . '' 
`` True , true , '' said D'Artagnan , as he pretended to become sad and full of reflection ; and then , a moment after , he added , `` Why do you tell me that M. Colbert will be minister in four months ? '' 
`` Because M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so , '' replied Aramis . 
`` He will be ruined , you mean ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so . '' 
`` Why does he give these fetes , then ? '' 
said the musketeer , in a tone so full of thoughtful consideration , and so well assumed , that the bishop was for the moment deceived by it . 
`` Why did you not dissuade him from it ? '' 
The latter part of the phrase was just a little too much , and Aramis 's former suspicions were again aroused . 
`` It is done with the object of humoring the king . '' 
`` By ruining himself ? '' 
`` Yes , by ruining himself for the king . '' 
`` A most eccentric , one might say , sinister calculation , that . '' 
`` Necessity , necessity , my friend . '' 
`` I do n't see that , dear Aramis . '' 
`` Do you not ? 
Have you not remarked M. Colbert 's daily increasing antagonism , and that he is doing his utmost to drive the king to get rid of the superintendent ? '' 
`` One must be blind not to see it . '' 
`` And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` That is well known . '' 
`` What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed against a man who will have spent everything he had to please him ? '' 
`` True , true , '' said D'Artagnan , slowly , hardly convinced , yet curious to broach another phase of the conversation . 
`` There are follies , and follies , '' he resumed , `` and I do not like those you are committing . '' 
`` What do you allude to ? '' 
`` As for the banquet , the ball , the concert , the theatricals , the tournaments , the cascades , the fireworks , the illuminations , and the presents -- these are well and good , I grant ; but why were not these expenses sufficient ? 
Why was it necessary to have new liveries and costumes for your whole household ? '' 
`` You are quite right . 
I told M. Fouquet that myself ; he replied , that if he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau , from the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars ; completely new inside and out ; and that , as soon as the king had left , he would burn the whole building and its contents , in order that it might not be made use of by any one else . '' 
`` How completely Spanish ! '' 
`` I told him so , and he then added this : ` Whoever advises me to spare expense , I shall look upon as my enemy . ' '' 
`` It is positive madness ; and that portrait , too ! '' 
`` What portrait ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` That of the king , and the surprise as well . '' 
`` What surprise ? '' 
`` The surprise you seem to have in view , and on account of which you took some specimens away , when I met you at Percerin 's . '' 
D'Artagnan paused . 
The shaft was discharged , and all he had to do was to wait and watch its effect . 
`` That is merely an act of graceful attention , '' replied Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went up to his friend , took hold of both his hands , and looking him full in the eyes , said , `` Aramis , do you still care for me a very little ? '' 
`` What a question to ask ! '' 
`` Very good . 
One favor , then . 
Why did you take some patterns of the king 's costumes at Percerin 's ? '' 
`` Come with me and ask poor Lebrun , who has been working upon them for the last two days and nights . '' 
`` Aramis , that may be truth for everybody else , but for me -- '' `` Upon my word , D'Artagnan , you astonish me . '' 
`` Be a little considerate . 
Tell me the exact truth ; you would not like anything disagreeable to happen to me , would you ? '' 
`` My dear friend , you are becoming quite incomprehensible . 
What suspicion can you have possibly got hold of ? '' 
`` Do you believe in my instinctive feelings ? 
Formerly you used to have faith in them . 
Well , then , an instinct tells me that you have some concealed project on foot . '' 
`` I -- a project ? '' 
`` I am convinced of it . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
`` I am not only sure of it , but I would even swear it . '' 
`` Indeed , D'Artagnan , you cause me the greatest pain . 
Is it likely , if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you , I should tell you about it ? 
If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed , should I not have long ago divulged it ? '' 
`` No , Aramis , no . 
There are certain projects which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives . '' 
`` In that case , my dear fellow , '' returned the bishop , laughing , `` the only thing now is , that the ` opportunity ' has not yet arrived . '' 
D'Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression . 
`` Oh , friendship , friendship ! '' 
he said , `` what an idle word you are ! 
Here is a man who , if I were but to ask it , would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake . '' 
`` You are right , '' said Aramis , nobly . 
`` And this man , who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me , will not open up before me the least corner in his heart . 
Friendship , I repeat , is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow -- a lure , like everything else in this bright , dazzling world . '' 
`` It is not thus you should speak of our friendship , '' replied the bishop , in a firm , assured voice ; `` for ours is not of the same nature as those of which you have been speaking . '' 
`` Look at us , Aramis ; three out of the old ` four . ' 
You are deceiving me ; I suspect you ; and Porthos is fast asleep . 
An admirable trio of friends , do n't you think so ? 
What an affecting relic of the former dear old times ! '' 
`` I can only tell you one thing , D'Artagnan , and I swear it on the Bible : I love you just as I used to do . 
If I ever suspect you , it is on account of others , and not on account of either of us . 
In everything I may do , and should happen to succeed in , you will find your fourth . 
Will you promise me the same favor ? '' 
`` If I am not mistaken , Aramis , your words -- at the moment you pronounce them -- are full of generous feeling . '' 
`` Such a thing is very possible . '' 
`` You are conspiring against M. Colbert . 
If that be all , mordioux , tell me so at once . 
I have the instrument in my own hand , and will pull out the tooth easily enough . '' 
Aramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his haughty features . 
`` And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert , what harm would there be in that ? '' 
`` No , no ; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand , and it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of the king 's costumes . 
Oh ! 
Aramis , we are not enemies , remember -- we are brothers . 
Tell me what you wish to undertake , and , upon the word of a D'Artagnan , if I can not help you , I will swear to remain neuter . '' 
`` I am undertaking nothing , '' said Aramis . 
`` Aramis , a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of light within my darkness : it is a voice that has never yet deceived me . 
It is the king you are conspiring against . '' 
`` The king ? '' 
exclaimed the bishop , pretending to be annoyed . 
`` Your face will not convince me ; the king , I repeat . '' 
`` Will you help me ? '' 
said Aramis , smiling ironically . 
`` Aramis , I will do more than help you -- I will do more than remain neuter -- I will save you . '' 
`` You are mad , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` I am the wiser of the two , in this matter . '' 
`` You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king ! '' 
`` Who spoke of such a thing ? '' 
smiled the musketeer . 
`` Well , let us understand one another . 
I do not see what any one can do to a legitimate king as ours is , if he does not assassinate him . '' 
D'Artagnan did not say a word . 
`` Besides , you have your guards and your musketeers here , '' said the bishop . 
`` True . '' 
`` You are not in M. Fouquet 's house , but in your own . '' 
`` True ; but in spite of that , Aramis , grant me , for pity 's sake , one single word of a true friend . '' 
`` A true friend 's word is ever truth itself . 
If I think of touching , even with my finger , the son of Anne of Austria , the true king of this realm of France -- if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before his throne -- if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow , here at Vaux , will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed -- may Heaven 's lightning blast me where I stand ! '' 
Aramis had pronounced these words with his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom , where D'Artagnan , seated with his back towards the alcove , could not suspect that any one was lying concealed . 
The earnestness of his words , the studied slowness with which he pronounced them , the solemnity of his oath , gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction . 
He took hold of both Aramis 's hands , and shook them cordially . 
Aramis had endured reproaches without turning pale , and had blushed as he listened to words of praise . 
D'Artagnan , deceived , did him honor ; but D'Artagnan , trustful and reliant , made him feel ashamed . 
`` Are you going away ? '' 
he said , as he embraced him , in order to conceal the flush on his face . 
`` Yes . 
Duty summons me . 
I have to get the watch-word . 
It seems I am to be lodged in the king 's ante-room . 
Where does Porthos sleep ? '' 
`` Take him away with you , if you like , for he rumbles through his sleepy nose like a park of artillery . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he does not stay with you , then ? '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not the least in the world . 
He has a chamber to himself , but I do n't know where . '' 
`` Very good ! '' 
said the musketeer ; from whom this separation of the two associates removed his last suspicion , and he touched Porthos lightly on the shoulder ; the latter replied by a loud yawn . 
`` Come , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` What , D'Artagnan , my dear fellow , is that you ? 
What a lucky chance ! 
Oh , yes -- true ; I have forgotten ; I am at the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Yes ; and your beautiful dress , too . '' 
`` Yes , it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere , was it not ? '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` You are walking so heavily you will make the flooring give way . '' 
`` True , '' said the musketeer ; `` this room is above the dome , I think . '' 
`` And I did not choose it for a fencing-room , I assure you , '' added the bishop . 
`` The ceiling of the king 's room has all the lightness and calm of wholesome sleep . 
Do not forget , therefore , that my flooring is merely the covering of his ceiling . 
Good night , my friends , and in ten minutes I shall be asleep myself . '' 
And Aramis accompanied them to the door , laughing quietly all the while . 
As soon as they were outside , he bolted the door , hurriedly ; closed up the chinks of the windows , and then called out , `` Monseigneur ! 
-- monseigneur ! ''
