The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle , and in the loop , as in the rope of a swing , there were seated and grouped , on that particular evening , in exquisite interlacement , two little girls ; one about two years and a half old , the other , eighteen months ; the younger in the arms of the other . 
A handkerchief , cleverly knotted about them , prevented their falling out . 
A mother had caught sight of that frightful chain , and had said , `` Come ! 
there 's a plaything for my children . '' 
The two children , who were dressed prettily and with some elegance , were radiant with pleasure ; one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron ; their eyes were a triumph ; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter . 
One had chestnut hair ; the other , brown . 
Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises ; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them ; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood . 
Above and around these two delicate heads , all made of happiness and steeped in light , the gigantic fore-carriage , black with rust , almost terrible , all entangled in curves and wild angles , rose in a vault , like the entrance of a cavern . 
A few paces apart , crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry , the mother , not a very prepossessing woman , by the way , though touching at that moment , was swinging the two children by means of a long cord , watching them carefully , for fear of accidents , with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity . 
At every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound , which resembled a cry of rage ; the little girls were in ecstasies ; the setting sun mingled in this joy , and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim . 
As she rocked her little ones , the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated : -- `` It must be , said a warrior . '' 
Her song , and the contemplation of her daughters , prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street . 
In the meantime , some one had approached her , as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance , and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear : -- `` You have two beautiful children there , Madame . '' 
`` To the fair and tender Imogene -- '' replied the mother , continuing her romance ; then she turned her head . 
A woman stood before her , a few paces distant . 
This woman also had a child , which she carried in her arms . 
She was carrying , in addition , a large carpet-bag , which seemed very heavy . 
This woman 's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold . 
It was a girl , two or three years of age . 
She could have entered into competition with the two other little ones , so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned ; she wore a cap of fine linen , ribbons on her bodice , and Valenciennes lace on her cap . 
The folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white , firm , and dimpled leg . 
She was admirably rosy and healthy . 
The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks . 
Of her eyes nothing could be known , except that they must be very large , and that they had magnificent lashes . 
She was asleep . 
She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age . 
The arms of mothers are made of tenderness ; in them children sleep profoundly . 
As for the mother , her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken . 
She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again . 
She was young . 
Was she handsome ? 
Perhaps ; but in that attire it was not apparent . 
Her hair , a golden lock of which had escaped , seemed very thick , but was severely concealed beneath an ugly , tight , close , nun-like cap , tied under the chin . 
A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them ; but she did not smile . 
Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time . 
She was pale ; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance . 
She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child . 
A large blue handkerchief , such as the Invalides use , was folded into a fichu , and concealed her figure clumsily . 
Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles , her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle ; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff , a linen gown , and coarse shoes . 
It was Fantine . 
It was Fantine , but difficult to recognize . 
Nevertheless , on scrutinizing her attentively , it was evident that she still retained her beauty . 
A melancholy fold , which resembled the beginning of irony , wrinkled her right cheek . 
As for her toilette , that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons , which seemed made of mirth , of folly , and of music , full of bells , and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight ; it melts and leaves the branch quite black . 
Ten months had elapsed since the `` pretty farce . '' 
What had taken place during those ten months ? 
It can be divined . 
After abandonment , straightened circumstances . 
Fantine had immediately lost sight of Favourite , Zephine and Dahlia ; the bond once broken on the side of the men , it was loosed between the women ; they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later , that they had been friends ; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing . 
Fantine had remained alone . 
The father of her child gone , -- alas ! 
such ruptures are irrevocable , -- she found herself absolutely isolated , minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure . 
Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew , she had neglected to keep her market open ; it was now closed to her . 
She had no resource . 
Fantine barely knew how to read , and did not know how to write ; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name ; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes , then a second , then a third . 
Tholomyes replied to none of them . 
Fantine heard the gossips say , as they looked at her child : `` Who takes those children seriously ! 
One only shrugs one 's shoulders over such children ! '' 
Then she thought of Tholomyes , who had shrugged his shoulders over his child , and who did not take that innocent being seriously ; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man . 
But what was she to do ? 
She no longer knew to whom to apply . 
She had committed a fault , but the foundation of her nature , as will be remembered , was modesty and virtue . 
She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress , and of gliding into a worse state . 
Courage was necessary ; she possessed it , and held herself firm . 
The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her . 
There , some one might possibly know her and give her work ; yes , but it would be necessary to conceal her fault . 
In a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one . 
Her heart contracted , but she took her resolution . 
Fantine , as we shall see , had the fierce bravery of life . 
She had already valiantly renounced finery , had dressed herself in linen , and had put all her silks , all her ornaments , all her ribbons , and all her laces on her daughter , the only vanity which was left to her , and a holy one it was . 
She sold all that she had , which produced for her two hundred francs ; her little debts paid , she had only about eighty francs left . 
At the age of twenty-two , on a beautiful spring morning , she quitted Paris , bearing her child on her back . 
Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them . 
This woman had , in all the world , nothing but her child , and the child had , in all the world , no one but this woman . 
Fantine had nursed her child , and this had tired her chest , and she coughed a little . 
We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes . 
Let us confine ourselves to saying , that , twenty years later , under King Louis Philippe , he was a great provincial lawyer , wealthy and influential , a wise elector , and a very severe juryman ; he was still a man of pleasure . 
Towards the middle of the day , after having , from time to time , for the sake of resting herself , travelled , for three or four sous a league , in what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris , the `` little suburban coach service , '' Fantine found herself at Montfermeil , in the alley Boulanger . 
As she passed the Thenardier hostelry , the two little girls , blissful in the monster swing , had dazzled her in a manner , and she had halted in front of that vision of joy . 
Charms exist . 
These two little girls were a charm to this mother . 
She gazed at them in much emotion . 
The presence of angels is an announcement of Paradise . 
She thought that , above this inn , she beheld the mysterious HERE of Providence . 
These two little creatures were evidently happy . 
She gazed at them , she admired them , in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song , she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read : -- `` You have two pretty children , Madame . '' 
The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young . 
The mother raised her head and thanked her , and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door , she herself being seated on the threshold . 
The two women began to chat . 
`` My name is Madame Thenardier , '' said the mother of the two little girls . 
`` We keep this inn . '' 
Then , her mind still running on her romance , she resumed humming between her teeth : -- `` It must be so ; I am a knight , And I am off to Palestine . '' 
This Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman , thin and angular -- the type of the soldier 's wife in all its unpleasantness ; and what was odd , with a languishing air , which she owed to her perusal of romances . 
She was a simpering , but masculine creature . 
Old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman . 
She was still young ; she was barely thirty . 
If this crouching woman had stood upright , her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs , might have frightened the traveller at the outset , troubled her confidence , and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish . 
A person who is seated instead of standing erect -- destinies hang upon such a thing as that . 
The traveller told her story , with slight modifications . 
That she was a working-woman ; that her husband was dead ; that her work in Paris had failed her , and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere , in her own native parts ; that she had left Paris that morning on foot ; that , as she was carrying her child , and felt fatigued , she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it ; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot ; that the little one had walked a little , but not much , because she was so young , and that she had been obliged to take her up , and the jewel had fallen asleep . 
At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss , which woke her . 
The child opened her eyes , great blue eyes like her mother 's , and looked at -- what ? 
Nothing ; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children , which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue . 
One would say that they feel themselves to be angels , and that they know us to be men . 
Then the child began to laugh ; and although the mother held fast to her , she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run . 
All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing , stopped short , and put out her tongue , in sign of admiration . 
Mother Thenardier released her daughters , made them descend from the swing , and said : -- `` Now amuse yourselves , all three of you . '' 
Children become acquainted quickly at that age , and at the expiration of a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer at making holes in the ground , which was an immense pleasure . 
The new-comer was very gay ; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child ; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel , and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly . 
The grave-digger 's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child . 
The two women pursued their chat . 
`` What is your little one 's name ? '' 
`` Cosette . '' 
For Cosette , read Euphrasie . 
The child 's name was Euphrasie . 
But out of Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into Pepita , and Francoise into Sillette . 
It is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists . 
We have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon . 
`` How old is she ? '' 
`` She is going on three . '' 
`` That is the age of my eldest . '' 
In the meantime , the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness ; an event had happened ; a big worm had emerged from the ground , and they were afraid ; and they were in ecstasies over it . 
Their radiant brows touched each other ; one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole . 
`` How easily children get acquainted at once ! '' 
exclaimed Mother Thenardier ; `` one would swear that they were three sisters ! '' 
This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for . 
She seized the Thenardier 's hand , looked at her fixedly , and said : -- `` Will you keep my child for me ? '' 
The Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal . 
Cosette 's mother continued : -- `` You see , I can not take my daughter to the country . 
My work will not permit it . 
With a child one can find no situation . 
People are ridiculous in the country . 
It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn . 
When I caught sight of your little ones , so pretty , so clean , and so happy , it overwhelmed me . 
I said : ` Here is a good mother . 
That is just the thing ; that will make three sisters . ' 
And then , it will not be long before I return . 
Will you keep my child for me ? '' 
`` I must see about it , '' replied the Thenardier . 
`` I will give you six francs a month . '' 
Here a man 's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop : -- `` Not for less than seven francs . 
And six months paid in advance . '' 
`` Six times seven makes forty-two , '' said the Thenardier . 
`` I will give it , '' said the mother . 
`` And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses , '' added the man 's voice . 
`` Total , fifty-seven francs , '' said Madame Thenardier . 
And she hummed vaguely , with these figures : -- `` It must be , said a warrior . '' 
`` I will pay it , '' said the mother . 
`` I have eighty francs . 
I shall have enough left to reach the country , by travelling on foot . 
I shall earn money there , and as soon as I have a little I will return for my darling . '' 
The man 's voice resumed : -- `` The little one has an outfit ? '' 
`` That is my husband , '' said the Thenardier . 
`` Of course she has an outfit , the poor treasure . 
-- I understood perfectly that it was your husband . 
-- And a beautiful outfit , too ! 
a senseless outfit , everything by the dozen , and silk gowns like a lady . 
It is here , in my carpet-bag . '' 
`` You must hand it over , '' struck in the man 's voice again . 
`` Of course I shall give it to you , '' said the mother . 
`` It would be very queer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked ! '' 
The master 's face appeared . 
`` That 's good , '' said he . 
The bargain was concluded . 
The mother passed the night at the inn , gave up her money and left her child , fastened her carpet-bag once more , now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit , and light henceforth and set out on the following morning , intending to return soon . 
People arrange such departures tranquilly ; but they are despairs ! 
A neighbor of the Thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out , and came back with the remark : -- `` I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart . '' 
When Cosette 's mother had taken her departure , the man said to the woman : -- `` That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due to-morrow ; I lacked fifty francs . 
Do you know that I should have had a bailiff and a protest after me ? 
You played the mouse-trap nicely with your young ones . '' 
`` Without suspecting it , '' said the woman . 
The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen ; but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse . 
Who were these Thenardiers ? 
Let us say a word or two of them now . 
We will complete the sketch later on . 
These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful , and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale , which is between the class called `` middle '' and the class denominated as `` inferior , '' and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first , without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois . 
They were of those dwarfed natures which , if a dull fire chances to warm them up , easily become monstrous . 
There was in the woman a substratum of the brute , and in the man the material for a blackguard . 
Both were susceptible , in the highest degree , of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil . 
There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness , retrograding in life rather than advancing , employing experience to augment their deformity , growing incessantly worse , and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness . 
This man and woman possessed such souls . 
Thenardier , in particular , was troublesome for a physiognomist . 
One can only look at some men to distrust them ; for one feels that they are dark in both directions . 
They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front . 
There is something of the unknown about them . 
One can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do . 
The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them . 
From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture , one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future . 
This Thenardier , if he himself was to be believed , had been a soldier -- a sergeant , he said . 
He had probably been through the campaign of 1815 , and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor , it would seem . 
We shall see later on how much truth there was in this . 
The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms . 
He had painted it himself ; for he knew how to do a little of everything , and badly . 
It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which , after having been Clelie , was no longer anything but Lodoiska , still noble , but ever more and more vulgar , having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme , and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthelemy-Hadot , was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame , and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent . 
Madame Thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books . 
She lived on them . 
In them she drowned what brains she possessed . 
This had given her , when very young , and even a little later , a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband , a scamp of a certain depth , a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar , coarse and fine at one and the same time , but , so far as sentimentalism was concerned , given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun , and `` in what concerns the sex , '' as he said in his jargon -- a downright , unmitigated lout . 
His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was . 
Later on , when her hair , arranged in a romantically drooping fashion , began to grow gray , when the Magaera began to be developed from the Pamela , the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse , vicious woman , who had dabbled in stupid romances . 
Now , one can not read nonsense with impunity . 
The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine ; as for the younger , the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare ; I know not to what diversion , effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil , she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma . 
However , we will remark by the way , everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding , and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names . 
By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom . 
It is not rare for the neatherd 's boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur , Alfred , or Alphonse , and for the vicomte -- if there are still any vicomtes -- to be called Thomas , Pierre , or Jacques . 
This displacement , which places the `` elegant '' name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat , is nothing else than an eddy of equality . 
The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else . 
Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing , -- the French Revolution . 
It is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper . 
The cook-shop was in a bad way . 
Thanks to the traveller 's fifty-seven francs , Thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature . 
On the following month they were again in need of money . 
The woman took Cosette 's outfit to Paris , and pawned it at the pawnbroker 's for sixty francs . 
As soon as that sum was spent , the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity ; and they treated her accordingly . 
As she had no longer any clothes , they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats ; that is to say , in rags . 
They fed her on what all the rest had left -- a little better than the dog , a little worse than the cat . 
Moreover , the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions ; Cosette ate with them under the table , from a wooden bowl similar to theirs . 
The mother , who had established herself , as we shall see later on , at M. sur M. , wrote , or , more correctly , caused to be written , a letter every month , that she might have news of her child . 
The Thenardiers replied invariably , `` Cosette is doing wonderfully well . '' 
At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month , and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month . 
The year was not completed when Thenardier said : `` A fine favor she is doing us , in sooth ! 
What does she expect us to do with her seven francs ? '' 
and he wrote to demand twelve francs . 
The mother , whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy , `` and was coming on well , '' submitted , and forwarded the twelve francs . 
Certain natures can not love on the one hand without hating on the other . 
Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately , which caused her to hate the stranger . 
It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects . 
Little as was the space occupied by Cosette , it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own , and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed . 
This woman , like many women of her sort , had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day . 
If she had not had Cosette , it is certain that her daughters , idolized as they were , would have received the whole of it ; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself . 
Her daughters received nothing but caresses . 
Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement . 
The sweet , feeble being , who should not have understood anything of this world or of God , incessantly punished , scolded , ill-used , beaten , and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself , who lived in a ray of dawn ! 
Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette . 
Eponine and Azelma were vicious . 
Children at that age are only copies of their mother . 
The size is smaller ; that is all . 
A year passed ; then another . 
People in the village said : -- `` Those Thenardiers are good people . 
They are not rich , and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands ! '' 
They thought that Cosette 's mother had forgotten her . 
In the meanwhile , Thenardier , having learned , it is impossible to say by what obscure means , that the child was probably a bastard , and that the mother could not acknowledge it , exacted fifteen francs a month , saying that `` the creature '' was growing and `` eating , '' and threatening to send her away . 
`` Let her not bother me , '' he exclaimed , `` or I 'll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets . 
I must have an increase . '' 
The mother paid the fifteen francs . 
From year to year the child grew , and so did her wretchedness . 
As long as Cosette was little , she was the scape-goat of the two other children ; as soon as she began to develop a little , that is to say , before she was even five years old , she became the servant of the household . 
Five years old ! 
the reader will say ; that is not probable . 
Alas ! 
it is true . 
Social suffering begins at all ages . 
Have we not recently seen the trial of a man named Dumollard , an orphan turned bandit , who , from the age of five , as the official documents state , being alone in the world , `` worked for his living and stole '' ? 
Cosette was made to run on errands , to sweep the rooms , the courtyard , the street , to wash the dishes , to even carry burdens . 
The Thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner , since the mother , who was still at M. sur M. , had become irregular in her payments . 
Some months she was in arrears . 
If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three years , she would not have recognized her child . 
Cosette , so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house , was now thin and pale . 
She had an indescribably uneasy look . 
`` The sly creature , '' said the Thenardiers . 
Injustice had made her peevish , and misery had made her ugly . 
Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes , which inspired pain , because , large as they were , it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness . 
It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child , not yet six years old , shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen , full of holes , sweeping the street before daylight , with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands , and a tear in her great eyes . 
She was called the Lark in the neighborhood . 
The populace , who are fond of these figures of speech , had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling , frightened , and shivering little creature , no bigger than a bird , who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village , and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak . 
Only the little lark never sang . 
And in the meantime , what had become of that mother who according to the people at Montfermeil , seemed to have abandoned her child ? 
Where was she ? 
What was she doing ? 
After leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers , she had continued her journey , and had reached M. sur M. This , it will be remembered , was in 1818 . 
Fantine had quitted her province ten years before . 
M. sur M. had changed its aspect . 
While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness , her native town had prospered . 
About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place . 
This detail is important , and we regard it as useful to develop it at length ; we should almost say , to underline it . 
From time immemorial , M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany . 
This industry had always vegetated , on account of the high price of the raw material , which reacted on the manufacture . 
At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M. , an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of `` black goods . '' 
Towards the close of 1815 a man , a stranger , had established himself in the town , and had been inspired with the idea of substituting , in this manufacture , gum-lac for resin , and , for bracelets in particular , slides of sheet-iron simply laid together , for slides of soldered sheet-iron . 
This very small change had effected a revolution . 
This very small change had , in fact , prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material , which had rendered it possible in the first place , to raise the price of manufacture , a benefit to the country ; in the second place , to improve the workmanship , an advantage to the consumer ; in the third place , to sell at a lower price , while trebling the profit , which was a benefit to the manufacturer . 
Thus three results ensued from one idea . 
In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich , which is good , and had made every one about him rich , which is better . 
He was a stranger in the Department . 
Of his origin , nothing was known ; of the beginning of his career , very little . 
It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money , a few hundred francs at the most . 
It was from this slender capital , enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea , developed by method and thought , that he had drawn his own fortune , and the fortune of the whole countryside . 
On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments , the appearance , and the language of a workingman . 
It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of M. sur M. , just at nightfall , on a December evening , knapsack on back and thorn club in hand , a large fire had broken out in the town-hall . 
This man had rushed into the flames and saved , at the risk of his own life , two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie ; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport . 
Afterwards they had learned his name . 
He was called Father Madeleine . 
He was a man about fifty years of age , who had a preoccupied air , and who was good . 
That was all that could be said about him . 
Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably re-constructed , M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade . 
Spain , which consumes a good deal of black jet , made enormous purchases there each year . 
M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this branch of commerce . 
Father Madeleine 's profits were such , that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory , in which there were two vast workrooms , one for the men , and the other for women . 
Any one who was hungry could present himself there , and was sure of finding employment and bread . 
Father Madeleine required of the men good will , of the women pure morals , and of all , probity . 
He had separated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes , and so that the women and girls might remain discreet . 
On this point he was inflexible . 
It was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant . 
He was all the more firmly set on this severity , since M. sur M. , being a garrison town , opportunities for corruption abounded . 
However , his coming had been a boon , and his presence was a godsend . 
Before Father Madeleine 's arrival , everything had languished in the country ; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil . 
A strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere . 
Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown . 
There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it ; no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it . 
Father Madeleine gave employment to every one . 
He exacted but one thing : Be an honest man . 
Be an honest woman . 
As we have said , in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot , Father Madeleine made his fortune ; but a singular thing in a simple man of business , it did not seem as though that were his chief care . 
He appeared to be thinking much of others , and little of himself . 
In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte ; but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs , he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor . 
The hospital was badly endowed ; he founded six beds there . 
M. sur M. is divided into the upper and the lower town . 
The lower town , in which he lived , had but one school , a miserable hovel , which was falling to ruin : he constructed two , one for girls , the other for boys . 
He allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors , a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary , and one day he said to some one who expressed surprise , `` The two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster . '' 
He created at his own expense an infant school , a thing then almost unknown in France , and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen . 
As his factory was a centre , a new quarter , in which there were a good many indigent families , rose rapidly around him ; he established there a free dispensary . 
At first , when they watched his beginnings , the good souls said , `` He 's a jolly fellow who means to get rich . '' 
When they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself , the good souls said , `` He is an ambitious man . '' 
This seemed all the more probable since the man was religious , and even practised his religion to a certain degree , a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch . 
He went regularly to low mass every Sunday . 
The local deputy , who nosed out all rivalry everywhere , soon began to grow uneasy over this religion . 
This deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire , and shared the religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire , known under the name of Fouche , Duc d'Otrante , whose creature and friend he had been . 
He indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors . 
But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock , he perceived in him a possible candidate , and resolved to outdo him ; he took a Jesuit confessor , and went to high mass and to vespers . 
Ambition was at that time , in the direct acceptation of the word , a race to the steeple . 
The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God , for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital , which made twelve . 
Nevertheless , in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that , on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country , Father Madeleine was to be appointed by the King , mayor of M. sur M. Those who had pronounced this new-comer to be `` an ambitious fellow , '' seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire , to exclaim , `` There ! 
what did we say ! '' 
All M. sur M. was in an uproar . 
The rumor was well founded . 
Several days later the appointment appeared in the Moniteur . 
On the following day Father Madeleine refused . 
In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition ; when the jury made their report , the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion of Honor . 
A fresh excitement in the little town . 
Well , so it was the cross that he wanted ! 
Father Madeleine refused the cross . 
Decidedly this man was an enigma . 
The good souls got out of their predicament by saying , `` After all , he is some sort of an adventurer . '' 
We have seen that the country owed much to him ; the poor owed him everything ; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him . 
His workmen , in particular , adored him , and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity . 
When he was known to be rich , `` people in society '' bowed to him , and he received invitations in the town ; he was called , in town , Monsieur Madeleine ; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father Madeleine , and that was what was most adapted to make him smile . 
In proportion as he mounted , throve , invitations rained down upon him . 
`` Society '' claimed him for its own . 
The prim little drawing-rooms on M. sur M. , which , of course , had at first been closed to the artisan , opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire . 
They made a thousand advances to him . 
He refused . 
This time the good gossips had no trouble . 
`` He is an ignorant man , of no education . 
No one knows where he came from . 
He would not know how to behave in society . 
It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read . '' 
When they saw him making money , they said , `` He is a man of business . '' 
When they saw him scattering his money about , they said , `` He is an ambitious man . '' 
When he was seen to decline honors , they said , `` He is an adventurer . '' 
When they saw him repulse society , they said , `` He is a brute . '' 
In 1820 , five years after his arrival in M. sur M. , the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling , the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous , that the King again appointed him mayor of the town . 
He again declined ; but the prefect resisted his refusal , all the notabilities of the place came to implore him , the people in the street besought him ; the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting . 
It was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people , who called to him from her threshold , in an angry way : `` A good mayor is a useful thing . 
Is he drawing back before the good which he can do ? '' 
This was the third phase of his ascent . 
Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine . 
Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire . 
On the other hand , he remained as simple as on the first day . 
He had gray hair , a serious eye , the sunburned complexion of a laborer , the thoughtful visage of a philosopher . 
He habitually wore a hat with a wide brim , and a long coat of coarse cloth , buttoned to the chin . 
He fulfilled his duties as mayor ; but , with that exception , he lived in solitude . 
He spoke to but few people . 
He avoided polite attentions ; he escaped quickly ; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking ; he gave , in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling , The women said of him , `` What a good-natured bear ! '' 
His pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields . 
He always took his meals alone , with an open book before him , which he read . 
He had a well-selected little library . 
He loved books ; books are cold but safe friends . 
In proportion as leisure came to him with fortune , he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind . 
It had been observed that , ever since his arrival at M. sur M. . 
his language had grown more polished , more choice , and more gentle with every passing year . 
He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls , but he rarely made use of it . 
When he did happen to do so , his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror . 
He never killed an inoffensive animal . 
He never shot at a little bird . 
Although he was no longer young , it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong . 
He offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it , lifted a horse , released a wheel clogged in the mud , or stopped a runaway bull by the horns . 
He always had his pockets full of money when he went out ; but they were empty on his return . 
When he passed through a village , the ragged brats ran joyously after him , and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats . 
It was thought that he must , in the past , have lived a country life , since he knew all sorts of useful secrets , which he taught to the peasants . 
He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat , by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt ; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere , on the walls and the ceilings , among the grass and in the houses . 
He had `` recipes '' for exterminating from a field , blight , tares , foxtail , and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat . 
He defended a rabbit warren against rats , simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed in it . 
One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles ; he examined the plants , which were uprooted and already dried , and said : `` They are dead . 
Nevertheless , it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them . 
When the nettle is young , the leaf makes an excellent vegetable ; when it is older , it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax . 
Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth . 
Chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; pounded , they are good for horned cattle . 
The seed of the nettle , mixed with fodder , gives gloss to the hair of animals ; the root , mixed with salt , produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter . 
Moreover , it is an excellent hay , which can be cut twice . 
And what is required for the nettle ?
