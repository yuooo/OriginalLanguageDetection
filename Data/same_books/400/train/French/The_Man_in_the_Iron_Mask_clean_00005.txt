`` And what do you want with Lyonne ? '' 
`` I wish to make him sign a lettre de cachet . '' '' ' 
Lettre de cachet ! ' 
Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile ? '' 
`` On the contrary -- to let somebody out . '' 
`` And who ? '' 
`` A poor devil -- a youth , a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years , for two Latin verses he made against the Jesuits . '' '' 
` Two Latin verses ! ' 
and , for ` two Latin verses , ' the miserable being has been in prison for ten years ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` And has committed no other crime ? '' 
`` Beyond this , he is as innocent as you or I. '' `` On your word ? '' 
`` On my honor ! '' 
`` And his name is -- '' `` Seldon . '' 
`` Yes . 
-- But it is too bad . 
You knew this , and you never told me ! '' '' 
'T was only yesterday his mother applied to me , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the woman is poor ! '' 
`` In the deepest misery . '' 
`` Heaven , '' said Fouquet , `` sometimes bears with such injustice on earth , that I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence . 
Stay , M. d'Herblay . '' 
And Fouquet , taking a pen , wrote a few rapid lines to his colleague Lyonne . 
Aramis took the letter and made ready to go . 
`` Wait , '' said Fouquet . 
He opened his drawer , and took out ten government notes which were there , each for a thousand francs . 
`` Stay , '' he said ; `` set the son at liberty , and give this to the mother ; but , above all , do not tell her -- '' `` What , monseigneur ? '' 
`` That she is ten thousand livres richer than I . 
She would say I am but a poor superintendent ! 
Go ! 
and I pray that God will bless those who are mindful of his poor ! '' 
`` So also do I pray , '' replied Aramis , kissing Fouquet 's hand . 
And he went out quickly , carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes for Seldon 's mother , and taking up Moliere , who was beginning to lose patience . 
Seven o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile , that famous clock , which , like all the accessories of the state prison , the very use of which is a torture , recalled to the prisoners ' minds the destination of every hour of their punishment . 
The time-piece of the Bastile , adorned with figures , like most of the clocks of the period , represented St. Peter in bonds . 
It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives . 
The doors , grating on their enormous hinges , opened for the passage of the baskets and trays of provisions , the abundance and the delicacy of which , as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us , was regulated by the condition in life of the prisoner . 
We understand on this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux , sovereign dispenser of gastronomic delicacies , head cook of the royal fortress , whose trays , full-laden , were ascending the steep staircases , carrying some consolation to the prisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages . 
This same hour was that of M. le gouverneur 's supper also . 
He had a guest to-day , and the spit turned more heavily than usual . 
Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation . 
As for M. de Baisemeaux , with the facility of vulgar people , he gave himself up entirely upon this point of his guest 's freedom . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur . '' 
`` By no means , '' said Aramis ; `` call me monsieur ; I am booted . '' 
`` Do you know , monsieur , of whom you remind me this evening ? '' 
`` No ! 
faith , '' said Aramis , taking up his glass ; `` but I hope I remind you of a capital guest . '' 
`` You remind me of two , monsieur . 
Francois , shut the window ; the wind may annoy his greatness . '' 
`` And let him go , '' added Aramis . 
`` The supper is completely served , and we shall eat it very well without waiters . 
I like exceedingly to be tete-a-tete when I am with a friend . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed respectfully . 
`` I like exceedingly , '' continued Aramis , `` to help myself . '' 
`` Retire , Francois , '' cried Baisemeaux . 
`` I was saying that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons ; one very illustrious , the late cardinal , the great Cardinal de la Rochelle , who wore boots like you . '' 
`` Indeed , '' said Aramis ; `` and the other ? '' 
`` The other was a certain musketeer , very handsome , very brave , very adventurous , very fortunate , who , from being abbe , turned musketeer , and from musketeer turned abbe . '' 
Aramis condescended to smile . 
`` From abbe , '' continued Baisemeaux , encouraged by Aramis 's smile -- `` from abbe , bishop -- and from bishop -- '' `` Ah ! 
stay there , I beg , '' exclaimed Aramis . 
`` I have just said , monsieur , that you gave me the idea of a cardinal . '' 
`` Enough , dear M. Baisemeaux . 
As you said , I have on the boots of a cavalier , but I do not intend , for all that , to embroil myself with the church this evening . '' 
`` But you have wicked intentions , nevertheless , monseigneur . '' 
`` Oh , yes , wicked , I own , as everything mundane is . '' 
`` You traverse the town and the streets in disguise ? '' 
`` In disguise , as you say . '' 
`` And you still make use of your sword ? '' 
`` Yes , I should think so ; but only when I am compelled . 
Do me the pleasure to summon Francois . '' 
`` Have you no wine there ? '' '' 
'T is not for wine , but because it is hot here , and the window is shut . '' 
`` I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the arrival of couriers . '' 
`` Ah , yes . 
You hear them when the window is open ? '' 
`` But too well , and that disturbs me . 
You understand ? '' 
`` Nevertheless I am suffocated . 
Francois . '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Open the windows , I pray you , Master Francois , '' said Aramis . 
`` You will allow him , dear M. Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` You are at home here , '' answered the governor . 
The window was opened . 
`` Do you not think , '' said M. de Baisemeaux , `` that you will find yourself very lonely , now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at Blois ? 
He is a very old friend , is he not ? '' 
`` You know it as I do , Baisemeaux , seeing that you were in the musketeers with us . '' 
`` Bah ! 
with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years . '' 
`` And you are right . 
But I do more than love M. de la Fere , dear Baisemeaux ; I venerate him . '' 
`` Well , for my part , though 't is singular , '' said the governor , `` I prefer M. d'Artagnan to him . 
There is a man for you , who drinks long and well ! 
That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts . '' 
`` Baisemeaux , make me tipsy to-night ; let us have a merry time of it as of old , and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart , I promise you , you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your glass . '' 
`` Bravo ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , and he poured out a great glass of wine and drank it off at a draught , trembling with joy at the idea of being , by hook or by crook , in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor . 
While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was noting the sounds in the great court . 
A courier came in about eight o'clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle , and , although the courier made a great noise , Baisemeaux heard nothing . 
`` The devil take him , '' said Aramis . 
`` What ! 
who ? '' 
asked Baisemeaux . 
`` I hope 't is neither the wine you drank nor he who is the cause of your drinking it . '' 
`` No ; it is a horse , who is making noise enough in the court for a whole squadron . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
some courier or other , '' replied the governor , redoubling his attention to the passing bottle . 
`` Yes ; and may the devil take him , and so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more . 
Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
`` You forget me , Baisemeaux ! 
my glass is empty , '' said Aramis , lifting his dazzling Venetian goblet . 
`` Upon my honor , you delight me . 
Francois , wine ! '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Wine , fellow ! 
and better . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , yes ; but a courier has just arrived . '' 
`` Let him go to the devil , I say . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , but -- '' `` Let him leave his news at the office ; we will see to it to-morrow . 
To-morrow , there will be time to-morrow ; there will be daylight , '' said Baisemeaux , chanting the words . 
`` Ah , monsieur , '' grumbled the soldier Francois , in spite of himself , `` monsieur . '' 
`` Take care , '' said Aramis , `` take care ! '' 
`` Of what ? 
dear M. d'Herblay , '' said Baisemeaux , half intoxicated . 
`` The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is sometimes an order . '' 
`` Nearly always . '' 
`` Do not orders issue from the ministers ? '' 
`` Yes , undoubtedly ; but -- '' `` And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the king ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . 
Nevertheless , 't is very tiresome when you are sitting before a good table , tete-a-tete with a friend -- Ah ! 
I beg your pardon , monsieur ; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper , and that I speak to a future cardinal . '' 
`` Let us pass over that , dear Baisemeaux , and return to our soldier , to Francois . '' 
`` Well , and what has Francois done ? '' 
`` He has demurred ! '' 
`` He was wrong , then ? '' 
`` However , he has demurred , you see ; 't is because there is something extraordinary in this matter . 
It is very possible that it was not Francois who was wrong in demurring , but you , who are in the wrong in not listening to him . '' 
`` Wrong ? 
I to be wrong before Francois ? 
that seems rather hard . '' 
`` Pardon me , merely an irregularity . 
But I thought it my duty to make an observation which I deem important . '' 
`` Oh ! 
perhaps you are right , '' stammered Baisemeaux . 
`` The king 's order is sacred ; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper , I repeat that the devil -- '' `` If you had said as much to the great cardinal -- hem ! 
my dear Baisemeaux , and if his order had any importance . '' 
`` I do it that I may not disturb a bishop . 
Mordioux ! 
am I not , then , excusable ? '' 
`` Do not forget , Baisemeaux , that I have worn the soldier 's coat , and I am accustomed to obedience everywhere . '' 
`` You wish , then -- '' `` I wish that you would do your duty , my friend ; yes , at least before this soldier . '' '' 
'T is mathematically true , '' exclaimed Baisemeaux . 
Francois still waited : `` Let them send this order of the king 's up to me , '' he repeated , recovering himself . 
And he added in a low tone , `` Do you know what it is ? 
I will tell you something about as interesting as this . 
` Beware of fire near the powder magazine ; ' or , ` Look close after such and such a one , who is clever at escaping , ' Ah ! 
if you only knew , monseigneur , how many times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest , deepest slumber , by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me , or rather , bring me a slip of paper containing these words : ` Monsieur de Baisemeaux , what news ? ' 
'T is clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile . 
They would know better ; they have never considered the thickness of my walls , the vigilance of my officers , the number of rounds we go . 
But , indeed , what can you expect , monseigneur ? 
It is their business to write and torment me when I am at rest , and to trouble me when I am happy , '' added Baisemeaux , bowing to Aramis . 
`` Then let them do their business . '' 
`` And do you do yours , '' added the bishop , smiling . 
Francois re-entered ; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister 's order . 
He slowly undid it , and as slowly read it . 
Aramis pretended to be drinking , so as to be able to watch his host through the glass . 
Then , Baisemeaux , having read it : `` What was I just saying ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the bishop . 
`` An order of release ! 
There , now ; excellent news indeed to disturb us ! '' 
`` Excellent news for him whom it concerns , you will at least agree , my dear governor ! '' 
`` And at eight o'clock in the evening ! '' 
`` It is charitable ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
charity is all very well , but it is for that fellow who says he is so weary and tired , but not for me who am amusing myself , '' said Baisemeaux , exasperated . 
`` Will you lose by him , then ? 
And is the prisoner who is to be set at liberty a good payer ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , indeed ! 
a miserable , five-franc rat ! '' 
`` Let me see it , '' asked M. d'Herblay . 
`` It is no indiscretion ? '' 
`` By no means ; read it . '' 
`` There is ` Urgent , ' on the paper ; you have seen that , I suppose ? '' 
`` Oh , admirable ! 
` Urgent ! ' 
-- a man who has been there ten years ! 
It is urgent to set him free to-day , this very evening , at eight o'clock ! 
-- urgent ! '' 
And Baisemeaux , shrugging his shoulders with an air of supreme disdain , flung the order on the table and began eating again . 
`` They are fond of these tricks ! '' 
he said , with his mouth full ; `` they seize a man , some fine day , keep him under lock and key for ten years , and write to you , ` Watch this fellow well , ' or ` Keep him very strictly . ' 
And then , as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a dangerous man , all of a sudden , without rhyme or reason they write -- ` Set him at liberty , ' and actually add to their missive -- ` urgent . ' 
You will own , my lord , 't is enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders ! '' 
`` What do you expect ? 
It is for them to write , '' said Aramis , `` for you to execute the order . '' 
`` Good ! 
good ! 
execute it ! 
Oh , patience ! 
You must not imagine that I am a slave . '' 
`` Gracious Heaven ! 
my very good M. Baisemeaux , who ever said so ? 
Your independence is well known . '' 
`` Thank Heaven ! '' 
`` But your goodness of heart is also known . '' 
`` Ah ! 
do n't speak of it ! '' 
`` And your obedience to your superiors . 
Once a soldier , you see , Baisemeaux , always a soldier . '' 
`` And I shall directly obey ; and to-morrow morning , at daybreak , the prisoner referred to shall be set free . '' 
`` To-morrow ? '' 
`` At dawn . '' 
`` Why not this evening , seeing that the lettre de cachet bears , both on the direction and inside , ' urgent ' ? '' 
`` Because this evening we are at supper , and our affairs are urgent , too ! '' 
`` Dear Baisemeaux , booted though I be , I feel myself a priest , and charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst . 
This unfortunate man has suffered long enough , since you have just told me that he has been your prisoner these ten years . 
Abridge his suffering . 
His good time has come ; give him the benefit quickly . 
God will repay you in Paradise with years of felicity . '' 
`` You wish it ? '' 
`` I entreat you . '' 
`` What ! 
in the very middle of our repast ? '' 
`` I implore you ; such an action is worth ten Benedicites . '' 
`` It shall be as you desire , only our supper will get cold . '' 
`` Oh ! 
never heed that . '' 
Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois , and by a very natural motion turned round towards the door . 
The order had remained on the table ; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to change the paper for another , folded in the same manner , which he drew swiftly from his pocket . 
`` Francois , '' said the governor , `` let the major come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere . '' 
Francois bowed and quitted the room , leaving the two companions alone . 
There was now a brief silence , during which Aramis never removed his eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment . 
The latter seemed only half decided to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper , and it was clear he was trying to invent some pretext , whether good or bad , for delay , at any rate till after dessert . 
And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at last . 
`` Eh ! 
but it is impossible ! '' 
he cried . 
`` How impossible ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Give me a glimpse of this impossibility . '' '' 
'T is impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour . 
Where can he go to , a man so unacquainted with Paris ? '' 
`` He will find a place wherever he can . '' 
`` You see , now , one might as well set a blind man free ! '' 
`` I have a carriage , and will take him wherever he wishes . '' 
`` You have an answer for everything . 
Francois , tell monsieur le major to go and open the cell of M. Seldon , No. 3 , Bertaudiere . '' 
`` Seldon ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis , very naturally . 
`` You said Seldon , I think ? '' 
`` I said Seldon , of course . 
'T is the name of the man they set free . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you mean to say Marchiali ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Marchiali ? 
oh ! 
yes , indeed . 
No , no , Seldon . '' 
`` I think you are making a mistake , Monsieur Baisemeaux . '' 
`` I have read the order . '' 
`` And I also . '' 
`` And I saw ` Seldon ' in letters as large as that , '' and Baisemeaux held up his finger . 
`` And I read ` Marchiali ' in characters as large as this , '' said Aramis , also holding up two fingers . 
`` To the proof ; let us throw a light on the matter , '' said Baisemeaux , confident he was right . 
`` There is the paper , you have only to read it . '' 
`` I read ` Marchiali , ' '' returned Aramis , spreading out the paper . 
`` Look . '' 
Baisemeaux looked , and his arms dropped suddenly . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he said , quite overwhelmed ; `` yes , Marchiali . 
'T is plainly written Marchiali ! 
Quite true ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
-- '' `` How ? 
the man of whom we have talked so much ? 
The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of ? '' 
`` There is ` Marchiali , ' '' repeated the inflexible Aramis . 
`` I must own it , monseigneur . 
But I understand nothing about it . '' 
`` You believe your eyes , at any rate . '' 
`` To tell me very plainly there is ` Marchiali . ' '' 
`` And in a good handwriting , too . '' '' 
'T is a wonder ! 
I still see this order and the name of Seldon , Irishman . 
I see it . 
Ah ! 
I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of ink . '' 
`` No , there is no ink ; no , there is no blot . '' 
`` Oh ! 
but there was , though ; I know it , because I rubbed my finger -- this very one -- in the powder that was over the blot . '' 
`` In a word , be it how it may , dear M. Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , `` and whatever you may have seen , the order is signed to release Marchiali , blot or no blot . '' 
`` The order is signed to release Marchiali , '' replied Baisemeaux , mechanically , endeavoring to regain his courage . 
`` And you are going to release this prisoner . 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also , I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in the world . '' 
Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile , the irony of which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux 's confusion of mind , and restored his courage . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he said , `` this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a priest confessor of our order came to visit in so imperious and so secret a manner . '' 
`` I do n't know that , monsieur , '' replied the bishop . '' 
'T is no such long time ago , dear Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` It is true . 
But with us , monsieur , it is good that the man of to-day should no longer know what the man of yesterday did . '' 
`` In any case , '' said Baisemeaux , `` the visit of the Jesuit confessor must have given happiness to this man . '' 
Aramis made no reply , but recommenced eating and drinking . 
As for Baisemeaux , no longer touching anything that was on the table , he again took up the order and examined it every way . 
This investigation , under ordinary circumstances , would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis burn with anger ; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so little , above all , when he had murmured to himself that to do so was dangerous . 
`` Are you going to release Marchiali ? '' 
he said . 
`` What mellow , fragrant and delicious sherry this is , my dear governor . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Baisemeaux , `` I shall release the prisoner Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order , and above all , when , by interrogating him , I have satisfied myself . '' 
`` The order is sealed , and the courier is ignorant of the contents . 
What do you want to satisfy yourself about ? '' 
`` Be it so , monseigneur ; but I shall send to the ministry , and M. de Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order . '' 
`` What is the good of all that ? '' 
asked Aramis , coldly . 
`` What good ? '' 
`` Yes ; what is your object , I ask ? '' 
`` The object of never deceiving oneself , monseigneur ; nor being wanting in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers , nor infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one 's own free will . '' 
`` Very good ; you have just spoken so eloquently , that I can not but admire you . 
It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors ; he is guilty when he deceives himself , and he should be punished if he infringed either the duties or laws of his office . '' 
Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment . 
`` It follows , '' pursued Aramis , `` that you are going to ask advice , to put your conscience at ease in the matter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And if a superior officer gives you orders , you will obey ? '' 
`` Never doubt it , monseigneur . '' 
`` You know the king 's signature well , M. de Baisemeaux ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Is it not on this order of release ? '' 
`` It is true , but it may -- '' `` Be forged , you mean ? '' 
`` That is evident , monseigneur . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` I see it plain enough on the order ; but for the same reason that the king 's signature may have been forged , so also , and with even greater probability , may M. de Lyonne 's . '' 
`` Your logic has the stride of a giant , M. de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and your reasoning is irresistible . 
But on what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are false ? '' 
`` On this : the absence of counter-signatures . 
Nothing checks his majesty 's signature ; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has signed . '' 
`` Well , Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis , bending an eagle glance on the governor , `` I adopt so frankly your doubts , and your mode of clearing them up , that I will take a pen , if you will give me one . '' 
Baisemeaux gave him a pen . 
`` And a sheet of white paper , '' added Aramis . 
Baisemeaux handed him some paper . 
`` Now , I -- I , also -- I , here present -- incontestably , I -- am going to write an order to which I am certain you will give credence , incredulous as you are ! '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner . 
It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop 's , but just now so playful and gay , had become funereal and sad ; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel , the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood . 
Aramis took a pen and wrote . 
Baisemeaux , in terror , read over his shoulder . 
`` A. M. D. G. , '' wrote the bishop ; and he drew a cross under these four letters , which signify ad majorem Dei gloriam , `` to the greater glory of God ; '' and thus he continued : `` It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun , governor , for the king , of the castle of the Bastile , be held by him good and effectual , and be immediately carried into operation . '' 
-LRB- Signed -RRB- D'HERBLAY `` General of the Order , by the grace of God . '' 
Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished , that his features remained contracted , his lips parted , and his eyes fixed . 
He did not move an inch , nor articulate a sound . 
Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth , which was fluttering to its death about the candles . 
Aramis , without even deigning to look at the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition , drew from his pocket a small case of black wax ; he sealed the letter , and stamped it with a seal suspended at his breast , beneath his doublet , and when the operation was concluded , presented -- still in silence -- the missive to M. de Baisemeaux . 
The latter , whose hands trembled in a manner to excite pity , turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter . 
A last gleam of feeling played over his features , and he fell , as if thunder-struck , on a chair . 
`` Come , come , '' said Aramis , after a long silence , during which the governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses , `` do not lead me to believe , dear Baisemeaux , that the presence of the general of the order is as terrible as His , and that men die merely from having seen Him . 
Take courage , rouse yourself ; give me your hand -- obey . '' 
Baisemeaux , reassured , if not satisfied , obeyed , kissed Aramis 's hand , and rose . 
`` Immediately ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` Oh , there is no pressing haste , my host ; take your place again , and do the honors over this beautiful dessert . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I shall never recover such a shock as this ; I who have laughed , who have jested with you ! 
I who have dared to treat you on a footing of equality ! '' 
`` Say nothing about it , old comrade , '' replied the bishop , who perceived how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it ; `` say nothing about it . 
Let us each live in our own way ; to you , my protection and my friendship ; to me , your obedience . 
Having exactly fulfilled these two requirements , let us live happily . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected ; he perceived , at a glance , the consequence of this withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order ; and , putting in the scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general , did not consider it of any value . 
Aramis divined this . 
`` My dear Baisemeaux , '' said he , `` you are a simpleton . 
Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to think for you . '' 
And at another gesture he made , Baisemeaux bowed again . 
`` How shall I set about it ? '' 
he said . 
`` What is the process for releasing a prisoner ? '' 
`` I have the regulations . '' 
`` Well , then , follow the regulations , my friend . '' 
`` I go with my major to the prisoner 's room , and conduct him , if he is a personage of importance . '' 
`` But this Marchiali is not an important personage , '' said Aramis carelessly . 
`` I do n't know , '' answered the governor , as if he would have said , `` It is for you to instruct me . '' 
`` Then if you do n't know it , I am right ; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards one of obscure station . '' 
`` Good ; the regulations so provide . 
They are to the effect that the turnkey , or one of the lower officials , shall bring the prisoner before the governor , in the office . '' 
`` Well , 't is very wise , that ; and then ? '' 
`` Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his imprisonment , his clothes and papers , if the minister 's orders have not otherwise dictated . '' 
`` What was the minister 's order as to this Marchiali ? '' 
`` Nothing ; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels , without papers , and almost without clothes . '' 
`` See how simple , then , all is . 
Indeed , Baisemeaux , you make a mountain of everything . 
Remain here , and make them bring the prisoner to the governor 's house . '' 
Baisemeaux obeyed . 
He summoned his lieutenant , and gave him an order , which the latter passed on , without disturbing himself about it , to the next whom it concerned . 
Half an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court ; it was the door to the dungeon , which had just rendered up its prey to the free air . 
Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one , which he left burning behind the door . 
This flickering glare prevented the sight from resting steadily on any object . 
It multiplied tenfold the changing forms and shadows of the place , by its wavering uncertainty .
