No , I shall struggle along in this world a good while yet . ' 
He gave Piotr orders to come to him on important business the next morning directly it was light . 
Piotr imagined that he wanted to take him to Petersburg with him . 
Bazarov went late to bed , and all night long he was harassed by disordered dreams ... . 
Madame Odintsov kept appearing in them , now she was his mother , and she was followed by a kitten with black whiskers , and this kitten seemed to be Fenitchka ; then Pavel Petrovitch took the shape of a great wood , with which he had yet to fight . 
Piotr waked him up at four o'clock ; he dressed at once , and went out with him . 
It was a lovely , fresh morning ; tiny flecked clouds hovered overhead in little curls of foam on the pale clear blue ; a fine dew lay in drops on the leaves and grass , and sparkled like silver on the spiders ' webs ; the damp , dark earth seemed still to keep traces of the rosy dawn ; from the whole sky the songs of larks came pouring in showers . 
Bazarov walked as far as the copse , sat down in the shade at its edge , and only then disclosed to Piotr the nature of the service he expected of him . 
The refined valet was mortally alarmed ; but Bazarov soothed him by the assurance that he would have nothing to do but stand at a distance and look on , and that he would not incur any sort of responsibility . 
` And meantime , ' he added , ` only think what an important part you have to play ! ' 
Piotr threw up his hands , looked down , and leaned against a birch-tree , looking green with terror . 
The road from Maryino skirted the copse ; a light dust lay on it , untouched by wheel or foot since the previous day . 
Bazarov unconsciously stared along this road , picked and gnawed a blade of grass , while he kept repeating to himself , ` What a piece of foolery ! ' 
The chill of the early morning made him shiver twice ... . 
Piotr looked at him dejectedly , but Bazarov only smiled ; he was not afraid . 
The tramp of horses ' hoofs was heard along the road ... . 
A peasant came into sight from behind the trees . 
He was driving before him two horses hobbled together , and as he passed Bazarov he looked at him rather strangely , without touching his cap , which it was easy to see disturbed Piotr , as an unlucky omen . 
` There 's some one else up early too , ' thought Bazarov ; ` but he at least has got up for work , while we ... ' ` Fancy the gentleman 's coming , ' Piotr faltered suddenly . 
Bazarov raised his head and saw Pavel Petrovitch . 
Dressed in a light check jacket and snow-white trousers , he was walking rapidly along the road ; under his arm he carried a box wrapped up in green cloth . ' 
I beg your pardon , I believe I have kept you waiting , ' he observed , bowing first to Bazarov , then to Piotr , whom he treated respectfully at that instant , as representing something in the nature of a second . ' 
I was unwilling to wake my man . ' 
` It does n't matter , ' answered Bazarov ; ` we 've only just arrived ourselves . ' 
` Ah ! 
so much the better ! ' 
Pavel Petrovitch took a look round . 
` There 's no one in sight ; no one hinders us . 
We can proceed ? ' 
` Let us proceed . ' 
` You do not , I presume , desire any fresh explanations ? ' 
` No , I do n't . ' 
` Would you like to load ? ' 
inquired Pavel Petrovitch , taking the pistols out of the box . 
` No ; you load , and I will measure out the paces . 
My legs are longer , ' added Bazarov with a smile . 
` One , two , three . ' 
` Yevgeny Vassilyevitch , ' Piotr faltered with an effort -LRB- he shaking as though he were in a fever -RRB- , ` say what you like , I am going farther off . ' 
` Four ... five ... . 
Good . 
Move away , my good fellow , move away ; you may get behind a tree even , and stop up your ears , only do n't shut your eyes ; and if any one falls , run and pick him up . 
Six ... seven ... eight ... ' Bazarov stopped . 
` Is that enough ? ' 
he said , turning to Pavel Petrovitch ; ` or shall I add two paces more ? ' 
` As you like , ' replied the latter , pressing down the second bullet . 
` Well , we 'll make it two paces more . ' 
Bazarov drew a line on the ground with the toe of his boot . 
` There 's the barrier then . 
By the way , how many paces may each of us go back from the barrier ? 
That 's an important question too . 
That point was not discussed yesterday . ' ' 
I imagine , ten , ' replied Pavel Petrovitch , handing Bazarov both pistols . 
` Will you be so good as to choose ? ' ' 
I will be so good . 
But , Pavel Petrovitch , you must admit our combat is singular to the point of absurdity . 
Only look at the countenance of our second . ' 
` You are disposed to laugh at everything , ' answered Pavel Petrovitch . ' 
I acknowledge the strangeness of our duel , but I think it my duty to warn you that I intend to fight seriously . 
A bon entendeur , salut ! ' 
` Oh ! 
I do n't doubt that we 've made up our minds to make away with each other ; but why not laugh too and unite utile dulci ? 
You talk to me in French , while I talk to you in Latin . ' ' 
I am going to fight in earnest , ' repeated Pavel Petrovitch , and he walked off to his place . 
Bazarov on his side counted off ten paces from the barrier , and stood still . 
` Are you ready ? ' 
asked Pavel Petrovitch . 
` Perfectly . ' 
` We can approach one another . ' 
Bazarov moved slowly forward , and Pavel Petrovitch , his left hand thrust in his pocket , walked towards him , gradually raising the muzzle of his pistol ... ` He 's aiming straight at my nose , ' thought Bazarov , ` and does n't he blink down it carefully , the ruffian ! 
Not an agreeable sensation though . 
I 'm going to look at his watch chain . ' 
Something whizzed sharply by his very ear , and at the same instant there was the sound of a shot . ' 
I heard it , so it must be all right , ' had time to flash through Bazarov 's brain . 
He took one more step , and without taking aim , pressed the spring . 
Pavel Petrovitch gave a slight start , and clutched at his thigh . 
A stream of blood began to trickle down his white trousers . 
Bazarov flung aside the pistol , and went up to his antagonist . 
` Are you wounded ? ' 
he said . 
` You had the right to call me up to the barrier , ' said Pavel Petrovitch , ` but that 's of no consequence . 
According to our agreement , each of us has the right to one more shot . ' 
` All right , but , excuse me , that 'll do another time , ' answered Bazarov , catching hold of Pavel Petrovitch , who was beginning to turn pale . 
` Now , I 'm not a duellist , but a doctor , and I must have a look at your wound before anything else . 
Piotr ! 
come here , Piotr ! 
where have you got to ? ' 
` That 's all nonsense ... . 
I need no one 's aid , ' Pavel Petrovitch declared jerkily , ` and ... we must ... again ... ' He tried to pull at his moustaches , but his hand failed him , his eyes grew dim , and he lost consciousness . 
` Here 's a pretty pass ! 
A fainting fit ! 
What next ! ' 
Bazarov cried unconsciously , as he laid Pavel Petrovitch on the grass . 
` Let 's have a look what 's wrong . ' 
He pulled out a handkerchief , wiped away the blood , and began feeling round the wound ... ` The bone 's not touched , ' he muttered through his teeth ; ` the ball did n't go deep ; one muscle , vastus externus , grazed . 
He 'll be dancing about in three weeks ! 
... And to faint ! 
Oh , these nervous people , how I hate them ! 
My word , what a delicate skin ! ' 
` Is he killed ? ' 
the quaking voice of Piotr came rustling behind his back . 
Bazarov looked round . 
` Go for some water as quick as you can , my good fellow , and he 'll outlive us yet . ' 
But the modern servant seemed not to understand his words , and he did not stir . 
Pavel Petrovitch slowly opened his eyes . 
` He will die ! ' 
whispered Piotr , and he began crossing himself . 
` You are right ... What an imbecile countenance ! ' 
remarked the wounded gentleman with a forced smile . 
` Well , go for the water , damn you ! ' 
shouted Bazarov . 
` No need ... . 
It was a momentary vertigo ... . 
Help me to sit up ... there , that 's right ... . 
I only need something to bind up this scratch , and I can reach home on foot , or you can send a droshky for me . 
The duel , if you are willing , shall not be renewed . 
You have behaved honourably ... to-day , to-day -- observe . ' 
` There 's no need to recall the past , ' rejoined Bazarov ; ` and as regards the future , it 's not worth while for you to trouble your head about that either , for I intend being off without delay . 
Let me bind up your leg now ; your wound 's not serious , but it 's always best to stop bleeding . 
But first I must bring this corpse to his senses . ' 
Bazarov shook Piotr by the collar , and sent him for a droshky . 
` Mind you do n't frighten my brother , ' Pavel Petrovitch said to him ; ` do n't dream of informing him . ' 
Piotr flew off ; and while he was running for a droshky , the two antagonists sat on the ground and said nothing . 
Pavel Petrovitch tried not to look at Bazarov ; he did not want to be reconciled to him in any case ; he was ashamed of his own haughtiness , of his failure ; he was ashamed of the whole position he had brought about , even while he felt it could not have ended in a more favourable manner . 
` At any rate , there will be no scandal , ' he consoled himself by reflecting , ` and for that I am thankful . ' 
The silence was prolonged , a silence distressing and awkward . 
Both of them were ill at ease . 
Each was conscious that the other understood him . 
That is pleasant to friends , and always very unpleasant to those who are not friends , especially when it is impossible either to have things out or to separate . 
` Have n't I bound up your leg too tight ? ' 
inquired Bazarov at last . 
` No , not at all ; it 's capital , ' answered Pavel Petrovitch ; and after a brief pause , he added , ` There 's no deceiving my brother ; we shall have to tell him we quarrelled over politics . ' 
` Very good , ' assented Bazarov . 
` You can say I insulted all anglomaniacs . ' 
` That will do capitally . 
What do you imagine that man thinks of us now ? ' 
continued Pavel Petrovitch , pointing to the same peasant , who had driven the hobbled horses past Bazarov a few minutes before the duel , and going back again along the road , took off his cap at the sight of the ` gentlefolk . ' 
` Who can tell ! ' 
answered Bazarov ; ` it 's quite likely he thinks nothing . 
The Russian peasant is that mysterious unknown about whom Mrs. Radcliffe used to talk so much . 
Who is to understand him ! 
He does n't understand himself ! ' 
` Ah ! 
so that 's your idea ! ' 
Pavel Petrovitch began ; and suddenly he cried , ` Look what your fool of a Piotr has done ! 
Here 's my brother galloping up to us ! ' 
Bazarov turned round and saw the pale face of Nikolai Petrovitch , who was sitting in the droshky . 
He jumped out of it before it had stopped , and rushed up to his brother . 
` What does this mean ? ' 
he said in an agitated voice . 
` Yevgeny Vassilyitch , pray , what is this ? ' 
` Nothing , ' answered Pavel Petrovitch ; ` they have alarmed you for nothing . 
I had a little dispute with Mr. Bazarov , and I have had to pay for it a little . ' 
` But what was it all about , mercy on us ! ' 
` How can I tell you ? 
Mr. Bazarov alluded disrespectfully to Sir Robert Peel . 
I must hasten to add that I am the only person to blame in all this , while Mr. Bazarov has behaved most honourably . 
I called him out . ' 
` But you 're covered with blood , good Heavens ! ' 
` Well , did you suppose I had water in my veins ? 
But this blood-letting is positively beneficial to me . 
Is n't that so , doctor ? 
Help me to get into the droshky , and do n't give way to melancholy . 
I shall be quite well to-morrow . 
That 's it ; capital . 
Drive on , coachman . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch walked after the droshky ; Bazarov was remaining where he was ... ' I must ask you to look after my brother , ' Nikolai Petrovitch said to him , 'till we get another doctor from the town . ' 
Bazarov nodded his head without speaking . 
In an hour 's time Pavel Petrovitch was already lying in bed with a skilfully bandaged leg . 
The whole house was alarmed ; Fenitchka fainted . 
Nikolai Petrovitch kept stealthily wringing his hands , while Pavel Petrovitch laughed and joked , especially with Bazarov ; he had put on a fine cambric night-shirt , an elegant morning wrapper , and a fez , did not allow the blinds to be drawn down , and humorously complained of the necessity of being kept from food . 
Towards night , however , he began to be feverish ; his head ached . 
The doctor arrived from the town . 
-LRB- Nikolai Petrovitch would not listen to his brother , and indeed Bazarov himself did not wish him to ; he sat the whole day in his room , looking yellow and vindictive , and only went in to the invalid for as brief a time as possible ; twice he happened to meet Fenitchka , but she shrank away from him with horror . -RRB- 
The new doctor advised a cooling diet ; he confirmed , however , Bazarov 's assertion that there was no danger . 
Nikolai Petrovitch told him his brother had wounded himself by accident , to which the doctor responded , ` Hm ! ' 
but having twenty-five silver roubles slipped into his hand on the spot , he observed , ` You do n't say so ! 
Well , it 's a thing that often happens , to be sure . ' 
No one in the house went to bed or undressed . 
Nikolai Petrovitch kept going in to his brother on tiptoe , retreating on tiptoe again ; the latter dozed , moaned a little , told him in French , Couchez-vous , and asked for drink . 
Nikolai Petrovitch sent Fenitchka twice to take him a glass of lemonade ; Pavel Petrovitch gazed at her intently , and drank off the glass to the last drop . 
Towards morning the fever had increased a little ; there was slight delirium . 
At first Pavel Petrovitch uttered incoherent words ; then suddenly he opened his eyes , and seeing his brother near his bed bending anxiously over him , he said , ` Do n't you think , Nikolai , Fenitchka has something in common with Nellie ? ' 
` What Nellie , Pavel dear ? ' 
` How can you ask ? 
Princess R -- . 
Especially in the upper part of the face . 
C'est de la même famille . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch made no answer , while inwardly he marvelled at the persistence of old passions in man . 
` It 's like this when it comes to the surface , ' he thought . 
` Ah , how I love that light-headed creature ! ' 
moaned Pavel Petrovitch , clasping his hands mournfully behind his head . ' 
I ca n't bear any insolent upstart to dare to touch ... ' he whispered a few minutes later . 
Nikolai Petrovitch only sighed ; he did not even suspect to whom these words referred . 
Bazarov presented himself before him at eight o'clock the next day . 
He had already had time to pack , and to set free all his frogs , insects , and birds . 
` You have come to say good-bye to me ? ' 
said Nikolai Petrovitch , getting up to meet him . 
` Yes . ' ' 
I understand you , and approve of you fully . 
My poor brother , of course , is to blame ; and he is punished for it . 
He told me himself that he made it impossible for you to act otherwise . 
I believe that you could not avoid this duel , which ... which to some extent is explained by the almost constant antagonism of your respective views . ' 
-LRB- Nikolai Petrovitch began to get a little mixed up in his words . -RRB- 
` My brother is a man of the old school , hot-tempered and obstinate ... . 
Thank God that it has ended as it has . 
I have taken every precaution to avoid publicity . ' 
` I 'm leaving you my address , in case there 's any fuss , ' Bazarov remarked casually . ' 
I hope there will be no fuss , Yevgeny Vassilyitch ... . 
I am very sorry your stay in my house should have such a ... such an end . 
It is the more distressing to me through Arkady 's ... ' ' I shall be seeing him , I expect , ' replied Bazarov , in whom ` explanations ' and ` protestations ' of every sort always aroused a feeling of impatience ; ` in case I do n't , I beg you to say good-bye to him for me , and accept the expression of my regret . ' 
` And I beg ... ' answered Nikolai Petrovitch . 
But Bazarov went off without waiting for the end of his sentence . 
When he heard of Bazarov 's going , Pavel Petrovitch expressed a desire to see him , and shook his hand . 
But even then he remained as cold as ice ; he realised that Pavel Petrovitch wanted to play the magnanimous . 
He did not succeed in saying good-bye to Fenitchka ; he only exchanged glances with her at the window . 
Her face struck him as looking dejected . 
` She 'll come to grief , perhaps , ' he said to himself ... ` But who knows ? 
she 'll pull through somehow , I dare say ! ' 
Piotr , however , was so overcome that he wept on his shoulder , till Bazarov damped him by asking if he 'd a constant supply laid on in his eyes ; while Dunyasha was obliged to run away into the wood to hide her emotion . 
The originator of all this woe got into a light cart , smoked a cigar , and when at the third mile , at the bend in the road , the Kirsanovs ' farm , with its new house , could be seen in a long line , he merely spat , and muttering , ` Cursed snobs ! ' 
wrapped himself closer in his cloak . 
Pavel Petrovitch was soon better ; but he had to keep his bed about a week . 
He bore his captivity , as he called it , pretty patiently , though he took great pains over his toilette , and had everything scented with eau-de-cologne . 
Nikolai Petrovitch used to read him the journals ; Fenitchka waited on him as before , brought him lemonade , soup , boiled eggs , and tea ; but she was overcome with secret dread whenever she went into his room . 
Pavel Petrovitch 's unexpected action had alarmed every one in the house , and her more than any one ; Prokofitch was the only person not agitated by it ; he discoursed upon how gentlemen in his day used to fight , but only with real gentlemen ; low curs like that they used to order a horsewhipping in the stable for their insolence . 
Fenitchka 's conscience scarcely reproached her ; but she was tormented at times by the thought of the real cause of the quarrel ; and Pavel Petrovitch too looked at her so strangely ... that even when her back was turned , she felt his eyes upon her . 
She grew thinner from constant inward agitation , and , as is always the way , became still more charming . 
One day -- the incident took place in the morning -- Pavel Petrovitch felt better and moved from his bed to the sofa , while Nikolai Petrovitch , having satisfied himself he was better , went off to the threshing-floor . 
Fenitchka brought him a cup of tea , and setting it down on a little table , was about to withdraw . 
Pavel Petrovitch detained her . 
` Where are you going in such a hurry , Fedosya Nikolaevna ? ' 
he began ; ` are you busy ? ' ' 
... I have to pour out tea . ' 
` Dunyasha will do that without you ; sit a little while with a poor invalid . 
By the way , I must have a little talk with you . ' 
Fenitchka sat down on the edge of an easy-chair , without speaking . 
` Listen , ' said Pavel Petrovitch , tugging at his moustaches ; ' I have long wanted to ask you something ; you seem somehow afraid of me ? ' 
` I ? ' 
` Yes , you . 
You never look at me , as though your conscience were not at rest . ' 
Fenitchka crimsoned , but looked at Pavel Petrovitch . 
He impressed her as looking strange , and her heart began throbbing slowly . 
` Is your conscience at rest ? ' 
he questioned her . 
` Why should it not be at rest ? ' 
she faltered . 
` Goodness knows why ! 
Besides , whom can you have wronged ? 
Me ? 
That is not likely . 
Any other people in the house here ? 
That , too , is something incredible . 
Can it be my brother ? 
But you love him , do n't you ? ' ' 
I love him . ' 
` With your whole soul , with your whole heart ? ' ' 
I love Nikolai Petrovitch with my whole heart . ' 
` Truly ? 
Look at me , Fenitchka . ' 
-LRB- It was the first time he had called her that name . -RRB- 
` You know , it 's a great sin telling lies ! ' ' 
I am not telling lies , Pavel Petrovitch . 
Not love Nikolai Petrovitch -- I should n't care to live after that . ' 
` And will you never give him up for any one ? ' 
` For whom could I give him up ? ' 
` For whom indeed ! 
Well , how about that gentleman who has just gone away from here ? ' 
Fenitchka got up . 
` My God , Pavel Petrovitch , what are you torturing me for ? 
What have I done to you ? 
How can such things be said ? ' 
... ` Fenitchka , ' said Pavel Petrovitch , in a sorrowful voice , ` you know I saw ... ' ` What did you see ? ' 
` Well , there ... in the arbour . ' 
Fenitchka crimsoned to her hair and to her ears . 
` How was I to blame for that ? ' 
she articulated with an effort . 
Pavel Petrovitch raised himself up . 
` You were not to blame ? 
No ? 
Not at all ? ' ' 
I love Nikolai Petrovitch , and no one else in the world , and I shall always love him ! ' 
cried Fenitchka with sudden force , while her throat seemed fairly breaking with sobs . 
` As for what you saw , at the dreadful day of judgment I will say I 'm not to blame , and was n't to blame for it , and I would rather die at once if people can suspect me of such a thing against my benefactor , Nikolai Petrovitch . ' 
But here her voice broke , and at the same time she felt that Pavel Petrovitch was snatching and pressing her hand ... . 
She looked at him , and was fairly petrified . 
He had turned even paler than before ; his eyes were shining , and what was most marvellous of all , one large solitary tear was rolling down his cheek . 
` Fenitchka ! ' 
he was saying in a strange whisper ; ` love him , love my brother ! 
Do n't give him up for any one in the world ; do n't listen to any one else ! 
Think what can be more terrible than to love and not be loved ! 
Never leave my poor Nikolai ! ' 
Fenitchka 's eyes were dry , and her terror had passed away , so great was her amazement . 
But what were her feelings when Pavel Petrovitch , Pavel Petrovitch himself , put her hand to his lips and seemed to pierce into it without kissing it , and only heaving convulsive sighs from time to time ... ` Goodness , ' she thought , ` is n't it some attack coming on him ? ' 
... At that instant his whole ruined life was stirred up within him . 
The staircase creaked under rapidly approaching footsteps ... . 
He pushed her away from him , and let his head drop back on the pillow . 
The door opened , and Nikolai Petrovitch entered , cheerful , fresh , and ruddy . 
Mitya , as fresh and ruddy as his father , in nothing but his little shirt , was frisking on his shoulder , catching the big buttons of his rough country coat with his little bare toes . 
Fenitchka simply flung herself upon him , and clasping him and her son together in her arms , dropped her head on his shoulder . 
Nikolai Petrovitch was surprised ; Fenitchka , the reserved and staid Fenitchka , had never given him a caress in the presence of a third person . 
` What 's the matter ? ' 
he said , and , glancing at his brother , he gave her Mitya . 
` You do n't feel worse ? ' 
he inquired , going up to Pavel Petrovitch . 
He buried his face in a cambric handkerchief . 
` No ... not at all ... on the contrary , I am much better . ' 
` You were in too great a hurry to move on to the sofa . 
Where are you going ? ' 
added Nikolai Petrovitch , turning round to Fenitchka ; but she had already closed the door behind her . ' 
I was bringing in my young hero to show you , he 's been crying for his uncle . 
Why has she carried him off ? 
What 's wrong with you , though ? 
Has anything passed between you , eh ? ' 
` Brother ! ' 
said Pavel Petrovitch solemnly . 
Nikolai Petrovitch started . 
He felt dismayed , he could not have said why himself . 
` Brother , ' repeated Pavel Petrovitch , ` give me your word that you will carry out my one request . ' 
` What request ? 
Tell me . ' 
` It is very important ; the whole happiness of your life , to my idea , depends on it . 
I have been thinking a great deal all this time over what I want to say to you now ... . 
Brother , do your duty , the duty of an honest and generous man ; put an end to the scandal and bad example you are setting -- you , the best of men ! ' 
` What do you mean , Pavel ? ' 
` Marry Fenitchka ... . 
She loves you ; she is the mother of your son . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch stepped back a pace , and flung up his hands . 
` Do you say that , Pavel ? 
you whom I have always regarded as the most determined opponent of such marriages ! 
You say that ? 
Do n't you know that it has simply been out of respect for you that I have not done what you so rightly call my duty ? ' 
` You were wrong to respect me in that case , ' Pavel Petrovitch responded , with a weary smile . ' 
I begin to think Bazarov was right in accusing me of snobbishness . 
No dear brother , do n't let us worry ourselves about appearances and the world 's opinion any more ; we are old folks and humble now ; it 's time we laid aside vanity of all kinds . 
Let us , just as you say , do our duty ; and mind , we shall get happiness that way into the bargain . ' 
Nikolai Petrovitch rushed to embrace his brother . 
` You have opened my eyes completely ! ' 
he cried . ' 
I was right in always declaring you the wisest and kindest-hearted fellow in the world , and now I see you are just as reasonable as you are noble-hearted . ' 
` Quietly , quietly , ' Pavel Petrovitch interrupted him ; ` do n't hurt the leg of your reasonable brother , who at close upon fifty has been fighting a duel like an ensign . 
So , then , it 's a settled matter ; Fenitchka is to be my ... belle soeur . ' 
` My dearest Pavel ! 
But what will Arkady say ? ' 
` Arkady ? 
he 'll be in ecstasies , you may depend upon it ! 
Marriage is against his principles , but then the sentiment of equality in him will be gratified . 
And , after all , what sense have class distinctions au dix-neuvième siècle ? ' 
` Ah , Pavel , Pavel ! 
let me kiss you once more ! 
Do n't be afraid , I 'll be careful . ' 
The brothers embraced each other . 
` What do you think , should you not inform her of your intention now ? ' 
queried Pavel Petrovitch . 
` Why be in a hurry ? ' 
responded Nikolai Petrovitch . 
` Has there been any conversation between you ? ' 
` Conversation between us ? 
Quelle idée ! ' 
` Well , that is all right then . 
First of all , you must get well , and meanwhile there 's plenty of time . 
We must think it over well , and consider ... ' ` But your mind is made up , I suppose ? ' 
` Of course , my mind is made up , and I thank you from the bottom of my heart . 
I will leave you now ; you must rest ; any excitement is bad for you ... . 
But we will talk it over again . 
Sleep well , dear heart , and God bless you ! ' 
` What is he thanking me like that for ? ' 
thought Pavel Petrovitch , when he was left alone . 
` As though it did not depend on him ! 
I will go away directly he is married , somewhere a long way off -- to Dresden or Florence , and will live there till I -- ' Pavel Petrovitch moistened his forehead with eau de cologne , and closed his eyes . 
His beautiful , emaciated head , the glaring daylight shining full upon it , lay on the white pillow like the head of a dead man ... . 
And indeed he was a dead man . 
At Nikolskoe Katya and Arkady were sitting in the garden on a turf seat in the shade of a tall ash tree ; Fifi had placed himself on the ground near them , giving his slender body that graceful curve , which is known among dog-fanciers as ` the hare bend . ' 
Both Arkady and Katya were silent ; he was holding a half-open book in his hands , while she was picking out of a basket the few crumbs of bread left in it , and throwing them to a small family of sparrows , who with the frightened impudence peculiar to them were hopping and chirping at her very feet . 
A faint breeze stirring in the ash leaves kept slowly moving pale-gold flecks of sunlight up and down over the path and Fifi 's tawny back ; a patch of unbroken shade fell upon Arkady and Katya ; only from time to time a bright streak gleamed on her hair . 
Both were silent , but the very way in which they were silent , in which they were sitting together , was expressive of confidential intimacy ; each of them seemed not even to be thinking of his companion , while secretly rejoicing in his presence . 
Their faces , too , had changed since we saw them last ; Arkady looked more tranquil , Katya brighter and more daring . 
` Do n't you think , ' began Arkady , ` that the ash has been very well named in Russian yasen ; no other tree is so lightly and brightly transparent -LRB- yasno -RRB- against the air as it is . ' 
Katya raised her eyes to look upward , and assented , ` Yes ' ; while Arkady thought , ` Well , she does not reproach me for talking finely . ' ' 
I do n't like Heine , ' said Katya , glancing towards the book which Arkady was holding in his hands , ` either when he laughs or when he weeps ; I like him when he 's thoughtful and melancholy . ' 
` And I like him when he laughs , ' remarked Arkady . 
` That 's the relics left in you of your old satirical tendencies . ' 
-LRB- ` Relics ! ' 
thought Arkady -- ` if Bazarov had heard that ? ' -RRB- 
` Wait a little ; we shall transform you . ' 
` Who will transform me ? 
You ? ' 
` Who ? 
-- my sister ; Porfiry Platonovitch , whom you 've given up quarrelling with ; auntie , whom you escorted to church the day before yesterday . ' 
` Well , I could n't refuse ! 
And as for Anna Sergyevna , she agreed with Yevgeny in a great many things , you remember ? ' 
` My sister was under his influence then , just as you were . ' 
` As I was ? 
Do you discover , may I ask , that I 've shaken off his influence now ? ' 
Katya did not speak . ' 
I know , ' pursued Arkady , ` you never liked him . ' ' 
I can have no opinion about him . '
