I said , with a laugh . '' 
` Hey , friend ! ' 
cried the sentry , waving his hand . 
` Wait a bit . 
What are you spinning round like a humming-top for ? ' 
`` Kazbich halted and gave ear to the sentry -- probably thinking that we were going to parley with him . 
Quite the contrary ! 
... My grenadier took aim ... Bang ! 
... Missed ! 
... Just as the powder flashed in the pan Kazbich jogged his horse , which gave a bound to one side . 
He stood up in his stirrups , shouted something in his own language , made a threatening gesture with his whip -- and was off . '' 
` Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? ' 
I said to the sentry . '' 
` He has gone away to die , your honour , ' he answered . 
` There 's no killing a man of that cursed race at one stroke . ' 
`` A quarter of an hour later Pechorin returned from hunting . 
Bela threw herself on his neck without a single complaint , without a single reproach for his lengthy absence ! 
... Even I was angry with him by this time ! '' 
` Good heavens ! ' 
I said ; ` why , I tell you , Kazbich was here on the other side of the river just a moment ago , and we shot at him . 
How easily you might have run up against him , you know ! 
These mountaineers are a vindictive race ! 
Do you suppose he does not guess that you gave Azamat some help ? 
And I wager that he recognised Bela to-day ! 
I know he was desperately fond of her a year ago -- he told me so himself -- and , if he had had any hope of getting together a proper bridegroom 's gift , he would certainly have sought her in marriage . ' 
`` At this Pechorin became thoughtful . '' 
` Yes , ' he answered . 
` We must be more cautious -- Bela , from this day forth you must n't walk on the rampart any more . ' 
`` In the evening I had a lengthy explanation with him . 
I was vexed that his feelings towards the poor girl had changed ; to say nothing of his spending half the day hunting , his manner towards her had become cold . 
He rarely caressed her , and she was beginning perceptibly to pine away ; her little face was becoming drawn , her large eyes growing dim . '' 
` What are you sighing for , Bela ? ' 
I would ask her . 
` Are you sad ? ' '' 
` No ! ' '' 
` Do you want anything ? ' '' 
` No ! ' '' 
` You are pining for your kinsfolk ? ' '' ' 
I have none ! ' 
`` Sometimes for whole days not a word could be drawn from her but ` Yes ' and ` No . ' 
`` So I straightway proceeded to talk to Pechorin about her . '' '' 
` LISTEN , Maksim Maksimych , ' said Pechorin . 
` Mine is an unfortunate disposition ; whether it is the result of my upbringing or whether it is innate -- I know not . 
I only know this , that if I am the cause of unhappiness in others I myself am no less unhappy . 
Of course , that is a poor consolation to them -- only the fact remains that such is the case . 
In my early youth , from the moment I ceased to be under the guardianship of my relations , I began madly to enjoy all the pleasures which money could buy -- and , of course , such pleasures became irksome to me . 
Then I launched out into the world of fashion -- and that , too , soon palled upon me . 
I fell in love with fashionable beauties and was loved by them , but my imagination and egoism alone were aroused ; my heart remained empty ... I began to read , to study -- but sciences also became utterly wearisome to me . 
I saw that neither fame nor happiness depends on them in the least , because the happiest people are the uneducated , and fame is good fortune , to attain which you have only to be smart . 
Then I grew bored ... Soon afterwards I was transferred to the Caucasus ; and that was the happiest time of my life . 
I hoped that under the bullets of the Chechenes boredom could not exist -- a vain hope ! 
In a month I grew so accustomed to the buzzing of the bullets and to the proximity of death that , to tell the truth , I paid more attention to the gnats -- and I became more bored than ever , because I had lost what was almost my last hope . 
When I saw Bela in my own house ; when , for the first time , I held her on my knee and kissed her black locks , I , fool that I was , thought that she was an angel sent to me by sympathetic fate ... Again I was mistaken ; the love of a savage is little better than that of your lady of quality , the barbaric ignorance and simplicity of the one weary you as much as the coquetry of the other . 
I am not saying that I do not love her still ; I am grateful to her for a few fairly sweet moments ; I would give my life for her -- only I am bored with her ... Whether I am a fool or a villain I know not ; but this is certain , I am also most deserving of pity -- perhaps more than she . 
My soul has been spoiled by the world , my imagination is unquiet , my heart insatiate . 
To me everything is of little moment . 
I become as easily accustomed to grief as to joy , and my life grows emptier day by day . 
One expedient only is left to me -- travel . '' 
` As soon as I can , I shall set off -- but not to Europe . 
Heaven forfend ! 
I shall go to America , to Arabia , to India -- perchance I shall die somewhere on the way . 
At any rate , I am convinced that , thanks to storms and bad roads , that last consolation will not quickly be exhausted ! ' 
`` For a long time he went on speaking thus , and his words have remained stamped upon my memory , because it was the first time that I had heard such things from a man of five-and-twenty -- and Heaven grant it may be the last . 
Is n't it astonishing ? 
Tell me , please , '' continued the staff-captain , appealing to me . 
`` You used to live in the Capital , I think , and that not so very long ago . 
Is it possible that the young men there are all like that ? '' 
I replied that there were a good many people who used the same sort of language , that , probably , there might even be some who spoke in all sincerity ; that disillusionment , moreover , like all other vogues , having had its beginning in the higher strata of society , had descended to the lower , where it was being worn threadbare , and that , now , those who were really and truly bored strove to conceal their misfortune as if it were a vice . 
The staff-captain did not understand these subtleties , shook his head , and smiled slyly . 
`` Anyhow , I suppose it was the French who introduced the fashion ? '' 
`` No , the English . '' 
`` Aha , there you are ! '' 
he answered . 
`` They always have been arrant drunkards , you know ! '' 
Involuntarily I recalled to mind a certain lady , living in Moscow , who used to maintain that Byron was nothing more nor less than a drunkard . 
However , the staff-captain 's observation was more excusable ; in order to abstain from strong drink , he naturally endeavoured to convince himself that all the misfortunes in the world are the result of drunkenness . 
MEANWHILE the staff-captain continued his story . 
`` Kazbich never put in an appearance again ; but somehow -- I do n't know why -- I could not get the idea out of my head that he had had a reason for coming , and that some mischievous scheme was in his mind . 
`` Well , one day Pechorin tried to persuade me to go boar-hunting with him . 
For a long time I refused . 
What novelty was a wild boar to me ? 
`` However , off he dragged me , all the same . 
We took four or five soldiers and set out early in the morning . 
Up till ten o'clock we scurried about the reeds and the forest -- there was n't a wild beast to be found ! '' ' 
I say , ought n't we to be going back ? ' 
I said . 
` What 's the use of sticking at it ? 
It is evident enough that we have happened on an unlucky day ! ' 
`` But , in spite of heat and fatigue , Pechorin did n't like to return empty-handed ... That is just the kind of man he was ; whatever he set his heart on he had to have -- evidently , in his childhood , he had been spoiled by an indulgent mother . 
At last , at midday , we discovered one of those cursed wild boars -- Bang ! 
Bang ! 
-- No good ! 
-- Off it went into the reeds . 
That was an unlucky day , to be sure ! 
... So , after a short rest , we set off homeward ... `` We rode in silence , side by side , giving the horses their head . 
We had almost reached the fortress , and only the brushwood concealed it from view . 
Suddenly a shot rang out ... We glanced at each other , both struck with the selfsame suspicion ... We galloped headlong in the direction of the shot , looked , and saw the soldiers clustered together on the rampart and pointing towards a field , along which a rider was flying at full speed , holding something white across his saddle . 
Grigori Aleksandrovich yelled like any Chechene , whipped his gun from its cover , and gave chase -- I after him . 
`` Luckily , thanks to our unsuccessful hunt , our horses were not jaded ; they strained under the saddle , and with every moment we drew nearer and nearer ... At length I recognised Kazbich , only I could not make out what it was that he was holding in front of him . 
`` Then I drew level with Pechorin and shouted to him : '' ` It is Kazbich ! ' 
`` He looked at me , nodded , and struck his horse with his whip . 
`` At last we were within gunshot of Kazbich . 
Whether it was that his horse was jaded or not so good as ours , I do n't know , but , in spite of all his efforts , it did not get along very fast . 
I fancy at that moment he remembered his Karagyoz ! 
`` I looked at Pechorin . 
He was taking aim as he galloped ... '' ` Do n't shoot , ' I cried . 
` Save the shot ! 
We will catch up with him as it is . ' 
`` Oh , these young men ! 
Always taking fire at the wrong moment ! 
The shot rang out and the bullet broke one of the horse 's hind legs . 
It gave a few fiery leaps forward , stumbled , and fell to its knees . 
Kazbich sprang off , and then we perceived that it was a woman he was holding in his arms -- a woman wrapped in a veil . 
It was Bela -- poor Bela ! 
He shouted something to us in his own language and raised his dagger over her ... Delay was useless ; I fired in my turn , at haphazard . 
Probably the bullet struck him in the shoulder , because he dropped his hand suddenly . 
When the smoke cleared off , we could see the wounded horse lying on the ground and Bela beside it ; but Kazbich , his gun flung away , was clambering like a cat up the cliff , through the brushwood . 
I should have liked to have brought him down from there -- but I had n't a charge ready . 
We jumped off our horses and rushed to Bela . 
Poor girl ! 
She was lying motionless , and the blood was pouring in streams from her wound . 
The villain ! 
If he had struck her to the heart -- well and good , everything would at least have been finished there and then ; but to stab her in the back like that -- the scoundrel ! 
She was unconscious . 
We tore the veil into strips and bound up the wound as tightly as we could . 
In vain Pechorin kissed her cold lips -- it was impossible to bring her to . 
`` Pechorin mounted ; I lifted Bela from the ground and somehow managed to place her before him on his saddle ; he put his arm round her and we rode back . '' 
` Look here , Maksim Maksimych , ' said Grigori Aleksandrovich , after a few moments of silence . 
` We will never bring her in alive like this . ' '' 
` True ! ' 
I said , and we put our horses to a full gallop . '' 
`` A CROWD was awaiting us at the fortress gate . 
Carefully we carried the wounded girl to Pechorin 's quarters , and then we sent for the doctor . 
The latter was drunk , but he came , examined the wound , and announced that she could not live more than a day . 
He was mistaken , though . '' 
`` She recovered ? '' 
I asked the staff-captain , seizing him by the arm , and involuntarily rejoicing . 
`` No , '' he replied , `` but the doctor was so far mistaken that she lived two days longer . '' 
`` Explain , though , how Kazbich made off with her ! '' 
`` It was like this : in spite of Pechorin 's prohibition , she went out of the fortress and down to the river . 
It was a very hot day , you know , and she sat on a rock and dipped her feet in the water . 
Up crept Kazbich , pounced upon her , silenced her , and dragged her into the bushes . 
Then he sprang on his horse and made off . 
In the meantime she succeeded in crying out , the sentries took the alarm , fired , but wide of the mark ; and thereupon we arrived on the scene . '' 
`` But what did Kazbich want to carry her off for ? '' 
`` Good gracious ! 
Why , everyone knows these Circassians are a race of thieves ; they ca n't keep their hands off anything that is left lying about ! 
They may not want a thing , but they will steal it , for all that . 
Still , you must n't be too hard on them . 
And , besides , he had been in love with her for a long time . '' 
`` And Bela died ? '' 
`` Yes , she died , but she suffered for a long time , and we were fairly knocked up with her , I can tell you . 
About ten o'clock in the evening she came to herself . 
We were sitting by her bed . 
As soon as ever she opened her eyes she began to call Pechorin . '' ' 
I am here beside you , my janechka ' -LRB- that is , ` my darling ' -RRB- , he answered , taking her by the hand . '' ' 
I shall die , ' she said . 
`` We began to comfort her , telling her that the doctor had promised infallibly to cure her . 
She shook her little head and turned to the wall -- she did not want to die ! 
... `` At night she became delirious , her head burned , at times a feverish paroxysm convulsed her whole body . 
She talked incoherently about her father , her brother ; she yearned for the mountains , for her home ... Then she spoke of Pechorin also , called him various fond names , or reproached him for having ceased to love his janechka . 
`` He listened to her in silence , his head sunk in his hands ; but yet , during the whole time , I did not notice a single tear-drop on his lashes . 
I do not know whether he was actually unable to weep or was mastering himself ; but for my part I have never seen anything more pitiful . 
`` Towards morning the delirium passed off . 
For an hour or so she lay motionless , pale , and so weak that it was hardly possible to observe that she was breathing . 
After that she grew better and began to talk : only about what , think you ? 
Such thoughts come only to the dying ! 
... She lamented that she was not a Christian , that in the other world her soul would never meet the soul of Grigori Aleksandrovich , and that in Paradise another woman would be his companion . 
The thought occurred to me to baptize her before her death . 
I told her my idea ; she looked at me undecidedly , and for a long time was unable to utter a word . 
Finally she answered that she would die in the faith in which she had been born . 
A whole day passed thus . 
What a change that day made in her ! 
Her pale cheeks fell in , her eyes grew ever so large , her lips burned . 
She felt a consuming heat within her , as though a red-hot blade was piercing her breast . 
`` The second night came on . 
We did not close our eyes or leave the bedside . 
She suffered terribly , and groaned ; and directly the pain began to abate she endeavoured to assure Grigori Aleksandrovich that she felt better , tried to persuade him to go to bed , kissed his hand and would not let it out of hers . 
Before the morning she began to feel the death agony and to toss about . 
She knocked the bandage off , and the blood flowed afresh . 
When the wound was bound up again she grew quiet for a moment and begged Pechorin to kiss her . 
He fell on his knees beside the bed , raised her head from the pillow , and pressed his lips to hers -- which were growing cold . 
She threw her trembling arms closely round his neck , as if with that kiss she wished to yield up her soul to him . 
-- No , she did well to die ! 
Why , what would have become of her if Grigori Aleksandrovich had abandoned her ? 
And that is what would have happened , sooner or later . 
`` During half the following day she was calm , silent and docile , however much the doctor tortured her with his fomentations and mixtures . '' 
` Good heavens ! ' 
I said to him , ` you know you said yourself that she was certain to die , so what is the good of all these preparations of yours ? ' '' 
` Even so , it is better to do all this , ' he replied , ` so that I may have an easy conscience . ' 
`` A pretty conscience , forsooth ! 
`` After midday Bela began to suffer from thirst . 
We opened the windows , but it was hotter outside than in the room ; we placed ice round the bed -- all to no purpose . 
I knew that that intolerable thirst was a sign of the approaching end , and I told Pechorin so . '' 
` Water , water ! ' 
she said in a hoarse voice , raising herself up from the bed . 
`` Pechorin turned pale as a sheet , seized a glass , filled it , and gave it to her . 
I covered my eyes with my hands and began to say a prayer -- I ca n't remember what ... Yes , my friend , many a time have I seen people die in hospitals or on the field of battle , but this was something altogether different ! 
Still , this one thing grieves me , I must confess : she died without even once calling me to mind . 
Yet I loved her , I should think , like a father ! 
... Well , God forgive her ! 
... And , to tell the truth , what am I that she should have remembered me when she was dying ? 
... `` As soon as she had drunk the water , she grew easier -- but in about three minutes she breathed her last ! 
We put a looking-glass to her lips -- it was undimmed ! 
`` I led Pechorin from the room , and we went on to the fortress rampart . 
For a long time we walked side by side , to and fro , speaking not a word and with our hands clasped behind our backs . 
His face expressed nothing out of the common -- and that vexed me . 
Had I been in his place , I should have died of grief . 
At length he sat down on the ground in the shade and began to draw something in the sand with his stick . 
More for form 's sake than anything , you know , I tried to console him and began to talk . 
He raised his head and burst into a laugh ! 
At that laugh a cold shudder ran through me ... I went away to order a coffin . 
`` I confess it was partly to distract my thoughts that I busied myself in that way . 
I possessed a little piece of Circassian stuff , and I covered the coffin with it , and decked it with some Circassian silver lace which Grigori Aleksandrovich had bought for Bela herself . 
`` Early next morning we buried her behind the fortress , by the river , beside the spot where she had sat for the last time . 
Around her little grave white acacia shrubs and elder-trees have now grown up . 
I should have liked to erect a cross , but that would not have done , you know -- after all , she was not a Christian . '' 
`` And what of Pechorin ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Pechorin was ill for a long time , and grew thin , poor fellow ; but we never spoke of Bela from that time forth . 
I saw that it would be disagreeable to him , so what would have been the use ? 
About three months later he was appointed to the E -- Regiment , and departed for Georgia . 
We have never met since . 
Yet , when I come to think of it , somebody told me not long ago that he had returned to Russia -- but it was not in the general orders for the corps . 
Besides , to the like of us news is late in coming . '' 
Hereupon -- probably to drown sad memories -- he launched forth into a lengthy dissertation on the unpleasantness of learning news a year late . 
I did not interrupt him , nor did I listen . 
In an hour 's time a chance of proceeding on our journey presented itself . 
The snowstorm subsided , the sky became clear , and we set off . 
On the way I involuntarily let the conversation turn on Bela and Pechorin . 
`` You have not heard what became of Kazbich ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Kazbich ? 
In truth , I do n't know . 
I have heard that with the Shapsugs , on our right flank , there is a certain Kazbich , a dare-devil fellow who rides about at a walking pace , in a red tunic , under our bullets , and bows politely whenever one hums near him -- but it can scarcely be the same person ! '' 
... In Kobi , Maksim Maksimych and I parted company . 
I posted on , and he , on account of his heavy luggage , was unable to follow me . 
We had no expectation of ever meeting again , but meet we did , and , if you like , I will tell you how -- it is quite a history ... You must acknowledge , though , that Maksim Maksimych is a man worthy of all respect ... If you admit that , I shall be fully rewarded for my , perhaps , too lengthy story . 
AFTER parting with Maksim Maksimych , I galloped briskly through the gorges of the Terek and Darial , breakfasted in Kazbek , drank tea in Lars , and arrived at Vladikavkaz in time for supper . 
I spare you a description of the mountains , as well as exclamations which convey no meaning , and word-paintings which convey no image -- especially to those who have never been in the Caucasus . 
I also omit statistical observations , which I am quite sure nobody would read . 
I put up at the inn which is frequented by all who travel in those parts , and where , by the way , there is no one you can order to roast your pheasant and cook your cabbage-soup , because the three veterans who have charge of the inn are either so stupid , or so drunk , that it is impossible to knock any sense at all out of them . 
I was informed that I should have to stay there three days longer , because the `` Adventure '' had not yet arrived from Ekaterinograd and consequently could not start on the return journey . 
What a misadventure ! 
-LSB- 18 -RSB- ... But a bad pun is no consolation to a Russian , and , for the sake of something to occupy my thoughts , I took it into my head to write down the story about Bela , which I had heard from Maksim Maksimych -- never imagining that it would be the first link in a long chain of novels : you see how an insignificant event has sometimes dire results ! 
... Perhaps , however , you do not know what the `` Adventure '' is ? 
It is a convoy -- composed of half a company of infantry , with a cannon -- which escorts baggage-trains through Kabardia from Vladikavkaz to Ekaterinograd . 
The first day I found the time hang on my hands dreadfully . 
Early next morning a vehicle drove into the courtyard ... Aha ! 
Maksim Maksimych ! 
... We met like a couple of old friends . 
I offered to share my own room with him , and he accepted my hospitality without standing upon ceremony ; he even clapped me on the shoulder and puckered up his mouth by way of a smile -- a queer fellow , that ! 
... Maksim Maksimych was profoundly versed in the culinary art . 
He roasted the pheasant astonishingly well and basted it successfully with cucumber sauce . 
I was obliged to acknowledge that , but for him , I should have had to remain on a dry-food diet . 
A bottle of Kakhetian wine helped us to forget the modest number of dishes -- of which there was one , all told . 
Then we lit our pipes , took our chairs , and sat down -- I by the window , and he by the stove , in which a fire had been lighted because the day was damp and cold . 
We remained silent . 
What had we to talk about ? 
He had already told me all that was of interest about himself and I had nothing to relate . 
I looked out of the window . 
Here and there , behind the trees , I caught glimpses of a number of poor , low houses straggling along the bank of the Terek , which flowed seaward in an ever-widening stream ; farther off rose the dark-blue , jagged wall of the mountains , behind which Mount Kazbek gazed forth in his highpriest 's hat of white . 
I took a mental farewell of them ; I felt sorry to leave them ... Thus we sat for a considerable time . 
The sun was sinking behind the cold summits and a whitish mist was beginning to spread over the valleys , when the silence was broken by the jingling of the bell of a travelling-carriage and the shouting of drivers in the street . 
A few vehicles , accompanied by dirty Armenians , drove into the courtyard of the inn , and behind them came an empty travelling-carriage . 
Its light movement , comfortable arrangement , and elegant appearance gave it a kind of foreign stamp . 
Behind it walked a man with large moustaches . 
He was wearing a Hungarian jacket and was rather well dressed for a manservant . 
From the bold manner in which he shook the ashes out of his pipe and shouted at the coachman it was impossible to mistake his calling . 
He was obviously the spoiled servant of an indolent master -- something in the nature of a Russian Figaro . 
`` Tell me , my good man , '' I called to him out of the window . 
`` What is it ? 
-- Has the ` Adventure ' arrived , eh ? '' 
He gave me a rather insolent glance , straightened his cravat , and turned away . 
An Armenian , who was walking near him , smiled and answered for him that the `` Adventure '' had , in fact , arrived , and would start on the return journey the following morning . 
`` Thank heavens ! '' 
said Maksim Maksimych , who had come up to the window at that moment . 
`` What a wonderful carriage ! '' 
he added ; `` probably it belongs to some official who is going to Tiflis for a judicial inquiry . 
You can see that he is unacquainted with our little mountains ! 
No , my friend , you 're not serious ! 
They are not for the like of you ; why , they would shake even an English carriage to bits ! 
-- But who could it be ? 
Let us go and find out . '' 
We went out into the corridor , at the end of which there was an open door leading into a side room . 
The manservant and a driver were dragging portmanteaux into the room . 
`` I say , my man ! '' 
the staff-captain asked him : `` Whose is that marvellous carriage ? 
-- Eh ? 
-- A beautiful carriage ! '' 
Without turning round the manservant growled something to himself as he undid a portmanteau . 
Maksim Maksimych grew angry . 
`` I am speaking to you , my friend ! '' 
he said , touching the uncivil fellow on the shoulder . 
`` Whose carriage ? 
-- My master 's . '' 
`` And who is your master ? '' 
`` Pechorin -- '' `` What did you say ? 
What ? 
Pechorin ? 
-- Great Heavens ! 
... Did he not serve in the Caucasus ? '' 
exclaimed Maksim Maksimych , plucking me by the sleeve . 
His eyes were sparkling with joy . 
`` Yes , he served there , I think -- but I have not been with him long . '' 
`` Well ! 
Just so ! 
... Just so ! 
... Grigori Aleksandrovich ? 
... that is his name , of course ? 
Your master and I were friends , '' he added , giving the manservant a friendly clap on the shoulder with such force as to cause him to stagger . 
`` Excuse me , sir , you are hindering me , '' said the latter , frowning . 
`` What a fellow you are , my friend ! 
Why , do n't you know , your master and I were bosom friends , and lived together ? 
... But where has he put up ? '' 
The servant intimated that Pechorin had stayed to take supper and pass the night at Colonel N -- 's . 
`` But wo n't he be looking in here in the evening ? '' 
said Maksim Maksimych . 
`` Or , you , my man , wo n't you be going over to him for something ? 
... If you do , tell him that Maksim Maksimych is here ; just say that -- he 'll know ! 
-- I 'll give you half a ruble for a tip ! '' 
The manservant made a scornful face on hearing such a modest promise , but he assured Maksim Maksimych that he would execute his commission . 
`` He 'll be sure to come running up directly ! '' 
said Maksim Maksimych , with an air of triumph . 
`` I will go outside the gate and wait for him ! 
Ah , it 's a pity I am not acquainted with Colonel N -- ! '' 
Maksim Maksimych sat down on a little bench outside the gate , and I went to my room . 
I confess that I also was awaiting this Pechorin 's appearance with a certain amount of impatience -- although , from the staff-captain 's story , I had formed a by no means favourable idea of him . 
Still , certain traits in his character struck me as remarkable . 
In an hour 's time one of the old soldiers brought a steaming samovar and a teapot . 
`` Wo n't you have some tea , Maksim Maksimych ? '' 
I called out of the window . 
`` Thank you . 
I am not thirsty , somehow . '' 
`` Oh , do have some ! 
It is late , you know , and cold ! '' 
`` No , thank you '' ... `` Well , just as you like ! '' 
I began my tea alone . 
About ten minutes afterwards my old captain came in . 
`` You are right , you know ; it would be better to have a drop of tea -- but I was waiting for Pechorin . 
His man has been gone a long time now , but evidently something has detained him . '' 
The staff-captain hurriedly sipped a cup of tea , refused a second , and went off again outside the gate -- not without a certain amount of disquietude . 
It was obvious that the old man was mortified by Pechorin 's neglect , the more so because a short time previously he had been telling me of their friendship , and up to an hour ago had been convinced that Pechorin would come running up immediately on hearing his name . 
It was already late and dark when I opened the window again and began to call Maksim Maksimych , saying that it was time to go to bed . 
He muttered something through his teeth . 
I repeated my invitation -- he made no answer . 
I left a candle on the stove-seat , and , wrapping myself up in my cloak , I lay down on the couch and soon fell into slumber ; and I would have slept on quietly had not Maksim Maksimych awakened me as he came into the room . 
It was then very late . 
He threw his pipe on the table , began to walk up and down the room , and to rattle about at the stove . 
At last he lay down , but for a long time he kept coughing , spitting , and tossing about . 
`` The bugs are biting you , are they not ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Yes , that is it , '' he answered , with a heavy sigh . 
I woke early the next morning , but Maksim Maksimych had anticipated me . 
I found him sitting on the little bench at the gate . 
`` I have to go to the Commandant , '' he said , `` so , if Pechorin comes , please send for me . '' 
... I gave my promise . 
He ran off as if his limbs had regained their youthful strength and suppleness . 
The morning was fresh and lovely . 
Golden clouds had massed themselves on the mountaintops like a new range of aerial mountains . 
Before the gate a wide square spread out ; behind it the bazaar was seething with people , the day being Sunday . 
Barefooted Ossete boys , carrying wallets of honeycomb on their shoulders , were hovering around me . 
I cursed them ; I had other things to think of -- I was beginning to share the worthy staff-captain 's uneasiness . 
Before ten minutes had passed the man we were awaiting appeared at the end of the square . 
He was walking with Colonel N. , who accompanied him as far as the inn , said good-bye to him , and then turned back to the fortress . 
I immediately despatched one of the old soldiers for Maksim Maksimych . 
Pechorin 's manservant went out to meet him and informed him that they were going to put to at once ; he handed him a box of cigars , received a few orders , and went off about his business . 
His master lit a cigar , yawned once or twice , and sat down on the bench on the other side of the gate . 
I must now draw his portrait for you . 
He was of medium height . 
His shapely , slim figure and broad shoulders gave evidence of a strong constitution , capable of enduring all the hardships of a nomad life and changes of climates , and of resisting with success both the demoralising effects of life in the Capital and the tempests of the soul . 
His velvet overcoat , which was covered with dust , was fastened by the two lower buttons only , and exposed to view linen of dazzling whiteness , which proved that he had the habits of a gentleman . 
His gloves , soiled by travel , seemed as though made expressly for his small , aristocratic hand , and when he took one glove off I was astonished at the thinness of his pale fingers . 
His gait was careless and indolent , but I noticed that he did not swing his arms -- a sure sign of a certain secretiveness of character . 
These remarks , however , are the result of my own observations , and I have not the least desire to make you blindly believe in them . 
When he was in the act of seating himself on the bench his upright figure bent as if there was not a single bone in his back . 
The attitude of his whole body was expressive of a certain nervous weakness ; he looked , as he sat , like one of Balzac 's thirty-year-old coquettes resting in her downy arm-chair after a fatiguing ball . 
From my first glance at his face I should not have supposed his age to be more than twenty-three , though afterwards I should have put it down as thirty . 
His smile had something of a child-like quality . 
His skin possessed a kind of feminine delicacy . 
His fair hair , naturally curly , most picturesquely outlined his pale and noble brow , on which it was only after lengthy observation that traces could be noticed of wrinkles , intersecting each other : probably they showed up more distinctly in moments of anger or mental disturbance . 
Notwithstanding the light colour of his hair , his moustaches and eyebrows were black -- a sign of breeding in a man , just as a black mane and a black tail in a white horse . 
To complete the portrait , I will add that he had a slightly turned-up nose , teeth of dazzling whiteness , and brown eyes -- I must say a few words more about his eyes . 
In the first place , they never laughed when he laughed . 
Have you not happened , yourself , to notice the same peculiarity in certain people ? 
... It is a sign either of an evil disposition or of deep and constant grief . 
From behind his half-lowered eyelashes they shone with a kind of phosphorescent gleam -- if I may so express myself -- which was not the reflection of a fervid soul or of a playful fancy , but a glitter like to that of smooth steel , blinding but cold . 
His glance -- brief , but piercing and heavy -- left the unpleasant impression of an indiscreet question and might have seemed insolent had it not been so unconcernedly tranquil . 
It may be that all these remarks came into my mind only after I had known some details of his life , and it may be , too , that his appearance would have produced an entirely different impression upon another ; but , as you will not hear of him from anyone except myself , you will have to rest content , nolens volens , with the description I have given . 
In conclusion , I will say that , speaking generally , he was a very good-looking man , and had one of those original types of countenance which are particularly pleasing to women . 
The horses were already put to ; now and then the bell jingled on the shaft-bow ; -LSB- 19 -RSB- and the manservant had twice gone up to Pechorin with the announcement that everything was ready , but still there was no sign of Maksim Maksimych . 
Fortunately Pechorin was sunk in thought as he gazed at the jagged , blue peaks of the Caucasus , and was apparently by no means in a hurry for the road . 
I went up to him . 
`` If you care to wait a little longer , '' I said , `` you will have the pleasure of meeting an old friend . '' 
`` Oh , exactly ! '' 
he answered quickly . 
`` They told me so yesterday . 
Where is he , though ? '' 
I looked in the direction of the square and there I descried Maksim Maksimych running as hard as he could . 
In a few moments he was beside us .
