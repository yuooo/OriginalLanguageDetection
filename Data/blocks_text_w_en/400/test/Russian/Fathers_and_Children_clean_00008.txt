` Of course , not in medicine , though even in that department he will be one of the leading scientific men . ' 
` In what then , Arkady Nikolaitch ? ' 
` It would he hard to say now , but he will be famous . ' 
` He will be famous ! ' 
repeated the old man , and he sank into a reverie . 
` Arina Vlasyevna sent me to call you in to tea , ' announced Anfisushka , coming by with an immense dish of ripe raspberries . 
Vassily Ivanovitch started . 
` And will there be cooled cream for the raspberries ? ' 
` Yes . ' 
` Cold now , mind ! 
Do n't stand on ceremony , Arkady Nikolaitch ; take some more . 
How is it Yevgeny does n't come ? ' 
` I 'm here , ' was heard Bazarov 's voice from Arkady 's room . 
Vassily Ivanovitch turned round quickly . 
` Aha ! 
you wanted to pay a visit to your friend ; but you were too late , amice , and we have already had a long conversation with him . 
Now we must go in to tea , mother summons us . 
By the way , I want to have a little talk with you . ' 
` What about ? ' 
` There 's a peasant here ; he 's suffering from icterus ... ` You mean jaundice ? ' 
` Yes , a chronic and very obstinate case of icterus . 
I have prescribed him centaury and St. John 's wort , ordered him to eat carrots , given him soda ; but all that 's merely palliative measures ; we want some more decided treatment . 
Though you do laugh at medicine , I am certain you can give me practical advice . 
But we will talk of that later . 
Now come in to tea . ' 
Vassily Ivanovitch jumped up briskly from the garden seat , and hummed from Robert le Diable -- ` The rule , the rule we set ourselves , To live , to live for pleasure ! ' 
` Singular vitality ! ' 
observed Bazarov , going away from the window . 
It was midday . 
The sun was burning hot behind a thin veil of unbroken whitish clouds . 
Everything was hushed ; there was no sound but the cocks crowing irritably at one another in the village , producing in every one who heard them a strange sense of drowsiness and ennui ; and somewhere , high up in a tree-top , the incessant plaintive cheep of a young hawk . 
Arkady and Bazarov lay in the shade of a small haystack , putting under themselves two armfuls of dry and rustling , but still greenish and fragrant grass . 
` That aspen-tree , ' began Bazarov , ` reminds me of my childhood ; it grows at the edge of the clay-pits where the bricks were dug , and in those days I believed firmly that that clay-pit and aspen-tree possessed a peculiar talismanic power ; I never felt dull near them . 
I did not understand then that I was not dull , because I was a child . 
Well , now I 'm grown up , the talisman 's lost its power . ' 
` How long did you live here altogether ? ' 
asked Arkady . 
` Two years on end ; then we travelled about . 
We led a roving life , wandering from town to town for the most part . ' 
` And has this house been standing long ? ' 
` Yes . 
My grandfather built it -- my mother 's father . ' 
` Who was he -- your grandfather ? ' 
` Devil knows . 
Some second-major . 
He served with Suvorov , and was always telling stories about the crossing of the Alps -- inventions probably . ' 
` You have a portrait of Suvorov hanging in the drawing-room . 
I like these dear little houses like yours ; they 're so warm and old-fashioned ; and there 's always a special sort of scent about them . ' ' 
A smell of lamp-oil and clover , ' Bazarov remarked , yawning . 
` And the flies in those dear little houses ... . 
Faugh ! ' 
` Tell me , ' began Arkady , after a brief pause , ` were they strict with you when you were a child ? ' 
` You can see what my parents are like . 
They 're not a severe sort . ' 
` Are you fond of them , Yevgeny ? ' ' 
I am , Arkady . ' 
` How fond they are of you ! ' 
Bazarov was silent for a little . 
` Do you know what I 'm thinking about ? ' 
he brought out at last , clasping his hands behind his head . 
` No . 
What is it ? ' 
` I 'm thinking life is a happy thing for my parents . 
My father at sixty is fussing around , talking about `` palliative '' measures , doctoring people , playing the bountiful master with the peasants -- having a festive time , in fact ; and my mother 's happy too ; her day 's so chockful of duties of all sorts , and sighs and groans that she 's no time even to think of herself ; while I ... ' ` While you ? ' ' 
I think ; here I lie under a haystack ... . 
The tiny space I occupy is so infinitely small in comparison with the rest of space , in which I am not , and which has nothing to do with me ; and the period of time in which it is my lot to live is so petty beside the eternity in which I have not been , and shall not be ... . 
And in this atom , this mathematical point , the blood is circulating , the brain is working and wanting something ... . 
Is n't it loathsome ? 
Is n't it petty ? ' 
` Allow me to remark that what you 're saying applies to men in general . ' 
` You are right , ' Bazarov cut in . ' 
I was going to say that they now -- my parents , I mean -- are absorbed and do n't trouble themselves about their own nothingness ; it does n't sicken them ... while I ... I feel nothing but weariness and anger . ' 
` Anger ? 
why anger ? ' 
` Why ? 
How can you ask why ? 
Have you forgotten ? ' ' 
I remember everything , but still I do n't admit that you have any right to be angry . 
You 're unlucky , I 'll allow , but ... ' ` Pooh ! 
then you , Arkady Nikolaevitch , I can see , regard love like all modern young men ; cluck , cluck , cluck you call to the hen , but if the hen comes near you , you run away . 
I 'm not like that . 
But that 's enough of that . 
What ca n't be helped , it 's shameful to talk about . ' 
He turned over on his side . 
` Aha ! 
there goes a valiant ant dragging off a half-dead fly . 
Take her , brother , take her ! 
Do n't pay attention to her resistance ; it 's your privilege as an animal to be free from the sentiment of pity -- make the most of it -- not like us conscientious self-destructive animals ! ' 
` You should n't say that , Yevgeny ! 
When have you destroyed yourself ? ' 
Bazarov raised his head . 
` That 's the only thing I pride myself on . 
I have n't crushed myself , so a woman ca n't crush me . 
Amen ! 
It 's all over ! 
You shall not hear another word from me about it . ' 
Both the friends lay for some time in silence . 
` Yes , ' began Bazarov , ` man 's a strange animal . 
When one gets a side view from a distance of the dead-alive life our `` fathers '' lead here , one thinks , What could be better ? 
You eat and drink , and know you are acting in the most reasonable , most judicious manner . 
But if not , you 're devoured by ennui . 
One wants to have to do with people if only to abuse them . ' 
` One ought so to order one 's life that every moment in it should be of significance , ' Arkady affirmed reflectively . ' 
I dare say ! 
What 's of significance is sweet , however mistaken ; one could make up one 's mind to what 's insignificant even . 
But pettiness , pettiness , that 's what 's insufferable . ' 
` Pettiness does n't exist for a man so long as he refuses to recognise it . ' 
` H 'm ... what you 've just said is a common-place reversed . ' 
` What ? 
What do you mean by that term ? ' 
` I 'll tell you ; saying , for instance , that education is beneficial , that 's a common-place ; but to say that education is injurious , that 's a common-place turned upside down . 
There 's more style about it , so to say , but in reality it 's one and the same . ' 
` And the truth is -- where , which side ? ' 
` Where ? 
Like an echo I answer , Where ? ' 
` You 're in a melancholy mood to-day , Yevgeny . ' 
` Really ? 
The sun must have softened my brain , I suppose , and I ca n't stand so many raspberries either . ' 
` In that case , a nap 's not a bad thing , ' observed Arkady . 
` Certainly ; only do n't look at me ; every man 's face is stupid when he 's asleep . ' 
` But is n't it all the same to you what people think of you ? ' ' 
I do n't know what to say to you . 
A real man ought not to care ; a real man is one whom it 's no use thinking about , whom one must either obey or hate . ' 
` It 's funny ! 
I do n't hate anybody , ' observed Arkady , after a moment 's thought . 
` And I hate so many . 
You are a soft-hearted , mawkish creature ; how could you hate any one ? 
... You 're timid ; you do n't rely on yourself much . ' 
` And you , ' interrupted Arkady , ` do you expect much of yourself ? 
Have you a high opinion of yourself ? ' 
Bazarov paused . 
` When I meet a man who can hold his own beside me , ' he said , dwelling on every syllable , ` then I 'll change my opinion of myself . 
Yes , hatred ! 
You said , for instance , to-day as we passed our bailiff Philip 's cottage -- it 's the one that 's so nice and clean -- well , you said , Russia will come to perfection when the poorest peasant has a house like that , and every one of us ought to work to bring it about ... . 
And I felt such a hatred for this poorest peasant , this Philip or Sidor , for whom I 'm to be ready to jump out of my skin , and who wo n't even thank me for it ... and why should he thank me ? 
Why , suppose he does live in a clean house , while the nettles are growing out of me , -- well what do I gain by it ? ' 
` Hush , Yevgeny ... if one listened to you to-day one would be driven to agreeing with those who reproach us for want of principles . ' 
` You talk like your uncle . 
There are no general principles -- you 've not made out that even yet ! 
There are feelings . 
Everything depends on them . ' 
` How so ? ' 
` Why , I , for instance , take up a negative attitude , by virtue of my sensations ; I like to deny -- my brain 's made on that plan , and that 's all about it ! 
Why do I like chemistry ? 
Why do you like apples ? 
-- by virtue of our sensations . 
It 's all the same thing . 
Deeper than that men will never penetrate . 
Not every one will tell you that , and , in fact , I sha n't tell you so another time . ' 
` What ? 
and is honesty a matter of the senses ? ' ' 
I should rather think so . ' 
` Yevgeny ! ' 
Arkady was beginning in a dejected voice ... ` Well ? 
What ? 
Is n't it to your taste ? ' 
broke in Bazarov . 
` No , brother . 
If you 've made up your mind to mow down everything , do n't spare your own legs . 
But we 've talked enough metaphysics . 
`` Nature breathes the silence of sleep , '' said Pushkin . ' 
` He never said anything of the sort , ' protested Arkady . 
` Well , if he did n't , as a poet he might have -- and ought to have said it . 
By the way , he must have been a military man . ' 
` Pushkin never was a military man ! ' 
` Why , on every page of him there 's , `` To arms ! 
to arms ! 
for Russia 's honour ! '' ' 
` Why , what stories you invent ! 
I declare , it 's positive calumny . ' 
` Calumny ? 
That 's a mighty matter ! 
What a word he 's found to frighten me with ! 
Whatever charge you make against a man , you may be certain he deserves twenty times worse than that in reality . ' 
` We had better go to sleep , ' said Arkady , in a tone of vexation . 
` With the greatest pleasure , ' answered Bazarov . 
But neither of them slept . 
A feeling almost of hostility had come over both the young men . 
Five minutes later , they opened their eyes and glanced at one another in silence . 
` Look , ' said Arkady suddenly , ' a dry maple leaf has come off and is falling to the earth ; its movement is exactly like a butterfly 's flight . 
Is n't it strange ? 
Gloom and decay -- like brightness and life . ' 
` Oh , my friend , Arkady Nikolaitch ! ' 
cried Bazarov , ` one thing I entreat of you ; no fine talk . ' ' 
I talk as best I can ... . 
And , I declare , its perfect despotism . 
An idea came into my head ; why should n't I utter it ? ' 
` Yes ; and why should n't I utter my ideas ? 
I think that fine talk 's positively indecent . ' 
` And what is decent ? 
Abuse ? ' 
` Ha ! 
ha ! 
you really do intend , I see , to walk in your uncle 's footsteps . 
How pleased that worthy imbecile would have been if he had heard you ! ' 
` What did you call Pavel Petrovitch ? ' ' 
I called him , very justly , an imbecile . ' 
` But this is unbearable ! ' 
cried Arkady . 
` Aha ! 
family feeling spoke there , ' Bazarov commented coolly . 
` I 've noticed how obstinately it sticks to people . 
A man 's ready to give up everything and break with every prejudice ; but to admit that his brother , for instance , who steals handkerchiefs , is a thief -- that 's too much for him . 
And when one comes to think of it : my brother , mine -- and no genius ... that 's an idea no one can swallow . ' 
` It was a simple sense of justice spoke in me and not in the least family feeling , ' retorted Arkady passionately . 
` But since that 's a sense you do n't understand , since you have n't that sensation , you ca n't judge of it . ' 
` In other words , Arkady Kirsanov is too exalted for my comprehension . 
I bow down before him and say no more . ' 
` Do n't , please , Yevgeny ; we shall really quarrel at last . ' 
` Ah , Arkady ! 
do me a kindness . 
I entreat you , let us quarrel for once in earnest ... ' ` But then perhaps we should end by ... ' ` Fighting ? ' 
put in Bazarov . 
` Well ? 
Here , on the hay , in these idyllic surroundings , far from the world and the eyes of men , it would n't matter . 
But you 'd be no match for me . 
I 'll have you by the throat in a minute . ' 
Bazarov spread out his long , cruel fingers ... . 
Arkady turned round and prepared , as though in jest , to resist ... . 
But his friend 's face struck him as so vindictive -- there was such menace in grim earnest in the smile that distorted his lips , and in his glittering eyes , that he felt instinctively afraid . 
` Ah ! 
so this is where you have got to ! ' 
the voice of Vassily Ivanovitch was heard saying at that instant , and the old army-doctor appeared before the young men , garbed in a home-made linen pea-jacket , with a straw hat , also home-made , on his head . 
` I 've been looking everywhere for you ... . 
Well , you 've picked out a capital place , and you 're excellently employed . 
Lying on the `` earth , gazing up to heaven . '' 
Do you know , there 's a special significance in that ? ' ' 
I never gaze up to heaven except when I want to sneeze , ' growled Bazarov , and turning to Arkady he added in an undertone . 
` Pity he interrupted us . ' 
` Come , hush ! ' 
whispered Arkady , and he secretly squeezed his friend 's hand . 
But no friendship can long stand such shocks . ' 
I look at you , my youthful friends , ' Vassily Ivanovitch was saying meantime , shaking his head , and leaning his folded arms on a rather cunningly bent stick of his own carving , with a Turk 's figure for a top , -- ' I look , and I can not refrain from admiration . 
You have so much strength , such youth and bloom , such abilities , such talents ! 
Positively , a Castor and Pollux ! ' 
` Get along with you -- going off into mythology ! ' 
commented Bazarov . 
` You can see at once that he was a great Latinist in his day ! 
Why , I seem to remember , you gained the silver medal for Latin prose -- did n't you ? ' 
` The Dioscuri , the Dioscuri ! ' 
repeated Vassily Ivanovitch . 
` Come , shut up , father ; do n't show off . ' 
` Once in a way it 's surely permissible , ' murmured the old man . 
` However , I have not been seeking for you , gentlemen , to pay you compliments ; but with the object , in the first place , of announcing to you that we shall soon be dining ; and secondly , I wanted to prepare you , Yevgeny ... . 
You are a sensible man , you know the world , and you know what women are , and consequently you will excuse ... . 
Your mother wished to have a Te Deum sung on the occasion of your arrival . 
You must not imagine that I am inviting you to attend this thanksgiving -- it is over indeed now ; but Father Alexey ... ' ` The village parson ? ' 
` Well , yes , the priest ; he ... is to dine ... with us ... . 
I did not anticipate this , and did not even approve of it ... but it somehow came about ... he did not understand me ... . 
And , well ... Arina Vlasyevna ... Besides , he 's a worthy , reasonable man . ' 
` He wo n't eat my share at dinner , I suppose ? ' 
queried Bazarov . 
Vassily Ivanovitch laughed . 
` How you talk ! ' 
` Well , that 's all I ask . 
I 'm ready to sit down to table with any man . ' 
Vassily Ivanovitch set his hat straight . ' 
I was certain before I spoke , ' he said , ` that you were above any kind of prejudice . 
Here am I , an old man at sixty-two , and I have none . ' 
-LRB- Vassily Ivanovitch did not dare to confess that he had himself desired the thanksgiving service . 
He was no less religious than his wife . -RRB- 
` And Father Alexey very much wanted to make your acquaintance . 
You will like him , you 'll see . 
He 's no objection even to cards , and he sometimes -- but this is between ourselves ... positively smokes a pipe . ' 
` All right . 
We 'll have a round of whist after dinner , and I 'll clean him out . ' 
` He ! 
he ! 
he ! 
We shall see ! 
That remains to be seen . ' ' 
I know you 're an old hand , ' said Bazarov , with a peculiar emphasis . 
Vassily Ivanovitch 's bronzed cheeks were suffused with an uneasy flush . 
` For shame , Yevgeny ... . 
Let bygones be bygones . 
Well , I 'm ready to acknowledge before this gentleman I had that passion in my youth ; and I have paid for it too ! 
How hot it is , though ! 
Let me sit down with you . 
I sha n't be in your way , I hope ? ' 
` Oh , not at all , ' answered Arkady . 
Vassily Ivanovitch lowered himself , sighing , into the hay . 
` Your present quarters remind me , my dear sirs , ' he began , ` of my military bivouacking existence , the ambulance halts , somewhere like this under a haystack , and even for that we were thankful . ' 
He sighed . ' 
I had many , many experiences in my life . 
For example , if you will allow me , I will tell you a curious episode of the plague in Bessarabia . ' 
` For which you got the Vladimir cross ? ' 
put in Bazarov . 
` We know , we know ... . 
By the way , why is it you 're not wearing it ? ' 
` Why , I told you that I have no prejudices , ' muttered Vassily Ivanovitch -LRB- he had only the evening before had the red ribbon unpicked off his coat -RRB- , and he proceeded to relate the episode of the plague . 
` Why , he 's fallen asleep , ' he whispered all at once to Arkady , pointing to Yevgeny , and winking good-naturedly . 
` Yevgeny ! 
get up , ' he went on aloud . 
` Let 's go in to dinner . ' 
Father Alexey , a good-looking stout man with thick , carefully-combed hair , with an embroidered girdle round his lilac silk cassock , appeared to be a man of much tact and adaptability . 
He made haste to be the first to offer his hand to Arkady and Bazarov , as though understanding beforehand that they did not want his blessing , and he behaved himself in general without constraint . 
He neither derogated from his own dignity , nor gave offence to others ; he vouchsafed a passing smile at the seminary Latin , and stood up for his bishop ; drank two small glasses of wine , but refused a third ; accepted a cigar from Arkady , but did not proceed to smoke it , saying he would take it home with him . 
The only thing not quite agreeable about him was a way he had of constantly raising his hand with care and deliberation to catch the flies on his face , sometimes succeeding in smashing them . 
He took his seat at the green table , expressing his satisfaction at so doing in measured terms , and ended by winning from Bazarov two roubles and a half in paper money ; they had no idea of even reckoning in silver in the house of Arina Vlasyevna ... . 
She was sitting , as before , near her son -LRB- she did not play cards -RRB- , her cheek , as before , propped on her little fist ; she only got up to order some new dainty to be served . 
She was afraid to caress Bazarov , and he gave her no encouragement , he did not invite her caresses ; and besides , Vassily Ivanovitch had advised her not to ` worry ' him too much . 
` Young men are not fond of that sort of thing , ' he declared to her . 
-LRB- It 's needless to say what the dinner was like that day ; Timofeitch in person had galloped off at early dawn for beef ; the bailiff had gone off in another direction for turbot , gremille , and crayfish ; for mushrooms alone forty-two farthings had been paid the peasant women in copper -RRB- ; but Arina Vlasyevna 's eyes , bent steadfastly on Bazarov , did not express only devotion and tenderness ; in them was to be seen sorrow also , mingled with awe and curiosity ; there was to be seen too a sort of humble reproachfulness . 
Bazarov , however , was not in a humour to analyse the exact expression of his mother 's eyes ; he seldom turned to her , and then only with some short question . 
Once he asked her for her hand ` for luck ' ; she gently laid her soft , little hand on his rough , broad palm . 
` Well , ' she asked , after waiting a little , ` has it been any use ? ' 
` Worse luck than ever , ' he answered , with a careless laugh . 
` He plays too rashly , ' pronounced Father Alexey , as it were compassionately , and he stroked his beard . 
` Napoleon 's rule , good Father , Napoleon 's rule , ' put in Vassily Ivanovitch , leading an ace . 
` It brought him to St. Helena , though , ' observed Father Alexey , as he trumped the ace . 
` Would n't you like some currant tea , Enyusha ? ' 
inquired Arina Vlasyevna . 
Bazarov merely shrugged his shoulders . 
` No ! ' 
he said to Arkady the next day . 
I 'm off from here to-morrow . 
I 'm bored ; I want to work , but I ca n't work here . 
I will come to your place again ; I 've left all my apparatus there too . 
In your house one can at any rate shut oneself up . 
While here my father repeats to me , `` My study is at your disposal -- nobody shall interfere with you , '' and all the time he himself is never a yard away . 
And I 'm ashamed somehow to shut myself away from him . 
It 's the same thing too with mother . 
I hear her sighing the other side of the wall , and if one goes in to her , one 's nothing to say to her . ' 
` She will be very much grieved , ' observed Arkady , ` and so will he . ' ' 
I shall come back again to them . ' 
` When ? ' 
` Why , when on my way to Petersburg . ' ' 
I feel sorry for your mother particularly . ' 
` Why 's that ? 
Has she won your heart with strawberries , or what ? ' 
Arkady dropped his eyes . 
` You do n't understand your mother , Yevgeny . 
She 's not only a very good woman , she 's very clever really . 
This morning she talked to me for half-an-hour , and so sensibly , interestingly . ' ' 
I suppose she was expatiating upon me all the while ? ' 
` We did n't talk only about you . ' 
` Perhaps ; lookers-on see most . 
If a woman can keep up half-an-hour 's conversation , it 's always a hopeful sign . 
But I 'm going , all the same . ' 
` It wo n't be very easy for you to break it to them . 
They are always making plans for what we are to do in a fortnight 's time . ' 
` No ; it wo n't be easy . 
Some demon drove me to tease my father to-day ; he had one of his rent-paying peasants flogged the other day , and quite right too -- yes , yes , you need n't look at me in such horror -- he did quite right , because he 's an awful thief and drunkard ; only my father had no idea that I , as they say , was cognisant of the facts . 
He was greatly perturbed , and now I shall have to upset him more than ever ... . 
Never mind ! 
Never say die ! 
He 'll get over it ! ' 
Bazarov said , ` Never mind ' ; but the whole day passed before he could make up his mind to inform Vassily Ivanovitch of his intentions . 
At last , when he was just saying good-night to him in the study , he observed , with a feigned yawn -- ` Oh ... I was almost forgetting to tell you ... . 
Send to Fedot 's for our horses to-morrow . ' 
Vassily Ivanovitch was dumbfounded . 
` Is Mr. Kirsanov leaving us , then ? ' 
` Yes ; and I 'm going with him . ' 
Vassily Ivanovitch positively reeled . 
` You are going ? ' 
` Yes ... I must . 
Make the arrangements about the horses , please . ' 
` Very good ... ' faltered the old man ; ` to Fedot 's ... very good ... only ... only ... . 
How is it ? ' ' 
I must go to stay with him for a little time . 
I will come back again later . ' 
` Ah ! 
For a little time ... very good . ' 
Vassily Ivanovitch drew out his handkerchief , and , blowing his nose , doubled up almost to the ground . 
` Well ... everything shall be done . 
I had thought you were to be with us ... a little longer . 
Three days ... . 
After three years , it 's rather little ; rather little , Yevgeny ! ' 
` But , I tell you , I 'm coming back directly . 
It 's necessary for me to go . ' 
` Necessary ... . 
Well ! 
Duty before everything . 
So the horses shall be in readiness . 
Very good . 
Arina and I , of course , did not anticipate this . 
She has just begged some flowers from a neighbour ; she meant to decorate the room for you . ' 
-LRB- Vassily Ivanovitch did not even mention that every morning almost at dawn he took counsel with Timofeitch , standing with his bare feet in his slippers , and pulling out with trembling fingers one dog 's - eared rouble note after another , charged him with various purchases , with special reference to good things to eat , and to red wine , which , as far as he could observe , the young men liked extremely . -RRB- 
` Liberty ... is the great thing ; that 's my rule ... . 
I do n't want to hamper you ... not ... ' He suddenly ceased , and made for the door . 
` We shall soon see each other again , father , really . ' 
But Vassily Ivanovitch , without turning round , merely waved his hand and was gone . 
When he got back to his bedroom he found his wife in bed , and began to say his prayers in a whisper , so as not to wake her up . 
She woke , however . 
` Is that you , Vassily Ivanovitch ? ' 
she asked . 
` Yes , mother . ' 
` Have you come from Enyusha ? 
Do you know , I 'm afraid of his not being comfortable on that sofa . 
I told Anfisushka to put him on your travelling mattress and the new pillows ; I should have given him our feather-bed , but I seem to remember he does n't like too soft a bed ... ' ` Never mind , mother ; do n't worry yourself . 
He 's all right . 
Lord , have mercy on me , a sinner , ' he went on with his prayer in a low voice . 
Vassily Ivanovitch was sorry for his old wife ; he did not mean to tell her over night what a sorrow there was in store for her . 
Bazarov and Arkady set off the next day . 
From early morning all was dejection in the house ; Anfisushka let the tray slip out of her hands ; even Fedka was bewildered , and was reduced to taking off his boots . 
Vassily Ivanitch was more fussy than ever ; he was obviously trying to put a good face on it , talked loudly , and stamped with his feet , but his face looked haggard , and his eyes were continually avoiding his son . 
Arina Vlasyevna was crying quietly ; she was utterly crushed , and could not have controlled herself at all if her husband had not spent two whole hours early in the morning exhorting her . 
When Bazarov , after repeated promises to come back certainly not later than in a month 's time , tore himself at last from the embraces detaining him , and took his seat in the coach ; when the horses had started , the bell was ringing , and the wheels were turning round , and when it was no longer any good to look after them , and the dust had settled , and Timofeitch , all bent and tottering as he walked , had crept back to his little room ; when the old people were left alone in their little house , which seemed suddenly to have grown shrunken and decrepit too , Vassily Ivanovitch , after a few more moments of hearty waving of his handkerchief on the steps , sank into a chair , and his head dropped on to his breast . 
` He has cast us off ; he has forsaken us , ' he faltered ; ` forsaken us ; he was dull with us . 
Alone , alone ! '
