`` Dick , '' said Silver , `` I trust you . 
I 've a gauge on the keg , mind . 
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . '' 
Terrified as I was , I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him . 
Dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook 's ear . 
It was but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . '' 
Hence there were still faithful men on board . 
When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . '' 
Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , `` Land ho ! '' 
THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck . 
I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , I dived behind the fore-sail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow . 
There all hands were already congregated . 
A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon . 
Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog . 
All three seemed sharp and conical in figure . 
So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before . 
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders . 
The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east . 
`` And now , men , '' said the captain , when all was sheeted home , `` has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? '' 
`` I have , sir , '' said Silver . 
`` I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . '' 
`` The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it . 
It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it . 
That hill to the nor ` ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir . 
But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually calls the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . '' 
`` I have a chart here , '' says Captain Smollett . 
`` See if that 's the place . '' 
Long John 's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment . 
This was not the map we found in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all things -- names and heights and soundings -- with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes . 
Sharp as must have been his annoyance , Silver had the strength of mind to hide it . 
`` Yes , sir , '' said he , `` this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out . 
Who might have done that , I wonder ? 
The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon . 
Aye , here it is : ` Capt. Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate called it . 
There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast . 
Right you was , sir , '' says he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island . 
Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . '' 
`` Thank you , my man , '' says Captain Smollett . 
`` I 'll ask you later on to give us a help . 
You may go . '' 
I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island , and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself . 
He did not know , to be sure , that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm . 
`` Ah , '' says he , `` this here is a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on . 
You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself . 
Why , it makes me young again . 
I was going to forget my timber leg , I was . 
It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that . 
When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . '' 
And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below . 
Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck , and anxious as I was to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly . 
While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey called me to his side . 
He had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that I should fetch it ; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I broke immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak . 
Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me . 
I have terrible news . '' 
The doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself . 
`` Thank you , Jim , '' said he quite loudly , `` that was all I wanted to know , '' as if he had asked me a question . 
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two . 
They spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson , and all hands were piped on deck . 
`` My lads , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you . 
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for . 
Mr. Trelawney , being a very open-handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck . 
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome . 
And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it . '' 
The cheer followed -- that was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood . 
`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cried Long John when the first had subsided . 
And this also was given with a will . 
On the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin . 
I found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I knew , was a sign that he was agitated . 
The stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship 's wake . 
`` Now , Hawkins , '' said the squire , `` you have something to say . 
Speak up . '' 
I did as I was bid , and as short as I could make it , told the whole details of Silver 's conversation . 
Nobody interrupted me till I was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last . 
`` Jim , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . '' 
And they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage . 
`` Now , captain , '' said the squire , `` you were right , and I was wrong . 
I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . '' 
`` No more an ass than I , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according . 
But this crew , '' he added , `` beats me . '' 
`` Captain , '' said the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver . 
A very remarkable man . '' 
`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything . 
I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . '' 
`` You , sir , are the captain . 
It is for you to speak , '' says Mr. Trelawney grandly . 
`` First point , '' began Mr. Smollett . 
`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back . 
If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once . 
Second point , we have time before us -- at least until this treasure 's found . 
Third point , there are faithful hands . 
Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it . 
We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? '' 
`` As upon myself , '' declared the squire . 
`` Three , '' reckoned the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here . 
Now , about the honest hands ? '' 
`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' said the doctor ; `` those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . '' 
`` Nay , '' replied the squire . 
`` Hands was one of mine . '' 
`` I did think I could have trusted Hands , '' added the captain . 
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! '' 
broke out the squire . 
`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . '' 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' said the captain , `` the best that I can say is not much . 
We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout . 
It 's trying on a man , I know . 
It would be pleasanter to come to blows . 
But there 's no help for it till we know our men . 
Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . '' 
`` Jim here , '' said the doctor , `` can help us more than anyone . 
The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . '' 
`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' added the squire . 
I began to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came . 
In the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen . 
THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed . 
Although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast . 
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface . 
This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad . 
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock . 
All were strangely shaped , and the Spy-glass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on . 
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell . 
The booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory . 
I had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach . 
Perhaps it was this -- perhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , I hated the very thought of Treasure Island . 
We had a dreary morning 's work before us , for there was no sign of any wind , and the boats had to be got out and manned , and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island . 
I volunteered for one of the boats , where I had , of course , no business . 
The heat was sweltering , and the men grumbled fiercely over their work . 
Anderson was in command of my boat , and instead of keeping the crew in order , he grumbled as loud as the worst . 
`` Well , '' he said with an oath , `` it 's not forever . '' 
I thought this was a very bad sign , for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline . 
All the way in , Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship . 
He knew the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart , John never hesitated once . 
`` There 's a strong scour with the ebb , '' he said , `` and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . '' 
We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other . 
The bottom was clean sand . 
The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods , but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent . 
The place was entirely land-locked , buried in woods , the trees coming right down to high-water mark , the shores mostly flat , and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there . 
Two little rivers , or rather two swamps , emptied out into this pond , as you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness . 
From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they were quite buried among trees ; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion , we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas . 
There was not a breath of air moving , nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside . 
A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage -- a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks . 
I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone tasting a bad egg . 
`` I do n't know about treasure , '' he said , `` but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . '' 
If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat , it became truly threatening when they had come aboard . 
They lay about the deck growling together in talk . 
The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed . 
Even the honest hands must have caught the infection , for there was not one man aboard to mend another . 
Mutiny , it was plain , hung over us like a thunder-cloud . 
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger . 
Long John was hard at work going from group to group , spending himself in good advice , and as for example no man could have shown a better . 
He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility ; he was all smiles to everyone . 
If an order were given , John would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheeriest `` Aye , aye , sir ! '' 
in the world ; and when there was nothing else to do , he kept up one song after another , as if to conceal the discontent of the rest . 
Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst . 
We held a council in the cabin . 
`` Sir , '' said the captain , `` if I risk another order , the whole ship 'll come about our ears by the run . 
You see , sir , here it is . 
I get a rough answer , do I not ? 
Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up . 
Now , we 've only one man to rely on . '' 
`` And who is that ? '' 
asked the squire . 
`` Silver , sir , '' returned the captain ; `` he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up . 
This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance . 
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore . 
If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship . 
If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right . 
If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . '' 
It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew . 
`` My lads , '' said he , `` we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts . 
A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon . 
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . '' 
I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage . 
The captain was too bright to be in the way . 
He whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it was as well he did so . 
Had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation . 
It was as plain as day . 
Silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it . 
The honest hands -- and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board -- must have been very stupid fellows . 
Or rather , I suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders -- only some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further . 
It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men . 
At last , however , the party was made up . 
Six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including Silver , began to embark . 
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives . 
If six men were left by Silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance . 
It occurred to me at once to go ashore . 
In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off . 
No one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , `` Is that you , Jim ? 
Keep your head down . '' 
But Silver , from the other boat , looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me ; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done . 
The crews raced for the beach , but the boat I was in , having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned , shot far ahead of her consort , and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind . 
`` Jim , Jim ! '' 
I heard him shouting . 
But you may suppose I paid no heed ; jumping , ducking , and breaking through , I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer . 
I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in . 
I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows , bulrushes , and odd , outlandish , swampy trees ; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating , sandy country , about a mile long , dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees , not unlike the oak in growth , but pale in the foliage , like willows . 
On the far side of the open stood one of the hills , with two quaint , craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun . 
I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration . 
The isle was uninhabited ; my shipmates I had left behind , and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls . 
I turned hither and thither among the trees . 
Here and there were flowering plants , unknown to me ; here and there I saw snakes , and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top . 
Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle . 
Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees -- live , or evergreen , oaks , I heard afterwards they should be called -- which grew low along the sand like brambles , the boughs curiously twisted , the foliage compact , like thatch . 
The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls , spreading and growing taller as it went , until it reached the margin of the broad , reedy fen , through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage . 
The marsh was steaming in the strong sun , and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze . 
All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes ; a wild duck flew up with a quack , another followed , and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air . 
I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen . 
Nor was I deceived , for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice , which , as I continued to give ear , grew steadily louder and nearer . 
This put me in a great fear , and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there , hearkening , as silent as a mouse . 
Another voice answered , and then the first voice , which I now recognized to be Silver 's , once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream , only now and again interrupted by the other . 
By the sound they must have been talking earnestly , and almost fiercely ; but no distinct word came to my hearing . 
At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down , for not only did they cease to draw any nearer , but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp . 
And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business , that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes , the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils , and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage , under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees . 
I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly , not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders . 
Crawling on all fours , I made steadily but slowly towards them , till at last , raising my head to an aperture among the leaves , I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh , and closely set about with trees , where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation . 
The sun beat full upon them . 
Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground , and his great , smooth , blond face , all shining with heat , was lifted to the other man 's in a kind of appeal . 
`` Mate , '' he was saying , `` it 's because I thinks gold dust of you -- gold dust , and you may lay to that ! 
If I had n't took to you like pitch , do you think I 'd have been here a-warning of you ? 
All 's up -- you ca n't make nor mend ; it 's to save your neck that I 'm a-speaking , and if one of the wild uns knew it , where 'd I be , Tom -- now , tell me , where 'd I be ? '' 
`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook . 
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ? 
Not you ! 
As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand . 
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise . 
I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another . 
Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream . 
The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon . 
Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye . 
He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring . 
`` John ! '' 
said the sailor , stretching out his hand . 
`` Hands off ! '' 
cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast . 
`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other . 
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me . 
But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? '' 
`` That ? '' 
returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass . 
`` That ? 
Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . '' 
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero . 
`` Alan ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman ! 
And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more . 
If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty . 
You 've killed Alan , have you ? 
Kill me too , if you can . 
But I defies you . '' 
And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach . 
But he was not destined to go far . 
With a cry John seized the branch of a tree , whipped the crutch out of his armpit , and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air . 
It struck poor Tom , point foremost , and with stunning violence , right between the shoulders in the middle of his back . 
His hands flew up , he gave a sort of gasp , and fell . 
Whether he were injured much or little , none could ever tell . 
Like enough , to judge from the sound , his back was broken on the spot . 
But he had no time given him to recover . 
Silver , agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch , was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body . 
From my place of ambush , I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows . 
I do not know what it rightly is to faint , but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist ; Silver and the birds , and the tall Spy-glass hilltop , going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear . 
When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head . 
Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass . 
Everything else was unchanged , the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain , and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes . 
But now John put his hand into his pocket , brought out a whistle , and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air . 
I could not tell , of course , the meaning of the signal , but it instantly awoke my fears . 
More men would be coming . 
I might be discovered . 
They had already slain two of the honest people ; after Tom and Alan , might not I come next ? 
Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again , with what speed and silence I could manage , to the more open portion of the wood . 
As I did so , I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades , and this sound of danger lent me wings . 
As soon as I was clear of the thicket , I ran as I never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as I ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy . 
Indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than I ? 
When the gun fired , how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ? 
Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe 's ? 
Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ? 
It was all over , I thought . 
Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA ; good-bye to the squire , the doctor , and the captain ! 
There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers . 
All this while , as I say , I was still running , and without taking any notice , I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions . 
Mingled with these were a few scattered pines , some fifty , some nearer seventy , feet high . 
The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh . 
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart . 
FROM the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees . 
My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine . 
What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell . 
It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not . 
But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand . 
I was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript . 
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not . 
Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and I turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats . 
Instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off . 
I was tired , at any rate ; but had I been as fresh as when I rose , I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary . 
From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that I had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran . 
Yet a man it was , I could no longer be in doubt about that . 
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals . 
I was within an ace of calling for help . 
But the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion . 
I stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as I was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind . 
As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him . 
He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me . 
Then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication . 
At that I once more stopped . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Ben Gunn , '' he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock . 
`` I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . '' 
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing . 
His skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face . 
Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness . 
He was clothed with tatters of old ship 's canvas and old sea-cloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin . 
About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement . 
`` Three years ! '' 
I cried . 
`` Were you shipwrecked ? '' 
`` Nay , mate , '' said he ; `` marooned . '' 
I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island . 
`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters . 
Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself . 
But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet . 
You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ? 
No ? 
Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . '' 
`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . '' 
All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature . 
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness . 
`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? '' 
he repeated . 
`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? '' 
`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply . 
`` And right you was , '' he cried . 
`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? '' 
`` Jim , '' I told him . 
`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently . 
`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of . 
Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered . 
`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious . 
And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another . 
And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones ! 
That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman ! 
But it were Providence that put me here . 
I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety . 
You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have . 
I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to . 
And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . '' 
I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich ! 
Rich ! 
I says . 
And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim . 
Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! '' 
And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes . 
`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? '' 
he asked . 
At this I had a happy inspiration . 
I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once . 
`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . '' 
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? '' 
he gasped . 
`` Silver ? '' 
I asked . 
`` Ah , Silver ! '' 
says he . 
`` That were his name . '' 
`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . '' 
He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring . 
`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it . 
But where was you , do you suppose ? '' 
I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves . 
He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head . 
`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ? 
Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it . 
Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? '' 
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men . 
`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim . 
What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? '' 
`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . '' 
`` AND a passage home ? '' 
he added with a look of great shrewdness . 
`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman . 
And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . '' 
`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . '' 
And he seemed very much relieved . 
`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on . 
`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more . 
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen . 
They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS . 
One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf . 
The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater . 
But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried . 
How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out . 
It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six . 
Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was . 
` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! ' 
That 's what he said . 
`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island .
