` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . ' 
The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed . 
Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard . 
` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe . 
You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says . 
`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this . 
But now , you look here ; look at me . 
Do I look like a man before the mast ? 
No , says you . 
Nor I were n't , neither , I says . '' 
And with that he winked and pinched me hard . 
`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on . 
`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words . 
Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter . 
And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . '' 
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner . 
`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . '' 
`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying . 
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? '' 
`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure . 
Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands . 
I keep her under the white rock . 
If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark . 
Hi ! '' 
he broke out . 
`` What 's that ? '' 
For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon . 
`` They have begun to fight ! '' 
I cried . 
`` Follow me . '' 
And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly . 
`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim ! 
Under the trees with you ! 
Theer 's where I killed my first goat . 
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn . 
Ah ! 
And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant . 
`` You see the mounds ? 
I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo . 
It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . '' 
So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer . 
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms . 
Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood . 
IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA . 
The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin . 
Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea . 
But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest . 
It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins , but we were alarmed for his safety . 
With the men in the temper they were in , it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again . 
We ran on deck . 
The pitch was bubbling in the seams ; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick ; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery , it was in that abominable anchorage . 
The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each , hard by where the river runs in . 
One of them was whistling `` Lillibullero . '' 
Waiting was a strain , and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information . 
The gigs had leaned to their right , but Hunter and I pulled straight in , in the direction of the stockade upon the chart . 
The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance ; `` Lillibullero '' stopped off , and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do . 
Had they gone and told Silver , all might have turned out differently ; but they had their orders , I suppose , and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to `` Lillibullero . '' 
There was a slight bend in the coast , and I steered so as to put it between us ; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs . 
I jumped out and came as near running as I durst , with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness ' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety . 
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade . 
This was how it was : a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll . 
Well , on the knoll , and enclosing the spring , they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side . 
All round this they had cleared a wide space , and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high , without door or opening , too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers . 
The people in the log-house had them in every way ; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges . 
All they wanted was a good watch and food ; for , short of a complete surprise , they might have held the place against a regiment . 
What particularly took my fancy was the spring . 
For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA , with plenty of arms and ammunition , and things to eat , and excellent wines , there had been one thing overlooked -- we had no water . 
I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death . 
I was not new to violent death -- I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland , and got a wound myself at Fontenoy -- but I know my pulse went dot and carry one . 
`` Jim Hawkins is gone , '' was my first thought . 
It is something to have been an old soldier , but more still to have been a doctor . 
There is no time to dilly-dally in our work . 
And so now I made up my mind instantly , and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat . 
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar . 
We made the water fly , and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner . 
I found them all shaken , as was natural . 
The squire was sitting down , as white as a sheet , thinking of the harm he had led us to , the good soul ! 
And one of the six forecastle hands was little better . 
`` There 's a man , '' says Captain Smollett , nodding towards him , `` new to this work . 
He came nigh-hand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry . 
Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us . '' 
I told my plan to the captain , and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment . 
We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle , with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection . 
Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port , and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins , muskets , bags of biscuits , kegs of pork , a cask of cognac , and my invaluable medicine chest . 
In the meantime , the squire and the captain stayed on deck , and the latter hailed the coxswain , who was the principal man aboard . 
`` Mr. Hands , '' he said , `` here are two of us with a brace of pistols each . 
If any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man 's dead . '' 
They were a good deal taken aback , and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion , thinking no doubt to take us on the rear . 
But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley , they went about ship at once , and a head popped out again on deck . 
`` Down , dog ! '' 
cries the captain . 
And the head popped back again ; and we heard no more , for the time , of these six very faint-hearted seamen . 
By this time , tumbling things in as they came , we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared . 
Joyce and I got out through the stern-port , and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us . 
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore . 
`` Lillibullero '' was dropped again ; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point , one of them whipped ashore and disappeared . 
I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats , but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand , and all might very well be lost by trying for too much . 
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house . 
All three made the first journey , heavily laden , and tossed our stores over the palisade . 
Then , leaving Joyce to guard them -- one man , to be sure , but with half a dozen muskets -- Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more . 
So we proceeded without pausing to take breath , till the whole cargo was bestowed , when the two servants took up their position in the block house , and I , with all my power , sculled back to the HISPANIOLA . 
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was . 
They had the advantage of numbers , of course , but we had the advantage of arms . 
Not one of the men ashore had a musket , and before they could get within range for pistol shooting , we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least . 
The squire was waiting for me at the stern window , all his faintness gone from him . 
He caught the painter and made it fast , and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives . 
Pork , powder , and biscuit was the cargo , with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain . 
The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water , so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun , on the clean , sandy bottom . 
By this time the tide was beginning to ebb , and the ship was swinging round to her anchor . 
Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs ; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter , who were well to the eastward , it warned our party to be off . 
Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat , which we then brought round to the ship 's counter , to be handier for Captain Smollett . 
`` Now , men , '' said he , `` do you hear me ? '' 
There was no answer from the forecastle . 
`` It 's to you , Abraham Gray -- it 's to you I am speaking . '' 
Still no reply . 
`` Gray , '' resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , `` I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain . 
I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out . 
I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . '' 
There was a pause . 
`` Come , my fine fellow , '' continued the captain ; `` do n't hang so long in stays . 
I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . '' 
There was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle . 
`` I 'm with you , sir , '' said he . 
And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way . 
We were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade . 
THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others . 
In the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded . 
Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry . 
Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags . 
The gunwale was lipping astern . 
Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards . 
The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly . 
All the same , we were afraid to breathe . 
In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ` ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning . 
Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point . 
If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment . 
`` I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , '' said I to the captain . 
I was steering , while he and Redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars . 
`` The tide keeps washing her down . 
Could you pull a little stronger ? '' 
`` Not without swamping the boat , '' said he . 
`` You must bear up , sir , if you please -- bear up until you see you 're gaining . '' 
I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go . 
`` We 'll never get ashore at this rate , '' said I. `` If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , '' returned the captain . 
`` We must keep upstream . 
You see , sir , '' he went on , `` if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . '' 
`` The current 's less a ` ready , sir , '' said the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore-sheets ; `` you can ease her off a bit . '' 
`` Thank you , my man , '' said I , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves . 
Suddenly the captain spoke up again , and I thought his voice was a little changed . 
`` The gun ! '' 
said he . 
`` I have thought of that , '' said I , for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort . 
`` They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . '' 
`` Look astern , doctor , '' replied the captain . 
We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed . 
Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad . 
`` Israel was Flint 's gunner , '' said Gray hoarsely . 
At any risk , we put the boat 's head direct for the landing-place . 
By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and I could keep her steady for the goal . 
But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door . 
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck . 
`` Who 's the best shot ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` Mr. Trelawney , out and away , '' said I. `` Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ? 
Hands , if possible , '' said the captain . 
Trelawney was as cool as steel . 
He looked to the priming of his gun . 
`` Now , '' cried the captain , `` easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat . 
All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . '' 
The squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop . 
They had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and Hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed . 
However , we had no luck , for just as Trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell . 
The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats . 
`` Here come the gigs , sir , '' said I. `` Give way , then , '' cried the captain . 
`` We must n't mind if we swamp her now . 
If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . '' 
`` Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , '' I added ; `` the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . '' 
`` They 'll have a hot run , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` Jack ashore , you know . 
It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round-shot . 
Carpet bowls ! 
My lady 's maid could n't miss . 
Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . '' 
In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process . 
We were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees . 
The gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes . 
The ebb-tide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants . 
The one source of danger was the gun . 
`` If I durst , '' said the captain , `` I 'd stop and pick off another man . '' 
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot . 
They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and I could see him trying to crawl away . 
`` Ready ! '' 
cried the squire . 
`` Hold ! '' 
cried the captain , quick as an echo . 
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water . 
The report fell in at the same instant of time . 
This was the first that Jim heard , the sound of the squire 's shot not having reached him . 
Where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster . 
At any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet . 
The other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling . 
So far there was no great harm . 
No lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety . 
But there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service . 
Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct . 
As for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost . 
The other three had gone down with the boat . 
To add to our concern , we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore , and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether , if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen , they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm . 
Hunter was steady , that we knew ; Joyce was a doubtful case -- a pleasant , polite man for a valet and to brush one 's clothes , but not entirely fitted for a man of war . 
With all this in our minds , we waded ashore as fast as we could , leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions . 
WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade , and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer . 
Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket . 
I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming . 
`` Captain , '' said I , `` Trelawney is the dead shot . 
Give him your gun ; his own is useless . '' 
They exchanged guns , and Trelawney , silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle , hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service . 
At the same time , observing Gray to be unarmed , I handed him my cutlass . 
It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand , knit his brows , and make the blade sing through the air . 
It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt . 
Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us . 
We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side , and almost at the same time , seven mutineers -- Job Anderson , the boatswain , at their head -- appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner . 
They paused as if taken aback , and before they recovered , not only the squire and I , but Hunter and Joyce from the block house , had time to fire . 
The four shots came in rather a scattering volley , but they did the business : one of the enemy actually fell , and the rest , without hesitation , turned and plunged into the trees . 
After reloading , we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy . 
He was stone dead -- shot through the heart . 
We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush , a ball whistled close past my ear , and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground . 
Both the squire and I returned the shot , but as we had nothing to aim at , it is probable we only wasted powder . 
Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom . 
The captain and Gray were already examining him , and I saw with half an eye that all was over . 
I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more , for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried , groaning and bleeding , into the log-house . 
Poor old fellow , he had not uttered one word of surprise , complaint , fear , or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now , when we had laid him down in the log-house to die . 
He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery ; he had followed every order silently , doggedly , and well ; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years ; and now , sullen , old , serviceable servant , it was he that was to die . 
The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand , crying like a child . 
`` Be I going , doctor ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Tom , my man , '' said I , `` you 're going home . '' 
`` I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first , '' he replied . 
`` Tom , '' said the squire , `` say you forgive me , wo n't you ? '' 
`` Would that be respectful like , from me to you , squire ? '' 
was the answer . 
`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! '' 
After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer . 
`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically . 
And not long after , without another word , he passed away . 
In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco . 
He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle . 
Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours . 
This seemed mightily to relieve him . 
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed . 
But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body . 
`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand . 
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner . 
It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . '' 
Then he pulled me aside . 
`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? '' 
I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later . 
`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said . 
`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . '' 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
I asked . 
`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load . 
That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain . 
`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do . 
But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . '' 
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag . 
Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood . 
`` Oho ! '' 
said the captain . 
`` Blaze away ! 
You 've little enough powder already , my lads . '' 
At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage . 
`` Captain , '' said the squire , `` the house is quite invisible from the ship . 
It must be the flag they are aiming at . 
Would it not be wiser to take it in ? '' 
`` Strike my colours ! '' 
cried the captain . 
`` No , sir , not I '' ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him . 
For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade . 
All through the evening they kept thundering away . 
Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand . 
We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket . 
`` There is one good thing about all this , '' observed the captain ; `` the wood in front of us is likely clear . 
The ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered . 
Volunteers to go and bring in pork . '' 
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward . 
Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission . 
The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery . 
For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current . 
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own . 
The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen -- being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company -- with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island . 
Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin-boy -- And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate . 
A hail on the land side . 
`` Somebody hailing us , '' said Hunter , who was on guard . 
`` Doctor ! 
Squire ! 
Captain ! 
Hullo , Hunter , is that you ? '' 
came the cries . 
And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade . 
AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` there 's your friends , sure enough . '' 
`` Far more likely it 's the mutineers , '' I answered . 
`` That ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that . 
No , that 's your friends . 
There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint . 
Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint ! 
Barring rum , his match were never seen . 
He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . '' 
`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . '' 
`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you . 
You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told . 
Now , Ben Gunn is fly . 
Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour . 
And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . '' 
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness . 
`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim . 
Just wheer you found him today . 
And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone . 
Oh ! 
And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' '' 
`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand . 
You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you . 
Is that all ? '' 
`` And when ? 
says you , '' he added . 
`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . '' 
`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? '' 
`` You wo n't forget ? '' 
he inquired anxiously . 
`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you . 
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man . 
Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim . 
And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ? 
Wild horses would n't draw it from you ? 
No , says you . 
And if them pirates camp ashore , Jim , what would you say but there 'd be widders in the morning ? '' 
Here he was interrupted by a loud report , and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking . 
The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction . 
For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island , and balls kept crashing through the woods . 
I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place , always pursued , or so it seemed to me , by these terrifying missiles . 
But towards the end of the bombardment , though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade , where the balls fell oftenest , I had begun , in a manner , to pluck up my heart again , and after a long detour to the east , crept down among the shore-side trees . 
The sun had just set , the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage ; the tide , too , was far out , and great tracts of sand lay uncovered ; the air , after the heat of the day , chilled me through my jacket . 
The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored ; but , sure enough , there was the Jolly Roger -- the black flag of piracy -- flying from her peak . 
Even as I looked , there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering , and one more round-shot whistled through the air . 
It was the last of the cannonade . 
I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack . 
Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade -- the poor jolly-boat , I afterwards discovered . 
Away , near the mouth of the river , a great fire was glowing among the trees , and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going , the men , whom I had seen so gloomy , shouting at the oars like children . 
But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum . 
At length I thought I might return towards the stockade . 
I was pretty far down on the low , sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east , and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island ; and now , as I rose to my feet , I saw , some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes , an isolated rock , pretty high , and peculiarly white in colour . 
It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one . 
Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear , or shoreward side , of the stockade , and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party . 
I had soon told my story and began to look about me . 
The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine -- roof , walls , and floor . 
The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand . 
There was a porch at the door , and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind -- no other than a great ship 's kettle of iron , with the bottom knocked out , and sunk `` to her bearings , '' as the captain said , among the sand . 
Little had been left besides the framework of the house , but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire . 
The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house , and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed . 
Most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees ; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand . 
Very close around the stockade -- too close for defence , they said -- the wood still flourished high and dense , all of fir on the land side , but towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks . 
The cold evening breeze , of which I have spoken , whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand . 
There was sand in our eyes , sand in our teeth , sand in our suppers , sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle , for all the world like porridge beginning to boil . 
Our chimney was a square hole in the roof ; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out , and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye . 
Add to this that Gray , the new man , had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth , still unburied , lay along the wall , stiff and stark , under the Union Jack . 
If we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but Captain Smollett was never the man for that . 
All hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches . 
The doctor and Gray and I for one ; the squire , Hunter , and Joyce upon the other . 
Tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; I was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted . 
From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me . 
`` That man Smollett , '' he said once , `` is a better man than I am . 
And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . '' 
Another time he came and was silent for a while . 
Then he put his head on one side , and looked at me . 
`` Is this Ben Gunn a man ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I do not know , sir , '' said I. `` I am not very sure whether he 's sane . '' 
`` If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , '' returned the doctor . 
`` A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me . 
It does n't lie in human nature . 
Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , cheese , '' I answered . 
`` Well , Jim , '' says he , `` just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food . 
You 've seen my snuff-box , have n't you ? 
And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese -- a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious . 
Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! '' 
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze . 
A good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain 's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we `` must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . '' 
Then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects . 
It appears they were at their wits ' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came . 
But our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA . 
From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at least -- the man shot beside the gun -- severely wounded , if he were not dead . 
Every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care . 
And besides that , we had two able allies -- rum and the climate . 
As for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week . 
`` So , '' he added , `` if we are not all shot down first they 'll be glad to be packing in the schooner . 
It 's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , I suppose . '' 
`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett .
