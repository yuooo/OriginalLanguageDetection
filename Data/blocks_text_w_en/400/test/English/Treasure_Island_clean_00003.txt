And falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks . 
I could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again . 
`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I am ! '' 
he said at last , wiping his cheeks . 
`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy . 
But come now , stand by to go about . 
This wo n't do . 
Dooty is dooty , messmates . 
I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair . 
For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit . 
Nor you neither , says you ; not smart -- none of the pair of us smart . 
But dash my buttons ! 
That was a good un about my score . '' 
And he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I did not see the joke as he did , I was again obliged to join him in his mirth . 
On our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forward -- how one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for sea -- and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly . 
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates . 
When we got to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection . 
Long John told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth . 
`` That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? '' 
he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out . 
The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , Long John took up his crutch and departed . 
`` All hands aboard by four this afternoon , '' shouted the squire after him . 
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cried the cook , in the passage . 
`` Well , squire , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . '' 
`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declared the squire . 
`` And now , '' added the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? '' 
`` To be sure he may , '' says squire . 
`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . '' 
THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us . 
At last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint . 
He and the squire were very thick and friendly , but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain . 
This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us . 
`` Captain Smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , '' said he . 
`` I am always at the captain 's orders . 
Show him in , '' said the squire . 
The captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him . 
`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ? 
All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? '' 
`` Well , sir , '' said the captain , `` better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence . 
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer . 
That 's short and sweet . '' 
`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? '' 
inquired the squire , very angry , as I could see . 
`` I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , '' said the captain . 
`` She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . '' 
`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? '' 
says the squire . 
But here Dr. Livesey cut in . 
`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit . 
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling . 
The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words . 
You do n't , you say , like this cruise . 
Now , why ? '' 
`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain . 
`` So far so good . 
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do . 
I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? '' 
`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . '' 
`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you . 
Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . '' 
`` Silver 's parrot ? '' 
asked the squire . 
`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain . 
`` Blabbed , I mean . 
It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . '' 
`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey . 
`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us . 
Next , you say you do n't like the crew . 
Are they not good seamen ? '' 
`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett . 
`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . '' 
`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor . 
`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional . 
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? '' 
`` I do n't , sir . 
I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer . 
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! '' 
`` Do you mean he drinks ? '' 
cried the squire . 
`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . '' 
`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? '' 
asked the doctor . 
`` Tell us what you want . '' 
`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? '' 
`` Like iron , '' answered the squire . 
`` Very good , '' said the captain . 
`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more . 
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold . 
Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ? 
-- first point . 
Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward . 
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ? 
-- second point . '' 
`` Any more ? '' 
asked Mr. Trelawney . 
`` One more , '' said the captain . 
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . '' 
`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor . 
`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly . 
`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! '' 
`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire . 
`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor . 
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations . 
Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island . 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow . 
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . '' 
`` I see , '' said the doctor . 
`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board . 
In other words , you fear a mutiny . '' 
`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth . 
No captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that . 
As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what I know . 
But I am responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her . 
I see things going , as I think , not quite right . 
And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth . 
And that 's all . '' 
`` Captain Smollett , '' began the doctor with a smile , `` did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ? 
You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable . 
When you came in here , I 'll stake my wig , you meant more than this . '' 
`` Doctor , '' said the captain , `` you are smart . 
When I came in here I meant to get discharged . 
I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . '' 
`` No more I would , '' cried the squire . 
`` Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce . 
As it is , I have heard you . 
I will do as you desire , but I think the worse of you . '' 
`` That 's as you please , sir , '' said the captain . 
`` You 'll find I do my duty . '' 
And with that he took his leave . 
`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` contrary to all my notions , I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . '' 
`` Silver , if you like , '' cried the squire ; `` but as for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . '' 
`` Well , '' says the doctor , `` we shall see . '' 
When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending . 
The new arrangement was quite to my liking . 
The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side . 
It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths . 
Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house . 
Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement . 
Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion . 
We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore-boat . 
The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , `` So ho , mates ! '' 
says he . 
`` What 's this ? '' 
`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answers one . 
`` Why , by the powers , '' cried Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! '' 
`` My orders ! '' 
said the captain shortly . 
`` You may go below , my man . 
Hands will want supper . '' 
`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley . 
`` That 's a good man , captain , '' said the doctor . 
`` Very likely , sir , '' replied Captain Smollett . 
`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cried , `` out o ' that ! 
Off with you to the cook and get some work . '' 
And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourites on my ship . '' 
I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply . 
ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friends , Mr. Blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return . 
We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work ; and I was dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars . 
I might have been twice as weary , yet I would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to me -- the brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship 's lanterns . 
`` Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , '' cried one voice . 
`` The old one , '' cried another . 
`` Aye , aye , mates , '' said Long John , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! '' 
And at the third `` Ho ! '' 
drove the bars before them with a will . 
Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus . 
But soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure . 
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail . 
It was fairly prosperous . 
The ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business . 
But before we came the length of Treasure Island , two or three things had happened which require to be known . 
Mr. Arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared . 
He had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him . 
But that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness . 
Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace . 
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably . 
In the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink . 
That was the ship 's mystery . 
Watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water . 
He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more . 
`` Overboard ! '' 
said the captain . 
`` Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . '' 
But there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men . 
The boatswain , Job Anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate . 
Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather . 
And the coxswain , Israel Hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything . 
He was a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , as the men called him . 
Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible . 
It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore . 
Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck . 
He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John 's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk . 
Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced . 
`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' said the coxswain to me . 
`` He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John ! 
I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together -- him unarmed . '' 
All the crew respected and even obeyed him . 
He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service . 
To me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner . 
`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John . 
Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son . 
Sit you down and hear the news . 
Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v ` yage . 
Was n't you , cap'n ? '' 
And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight ! 
Pieces of eight ! 
Pieces of eight ! '' 
till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage . 
`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself . 
She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate . 
She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello . 
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships . 
It 's there she learned ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins ! 
She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby . 
But you smelt powder -- did n't you , cap'n ? '' 
`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream . 
`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness . 
`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad . 
Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that . 
She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . '' 
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men . 
In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another . 
The squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain . 
The captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted . 
He owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well . 
As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her . 
`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir . 
But , '' he would add , `` all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . '' 
The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air . 
`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . '' 
We had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA . 
Every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship 's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea . 
Double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy . 
`` Never knew good come of it yet , '' the captain said to Dr. Livesey . 
`` Spoil forecastle hands , make devils . 
That 's my belief . '' 
But good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery . 
This was how it came about . 
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after -- I am not allowed to be more plain -- and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night . 
It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island . 
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea . 
The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray . 
All was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure . 
Now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that I should like an apple . 
I ran on deck . 
The watch was all forward looking out for the island . 
The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship . 
In I got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by . 
The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak . 
It was Silver 's voice , and before I had heard a dozen words , I would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone . 
`` NO , not I , '' said Silver . 
`` Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg . 
The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights . 
It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle . 
That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on . 
Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says . 
So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration . 
`` He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! '' 
`` Davis was a man too , by all accounts , '' said Silver . 
`` I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking . 
I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint . 
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank . 
` Tai n't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that . 
Where 's all England 's men now ? 
I dunno . 
Where 's Flint 's ? 
Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that , some on 'em . 
Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament . 
Where is he now ? 
Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving ! 
He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! '' 
`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . '' 
` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver . 
`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint . 
I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . '' 
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself . 
I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel . 
Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard . 
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune . 
They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets . 
Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts . 
But that 's not the course I lay . 
I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion . 
I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest . 
Time enough too , says you . 
Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea . 
And how did I begin ? 
Before the mast , like you ! '' 
`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ? 
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . '' 
`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? '' 
asked Silver derisively . 
`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion . 
`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor . 
But my old missis has it all by now . 
And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me . 
I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . '' 
`` And can you trust your missis ? '' 
asked the other . 
`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it . 
But I have a way with me , I have . 
When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John . 
There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me . 
Feared he was , and proud . 
They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them . 
Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers . 
Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . '' 
`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . '' 
`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . '' 
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms . 
By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard . 
But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party . 
`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver . 
`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands . 
`` He 's no fool , is Dick . '' 
And he turned his quid and spat . 
`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ? 
I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder ! 
I want to go into that cabin , I do . 
I want their pickles and wines , and that . '' 
`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was . 
But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough . 
Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . '' 
`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? '' 
growled the coxswain . 
`` What I say is , when ? 
That 's what I say . '' 
`` When ! 
By the powers ! '' 
cried Silver . 
`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when . 
The last moment I can manage , and that 's when . 
Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us . 
Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ? 
No more do you , says you . 
Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers . 
Then we 'll see . 
If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . '' 
`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick . 
`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver . 
`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ? 
That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last . 
If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day . 
But I know the sort you are . 
I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is . 
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk . 
Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! '' 
`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel . 
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? '' 
`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ? 
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? '' 
cried Silver . 
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry . 
You hear me ? 
I seen a thing or two at sea , I have . 
If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would . 
But not you ! 
I know you . 
You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . '' 
`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel . 
`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did . 
They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . '' 
`` So ? '' 
says Silver . 
`` Well , and where are they now ? 
Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man . 
Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah . 
Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was ! 
On ` y , where are they ? '' 
`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? '' 
`` There 's the man for me ! '' 
cried the cook admiringly . 
`` That 's what I call business . 
Well , what would you think ? 
Put 'em ashore like maroons ? 
That would have been England 's way . 
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ? 
That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . '' 
`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . '' 
` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he . 
Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . '' 
`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready . 
But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious . 
Dooty is dooty , mates . 
I give my vote -- death . 
When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers . 
Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! '' 
`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! '' 
`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver . 
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney . 
I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! '' 
he added , breaking off . 
`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . '' 
You may fancy the terror I was in ! 
I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me . 
I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that ! 
Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John . 
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
