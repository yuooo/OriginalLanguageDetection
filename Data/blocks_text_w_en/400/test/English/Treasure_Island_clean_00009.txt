You 're less of a fool than many , take you all round ; but you do n't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health . 
`` Well , '' he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions , with really laughable humility , more like charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates -- `` well , that 's done for today . 
And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy , please . '' 
And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly . 
George Merry was at the door , spitting and spluttering over some bad-tasted medicine ; but at the first word of the doctor 's proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried `` No ! '' 
and swore . 
Silver struck the barrel with his open hand . 
`` Si-lence ! '' 
he roared and looked about him positively like a lion . 
`` Doctor , '' he went on in his usual tones , `` I was a-thinking of that , knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy . 
We 're all humbly grateful for your kindness , and as you see , puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog . 
And I take it I 've found a way as 'll suit all . 
Hawkins , will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman -- for a young gentleman you are , although poor born -- your word of honour not to slip your cable ? '' 
I readily gave the pledge required . 
`` Then , doctor , '' said Silver , `` you just step outside o ' that stockade , and once you 're there I 'll bring the boy down on the inside , and I reckon you can yarn through the spars . 
Good day to you , sir , and all our dooties to the squire and Cap'n Smollett . '' 
The explosion of disapproval , which nothing but Silver 's black looks had restrained , broke out immediately the doctor had left the house . 
Silver was roundly accused of playing double -- of trying to make a separate peace for himself , of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims , and , in one word , of the identical , exact thing that he was doing . 
It seemed to me so obvious , in this case , that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger . 
But he was twice the man the rest were , and his last night 's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds . 
He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine , said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor , fluttered the chart in their faces , asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting . 
`` No , by thunder ! '' 
he cried . 
`` It 's us must break the treaty when the time comes ; and till then I 'll gammon that doctor , if I have to ile his boots with brandy . '' 
And then he bade them get the fire lit , and stalked out upon his crutch , with his hand on my shoulder , leaving them in a disarray , and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced . 
`` Slow , lad , slow , '' he said . 
`` They might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry . '' 
Very deliberately , then , did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade , and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped . 
`` You 'll make a note of this here also , doctor , '' says he , `` and the boy 'll tell you how I saved his life , and were deposed for it too , and you may lay to that . 
Doctor , when a man 's steering as near the wind as me -- playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body , like -- you would n't think it too much , mayhap , to give him one good word ? 
You 'll please bear in mind it 's not my life only now -- it 's that boy 's into the bargain ; and you 'll speak me fair , doctor , and give me a bit o ' hope to go on , for the sake of mercy . '' 
Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house ; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in , his voice trembled ; never was a soul more dead in earnest . 
`` Why , John , you 're not afraid ? '' 
asked Dr. Livesey . 
`` Doctor , I 'm no coward ; no , not I -- not SO much ! '' 
and he snapped his fingers . 
`` If I was I would n't say it . 
But I 'll own up fairly , I 've the shakes upon me for the gallows . 
You 're a good man and a true ; I never seen a better man ! 
And you 'll not forget what I done good , not any more than you 'll forget the bad , I know . 
And I step aside -- see here -- and leave you and Jim alone . 
And you 'll put that down for me too , for it 's a long stretch , is that ! '' 
So saying , he stepped back a little way , till he was out of earshot , and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle , spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight , sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire -- which they were busy rekindling -- and the house , from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast . 
`` So , Jim , '' said the doctor sadly , `` here you are . 
As you have brewed , so shall you drink , my boy . 
Heaven knows , I can not find it in my heart to blame you , but this much I will say , be it kind or unkind : when Captain Smollett was well , you dared not have gone off ; and when he was ill and could n't help it , by George , it was downright cowardly ! '' 
I will own that I here began to weep . 
`` Doctor , '' I said , `` you might spare me . 
I have blamed myself enough ; my life 's forfeit anyway , and I should have been dead by now if Silver had n't stood for me ; and doctor , believe this , I can die -- and I dare say I deserve it -- but what I fear is torture . 
If they come to torture me -- '' `` Jim , '' the doctor interrupted , and his voice was quite changed , `` Jim , I ca n't have this . 
Whip over , and we 'll run for it . '' 
`` Doctor , '' said I , `` I passed my word . '' 
`` I know , I know , '' he cried . 
`` We ca n't help that , Jim , now . 
I 'll take it on my shoulders , holus bolus , blame and shame , my boy ; but stay here , I can not let you . 
Jump ! 
One jump , and you 're out , and we 'll run for it like antelopes . '' 
`` No , '' I replied ; `` you know right well you would n't do the thing yourself -- neither you nor squire nor captain ; and no more will I. Silver trusted me ; I passed my word , and back I go . 
But , doctor , you did not let me finish . 
If they come to torture me , I might let slip a word of where the ship is , for I got the ship , part by luck and part by risking , and she lies in North Inlet , on the southern beach , and just below high water . 
At half tide she must be high and dry . '' 
`` The ship ! '' 
exclaimed the doctor . 
Rapidly I described to him my adventures , and he heard me out in silence . 
`` There is a kind of fate in this , '' he observed when I had done . 
`` Every step , it 's you that saves our lives ; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours ? 
That would be a poor return , my boy . 
You found out the plot ; you found Ben Gunn -- the best deed that ever you did , or will do , though you live to ninety . 
Oh , by Jupiter , and talking of Ben Gunn ! 
Why , this is the mischief in person . 
Silver ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Silver ! 
I 'll give you a piece of advice , '' he continued as the cook drew near again ; `` do n't you be in any great hurry after that treasure . '' 
`` Why , sir , I do my possible , which that ai n't , '' said Silver . 
`` I can only , asking your pardon , save my life and the boy 's by seeking for that treasure ; and you may lay to that . '' 
`` Well , Silver , '' replied the doctor , `` if that is so , I 'll go one step further : look out for squalls when you find it . '' 
`` Sir , '' said Silver , `` as between man and man , that 's too much and too little . 
What you 're after , why you left the block house , why you given me that there chart , I do n't know , now , do I ? 
And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope ! 
But no , this here 's too much . 
If you wo n't tell me what you mean plain out , just say so and I 'll leave the helm . '' 
`` No , '' said the doctor musingly ; `` I 've no right to say more ; it 's not my secret , you see , Silver , or , I give you my word , I 'd tell it you . 
But I 'll go as far with you as I dare go , and a step beyond , for I 'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I 'm mistaken ! 
And first , I 'll give you a bit of hope ; Silver , if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap , I 'll do my best to save you , short of perjury . '' 
Silver 's face was radiant . 
`` You could n't say more , I 'm sure , sir , not if you was my mother , '' he cried . 
`` Well , that 's my first concession , '' added the doctor . 
`` My second is a piece of advice : keep the boy close beside you , and when you need help , halloo . 
I 'm off to seek it for you , and that itself will show you if I speak at random . 
Good-bye , Jim . '' 
And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade , nodded to Silver , and set off at a brisk pace into the wood . 
`` JIM , '' said Silver when we were alone , `` if I saved your life , you saved mine ; and I 'll not forget it . 
I seen the doctor waving you to run for it -- with the tail of my eye , I did ; and I seen you say no , as plain as hearing . 
Jim , that 's one to you . 
This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed , and I owe it you . 
And now , Jim , we 're to go in for this here treasure-hunting , with sealed orders too , and I do n't like it ; and you and me must stick close , back to back like , and we 'll save our necks in spite o ' fate and fortune . '' 
Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready , and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk . 
They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox , and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward , and even there not without precaution . 
In the same wasteful spirit , they had cooked , I suppose , three times more than we could eat ; and one of them , with an empty laugh , threw what was left into the fire , which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel . 
I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow ; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing ; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries , though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it , I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign . 
Even Silver , eating away , with Captain Flint upon his shoulder , had not a word of blame for their recklessness . 
And this the more surprised me , for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then . 
`` Aye , mates , '' said he , `` it 's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head . 
I got what I wanted , I did . 
Sure enough , they have the ship . 
Where they have it , I do n't know yet ; but once we hit the treasure , we 'll have to jump about and find out . 
And then , mates , us that has the boats , I reckon , has the upper hand . '' 
Thus he kept running on , with his mouth full of the hot bacon ; thus he restored their hope and confidence , and , I more than suspect , repaired his own at the same time . 
`` As for hostage , '' he continued , `` that 's his last talk , I guess , with them he loves so dear . 
I 've got my piece o ' news , and thanky to him for that ; but it 's over and done . 
I 'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting , for we 'll keep him like so much gold , in case of accidents , you mark , and in the meantime . 
Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions , why then we 'll talk Mr. Hawkins over , we will , and we 'll give him his share , to be sure , for all his kindness . '' 
It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now . 
For my part , I was horribly cast down . 
Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible , Silver , already doubly a traitor , would not hesitate to adopt it . 
He had still a foot in either camp , and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging , which was the best he had to hope on our side . 
Nay , and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey , even then what danger lay before us ! 
What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life -- he a cripple and I a boy -- against five strong and active seamen ! 
Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends , their unexplained desertion of the stockade , their inexplicable cession of the chart , or harder still to understand , the doctor 's last warning to Silver , `` Look out for squalls when you find it , '' and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure . 
We made a curious figure , had anyone been there to see us -- all in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth . 
Silver had two guns slung about him -- one before and one behind -- besides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat . 
To complete his strange appearance , Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk . 
I had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook , who held the loose end of the rope , now in his free hand , now between his powerful teeth . 
For all the world , I was led like a dancing bear . 
The other men were variously burthened , some carrying picks and shovels -- for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the HISPANIOLA -- others laden with pork , bread , and brandy for the midday meal . 
All the stores , I observed , came from our stock , and I could see the truth of Silver 's words the night before . 
Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor , he and his mutineers , deserted by the ship , must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting . 
Water would have been little to their taste ; a sailor is not usually a good shot ; and besides all that , when they were so short of eatables , it was not likely they would be very flush of powder . 
Well , thus equipped , we all set out -- even the fellow with the broken head , who should certainly have kept in shadow -- and straggled , one after another , to the beach , where the two gigs awaited us . 
Even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates , one in a broken thwart , and both in their muddy and unbailed condition . 
Both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety ; and so , with our numbers divided between them , we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage . 
As we pulled over , there was some discussion on the chart . 
The red cross was , of course , far too large to be a guide ; and the terms of the note on the back , as you will hear , admitted of some ambiguity . 
They ran , the reader may remember , thus : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet . 
A tall tree was thus the principal mark . 
Now , right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high , adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough , cliffy eminence called the Mizzen-mast Hill . 
The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height . 
Every here and there , one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours , and which of these was the particular `` tall tree '' of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot , and by the readings of the compass . 
Yet , although that was the case , every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over , Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there . 
We pulled easily , by Silver 's directions , not to weary the hands prematurely , and after quite a long passage , landed at the mouth of the second river -- that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass . 
Thence , bending to our left , we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau . 
At the first outset , heavy , miry ground and a matted , marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress ; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot , and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order . 
It was , indeed , a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching . 
A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass . 
Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines ; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others . 
The air , besides , was fresh and stirring , and this , under the sheer sunbeams , was a wonderful refreshment to our senses . 
The party spread itself abroad , in a fan shape , shouting and leaping to and fro . 
About the centre , and a good way behind the rest , Silver and I followed -- I tethered by my rope , he ploughing , with deep pants , among the sliding gravel . 
From time to time , indeed , I had to lend him a hand , or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill . 
We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud , as if in terror . 
Shout after shout came from him , and the others began to run in his direction . 
`` He ca n't ' a found the treasure , '' said old Morgan , hurrying past us from the right , `` for that 's clean a-top . '' 
Indeed , as we found when we also reached the spot , it was something very different . 
At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper , which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones , a human skeleton lay , with a few shreds of clothing , on the ground . 
I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart . 
`` He was a seaman , '' said George Merry , who , bolder than the rest , had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing . 
`` Leastways , this is good sea-cloth . '' 
`` Aye , aye , '' said Silver ; `` like enough ; you would n't look to find a bishop here , I reckon . 
But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie ? 
` Tai n't in natur ' . '' 
Indeed , on a second glance , it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position . 
But for some disarray -LRB- the work , perhaps , of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains -RRB- the man lay perfectly straight -- his feet pointing in one direction , his hands , raised above his head like a diver 's , pointing directly in the opposite . 
`` I 've taken a notion into my old numbskull , '' observed Silver . 
`` Here 's the compass ; there 's the tip-top p ` int o ' Skeleton Island , stickin ' out like a tooth . 
Just take a bearing , will you , along the line of them bones . '' 
It was done . 
The body pointed straight in the direction of the island , and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E. `` I thought so , '' cried the cook ; `` this here is a p ` inter . 
Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars . 
But , by thunder ! 
If it do n't make me cold inside to think of Flint . 
This is one of HIS jokes , and no mistake . 
Him and these six was alone here ; he killed 'em , every man ; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass , shiver my timbers ! 
They 're long bones , and the hair 's been yellow . 
Aye , that would be Allardyce . 
You mind Allardyce , Tom Morgan ? '' 
`` Aye , aye , '' returned Morgan ; `` I mind him ; he owed me money , he did , and took my knife ashore with him . '' 
`` Speaking of knives , '' said another , `` why do n't we find his 'n lying round ? 
Flint war n't the man to pick a seaman 's pocket ; and the birds , I guess , would leave it be . '' 
`` By the powers , and that 's true ! '' 
cried Silver . 
`` There ai n't a thing left here , '' said Merry , still feeling round among the bones ; `` not a copper doit nor a baccy box . 
It do n't look nat ` ral to me . '' 
`` No , by gum , it do n't , '' agreed Silver ; `` not nat ` ral , nor not nice , says you . 
Great guns ! 
Messmates , but if Flint was living , this would be a hot spot for you and me . 
Six they were , and six are we ; and bones is what they are now . '' 
`` I saw him dead with these here deadlights , '' said Morgan . 
`` Billy took me in . 
There he laid , with penny-pieces on his eyes . '' 
`` Dead -- aye , sure enough he 's dead and gone below , '' said the fellow with the bandage ; `` but if ever sperrit walked , it would be Flint 's . 
Dear heart , but he died bad , did Flint ! '' 
`` Aye , that he did , '' observed another ; `` now he raged , and now he hollered for the rum , and now he sang . 
` Fifteen Men ' were his only song , mates ; and I tell you true , I never rightly liked to hear it since . 
It was main hot , and the windy was open , and I hear that old song comin ' out as clear as clear -- and the death-haul on the man already . '' 
`` Come , come , '' said Silver ; `` stow this talk . 
He 's dead , and he do n't walk , that I know ; leastways , he wo n't walk by day , and you may lay to that . 
Care killed a cat . 
Fetch ahead for the doubloons . '' 
We started , certainly ; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight , the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood , but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath . 
The terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits . 
PARTLY from the damping influence of this alarm , partly to rest Silver and the sick folk , the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent . 
The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west , this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand . 
Before us , over the tree-tops , we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf ; behind , we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island , but saw -- clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands -- a great field of open sea upon the east . 
Sheer above us rose the Spyglass , here dotted with single pines , there black with precipices . 
There was no sound but that of the distant breakers , mounting from all round , and the chirp of countless insects in the brush . 
Not a man , not a sail , upon the sea ; the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude . 
Silver , as he sat , took certain bearings with his compass . 
`` There are three ` tall trees ' '' said he , `` about in the right line from Skeleton Island . 
` Spy-glass shoulder , ' I take it , means that lower p ` int there . 
It 's child 's play to find the stuff now . 
I 've half a mind to dine first . '' 
`` I do n't feel sharp , '' growled Morgan . 
`` Thinkin ' o ' Flint -- I think it were -- as done me . '' 
`` Ah , well , my son , you praise your stars he 's dead , '' said Silver . 
`` He were an ugly devil , '' cried a third pirate with a shudder ; `` that blue in the face too ! '' 
`` That was how the rum took him , '' added Merry . 
`` Blue ! 
Well , I reckon he was blue . 
That 's a true word . '' 
Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought , they had spoken lower and lower , and they had almost got to whispering by now , so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood . 
All of a sudden , out of the middle of the trees in front of us , a thin , high , trembling voice struck up the well-known air and words : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! '' 
I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates . 
The colour went from their six faces like enchantment ; some leaped to their feet , some clawed hold of others ; Morgan grovelled on the ground . 
`` It 's Flint , by -- ! '' 
cried Merry . 
The song had stopped as suddenly as it began -- broken off , you would have said , in the middle of a note , as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer 's mouth . 
Coming through the clear , sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops , I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly ; and the effect on my companions was the stranger . 
`` Come , '' said Silver , struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out ; `` this wo n't do . 
Stand by to go about . 
This is a rum start , and I ca n't name the voice , but it 's someone skylarking -- someone that 's flesh and blood , and you may lay to that . '' 
His courage had come back as he spoke , and some of the colour to his face along with it . 
Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves , when the same voice broke out again -- not this time singing , but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass . 
`` Darby M'Graw , '' it wailed -- for that is the word that best describes the sound -- `` Darby M'Graw ! 
Darby M'Graw ! '' 
again and again and again ; and then rising a little higher , and with an oath that I leave out : `` Fetch aft the rum , Darby ! '' 
The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground , their eyes starting from their heads . 
Long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence , dreadfully , before them . 
`` That fixes it ! '' 
gasped one . 
`` Let 's go . '' 
`` They was his last words , '' moaned Morgan , `` his last words above board . '' 
Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly . 
He had been well brought up , had Dick , before he came to sea and fell among bad companions . 
Still Silver was unconquered . 
I could hear his teeth rattle in his head , but he had not yet surrendered . 
`` Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby , '' he muttered ; `` not one but us that 's here . '' 
And then , making a great effort : `` Shipmates , '' he cried , `` I 'm here to get that stuff , and I 'll not be beat by man or devil . 
I never was feared of Flint in his life , and , by the powers , I 'll face him dead . 
There 's seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here . 
When did ever a gentleman o ' fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug -- and him dead too ? '' 
But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers , rather , indeed , of growing terror at the irreverence of his words . 
`` Belay there , John ! '' 
said Merry . 
`` Do n't you cross a sperrit . '' 
And the rest were all too terrified to reply . 
They would have run away severally had they dared ; but fear kept them together , and kept them close by John , as if his daring helped them . 
He , on his part , had pretty well fought his weakness down . 
`` Sperrit ? 
Well , maybe , '' he said . 
`` But there 's one thing not clear to me . 
There was an echo . 
Now , no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow ; well then , what 's he doing with an echo to him , I should like to know ? 
That ai n't in natur ' , surely ? '' 
This argument seemed weak enough to me . 
But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious , and to my wonder , George Merry was greatly relieved . 
`` Well , that 's so , '' he said . 
`` You 've a head upon your shoulders , John , and no mistake . 
` Bout ship , mates ! 
This here crew is on a wrong tack , I do believe . 
And come to think on it , it was like Flint 's voice , I grant you , but not just so clear-away like it , after all . 
It was liker somebody else 's voice now -- it was liker -- '' `` By the powers , Ben Gunn ! '' 
roared Silver . 
`` Aye , and so it were , '' cried Morgan , springing on his knees . 
`` Ben Gunn it were ! '' 
`` It do n't make much odds , do it , now ? '' 
asked Dick . 
`` Ben Gunn 's not here in the body any more 'n Flint . '' 
But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn . 
`` Why , nobody minds Ben Gunn , '' cried Merry ; `` dead or alive , nobody minds him . '' 
It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces . 
Soon they were chatting together , with intervals of listening ; and not long after , hearing no further sound , they shouldered the tools and set forth again , Merry walking first with Silver 's compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island . 
He had said the truth : dead or alive , nobody minded Ben Gunn . 
Dick alone still held his Bible , and looked around him as he went , with fearful glances ; but he found no sympathy , and Silver even joked him on his precautions . 
`` I told you , '' said he -- `` I told you you had sp ` iled your Bible . 
If it ai n't no good to swear by , what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it ? 
Not that ! '' 
and he snapped his big fingers , halting a moment on his crutch . 
But Dick was not to be comforted ; indeed , it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick ; hastened by heat , exhaustion , and the shock of his alarm , the fever , predicted by Dr. Livesey , was evidently growing swiftly higher . 
It was fine open walking here , upon the summit ; our way lay a little downhill , for , as I have said , the plateau tilted towards the west . 
The pines , great and small , grew wide apart ; and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea , wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine . 
Striking , as we did , pretty near north-west across the island , we drew , on the one hand , ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass , and on the other , looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the coracle . 
The first of the tall trees was reached , and by the bearings proved the wrong one . 
So with the second . 
The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood -- a giant of a vegetable , with a red column as big as a cottage , and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred . 
It was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart . 
But it was not its size that now impressed my companions ; it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow . 
The thought of the money , as they drew nearer , swallowed up their previous terrors . 
Their eyes burned in their heads ; their feet grew speedier and lighter ; their whole soul was bound up in that fortune , that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure , that lay waiting there for each of them . 
Silver hobbled , grunting , on his crutch ; his nostrils stood out and quivered ; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance ; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look . 
Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts , and certainly I read them like print . 
In the immediate nearness of the gold , all else had been forgotten : his promise and the doctor 's warning were both things of the past , and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure , find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night , cut every honest throat about that island , and sail away as he had at first intended , laden with crimes and riches . 
Shaken as I was with these alarms , it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters . 
Now and again I stumbled , and it was then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances . 
Dick , who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear , was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising . 
This also added to my wretchedness , and to crown all , I was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau , when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face -- he who died at Savannah , singing and shouting for drink -- had there , with his own hand , cut down his six accomplices . 
This grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries , I thought ; and even with the thought I could believe I heard it ringing still . 
We were now at the margin of the thicket . 
`` Huzza , mates , all together ! '' 
shouted Merry ; and the foremost broke into a run . 
And suddenly , not ten yards further , we beheld them stop . 
A low cry arose . 
Silver doubled his pace , digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed ; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead halt . 
Before us was a great excavation , not very recent , for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom . 
In this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn around . 
On one of these boards I saw , branded with a hot iron , the name WALRUS -- the name of Flint 's ship . 
All was clear to probation . 
The CACHE had been found and rifled ; the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone ! 
THERE never was such an overturn in this world . 
Each of these six men was as though he had been struck . 
But with Silver the blow passed almost instantly . 
Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch , like a racer , on that money ; well , he was brought up , in a single second , dead ; and he kept his head , found his temper , and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment . 
`` Jim , '' he whispered , `` take that , and stand by for trouble . '' 
And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol . 
At the same time , he began quietly moving northward , and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five . 
Then he looked at me and nodded , as much as to say , `` Here is a narrow corner , '' as , indeed , I thought it was . 
His looks were not quite friendly , and I was so revolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering , `` So you 've changed sides again . '' 
There was no time left for him to answer in . 
The buccaneers , with oaths and cries , began to leap , one after another , into the pit and to dig with their fingers , throwing the boards aside as they did so . 
Morgan found a piece of gold . 
He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths . 
It was a two-guinea piece , and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute . 
`` Two guineas ! '' 
roared Merry , shaking it at Silver . 
`` That 's your seven hundred thousand pounds , is it ? 
You 're the man for bargains , ai n't you ? 
You 're him that never bungled nothing , you wooden-headed lubber ! '' 
`` Dig away , boys , '' said Silver with the coolest insolence ; `` you 'll find some pig-nuts and I should n't wonder . '' 
`` Pig-nuts ! '' 
repeated Merry , in a scream . 
`` Mates , do you hear that ? 
I tell you now , that man there knew it all along . 
Look in the face of him and you 'll see it wrote there . '' 
`` Ah , Merry , '' remarked Silver , `` standing for cap'n again ? 
You 're a pushing lad , to be sure . '' 
But this time everyone was entirely in Merry 's favour . 
They began to scramble out of the excavation , darting furious glances behind them . 
One thing I observed , which looked well for us : they all got out upon the opposite side from Silver . 
Well , there we stood , two on one side , five on the other , the pit between us , and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow . 
Silver never moved ; he watched them , very upright on his crutch , and looked as cool as ever I saw him . 
He was brave , and no mistake . 
At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters . 
`` Mates , '' says he , `` there 's two of them alone there ; one 's the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this ; the other 's that cub that I mean to have the heart of . 
Now , mates -- '' He was raising his arm and his voice , and plainly meant to lead a charge . 
But just then -- crack ! 
crack ! 
crack ! 
-- three musket-shots flashed out of the thicket . 
Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation ; the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side , where he lay dead , but still twitching ; and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might . 
Before you could wink , Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling Merry , and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony , `` George , '' said he , `` I reckon I settled you . '' 
At the same moment , the doctor , Gray , and Ben Gunn joined us , with smoking muskets , from among the nutmeg-trees . 
`` Forward ! '' 
cried the doctor . 
`` Double quick , my lads . 
We must head 'em off the boats . '' 
And we set off at a great pace , sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest . 
I tell you , but Silver was anxious to keep up with us . 
The work that man went through , leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst , was work no sound man ever equalled ; and so thinks the doctor . 
As it was , he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope . 
`` Doctor , '' he hailed , `` see there ! 
No hurry ! '' 
Sure enough there was no hurry . 
In a more open part of the plateau , we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started , right for Mizzenmast Hill . 
We were already between them and the boats ; and so we four sat down to breathe , while Long John , mopping his face , came slowly up with us . 
`` Thank ye kindly , doctor , '' says he . 
`` You came in in about the nick , I guess , for me and Hawkins . 
And so it 's you , Ben Gunn ! '' 
he added . 
`` Well , you 're a nice one , to be sure . '' 
`` I 'm Ben Gunn , I am , '' replied the maroon , wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment . 
`` And , '' he added , after a long pause , `` how do , Mr. Silver ? 
Pretty well , I thank ye , says you . '' 
`` Ben , Ben , '' murmured Silver , `` to think as you 've done me ! '' 
The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted , in their flight , by the mutineers , and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying , related in a few words what had taken place . 
It was a story that profoundly interested Silver ; and Ben Gunn , the half-idiot maroon , was the hero from beginning to end . 
Ben , in his long , lonely wanderings about the island , had found the skeleton -- it was he that had rifled it ; he had found the treasure ; he had dug it up -LRB- it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation -RRB- ; he had carried it on his back , in many weary journeys , from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island , and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA . 
When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack , and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted , he had gone to Silver , given him the chart , which was now useless -- given him the stores , for Ben Gunn 's cave was well supplied with goats ' meat salted by himself -- given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill , there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money . 
`` As for you , Jim , '' he said , `` it went against my heart , but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty ; and if you were not one of these , whose fault was it ? '' 
That morning , finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers , he had run all the way to the cave , and leaving the squire to guard the captain , had taken Gray and the maroon and started , making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine . 
Soon , however , he saw that our party had the start of him ; and Ben Gunn , being fleet of foot , had been dispatched in front to do his best alone . 
Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates , and he was so far successful that Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure-hunters . 
`` Ah , '' said Silver , `` it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here . 
You would have let old John be cut to bits , and never given it a thought , doctor . '' 
`` Not a thought , '' replied Dr. Livesey cheerily . 
And by this time we had reached the gigs . 
The doctor , with the pick-axe , demolished one of them , and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet . 
This was a run of eight or nine miles . 
Silver , though he was almost killed already with fatigue , was set to an oar , like the rest of us , and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea . 
Soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island , round which , four days ago , we had towed the HISPANIOLA . 
As we passed the two-pointed hill , we could see the black mouth of Ben Gunn 's cave and a figure standing by it , leaning on a musket .
