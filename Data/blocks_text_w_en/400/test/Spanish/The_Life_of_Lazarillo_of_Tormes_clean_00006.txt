I left them quarreling and went to the tailor 's wife 's house . 
She had told me to be there at eleven because she had to go to dinner at a friend 's house . 
When she saw how ragged I looked , she shouted at me , `` Do you think you 're going to earn my money and escort me like a picaro ? 
I could have another squire with stylish trousers , breeches , a cape and hat , for less than I pay you . 
And you 're always getting drunk on what I give you . '' 
What do you mean , getting drunk ? 
I thought to myself . 
With seventy coppers that I make a day , at most ? 
And many days my mistresses do n't even leave their houses just so that they wo n't have to pay me a cent . 
The tailor 's wife had them stitch together the pieces of my cloak , and they were in such a hurry that they put some of the pieces on top that belonged on the bottom . 
And that 's the way I went with her . 
We went flying along like a friar who has been invited out to dinner because the lady was afraid there would n't be enough left for her . 
We reached her friend 's house , and inside were other women who had been invited , too . 
They asked my mistress if I would be able to guard the door ; she told them I could . 
They said to me , `` Stay here , brother . 
Today you 'll eat like a king . '' 
Many gallant young men came , each one pulling something out of his pocket : this one a partridge , that one a hen ; one took out a rabbit , another one a couple of pigeons ; this one a little mutton , that one a piece of loin ; and someone brought out sausage or blackpudding . 
One of them even took out a pie worth a silver piece , wrapped up in his handkerchief . 
They gave it to the cook , and in the meantime they were frolicking around with the ladies , romping with them like donkeys in a new field of rye . 
It is n't right for me to tell what happened there or for the reader to even imagine it . 
After these rituals there came the victuals . 
The ladies ate the Aves , and the young men drank the ite misa est . 
Everything left on the table the ladies wrapped in their handkerchiefs and put in their pockets . 
Then the men pulled the dessert out of theirs : some , apples ; others , cheese ; some , olives ; and one of them , who was the cock of the walk and the one who was fooling with the tailor 's wife , brought out a half-pound of candied fruit . 
I really liked that way of keeping your meal so close , in case you need it . 
And I decided right then that I would put three or four pockets on the first pair of pants God would give me , and one of them would be of good leather , sewn up well enough to pour soup into . 
Because if those gentlemen who were so rich and important brought everything in their pockets and the ladies carried things that were cooked in theirs , I -- who was only a whore 's squire -- could do it , too . 
We servants went to eat , and there was n't a damned thing left for us but soup and bread sops , and I was amazed to see that those ladies had n't stuck that up their sleeves . 
We had barely begun when we heard a tremendous uproar in the hall where our masters were : they were referring to their mothers and discussing what sort of men their fathers had been . 
They left off talking and started swinging , and since variety is necessary in everything , there was hitting , slapping , pinching , kicking , and biting . 
They were grabbing one another 's hair and pulling it out ; they pounded each other so much you would think they were village boys in a religious procession . 
As far as I could find out , the quarrel broke out because some of the men did n't want to give or pay those women anything : they said that what the women had eaten was enough . 
It happened that some law officers were coming up the street , and they heard the noise and knocked on the door and called out , `` Open up , in the name of the law ! '' 
When they heard this , some of the people inside ran one way , and others another way . 
Some left behind their cloaks , and others their swords , one left her shoes , another her veil . 
So they all disappeared , and each one hid as best he could . 
I had no reason to run away , so I stood there , and since I was the doorman , I opened the door so they would n't accuse me of resisting the law . 
The first officer who came in grabbed me by the collar and said I was under arrest . 
When they had me in their hands , they locked the door and went looking for the people who had been making all the noise . 
There was no bedroom , dressing room , basement , wine cellar , attic , or privy they did n't look in . 
Since the officers did n't find anyone , they took my statement . 
I confessed from A to Z about everyone at the gathering and what they had done . 
The officers were amazed , since there were as many as I 'd said , that not one of them had turned up . 
To tell the truth , I was amazed , too , because there had been twelve men and six women . 
Simple as I was , I told them -LRB- and I really believed it -RRB- that I thought all the people who had been there and made that noise were goblins . 
They laughed at me , and the constable asked his men who had been to the wine cellar if they 'd looked everywhere carefully . 
They said they had , but not satisfied with this , he made them light a torch , and when they went in the door they saw a cask rolling around . 
The officers were terrified , and they started to run away , crying , `` For God 's sake , that fellow was right ; there are nothing but spooks here ! '' 
The constable was shrewder , and he stopped the officers , saying he was n't afraid of the Devil himself . 
Then he went over to the cask and took off the lid , and inside he found a man and a woman . 
I do n't want to tell how he found them so I wo n't offend the pure ears of the wholesome , high-minded reader . 
I will only say that the violence of their movements had made the cask roll around and was the cause of their misfortune and of showing in public what they were doing in private . 
The officers pulled them out : he looked like Cupid with his arrow , and she like Venus with her quiver . 
Both of them were as naked as the day they were born because , when the officers had knocked , they were in bed , kissing the holy relics , and with the alarm they did n't have a chance to pick up their clothes . 
And , to hide , they had climbed into that empty cask , where they continued their devout exercise . 
Everyone stood there , agape at the beauty of these two . 
Then they threw two cloaks over them and put them in the custody of two officers , and they started looking for the others . 
The constable discovered a large earthen jug filled with oil , and inside he found a man fully dressed and up to his chest in the oil . 
As soon as they saw him he tried to jump out , but he did n't do it so agilely that the jug and he both did n't tip over . 
The oil flew out and covered the officers from head to foot , staining them without any respect . 
They stood there cursing the job and the whore who taught it to them . 
The oiled man saw that instead of grabbing him they were avoiding him like the plague , and he began to run away . 
The constable shouted , `` Stop him ! 
Stop him ! '' 
But they all made room for him to go past . 
He went out a back door , pissing oil . 
What he wrung from his clothes he used to light the lamp of Our Lady of Afflictions for more than a month . 
The law officers stood there , bathed in oil , and cursing whoever had brought them to the place . 
And so was I , because they said I was the pander and they were going to tar and feather me . 
They went out like fritters from the frying pan , leaving a trail wherever they walked . 
They were so irate that they swore to God and to the four holy Gospels that they would hang everyone they found . 
We prisoners trembled . 
They went over to the storeroom to look for the others . 
They went in , and from the top of a door a bag of flour was poured down on them , blinding them all . 
They shouted , `` Stop , in the name of the law ! '' 
If they tried to open their eyes , they were immediately closed up with flour and water . 
The men holding us let go so they could help the constable who was yelling like a madman . 
They had hardly gotten inside when their eyes were covered with flour and water , too . 
They were wandering around like they were playing blindman 's bluff , bumping into and clouting each other so much they broke their jaws and teeth . 
When we saw that the officers were done in , we threw ourselves on them , and they attacked each other so wildly that they fell , exhausted , to the floor while blows and kicks rained and hailed down on top of them . 
Finally , they did n't shout or move any more than dead men . 
If one of them tried to open his mouth , it was immediately filled with flour and stuffed like a capon at a poultry farm . 
We bound their hands and feet and carried them along like hogs to the wine cellar . 
We threw them in the oil like fish to be fried , and they squirmed around like pigs in a mire . 
Then we locked up the doors , and we all went home . 
The owner of that one had been in the country , and when he came back he found the doors locked and that no one answered when he called . 
A niece of his had loaned out his house for that feast , and she had gone back to her father 's , afraid of what her uncle would do . 
The man had the doors unlocked , and when he saw his house sown with flour and anointed with oil , he flew into a rage and began shouting like a drunkard . 
He went to the wine cellar and found his oil spilled all over and the law officers wallowing in it . 
He was so angry to see his home devastated that he picked up a cudgel and hammered away on the constable and the officers , leaving them half dead . 
He called his neighbors over , and they helped drag them out to the street , and there boys threw mud , garbage , and filth on the officers and the constable . 
They were so full of flour no one recognized them . 
When they came to and found themselves in the street , free , they took to their heels . 
Then people could very well have said , `` Stop the name of the law - - it 's running away ! '' 
They left behind their cloaks , swords , and daggers and did n't dare go back for them so that no one would find out what had happened . 
The owner of the house kept everything that was left behind as compensation for the damage that had been done . 
When I came out , ready to leave , I found a cloak that was n't at all bad , and I took it and left mine there . 
I thanked God I had come out ahead this time -LRB- something new for me -RRB- , since I was always getting the short end of things . 
I went to the house of the tailor 's wife . 
I found the house in an uproar , and the tailor , her husband , was thrashing her with a stick for having come back alone without her veil or shoes and for running down the street with more than a hundred boys after her . 
I got there at just the right time because , as soon as the tailor saw me , he left his wife and sailed into me with a blow that finished off the few teeth I still had . 
Then he kicked me ten or twelve times in the belly , and that made me throw up what little I had eaten . 
`` You damned pimp ! '' 
he cried . 
`` You mean you 're not ashamed to come back to my house ? 
I 'll give you enough payment to settle every score -- past and present . '' 
He called his servants , and they brought a blanket and tossed me in it to their own pleasure , which was my grief . 
They left me for dead and laid me out on a bench like that . 
It was nighttime when I recovered my senses , and I tried to get up and walk . 
But I fell to the ground and broke an arm . 
The next morning I made my way to the door of a church , little by little , and there I begged with a pitiful voice from the people going in . 
Stretched out at the door of the church and reviewing my past life , I thought over the misery I had gone through from the day I began to serve the blind man down to the present . 
And I came to the conclusion that even if a man always rises early , that does n't make dawn come any earlier , and if you work hard , that wo n't necessarily make you rich . 
And there 's a saying that goes like this : `` The early riser fails where God 's help succeeds . '' 
I put myself in His hands so that the end would be better than the beginning and the middle had been . 
A venerable , white-bearded hermit was next to me with his staff and a rosary in his hand , and at the end of the rosary hung a skull the size of a rabbit 's . 
When the good Father saw me in such misery he began to console me with kind , soft words , and he asked me where I was from and what had happened to bring me to such a pitiful state . 
I told him very briefly the long process of my bitter pilgrimage . 
He was astonished by what I said and showed his pity on me by inviting me to his hermitage . 
I accepted the invitation , and as well as I could -LRB- which was n't painlessly -RRB- I reached the oratory with him , a few miles from there , in the side of a hill . 
Attached to it was a little house with a bedroom and a bed . 
In the patio was a cistern with fresh water , and it was used to water a garden -- neater and better cared for than it was large . 
`` I have been living here , '' said the good old man , `` for twenty years , apart from the commotion and anxiety of man . 
This , brother , is earthly paradise . 
Here I contemplate both divine and human matters . 
Here I fast when I am well fed , and I eat when I am hungry . 
Here I stay awake when I ca n't sleep , and I sleep when I grow tired . 
Here I have solitude when no one is with me , and I have company when I am not alone . 
Here I sing when I am happy , and I cry when I am sad . 
Here I work when I 'm not idle , and I am idle when I do n't work . 
Here I think about my past bad life , and I contemplate the good one I have now . 
And , finally , here nothing is known , and the knowledge of all things is attained . '' 
I rejoiced in my heart to listen to the cunning hermit , and I begged him to tell me about hermit life , since it seemed to be the best in the world . 
`` What do you mean , the best ? '' 
he answered . 
`` Only a person who has enjoyed it can know how good it really is . 
But we do n't have time to speak further of this because it 's time to have dinner . '' 
I begged him to heal my arm because it hurt very much . 
He did it so easily that from then on it never bothered me . 
We ate like kings and drank like Germans . 
After the meal was over , and while we were taking an afternoon nap , my good hermit began to shout , `` I 'm dying ! 
I 'm dying ! '' 
I got up and saw that he looked like he was about to breathe his last . 
And I asked him if he really was dying . 
`` Yes , yes , yes ! '' 
he answered . 
And still repeating `` yes , '' he died an hour later . 
But at the time he told me that , I was very upset . 
I realized that if the man died without witnesses , people might say I had killed him , and it would cost me the life I had kept up with such hard work . 
And it would n't take very weighty witnesses for that because I looked more like a robber than an honest man . 
I immediately ran out of the hermitage to see if anyone was around who could be a witness to the old man 's death . 
I looked everywhere and saw a flock of sheep nearby . 
I quickly -LRB- although painfully because of the beating I had gotten in the tailor skirmish -RRB- went toward it . 
I found six or seven shepherds and four or five shepherdesses resting in the shade of some willows , next to a shining , clear spring . 
The men were playing instruments and the women were singing . 
Some were capering , others were dancing . 
One of the men was holding a woman 's hand , another was resting with his head on a woman 's lap . 
And they were spending the heat of the day wooing each other with sweet words . 
I ran up to them , terrified , and begged them to come with me right away because the old hermit was dying . 
Some of them came along while others stayed behind to watch over the sheep . 
They went into the hermitage and asked the good hermit if he was approaching death . 
He said , `` Yes '' -LRB- but that was a lie because he was n't going anywhere : it was death that was approaching him , and against his will -RRB- . 
When I saw that he was still in his rut about saying yes , I asked him if he wanted those shepherds to be witnesses for his last will and testament . 
He answered , `` Yes . '' 
I asked him if he was leaving me as his sole and lawful heir . 
He said , `` Yes . '' 
I went on , asking if he acknowledged and confessed that everything he possessed or might possess he was leaving to me for services and other things he had received from me . 
Again he said , `` Yes . '' 
I was wishing that would be the last noise he 'd make , but I saw that he still had a little breath left in him , and , so that he would n't do me any harm with it , I went on with my questions and had one of the shepherds write down everything he said . 
The shepherd wrote on a wall with a piece of coal since we did n't have an inkwell or a pen . 
I asked him if he wanted that shepherd to sign for him since he was in no position to do it himself , and he died , saying , `` Yes , yes , yes . '' 
We went ahead and buried him : we dug a grave in his garden -LRB- and did it all very quickly because I was afraid he might come back to life -RRB- . 
I invited the shepherds to have something to eat ; they did n't want to because it was time to feed their sheep . 
They went away , giving me their condolences . 
I locked the door of the hermitage and walked all around the inside . 
I found a huge jug of good wine , another one full of oil , and two crocks of honey . 
He had two sides of bacon , a good quantity of jerked beef , and some dried fruit . 
I liked all of this very much , but it was n't what I was looking for . 
I found his chests full of linens , and in the corner of one of them was a woman 's dress . 
This surprised me , but what surprised me even more was that such a well-provided man would n't have any money . 
I went to the grave to ask him where he had put it . 
It seemed to me that after I had asked him he answered : `` You stupid fellow . 
Do you think that living out here in the country the way I do , at the mercy of thieves and bandits , I would keep it in a coffer where I 'd be in danger of losing what I loved more than my own life ? '' 
It was as if I had really heard this inspiration from his mouth , and it made me look around in every corner . 
But when I did n't find anything , I thought : If I were going to hide money here so no one else could find it , where would I put it ? 
And I said to myself : In that altar . 
I went over to it and took the frontpiece of the altar off the pedestal , which was made of mud and clay . 
On one side I saw a crack that a silver coin could fit into . 
My blood started humming , and my heart began to flutter . 
I picked up a spade , and in less than two clouts I had half the altar on the ground , and I discovered the relics that were buried there . 
I found a jar full of coins . 
I counted them , and there were six hundred silver pieces . 
I was so overjoyed at the discovery that I thought I would die . 
I took the money out of there and dug a hole outside the hermitage where I buried it so that if they turned me out of there I would have what I loved most outside . 
When this was done I put on the hermit 's garb and went into town to tell the prior of the brotherhood what had happened . 
But first I did n't forget to put the altar back the way it had been before . 
I found all the members of the brotherhood that the hermitage depended on together there . 
The hermitage was dedicated to Saint Lazarus , and I thought that was a good sign for me . 
The members saw that I was already gray-haired and of an exemplary appearance , which is the most important part of positions like this . 
There was , however , one difficulty , and that was that I did n't have a beard . 
I had sheared it off such a short time before that it had n't yet sprung back . 
But even with this , seeing by the shepherds ' story that the dead man had left me as his heir , they turned the hermitage over to me . 
About this business of beards , I remember what a friar told me once : In his order , and even in the most reformed orders , they would n't make anyone a Superior unless he had a good beard . 
So it happened that some of them who were very capable of being in that position were excluded , and others who were woolly were given the position -LRB- as if good administration depended on hair and not on mature , capable understanding -RRB- . 
They warned me to live with the virtuous character and good reputation my predecessor had had , which was so great that everyone thought him a saint . 
I promised them I would live like a Hercules . 
They advised me to beg for alms only on Tuesdays and Saturdays because if I did it any other day the friars would punish me . 
I promised to do whatever they ordered me , and I especially did n't want to make enemies of them because I had previously experienced the taste of their hands . 
I began to beg for alms from door to door , with a low , humble , devout tone , the way I had learned in the blind man 's school . 
I did n't do this because I was in need , but because it 's the beggar 's character that the more they have the more they ask for and the more pleasure they get from doing it . 
The people who heard me calling , `` Alms for the candles of Saint Lazarus , '' and did n't recognize my voice , came out their doors and were astonished when they saw me . 
They asked me where Father Anselmo was -LRB- that was the name of the good old fellow -RRB- . 
I told them he had died . 
Some said , `` May he rest in peace , he was such a good man Others said , `` His soul is in the glory of God . '' 
And some , `` God bless the man whose life was like his : he ate nothing warm for six years . '' 
And others , `` He lived on bread and water . '' 
Some of the foolish pious women got down on their knees and called on the name of Father Anselmo . 
One asked me what I had done with his garb . 
I told her I was wearing it . 
She took out some scissors , and without saying what she wanted she began to cut a piece from the first part she found , which was the crotch . 
When I saw her going after that part , I started to shout because I thought she was trying to castrate me . 
When she saw how upset I was , she said , `` Do n't worry , brother . 
I want some relics from that blessed man , and I 'll pay you for the damage to your robe . '' 
`` Oh , '' some said , `` before six months are up they are certain to canonize him because he 's performed so many miracles . '' 
So many people came to see his grave that the house was always full , so I had to move the grave out to a shelter in front of the hermitage . 
From then on I did n't beg alms for the candles of Saint Lazarus , but for the blessed Father Anselmo . 
I have never understood this business of begging alms to light the candles of saints . 
But I do n't want to continue on this note because it will sound bad . 
I was n't at all interested in going to the city because I had everything I wanted at the hermitage . 
But , so no one could say I was rich and that 's why I did n't go out begging alms , I went the next day , and there something happened to me that you 'll find out if you read : Good fortune has more value than horse or mule ; for an unlucky man a sow will bear mongrels . 
Many times we see men rise from the dust of the earth , and without knowing how , they find themselves rich , honored , feared , and held in esteem . 
If you ask : Is this man wise ? 
They 'll tell you : Like a mule . 
Is he discreet ? 
Like an ass . 
Does he have any good qualities ? 
Those of a dunce . 
Well , how did he become so wealthy ? 
They 'll answer : It was the work of fortune . 
Other people , on the contrary , who are discreet , wise , prudent , with many good qualities , capable of ruling a kingdom , find themselves beaten down , cast aside , poor , and made into a rag for the whole world . 
If you ask why , they 'll tell you misfortune is always following them . 
And I think it was misfortune that was always pursuing and persecuting me , giving the world a sample and example of what it could do . 
Because since the world was made there has never been a man attacked so much by this damned fortune as I was . 
I was going down a street , begging alms for Saint Lazarus as usual , because in the city I did n't beg for the blessed Anselmo -- that was only for the naive and ignorant who came to touch the rosary at his grave , where they said many miracles took place . 
I went up to a door , and giving my usual cry I heard some people call me from a stairway , `` Why do n't you come up , Father ? 
Come on , come on , what are you doing , staying down there ? '' 
I started to climb the stairs , which were a little dark , and halfway up some women clasped me about the neck ; others held onto my hands and stuck theirs in my pockets And since we were in the dark , when one of the women reached for my pocket she hit upon my locket . 
She gave a cry , and said , ` What 's this ? '' 
I answered , `` A little bird that will come out if you touch it . '' 
They all asked why they had n't seen me for a week . 
When we reached the top of the stairs they saw me in the light from the windows , and they stood there looking at each other like wooden puppets . 
Then they burst out laughing and laughed so hard I wondered if they would ever stop . 
None of them could talk . 
The first to speak was a little boy who said , `` That is n't Daddy . '' 
After those bursts of laughter had subsided a little , the women -LRB- there were four of them -RRB- asked me what saint I was begging alms for . 
I told them for Saint Lazarus . 
`` Why are you begging for him ? '' 
they asked . 
`` Is n't Father Anselmo feeling well ? '' 
`` Well ? '' 
I answered . 
`` He does n't feel bad at all because a week ago he died . '' 
When they heard that , they burst into tears , and if the laughter had been loud before , their wailing was even louder . 
Some of them screamed , others pulled their hair , and with all of them carrying on together , their music was as grating as a choir of hoarse nuns . 
One of them said , `` What will I do . 
Oh , me ! 
Here I am without a husband , without protection , without consolation . 
Where will I go ? 
Who will help me ? 
What bitter news ! 
What a misfortune ! '' 
Another was lamenting with these words : `` Oh , my son-in-law and my lord ! 
How could you leave without saying good-by ? 
Oh , my little grandchildren , now you are orphans , abandoned ! 
Where is your good father ? '' 
The children were carrying the soprano of that unharmonious music . 
They were all crying and shouting , and there was nothing but weeping and wailing . 
When the water of that great deluge let up a little they asked me how and what he had died from . 
I told them about it and about the will he had made , leaving me as his lawful heir and successor . 
And then it all started . 
The tears turned into rage , their wails into curses , and their sighs into threats . 
`` You 're a thief , and you killed him to rob him , but you wo n't get away with it , '' said the youngest girl . 
`` That hermit was my husband , and these three children are his , and if you do n't give us all his property , we 'll have you hanged . 
And if the law does n't do it there are swords and daggers to kill you a thousand times if you had a thousand lives . '' 
I told them there were reliable witnesses there when he 'd made his will . 
`` That 's a pack of lies , '' they said . 
`` Because the day you say he died , he was here , and he told us he did n't have any company . '' 
When I realized that he had n't given his will to a notary , and that those women were threatening me , along with the experience I 'd had with the law and with lawsuits , I decided to be courteous to them . 
I wanted to try to get hold of what I would lose if it came into the hands of the law . 
Besides , the new widow 's tears had touched my heart . 
So I told them to calm down , they would n't lose anything with me ; that if I had accepted the inheritance , it was only because I did n't know the dead man was married -- in fact , I had never heard of hermits being married . 
Putting aside all their sadness and melancholy , they began to laugh , saying that it was easy to see that I was new and inexperienced in that position since I did n't know that when people talked about solitary hermits they did n't mean they had to give up the company of women . 
In fact , there was n't one who did n't have at least one woman to spend some time with after he was through contemplating , and together they would engage in active exercises -- so sometimes he would imitate Martha and other times Mary . 
Because they were people who had a better understanding of the will of God they knew that He does n't want man to be alone . 
So , like obedient sons , they have one or two women they maintain , even if it is by alms . 
`` And this one was especially obedient because he maintained four : this poor widow , me -LRB- her mother -RRB- , these two -LRB- her sisters -RRB- , and these three children who are his sons -LRB- or , at least , he considered them his -RRB- . '' 
Then the woman they called his wife said she did n't want them to call her the widow of that rotten old carcass who had n't remembered her the day he died , and that she would swear those children were n't his , and from then on she was renouncing the marriage contract . 
`` What is that marriage contract ? '' 
I asked . 
The mother said , `` The marriage contract I drew up when my daughter married that ungrateful wretch was this ... . 
But before I tell that , I 'll have to give you the background . 
`` I was living in a village called Duennas , twenty miles from here . 
I was left with these three daughters from three different fathers who were , as near as I can figure out , a monk , an abbot , and a priest -LRB- I have always been devoted to the Church -RRB- . 
I came to this city to live , to get away from all the gossiping that always goes on in small towns . 
Everyone called me the ecclesiastical widow because , unfortunately , all three men had died . 
And even though others came to take their place , they were only mediocre men of lower positions , and not being content with the sheep , they went after the young lambs . 
`` Well , when I saw the obvious danger we were in and that what we earned would n't make us rich , I called a halt and set up my camp here . 
And with the fame of the three girls , they swarmed here like bees to honey . 
And the ones I favored most of all were the clergy because they were silent , rich , family men , and understanding . 
Among them , the Father of Saint Lazarus came here to beg alms . 
And when he saw this girl , she went to his heart , and in his saintliness and simplicity he asked me to give her to him as his wife . 
`` So I did , under the following conditions and articles : `` First , he would have to maintain our household , and what we could earn ourselves would go for our clothes and our savings . 
`` Second , because he was a little decrepit , if my daughter should at any time take on an ecclesiastical assistant , he would be as quiet as if he were at mass . 
`` Third , that all the children she would have , he would have to take as his own and promise them what he did or might possess . 
And if my daughter did n't have any children , he would make her his sole and lawful heir . 
`` Fourth , that he would not come into our house when he saw a jug , a pot , or any other vessel in the window because that was a signal that there was n't any place for him . 
`` Fifth , that when he was in the house and someone else came , he would have to hide where we told him until the other person left . 
`` Sixth and last , that twice a week he would have to bring us some friend or acquaintance who would provide us with a great feast . 
`` These are the articles of the marriage contract , '' she continued , `` that that poor wretch and my daughter swore to . 
The marriage took place without their having to go to a priest because he said it was n't necessary . 
The most important part , he said , was for there to be mutual agreement about their wishes and intentions . '' 
I was astonished at what that second Celestina * was telling me and at the marriage contract she had used to marry her daughter . 
I was confused : I did n't know what to say . 
But they lit up the road to my desire because the young widow grabbed me around the neck and said , `` If that poor fellow had had the face of this angel , I would really have loved him . '' 
And with that she kissed me . 
After that kiss something started up in me -- I do n't know what it was -- and I began to burn inside . 
I told her that if she wanted to stop being a widow and take me as her own , I would keep not only the contract of the old man but any other articles she wanted to add . 
They were happy with that and said they only wanted me to give them everything in the hermitage for safekeeping . 
I promised to do that , but I intended to hold back the money in case I ever needed it . 
The marriage ceremony was to take place the next morning , and that afternoon they sent a cart to take away everything but the nails that held the place together . 
They did n't overlook the altarcloth or the saint 's clothing . 
I was so bedazzled that if they had asked me for the phoenix or the waters from the river Styx , I would have given it to them . 
The only thing they left me was a poor piece of sackcloth to lie on like a dog . 
When that lady -- my future wife -- who had come with the cart saw that there was n't any money she was angry . 
Because the old man had told her that he had some , but he did n't say where . 
She asked me if I knew where the treasure was . 
I told her I did n't . 
Being astute , she took me by the hand so we could go looking for it . 
She led me to every corner and crevice in the hermitage , including the base of the altar . 
And when she saw that it had recently been fixed , she became very suspicious . 
She hugged and kissed me and said , `` My life , tell me where that money is so we can have a happy wedding with it . '' 
I still denied that I knew anything about any money . 
She took my hand again and led me outside to walk around the hermitage , watching my face all the time . 
When we got to the place where I had hidden it , my eyes darted there . 
She called her mother and told her to look under a stone I had put on top of it . 
She found it , and I found my death . 
She feigned a smile and said , `` Look . 
With this we 'll have a wonderful life . '' 
She caressed me over and over again , and then , since it was getting late , they went back to the city , telling me to come to their house in the morning and we would have the happiest wedding there had ever been . 
I hope to God it 's full of roses and not thorns , I said to myself . 
All that night I was caught between the hope that those women would n't trick me and the fear that they would , although I thought it was impossible for there to be any trickery in a woman who had such a good face . 
I was expecting to enjoy that little pigeon , so the night seemed like a year to me . 
It was n't yet dawn when I closed up my hermitage and went to get married -LRB- as if that were nothing -RRB- , not remembering that I already was . 
I arrived just as they were getting up . 
They welcomed me so joyfully that I really thought I was fortunate , and with all my fears gone , I began to act right at home . 
We ate so well and the food was so good that I thought I was in paradise . 
They had invited six or seven lady friends of theirs in to eat . 
After dinner we danced , and although I did n't know how , they made me do it . 
To see me dancing with my hermit 's garb on was a sight . 
When evening came , after a good supper and even better drinking , they took me into a nicely decorated room where there was a good bed . 
They told me to get into it . 
While my wife was undressing , a maid pulled off my shoes and stockings and told me to take off my shirt because , for the ceremonies that would take place , I had to be completely naked . 
I obeyed her . 
Then all the women came into my room with my wife behind them , dressed in a shift , and one of the women was carrying the train . 
The first thing they made me do was kiss her arse , saying that was the first ceremony . 
After this , four of them grabbed me -- two by the feet and two by the arms -- and with great care they tied four ropes to me and fastened the ends to the four bedposts . 
I was like a Saint Andrew on the Cross . 
They all began to laugh when they saw my jack-in-the-box , and they threw a jar of cold water on it . 
I gave out a terrible shriek , but they told me to be quiet , or else . 
They took a huge pot of hot water and stuck my head in it . 
I was burning up , and the worst part was that if I tried to shout they whipped me . 
So I decided to let them do what they wanted . 
They sheared off my beard , my hair , my eyebrows and eyelashes . 
`` Be patient , '' they said . 
`` The ceremonies will be over soon , and you will enjoy what you desire so much . '' 
I begged them to let me go because my appetite had gone away . 
They cut away the hair from my crotch , and one of them who was the boldest took out a knife and said to the others , `` Hold him down tight , and I 'll cut off his plums so he 'll never again feel tempted to get married . 
This hermit thought everything we told him was the gospel truth . 
Why , it was n't even the epistle . 
He trusted women , and now he 'll see what the payment is . '' 
When I saw my precious stones in danger , I pulled so hard that I broke a rope and one of the bedposts . 
I grabbed my jewels with one hand and clutched them so that even if they had cut off my fingers , they could n't have gotten to them . 
So they would n't break the bed completely apart , they untied me and wrapped me in a sheet . 
Then they gave me such a blanketing that they left me half dead . 
`` These , my dear sir , '' they said , `` are the ceremonies our wedding begins with . 
If you want to come back tomorrow , we 'll finish the rest . '' 
The four of them picked me up and carried me far away from their house . 
They put me down in the middle of a street . 
And when morning came , boys began to chase and beat me , so that , to get away from their hands , I ran into a church next to the high altar where they were saying mass . 
When the priests saw that figure , which must have looked like the devil they paint at Saint Michael 's feet , they began to run away , and I was right behind them , trying to get away from the boys . 
The people in the church were shouting . 
Some said , `` Look ! 
There goes the devil ! '' 
Others said , `` Look at the madman ! '' 
I was shouting , too , but that I was n't a devil or a madman ; I was only a poor fellow who looked like that because of my sins . 
At this , they all quieted down . 
The priests went back to their mass , and the sacristan gave me a cover from a tomb to wrap myself in . 
I went over to a corner and thought about the reverses of fortune and that no matter where you go bad luck is there . 
So I decided to stay in that church for the rest of my life . 
And if past misfortunes were any indication , my life would n't be a long one .
