`` And Ramos ? '' 
`` They told me in the cathedral that he is the one they are looking for most eagerly . 
Oh , my God ! 
to arrest innocent people in that way , who have done nothing yet . 
Well , I do n't know how good Spaniards can have patience under such treatment . 
Senora Dona Perfecta , when I was telling you about the arrests , I forgot to say that you ought to go home at once . '' 
`` Yes , I will go at once . 
Have those bandits searched my house ? '' 
`` It is possible . 
Senora , we have fallen upon evil days , '' said Don Inocencio , in solemn and feeling accents . 
`` May God have pity upon us ! '' 
`` There are half a dozen well-armed men in my house , '' responded the lady , greatly agitated . 
`` What iniquity ! 
Would they be capable of wanting to carry them off too ? '' 
`` Assuredly Senor Pinzon will not have neglected to denounce them . 
Senora , I repeat that we have fallen upon evil days . 
But God will protect the innocent . '' 
`` I am going now . 
Do n't fail to stop in at the house . '' 
`` Senora , as soon as the lesson is over -- though I imagine that with the excitement that there is in the town , all the boys will play truant to-day -- But in any case I will go to the house after class hours . 
I do n't wish you to go out alone , senora . 
Those vagabond soldiers are strutting about the streets with such insolent airs . 
Jacinto , Jacinto ! '' 
`` It is not necessary . 
I will go alone . '' 
`` Let Jacinto go with you , '' said the young man 's mother . 
`` He must be up by this time . '' 
They heard the hurried footsteps of the little doctor , who was coming down the stairs in the greatest haste . 
He entered the room with flushed face and panting for breath . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked his uncle . 
`` In the Troyas ' house , '' said the young man , `` in the house of those -- those girls -- '' `` Finish at once ! '' 
`` Caballuco is there ! '' 
`` Up there ? 
In the house of the Troyas ? '' 
`` Yes , senor . 
He spoke to me from the terrace , and he told me he was afraid they were coming there to arrest him . '' 
`` Oh , what a fool ! 
That idiot is going to allow himself to be arrested ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , tapping the floor impatiently with her foot . 
`` He wants to come down and let us hide him in the house . '' 
`` Here ? '' 
The canon and his niece exchanged a glance . 
`` Let him come down ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta vehemently . 
`` Here ? '' 
repeated Don Inocencio , with a look of ill-humor . 
`` Here , '' answered the lady . 
`` I do n't know of any house where he would be more secure . '' 
`` He can let himself down easily from the window of my room , '' said Jacinto . 
`` Well , if it is necessary -- '' `` Maria Remedios , '' said Dona Perfecta , `` if they take that man , all is lost . '' 
`` I am a fool and a simpleton , '' answered the canon 's niece , laying her hand on her breast and stifling the sigh that was doubtless about to escape from it ; `` but they shall not take him . '' 
Dona Perfecta went out quickly , and shortly afterward the Centaur was making himself comfortable in the arm-chair in which Don Inocencio was accustomed to sit when he was writing his sermons . 
We do not know how it reached the ears of Brigadier Batalla , but certain it is that this active soldier had had notice that the Orbajosans had changed their intentions ; and on the morning of this day he had ordered the arrest of those whom in our rich insurrectional language we are accustomed to call marked . 
The great Caballuco escaped by a miracle , taking refuge in the house of the Troyas , but not thinking himself safe there he descended , as we have seen , to the holy and unsuspected mansion of the good canon . 
At night the soldiers , established at various points of the town , kept a strict watch on all who came in and went out , but Ramos succeeded in making his escape , cheating or perhaps without cheating the vigilance of the military . 
This filled the measure of the rage of the Orbajosans , and numbers of people were conspiring in the hamlets near Villahorrenda ; meeting at night to disperse in the morning and prepare in this way the arduous business of the insurrection . 
Ramos scoured the surrounding country , collecting men and arms ; and as the flying columns followed the Aceros into the district of Villajuan de Nahara , our chivalrous hero made great progress in a very short time . 
At night he ventured boldly into Orbajosa , employing stratagems and perhaps bribery . 
His popularity and the protection which he received in the town served him , to a certain extent , as a safeguard ; and it would not be rash to affirm that the soldiers did not manifest toward this daring leader of the insurrection the same rigor as toward the insignificant men of the place . 
In Spain , and especially in time of war , which is here always demoralizing , these unworthy considerations toward the great are often seen , while the little are persecuted pitilessly . 
Favored then by his boldness , by bribery , or by we know not what , Caballuco entered Orbajosa , gained new recruits , and collected arms and money . 
Either for the great security of his person or in order to save appearances , he did not set foot in his own house ; he entered Dona Perfecta 's only for the purpose of treating of important affairs , and he usually supped in the house of some friend , preferring always the respected domicile of some priest , and especially that of Don Inocencio , where he had taken refuge on the fateful morning of the arrests . 
Meanwhile Batalla had telegraphed to the Government the information that a plot of the rebels having been discovered its authors had been imprisoned , and the few who had succeeded in escaping had fled in various directions and were being actively pursued by the military . 
There is nothing more entertaining than to search for the cause of some interesting event which surprises or agitates us , and nothing more satisfactory than to discover it . 
When , seeing violent passions in open or concealed conflict , and led by the natural intuitive impulse which always accompanies human observation we succeed in discovering the hidden source from which that turbulent river had derived its waters , we experience a sensation very similar to the delight of the explorer or the discoverer of an unknown land . 
This delight Providence has now bestowed upon us ; for , exploring the hidden recesses of the hearts which beat in this story , we have discovered an event that is assuredly the source of the most important events that we have narrated ; a passion which is the first drop of water of the impetuous current whose course we are observing . 
Let us go on with our story , then . 
To do so , let us leave Senora de Polentinos , without concerning ourselves in regard to what may have happened to her on the morning of her conversation with Maria Remedios . 
Returning to her house , full of anxiety , she found herself obliged to endure the apologies and the civilities of Senor Pinzon , who assured her that while he lived her house should not be searched . 
Dona Perfecta responded haughtily , without deigning to look at him , for which reason he asked her politely for an explanation of her coldness , to which she replied requesting Senor Pinzon to leave her house , deferring to a future occasion the explanation which she would require from him of his perfidious conduct while in it . 
Don Cayetano arriving at this moment , words were exchanged between the two gentlemen , as between man and man ; but as we are more interested at present in another matter , we will leave the Polentinos and the lieutenant-colonel to settle matters between them as best they can , and proceed to examine the question of the sources above mentioned . 
Let us fix our attention on Maria Remedios , an estimable woman , to whom it is indispensably necessary to devote a few words . 
She was a lady , a real lady -- for , notwithstanding her humble origin , the virtues of her uncle , Senor Don Inocencio , also of low origin , but elevated by his learning and his estimable qualities , had shed extraordinary lustre over the whole family . 
The love of Remedios for Jacinto was one of the strongest passions of which the maternal heart is capable . 
She loved him with delirium ; her son 's welfare was her first earthly consideration ; she regarded him as the most perfect type of beauty and talent ever created by God , and to see him happy and great and powerful she would have given her whole life and even a part of the life to come . 
The maternal sentiment is the only one which , because of its nobility and its sanctity , will admit of exaggeration ; the only one which the delirium of passion does not debase . 
Nevertheless it is a singular phenomenon , frequently observed , that this exaltation of maternal affection , if not accompanied with absolute purity of heart and with perfect uprightness is apt to become perverted and transformed into a lamentable frenzy , which may lead , like any other ungoverned passion , to great errors and catastrophies . 
In Orbajosa Maria Remedios passed for a model of virtue and a model niece -- perhaps she was so in reality . 
She served with affection all who needed her services ; she never gave occasion for gossip or for scandal ; she never mixed herself up in intrigues . 
She carried her religion to the extreme of an offensive fanaticism ; she practised charity ; she managed her uncle 's house with the utmost ability ; she was well received , admired and kindly treated everywhere , in spite of the almost intolerable annoyance produced by her persistent habit of sighing and speaking always in a complaining voice . 
But in Dona Perfecta 's house this excellent lady suffered a species of capitis diminutio . 
In times far distant and very bitter for the family of the good Penitentiary , Maria Remedios -LRB- since it is the truth , why should it not be told ? -RRB- 
had been a laundress in the house of Polentinos . 
And let it not be supposed that Dona Perfecta looked down upon her on this account -- nothing of the kind . 
She behaved to her without any haughtiness ; she felt a real sisterly affection for her ; they ate together ; they prayed together ; they confided their troubles to each other ; they aided each other in their charities and in their devotions as well as in domestic matters ; but , truth to say , there was always a something , there was always a line , invisible but which could not be crossed between the improvised lady and the lady by birth and ancestry . 
Dona Perfecta addressed Maria as `` thou , '' while the latter could never lay aside certain ceremonial forms . 
Maria Remedios always felt herself so insignificant in the presence of her uncle 's friend that her natural humility had acquired through this feeling a strange tinge of sadness . 
She saw that the good canon was a species of perpetual Aulic councillor in the house ; she saw her idolized Jacintillo mingling on terms of almost lover-like familiarity with the young lady , and nevertheless the poor mother and niece visited the house as little as possible . 
It is to be observed that Maria Remedios ' dignity as a lady suffered not a little in Dona Perfecta 's house , and this was disagreeable to her ; for in this sighing spirit , too , there was , as there is in every living thing , a little pride . 
To see her son married to Rosarito , to see him rich and powerful ; to see him related to Dona Perfecta , to the senora -- ah ! 
this was for Maria Remedios earth and heaven , this life and the next , the present and the future , the supreme totality of existence . 
For years her mind and her heart had been filled by the light of this sweet hope . 
Because of this hope she was good and she was bad ; because of it she was religious and humble , or fierce and daring ; because of it she was whatever she was -- for without this idea Maria , who was the incarnation of her project , would not exist . 
In person , Maria Remedios could not be more insignificant than she was . 
She was remarkable for a surprising freshness and robustness which made her look much younger than she really was , and she always dressed in mourning , although her widowhood was now of long standing . 
Five days had passed since the entrance of Caballuco into the Penitentiary 's house . 
It was evening . 
Remedios entered her uncle 's room with the lighted lamp , which she placed on the table . 
She then seated herself in front of the old man , who , for a great part of the afternoon , had been sitting motionless and thoughtful in his easy chair . 
His fingers supported his chin , wrinkling up the brown skin , unshaven for the past three days . 
`` Did Caballuco say he would come here to supper to-night ? '' 
he asked his niece . 
`` Yes , senor , he will come . 
It is in a respectable house like this that the poor fellow is most secure . '' 
`` Well , I am not altogether easy in my mind , in spite of the respectability of the house , '' answered the Penitentiary . 
`` How the brave Ramos exposes himself ! 
And I am told that in Villahorrenda and the surrounding country there are a great many men . 
I do n't know how many men -- What have you heard ? '' 
`` That the soldiers are committing atrocities . '' 
`` It is a miracle that those Hottentots have not searched the house ! 
I declare that if I see one of the red-trousered gentry enter the house , I shall fall down speechless . '' 
`` This is a nice condition of things ! '' 
said Remedios , exhaling half her soul in a sigh . 
`` I can not get out of my head the idea of the tribulation in which Senora Dona Perfecta finds herself . 
Uncle , you ought to go there . '' 
`` Go there to-night ? 
The military are parading the streets ! 
Imagine that some insolent soldier should take it into his head to -- The senora is well protected . 
The other day they searched the house and they carried off the six armed men she had there ; but afterward they sent them back to her . 
We have no one to protect us in case of an attack . '' 
`` I sent Jacinto to the senora 's , to keep her company for a while . 
If Caballuco comes , we will tell him to stop in there , too . 
No one can put it out of my head but that those rascals are plotting some piece of villany against our friend . 
Poor senora , poor Rosarito ! 
When one thinks that this might have been avoided by what I proposed to Dona Perfecta two days ago -- '' `` My dear niece , '' said the Penitentiary phlegmatically , `` we have done all that it was in human power to do to carry out our virtuous purpose . 
More we can not do . 
Convince yourself of this , and do not be obstinate . 
Rosarito can not be the wife of our idolized Jacintillo . 
Your golden dream , your ideal of happiness , that at one time seemed attainable , and to which like a good uncle , I devoted all the powers of my understanding , has become chimerical , has vanished into smoke . 
Serious obstructions , the wickedness of a man , the indubitable love of the girl , and other things , regarding which I am silent , have altered altogether the condition of affairs . 
We were in a fair way to conquer , and suddenly we are conquered . 
Ah , niece ! 
convince yourself of one thing . 
As matters are now , Jacinto deserves something a great deal better than that crazy girl . '' 
`` Caprices and obstinate notions ! '' 
responded Maria , with an ill-humor that was far from respectful . 
`` That 's a pretty thing to say now , uncle ! 
The great minds are outshining themselves , now . 
Dona Perfecta with her lofty ideas , and you with your doubts and fears -- of much use either of you is . 
It is a pity that God made me such a fool and gave me an understanding of brick and mortar , as the senora says , for if that was n't the case I would soon settle the question . '' 
`` You ? '' 
`` If she and you had allowed me , it would be settled already . '' 
`` By the beating ? '' 
`` There 's no occasion for you to be frightened or to open your eyes like that . 
There is no question of killing any body . 
What an idea ! '' 
`` Beating , '' said the canon , smiling , `` is like scratching -- when one begins one does n't know when to leave off . '' 
`` Bah ! 
say too that I am cruel and blood-thirsty . 
I would n't have the courage to kill a fly ; it 's not very likely that I should desire the death of a man . '' 
`` In fine , child , no matter what objections you may make , Senor Don Pepe Rey will carry off the girl . 
It is not possible now to prevent it . 
He is ready to employ every means , including dishonor . 
If Rosarito -- how she deceived us with that demure little face and those heavenly eyes , eh ! 
-- if Rosarito , I say , did not herself wish it , then all might be arranged , but alas ! 
she loves him as the sinner loves Satan ; she is consumed with a criminal passion ; she has fallen , niece , into the snares of the Evil One . 
Let us be virtuous and upright ; let us turn our eyes away from the ignoble pair , and think no more about either of them . '' 
`` You know nothing about women , uncle , '' said Remedios , with flattering hypocrisy ; `` you are a holy man ; you do not understand that Rosario 's feeling is only a passing caprice , one of those caprices that are cured by a sound whipping . '' 
`` Niece , '' said Don Inocencio gravely and sententiously , `` when serious things have taken place , caprices are not called caprices , but by another name . '' 
`` Uncle , you do n't know what you are talking about , '' responded Maria Remedios , her face flushing suddenly . 
`` What ! 
would you be capable of supposing that Rosarito -- what an atrocity ! 
I will defend her ; yes , I will defend her . 
She is as pure as an angel . 
Why , uncle , those things bring a blush to my cheek , and make me indignant with you . '' 
As she spoke the good priest 's face was darkened by a cloud of sadness that made him look ten years older . 
`` My dear Remedios , '' he said , `` we have done all that is humanly possible , and all that in conscience we can or ought to do . 
Nothing could be more natural than our desire to see Jacintillo connected with that great family , the first in Orbajosa ; nothing more natural than our desire to see him master of the seven houses in the town , the meadow of Mundogrande , the three gardens of the upper farm , La Encomienda , and the other lands and houses which that girl owns . 
Your son has great merit , every one knows it well . 
Rosarito liked him , and he liked Rosarito . 
The matter seemed settled . 
Dona Perfecta herself , without being very enthusiastic , doubtless on account of our origin , seemed favorably disposed toward it , because of her great esteem and veneration for me , as her confessor and friend . 
But suddenly this unlucky young man presents himself . 
The senora tells me that she has given her word to her brother , and that she can not reject the proposal made by him . 
A difficult situation ! 
But what do I do in view of all this ? 
Ah , you do n't know every thing ! 
I will be frank with you . 
If I had found Senor de Rey to be a man of good principles , calculated to make Rosario happy , I would not have interfered in the matter ; but the young man appeared to me to be a wretch , and , as the spiritual director of the house , it was my duty to take a hand in the business , and I took it . 
You know already that I determined to unmask him . 
I exposed his vices ; I made manifest his atheism ; I laid bare to the view of all the rottenness of that materialistic heart , and the senora was convinced that in giving her daughter to him , she would be delivering her up to vice . 
Ah , what anxieties I endured ! 
The senora vacillated ; I strengthened her wavering mind ; I advised her concerning the means she might lawfully employ to send her nephew away without scandal . 
I suggested ingenious ideas to her ; and as she often spoke to me of the scruples that troubled her tender conscience , I tranquillized her , pointing out to her how far it was allowable for us to go in our fight against that lawless enemy . 
Never did I counsel violent or sanguinary measures or base outrages , but always subtle artifices , in which there was no sin . 
My mind is tranquil , my dear niece . 
But you know that I struggled hard , that I worked like a negro . 
Ah ! 
when I used to come home every night and say , ` Mariquilla , we are getting on well , we are getting on very well , ' you used to be wild with delight , and you would kiss my hands again and again , and say I was the best man on earth . 
Why do you fly into a passion now , disfiguring your noble character and peaceable disposition ? 
Why do you scold me ? 
Why do you say that you are indignant , and tell me in plain terms that I am nothing better than an idiot ? '' 
`` Because , '' said the woman , without any diminution of her rage , `` because you have grown faint-hearted all of a sudden . '' 
`` The thing is that every thing is going against us , woman . 
That confounded engineer , protected as he is by the army , is resolved to dare every thing . 
The girl loves him , the girl -- I will say no more . 
It can not be ; I tell you that it can not be . '' 
`` The army ! 
But do you believe , like Dona Perfecta , that there is going to be a war , and that to drive Don Pepe from the town it will be necessary for one half of the nation to rise up against the other half ? 
The senora has lost her senses , and you are in a fair way to lose yours . '' 
`` I believe as she does . 
In view of the intimate connection of Rey with the soldiers the personal question assumes larger proportions . 
But , ah , niece ! 
if two days ago I entertained the hope that our valiant townsmen would kick the soldiers out of the town , since I have seen the turn things have taken , since I have seen that most of them have been surprised before fighting , and that Caballuco is in hiding and that the insurrection is going to the devil , I have lost confidence in every thing . 
The good doctrines have not yet acquired sufficient material force to tear in pieces the ministers and the emissaries of error . 
Ah , niece ! 
resignation , resignation ! '' 
And Don Inocencio , employing the method of expression which characterized his niece , heaved two or three profound sighs . 
Maria , contrary to what might have been expected , maintained absolute silence . 
She showed now neither anger nor the superficial sentimentality of her ordinary life ; but only a profound and humble grief . 
Shortly after the good canon had ended his peroration two tears rolled down his niece 's rosy cheeks ; before long were heard a few half-suppressed sighs , and gradually , as the swell and tumult of a sea that is beginning to be stormy rise higher and higher and become louder and louder , so the surge of Maria Remedios ' grief rose and swelled , until it at last broke forth in a flood of tears . 
`` Resignation , resignation ! '' 
repeated Don Inocencio . 
`` Resignation , resignation ! '' 
repeated his niece , drying her tears . 
`` If my dear son is doomed to be always a beggar , well , then , be it so . 
Lawsuits are becoming scarce ; the day will soon come when the practice of the law will be the same as nothing . 
What is the use of all his talent ? 
What is the use of his tiring his brain with so much study ? 
Ah ! 
We are poor . 
A day will come , Senor Don Inocencio , when my poor boy will not have a pillow on which to lay his head . '' 
`` Woman ! '' 
`` Man ! 
can you deny it ? 
Tell me , then , what inheritance are you going to leave him when you close your eyes on this world ? 
A couple of rooms , half a dozen big books , poverty , and nothing more . 
What times are before us , uncle ; what times ! 
My poor boy is growing very delicate in his health , and he wo n't be able to work -- it makes him dizzy now to read a book ; he gets a headache and nausea whenever he works at night ! 
He will have to beg a paltry situation ; I shall have to take in sewing , and who knows , who knows but we may have to beg our bread ! '' 
`` Woman ! '' 
`` Oh , I know very well what I am talking about ! 
Fine times before us ! '' 
added the excellent woman , forcing still more the lachrymose note in her diatribe . 
`` My God ! 
What is going to become of us ? 
Ah , it is only a mother 's heart that can feel these things ! 
Only a mother is capable of suffering so much anxiety about a son 's welfare . 
How should you understand it ? 
No ; it is one thing to have children and to suffer anxiety on their account and another to sing the gori gori in the cathedral and to teach Latin in the institute . 
Of great use is it for my son to be your nephew and to have taken so many honors and to be the pride and ornament of Orbajosa . 
He will die of starvation , for we already know what law brings ; or else he will have to ask the deputies for a situation in Havana , where the yellow fever will kill him . '' 
`` But , niece -- '' `` No , I am not grieving , I am silent now ; I wo n't annoy you any more . 
I am very troublesome , always crying and sighing ; and I am not to be endured because I am a fond mother and I will look out for the good of my beloved son . 
I will die , yes , I will die in silence , and stifle my grief . 
I will swallow my tears , in order not to annoy his reverence the canon . 
But my idolized son will comprehend me and he wo n't put his hands to his ears as you are doing now . 
Woe is me ! 
Poor Jacinto knows that I would die for him , and that I would purchase his happiness at the sacrifice of my life . 
Darling child of my soul ! 
To be so deserving and to be forever doomed to mediocrity , to a humble station , for -- do n't get indignant , uncle -- no matter what airs we put on , you will always be the son of Uncle Tinieblas , the sacristan of San Bernardo , and I shall never be any thing more than the daughter of Ildefonso Tinieblas , your brother , who used to sell crockery , and my son will be the grandson of the Tinieblas -- for obscure we were born , and we shall never emerge from our obscurity , nor own a piece of land of which we can say , ` This is mine ' ; nor shall I ever plunge my arms up to the elbows in a sack of wheat threshed and winnowed on our own threshing-floor -- all because of your cowardice , your folly , your soft-heartedness . '' 
`` But -- but , niece ! '' 
The canon 's voice rose higher every time he repeated this phrase , and , with his hands to his ears , he shook his head from side to side with a look of mingled grief and desperation . 
The shrill complaint of Maria Remedios grew constantly shriller , and pierced the brain of the unhappy and now dazed priest like an arrow . 
But all at once the woman 's face became transformed ; her plaintive wail was changed to a hard , shrill scream ; she turned pale , her lips trembled , she clenched her hands , a few locks of her disordered hair fell over her forehead , her eyes glittered , dried by the heat of the anger that glowed in her breast ; she rose from her seat and , not like a woman , but like a harpy , cried : `` I am going away from here ! 
I am going away from here with my son ! 
We will go to Madrid ; I do n't want my son to fret himself to death in this miserable town ! 
I am tired now of seeing that my son , under the protection of the cassock , neither is nor ever will be any thing . 
Do you hear , my reverend uncle ? 
My son and I are going away ! 
You will never see us again -- never ! '' 
Don Inocencio had clasped his hands and was receiving the thunderbolts of his niece 's wrath with the consternation of a criminal whom the presence of the executioner has deprived of his last hope . 
`` In Heaven 's name , Remedios , '' he murmured , in a pained voice ; `` in the name of the Holy Virgin -- '' These fits of range of his niece , who was usually so meek , were as violent as they were rare , and five or six years would sometimes pass without Don Inocencio seeing Remedios transformed into a fury . 
`` I am a mother ! 
I am a mother ! 
and since no one else will look out for my son , I will look out for him myself ! '' 
roared the improvised lioness . 
`` In the name of the Virgin , niece , do n't let your passion get the best of you ! 
Remember that you are committing a sin . 
Let us say the Lord 's Prayer and an Ave Maria , and you will see that this will pass away . '' 
As he said this the Penitentiary trembled , and the perspiration stood on his forehead . 
Poor dove in the talons of the vulture ! 
The furious woman completed his discomfiture with these words : `` You are good for nothing ; you are a poltroon ! 
My son and I will go away from this place forever , forever ! 
I will get a position for my son , I will find him a good position , do you understand ? 
Just as I would be willing to sweep the streets with my tongue if I could gain a living for him in no other way , so I will move heaven and earth to find a position for my boy in order that he may rise in the world and be rich , and a person of consequence , and a gentleman , and a lord and great , and all that there is to be -- all , all ! '' 
`` Heaven protect me ! '' 
cried Don Inocencio , sinking into a chair and letting his head fall on his breast . 
There was a pause during which the agitated breathing of the furious woman could be heard . 
`` Niece , '' said Don Inocencio at last , `` you have shortened my life by ten years ; you have set my blood on fire ; you have put me beside myself . 
God give me the calmness that I need to bear with you ! 
Lord , patience -- patience is what I ask . 
And you , niece , do me the favor to sigh and cry to your heart 's content for the next ten years ; for your confounded mania of sniveling , greatly as it annoys me , is preferable to these mad fits of rage . 
If I did not know that you are good at heart -- Well , for one who confessed and received communion this morning you are behaving -- '' `` Yes , but you are the cause of it -- you ! '' 
`` Because in the matter of Rosario and Jacinto I say to you , resignation ? '' 
`` Because when every thing is going on well you turn back and allow Senor de Rey to get possession of Rosario . '' 
`` And how am I going to prevent it ? 
Dona Perfecta is right in saying that you have an understanding of brick . 
Do you want me to go about the town with a sword , and in the twinkling of an eye to make mincemeat of the whole regiment , and then confront Rey and say to him , ` Leave the girl in peace or I will cut your throat ' ? '' 
`` No , but when I advised the senora to give her nephew a fright , you opposed my advice , instead of supporting it . '' 
`` You are crazy with your talk about a fright . '' 
`` Because when the dog is dead the madness is at an end . '' 
`` I can not advise what you call a fright , and what might be a terrible thing . '' 
`` Yes ; because I am a cut-throat , am I not , uncle ? '' 
`` You know that practical jokes are vulgar . 
Besides , do you suppose that man would allow himself to be insulted ? 
And his friends ? '' 
`` At night he goes out alone . '' 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
`` I know every thing ; he does not take a step that I am not aware of ; do you understand ? 
The widow De Cuzco keeps me informed of every thing . '' 
`` There , do n't set me crazy . 
And who is going to give him that fright ? 
Let us hear . '' 
`` Caballuco . '' 
`` So that he is disposed -- '' `` No , but he will be if you command him . '' 
`` Come , niece , leave me in peace . 
I can not command such an atrocity . 
A fright ! 
And what is that ? 
Have you spoken to him already ? '' 
`` Yes , senor ; but he paid no attention to me , or rather he refused . 
There are only two people in Orbajosa who can make him do what they wish by a simple order -- you and Dona Perfecta . '' 
`` Let Dona Perfecta order him to do it if she wishes , then . 
I will never advise the employment of violent and brutal measures . 
Will you believe that when Caballuco and some of his followers were talking of rising up in arms they could not draw a single word from me inciting them to bloodshed . 
No , not that . 
If Dona Perfecta wishes to do it -- '' `` She will not do it , either . 
I talked with her for two hours this afternoon and she said that she would preach war , and help it by every means in her power ; but that she would not bid one man stab another in the back . 
She would be right in opposing it if anything serious were intended , but I do n't want any wounds ; all I want is to give him a fright . '' 
`` Well , if Dona Perfecta does n't want to order a fright to be given to the engineer , I do n't either , do you understand ? 
My conscience is before every thing . '' 
`` Very well , '' returned his niece . 
`` Tell Caballuco to come with me to-night -- that is all you need say to him . '' 
`` Are you going out to-night ? '' 
`` Yes , senor , I am going out . 
Why , did n't I go out last night too ? '' 
`` Last night ? 
I did n't know it ; if I had known it I should have been angry ; yes , senora . '' 
`` All you have to say to Caballuco is this : ` My dear Ramos , I will be greatly obliged to you if you will accompany my niece on an errand which she has to do to-night , and if you will protect her , if she should chance to be in any danger . ' '' 
`` I can do that . 
To accompany you , to protect you . 
Ah , rogue ! 
you want to deceive me and make me your accomplice in some piece of villany . '' 
`` Of course -- what do you suppose ? '' 
said Maria Remedios ironically . 
`` Between Ramos and me we are going to slaughter a great many people to-night . '' 
`` Do n't jest ! 
I tell you again that I will not advise Ramos to do any thing that has the appearance of evil -- I think he is outside . '' 
A noise at the street-door was heard , then the voice of Caballuco speaking to the servant , and a little later the hero of Orbajosa entered the room . 
`` What is the news ? 
Give us the news , Senor Ramos , '' said the priest . 
`` Come ! 
If you do n't give us some hope in exchange for your supper and our hospitality -- What is going on in Villahorrenda ? '' 
`` Something , '' answered the bravo , seating himself with signs of fatigue . 
`` You shall soon see whether we are good for anything or not . '' 
Like all persons who wish to make themselves appear important , Caballuco made a show of great reserve . 
`` To-night , my friend , you shall take with you , if you wish , the money they have given me for -- '' `` There is good need of it . 
If the soldiers should get scent of it , however , they wo n't let me pass , '' said Ramos , with a brutal laugh . 
`` Hold your tongue , man . 
We know already that you pass whenever you please . 
Why , that would be a pretty thing ! 
The soldiers are not strait-laced gentry , and if they should become troublesome , with a couple of dollars , eh ? 
Come , I see that you are not badly armed . 
All you want now is an eight-pounder . 
Pistols , eh ? 
And a dagger too . '' 
`` For any thing that might happen , '' said Caballuco , taking the weapon from his belt and displaying its horrible blade . 
`` In the name of God and of the Virgin ! '' 
exclaimed Maria Remedios , closing her eyes and turning her face in terror , `` put away that thing . 
The very sight of it terrifies me . '' 
`` If you wo n't take it ill of me , '' said Ramos , shutting the weapon , `` let us have supper . '' 
Maria Remedios prepared every thing quickly , in order that the hero might not become impatient . 
`` Listen to me a moment , Senor Ramos , '' said Don Inocencio to his guest , when they had sat down to supper . 
`` Have you a great deal to do to-night ? '' 
`` Something there is to be done , '' responded the bravo . 
`` This is the last night I shall come to Orbajosa -- the last . 
I have to look up some boys who remained in the town , and we are going to see how we can get possession of the saltpetre and the sulphur that are in the house of Cirujeda . '' 
`` I asked you , '' said the curate amiably , filling his friend 's plate , `` because my niece wishes you to accompany her a short distance . 
She has some business or other to attend to , and it is a little late to be out alone . '' 
`` Is she going to Dona Perfecta 's ? '' 
asked Ramos . 
`` I was there a few moments ago , but I did not want to make any delay . '' 
`` How is the senora ? '' 
`` A little frightened . 
To-night I took away the six young men I had in the house . '' 
`` Why ! 
do n't you think they will be wanted there ? '' 
said Remedios , with alarm . 
`` They are wanted more in Villahorrenda . 
Brave men chafe at being kept in the house ; is it not so , Senor Canon ? '' 
`` Senor Ramos , that house ought not to be left unprotected , '' said the Penitentiary . 
`` The servants are enough , and more than enough . 
But do you suppose , Senor Don Inocencio , that the brigadier employs himself in attacking the people 's houses ? '' 
`` Yes , but you know very well that that diabolical engineer -- '' `` For that -- there are not wanting brooms in the house , '' said Cristobal jovially . 
`` For in the end , there will be no help for it but to marry them . 
After what has passed -- '' `` Senor Ramos , '' said Remedios , with sudden anger , `` I imagine that all you know about marrying people is very little . '' 
`` I say that because a little while ago , when I was at the house , the mother and daughter seemed to be having a sort of reconciliation . 
Dona Perfecta was kissing Rosarito over and over again , and there was no end to their caresses and endearments . '' 
`` Reconciliation ! 
With all these preparations for the war you have lost your senses . 
But , finally , are you coming with me or not ? '' 
`` It is not to Dona Perfecta 's she wants to go , '' said the priest , `` but to the hotel of the widow De Cuzco . 
She was saying that she does not dare to go alone , because she is afraid of being insulted . '' 
`` By whom ? '' 
`` It is easily understood . 
By that infernal engineer . 
Last night my niece met him there , and she gave him some plain talk ; and for that reason she is not altogether easy in her mind to-night . 
The young fellow is revengeful and insolent . ''
