But it is enough for him to be your friend and your mamma 's to be my friend also , '' declared the young man . 
`` And does he come here often ? '' 
`` Every day . 
He spends a great deal of his time with us , '' responded Rosarito ingenuously . 
`` How good and kind he is ! 
And how fond he is of me ! '' 
`` Come ! 
I begin to like this gentleman . '' 
`` He comes in the evening , besides , to play tresillo , '' continued the young girl ; `` for every night some friends meet here -- the judge of the lower court , the attorney-general , the dean , the bishop 's secretary , the alcalde , the collector of taxes , Don Inocencio 's nephew -- '' `` Ah ! 
Jacintito , the lawyer . '' 
`` Yes ; he is a simple-hearted boy , as good as gold . 
His uncle adores him . 
Since he returned from the university with his doctor 's tassel -- for he is a doctor in two sciences , and he took honors besides -- what do you think of that ? 
-- well , as I was saying , since his return , he has come here very often with his uncle . 
Mamma too is very fond of him . 
He is a very sensible boy . 
He goes home early with his uncle ; he never goes at night to the Casino , nor plays nor squanders money , and he is employed in the office of Don Lorenzo Ruiz , who is the best lawyer in Orbajosa . 
They say Jacinto will be a great lawyer , too . '' 
`` His uncle did not exaggerate when he praised him , then , '' said Pepe . 
`` I am very sorry that I talked all that nonsense I did about lawyers . 
I was very perverse , was I not , my dear cousin ? '' 
`` Not at all ; for my part , I think you were quite right . '' 
`` But , really , was I not a little -- '' `` Not in the least , not in the least ! '' 
`` What a weight you have taken off my mind ! 
The truth is that I found myself constantly , and without knowing why , in distressing opposition to that venerable priest . 
I am very sorry for it . '' 
`` What I think , '' said Rosarito , looking at him with eyes full of affection , `` is that you will not find yourself at home among us . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether I can make myself quite clear , cousin . 
I mean that it will not be easy for you to accustom yourself to the society and the ideas of the people of Orbajosa . 
I imagine so -- it is a supposition . '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
I think you are mistaken . '' 
`` You come from a different place , from another world , where the people are very clever , and very learned , and have refined manners , and a witty way of talking , and an air -- perhaps I am not making myself clear . 
I mean that you are accustomed to live among people of refinement ; you know a great deal . 
Here there is not what you need ; here the people are not learned or very polished . 
Every thing is plain , Pepe . 
I imagine you will be bored , terribly bored , and that in the end you will have to go away . '' 
The expression of sadness which was natural in Rosarito 's countenance here became so profound that Pepe Rey was deeply moved . 
`` You are mistaken , my dear cousin . 
I did not come here with the ideas you fancy , nor is there between my character and my opinions and the character and opinions of the people here the want of harmony you imagine . 
But let us suppose for a moment that there were . '' 
`` Let us suppose it . '' 
`` In that case I have the firm conviction that between you and me , between us two , dear Rosarito , perfect harmony would still exist . 
On this point I can not be mistaken . 
My heart tells me that I am not mistaken . '' 
Rosarito blushed deeply , but making an effort to conceal her embarrassment under smiles and fugitive glances , she said : `` Come , now , no pretences . 
But if you mean that I shall always approve of what you say , you are right . '' 
`` Rosario , '' exclaimed the young man , `` the moment I saw you my soul was filled with gladness ; I felt at the same time a regret that I had not come before to Orbajosa . '' 
`` Now , that I am not going to believe , '' she said , affecting gayety to conceal her emotion . 
`` So soon ? 
Do n't begin to make protestations already . 
See , Pepe , I am only a country girl , I can talk only about common things ; I do n't know French ; I do n't dress with elegance ; all I know is how to play the piano ; I -- '' `` Oh , Rosario ! '' 
cried the young man , with ardor ; `` I believed you to be perfect before ; now I am sure you are so . '' 
Her mother at this moment entered the room . 
Rosarito , who did not know what to say in answer to her cousin 's last words , was conscious , however , of the necessity of saying something , and , looking at her mother , she cried : `` Ah ! 
I forgot to give the parrot his dinner . '' 
`` Do n't mind that now . 
But why do you stay in here ? 
Take your cousin for a walk in the garden . '' 
Dona Perfecta smiled with maternal kindness at her nephew , as she pointed toward the leafy avenue which was visible through the glass door . 
`` Let us go there , '' said Pepe , rising . 
Rosarito darted , like a bird released from its cage , toward the glass door . 
`` Pepe , who knows so much and who must understand all about trees , '' said Dona Perfecta , `` will teach you how to graft . 
Let us see what he thinks of those young pear-trees that they are going to transplant . '' 
`` Come , come ! '' 
called Rosarito to her cousin impatiently from the garden . 
Both disappeared among the foliage . 
Dona Perfecta watched them until they were out of sight and then busied herself with the parrot . 
As she changed its food she said to herself with a contemplative air : `` How different he is ! 
He has not even given a caress to the poor bird . '' 
Then , thinking it possible that she had been overheard by her brother-in-law , she said aloud : `` Cayetano , what do you think of my nephew ? 
Cayetano ! '' 
A low grunt gave evidence that the antiquary was returning to the consciousness of this miserable world . 
`` Cayetano ! '' 
`` Just so , just so ! '' 
murmured the scientist in a sleepy voice . 
`` That young gentleman will maintain , as every one does , that the statues of Mundogrande belong to the first Phoenician immigration . 
But I will convince him -- '' `` But , Cayetano ! '' 
`` But , Perfecta ! 
There ! 
Now you will insist upon it again that I have been asleep . '' 
`` No , indeed ; how could I insist upon any thing so absurd ! 
But you have n't told me what you think about that young man . '' 
Don Cayetano placed the palm of his hand before his mouth to conceal a yawn ; then he and Dona Perfecta entered upon a long conversation . 
Those who have transmitted to us the necessary data for a compilation of this history omit this dialogue , no doubt because it was entirely confidential . 
As for what the engineer and Rosarito said in the garden that afternoon , it is evident that it was not worthy of mention . 
On the afternoon of the following day , however , events took place which , being of the gravest importance , ought not to be passed over in silence . 
Late in the afternoon the two cousins found themselves alone , after rambling through different parts of the garden in friendly companionship and having eyes and ears only for each other . 
`` Pepe , '' Rosario was saying , `` all that you have been telling me is pure fancy , one of those stories that you clever men know so well how to put together . 
You think that because I am a country girl I believe every thing I am told . '' 
`` If you understood me as well as I think I understand you , you would know that I never say any thing I do not mean . 
But let us have done with foolish subtleties and lovers ' sophistries , that lead only to misunderstandings . 
I will speak to you only in the language of truth . 
Are you by chance a young lady whose acquaintance I have made on the promenade or at a party , and with whom I propose to spend a pleasant hour or two ? 
No , you are my cousin . 
You are something more . 
Rosario , let us at once put things on their proper footing . 
Let us drop circumlocutions . 
I have come here to marry you . '' 
Rosario felt her face burning , and her heart was beating violently . 
`` See , my dear cousin , '' continued the young man . 
`` I swear to you that if you had not pleased me I should be already far away from this place . 
Although politeness and delicacy would have obliged me to make an effort to conceal my disappointment , I should have found it hard to do so . 
That is my character . '' 
`` Cousin , you have only just arrived , '' said Rosarito laconically , trying to laugh . 
`` I have only just arrived , and I already know all that I wanted to know ; I know that I love you ; that you are the woman whom my heart has long been announcing to me , saying to me night and day , ` Now she is coming , now she is near ; now you are burning . ' '' 
These words served Rosario as an excuse for breaking into the laugh that had been dimpling her lips . 
Her soul swelled with happiness ; she breathed an atmosphere of joy . 
`` You persist in depreciating yourself , '' continued Pepe , `` but for me you possess every perfection . 
You have the admirable quality of radiating on all around you the divine light of your soul . 
The moment one sees you one feels instinctively the nobility of your mind and the purity of your heart . 
To see you is to see a celestial being who , through the forgetfulness of Heaven , remains upon the earth ; you are an angel , and I adore you . '' 
When he had said this it seemed as if he had fulfilled an important mission . 
Rosarito , overcome by the violence of her emotion , felt her scant strength suddenly fail her ; and , half-fainting , she sank on a stone that in those pleasant solitudes served as a seat . 
Pepe bent over her . 
Her eyes were closed , her forehead rested on the palm of her hand . 
A few moments later the daughter of Dona Perfecta Polentinos gave her cousin , amid happy tears , a tender glance followed by these words : `` I loved you before I had ever seen you . '' 
Placing her hands in those of the young man she rose to her feet , and their forms disappeared among the leafy branches of an oleander walk . 
Night was falling and soft shadows enveloped the lower end of the garden , while the last rays of the setting sun crowned the tree-tops with fleeting splendors . 
The noisy republic of the birds kept up a deafening clamor in the upper branches . 
It was the hour in which , after flitting about in the joyous regions of the sky , they were all going to rest , and they were disputing with one another the branches they had selected for sleeping-places . 
Their chatter at times had a sound of recrimination and controversy , at times of mockery and merriment . 
In their voluble twitter the little rascals said the most insulting things to each other , pecking at each other and flapping their wings , as orators wave their arms when they want to make their hearers believe the lies they are telling them . 
But words of love were to be heard there too , for the peace of the hour and the beauty of the spot invited to it . 
A sharp ear might have distinguished the following : `` I loved you before I had even seen you , and if you had not come I should have died of grief . 
Mamma used to give me your father 's letters to read , and he praised you so much in them that I used to say , ` That is the man who ought to be my husband . ' 
For a long time your father said nothing about our marrying , which seemed to me great negligence . 
Uncle Cayetano , whenever he spoke of you , would say , ` There are not many men like him in the world . 
The woman who gets him for a husband may think herself fortunate . ' 
At last your father said what he could not avoid saying . 
Yes , he could not avoid saying it -- I was expecting it every day . '' 
Shortly after these words the same voice added uneasily : `` Some one is following us . '' 
Emerging from among the oleanders , Pepe , turning round , saw two men approaching them , and touching the leaves of a young tree near by , he said aloud to his companion : `` It is not proper to prune young trees like this for the first time until they have taken firm root . 
Trees recently planted have not sufficient strength to bear the operation . 
You know that the roots can grow only by means of the leaves , so that if you take the leaves from a tree -- '' `` Ah , Senor Don Jose , '' cried the Penitentiary , with a frank laugh , approaching the two young people and bowing to them , `` are you giving lessons in horticulture ? 
Insere nunc Meliboee piros ; pone ordine vites , as the great singer of the labors of the field said . 
` Graft the pear-tree , dear Meliboeus , trim the vines . ' 
And how are we now , Senor Don Jose ? '' 
The engineer and the canon shook hands . 
Then the latter turned round , and indicating by a gesture a young man who was behind him , said , smiling : `` I have the pleasure of presenting to you my dear Jacintillo -- a great rogue , a feather-head , Senor Don Jose . '' 
Close beside the black cassock was a fresh and rosy face , that seemed fresher and rosier from the contrast . 
Jacinto saluted our hero , not without some embarrassment . 
He was one of those precocious youths whom the indulgent university sends prematurely forth into the arena of life , making them fancy that they are men because they have received their doctor 's degree . 
Jacinto had a round , handsome face with rosy cheeks , like a girl 's , and without any beard save the down which announced its coming . 
In person he was plump and below the medium height . 
His age was a little over twenty . 
He had been educated from childhood under the direction of his excellent and learned uncle , which is the same as saying that the twig had not become crooked in the growing . 
A severe moral training had kept him always straight , and in the fulfilment of his scholastic duties he had been almost above reproach . 
Having concluded his studies at the university with astonishing success , for there was scarcely a class in which he did not take the highest honors , he entered on the practice of his profession , promising , by his application and his aptitude for the law , to maintain fresh and green in the forum the laurels of the lecture-hall . 
At times he was as mischievous as a boy , at times as sedate as a man . 
In very truth , if Jacinto had not had a little , and even a great deal of liking for pretty girls , his uncle would have thought him perfect . 
The worthy man preached to him unceasingly on this point , hastening to clip the wings of every audacious fancy . 
But not even this mundane inclination of the young man could cool the great affection which our worthy canon bore the charming offspring of his dear niece , Maria Remedios . 
Where the young lawyer was concerned , every thing else must give way . 
Even the grave and methodical habits of the worthy ecclesiastic were altered when they interfered with the affairs of his precocious pupil . 
That order and regularity , apparently as fixed as the laws of a planetary system , were interrupted whenever Jacinto was ill or had to take a journey . 
Useless celibacy of the clergy ! 
The Council of Trent prohibits them from having children of their own , but God -- and not the Devil , as the proverb says -- gives them nephews and nieces in order that they may know the tender anxieties of paternity . 
Examining impartially the qualities of this clever boy , it was impossible not to recognize that he was not wanting in merit . 
His character was in the main inclined to uprightness , and noble actions awakened a frank admiration in his soul . 
With respect to his intellectual endowments and his social knowledge , they were sufficient to enable him to become in time one of those notabilities of whom there are so many in Spain ; he might be what we take delight in calling hyperbolically a distinguished patrician , or an eminent public man ; species which , owing to their great abundance , are hardly appreciated at their just value . 
In the tender age in which the university degree serves as a sort of solder between boyhood and manhood , few young men -- especially if they have been spoiled by their masters -- are free from an offensive pedantry , which , if it gives them great importance beside their mamma 's arm-chair , makes them very ridiculous when they are among grave and experienced men . 
Jacinto had this defect , which was excusable in him , not only because of his youth , but also because his worthy uncle stimulated his puerile vanity by injudicious praise . 
When the introduction was over they resumed their walk . 
Jacinto was silent . 
The canon , returning to the interrupted theme of the pyros which were to be grafted and the vites which were to be trimmed , said : `` I am already aware that Senor Don Jose is a great agriculturist . '' 
`` Not at all ; I know nothing whatever about the subject , '' responded the young man , observing with no little annoyance the canon 's mania of supposing him to be learned in all the sciences . 
`` Oh , yes ! 
a great agriculturist , '' continued the Penitentiary ; `` but on agricultural subjects , do n't quote the latest treatises to me . 
For me the whole of that science , Senor de Rey , is condensed in what I call the Bible of the Field , in the ` Georgics ' of the immortal Roman . 
It is all admirable , from that grand sentence , Nec vero terroe ferre omnes omnia possunt -- that is to say , that not every soil is suited to every tree , Senor Don Jose -- to the exhaustive treatise on bees , in which the poet describes the habits of those wise little animals , defining the drone in these words : '' ` Ille horridus alter Desidia , latamque trahens inglorius alvum . ' '' 
` Of a horrible and slothful figure , dragging along the ignoble weight of the belly , ' Senor Don Jose . '' 
`` You do well to translate it for me , '' said Pepe , `` for I know very little Latin . '' 
`` Oh , why should the men of the present day spend their time in studying things that are out of date ? '' 
said the canon ironically . 
`` Besides , only poor creatures like Virgil and Cicero and Livy wrote in Latin . 
I , however , am of a different way of thinking ; as witness my nephew , to whom I have taught that sublime language . 
The rascal knows it better than I do . 
The worst of it is , that with his modern reading he is forgetting it ; and some fine day , without ever having suspected it , he will find out that he is an ignoramus . 
For , Senor Don Jose , my nephew has taken to studying the newest books and the most extravagant theories , and it is Flammarion here and Flammarion there , and nothing will do him but that the stars are full of people . 
Come , I fancy that you two are going to be very good friends . 
Jacinto , beg this gentleman to teach you the higher mathematics , to instruct you concerning the German philosophers , and then you will be a man . '' 
The worthy ecclesiastic laughed at his own wit , while Jacinto , delighted to see the conversation turn on a theme so greatly to his taste , after excusing himself to Pepe Rey , suddenly hurled this question at him : `` Tell me , Senor Don Jose , what do you think of Darwinism ? '' 
Our hero smiled at this inopportune pedantry , and he felt almost tempted to encourage the young man to continue in this path of childish vanity ; but , judging it more prudent to avoid intimacy , either with the nephew or the uncle , he answered simply : `` I can think nothing at all about the doctrines of Darwin , for I know scarcely any thing about him . 
My professional labors have not permitted me to devote much of my time to those studies . '' 
`` Well , '' said the canon , laughing , `` it all reduces itself to this , that we are descended from monkeys . 
If he had said that only in the case of certain people I know , he would have been right . '' 
`` The theory of natural selection , '' said Jacinto emphatically , `` has , they say , a great many partisans in Germany . '' 
`` I do not doubt it , '' said the ecclesiastic . 
`` In Germany they would have no reason to be sorry if that theory were true , as far as Bismarck is concerned . '' 
Dona Perfecta and Senor Don Cayetano at this moment made their appearance . 
`` What a beautiful evening ! '' 
said the former . 
`` Well , nephew , are you getting terribly bored ? '' 
`` I am not bored in the least , '' responded the young man . 
`` Do n't try to deny it . 
Cayetano and I were speaking of that as we came along . 
You are bored , and you are trying to hide it . 
It is not every young man of the present day who would have the self-denial to spend his youth , like Jacinto , in a town where there are neither theatres , nor opera bouffe , nor dancers , nor philosophers , nor athenaeums , nor magazines , nor congresses , nor any other kind of diversions or entertainments . '' 
`` I am quite contented here , '' responded Pepe . 
`` I was just now saying to Rosario that I find this city and this house so pleasant that I would like to live and die here . '' 
Rosario turned very red and the others were silent . 
They all sat down in a summer-house , Jacinto hastening to take the seat on the left of the young girl . 
`` See here , nephew , I have a piece of advice to give you , '' said Dona Perfecta , smiling with that expression of kindness that seemed to emanate from her soul , like the aroma from the flower . 
`` But do n't imagine that I am either reproving you or giving you a lesson -- you are not a child , and you will easily understand what I mean . '' 
`` Scold me , dear aunt , for no doubt I deserve it , '' replied Pepe , who was beginning to accustom himself to the kindnesses of his father 's sister . 
`` No , it is only a piece of advice . 
These gentlemen , I am sure , will agree that I am in the right . '' 
Rosario was listening with her whole soul . 
`` It is only this , '' continued Dona Perfecta , `` that when you visit our beautiful cathedral again , you will endeavor to behave with a little more decorum while you are in it . '' 
`` Why , what have I done ? '' 
`` It does not surprise me that you are not yourself aware of your fault , '' said his aunt , with apparent good humor . 
`` It is only natural ; accustomed as you are to enter athenaeums and clubs , and academies and congresses without any ceremony , you think that you can enter a temple in which the Divine Majesty is in the same manner . '' 
`` But excuse me , senora , '' said Pepe gravely , `` I entered the cathedral with the greatest decorum . '' 
`` But I am not scolding you , man ; I am not scolding you . 
If you take it in that way I shall have to remain silent . 
Excuse my nephew , gentlemen . 
A little carelessness , a little heedlessness on his part is not to be wondered at . 
How many years is it since you set foot in a sacred place before ? '' 
`` Senora , I assure you -- But , in short , let my religious ideas be what they may , I am in the habit of observing the utmost decorum in church . '' 
`` What I assure you is -- There , if you are going to be offended I wo n't go on . 
What I assure you is that a great many people noticed it this morning . 
The Senores de Gonzalez , Dona Robustiana , Serafinita -- in short , when I tell you that you attracted the attention of the bishop -- His lordship complained to me about it this afternoon when I was at my cousin 's . 
He told me that he did not order you to be put out of the church only because you were my nephew . '' 
Rosario looked anxiously at her cousin , trying to read in his countenance , before he uttered it , the answer he would make to these charges . 
`` No doubt they mistook me for some one else . '' 
`` No , no ! 
it was you . 
But there , do n't get angry ! 
We are talking here among friends and in confidence . 
It was you . 
I saw you myself . '' 
`` You saw me ! '' 
`` Just so . 
Will you deny that you went to look at the pictures , passing among a group of worshippers who were hearing mass ? 
I assure you that my attention was so distracted by your comings and goings that -- well , you must not do it again . 
Then you went into the chapel of San Gregorio . 
At the elevation of the Host at the high altar you did not even turn around to make a gesture of reverence . 
Afterward you traversed the whole length of the church , you went up to the tomb of the Adelantado , you touched the altar with your hands , then you passed a second time among a group of worshippers , attracting the notice of every one . 
All the girls looked at you , and you seemed pleased at disturbing so finely the devotions of those good people . '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
How many things I have done ! '' 
exclaimed Pepe , half angry , half amused . 
`` I am a monster , it seems , without ever having suspected it . '' 
`` No , I am very well aware that you are a good boy , '' said Dona Perfecta , observing the canon 's expression of unalterable gravity , which gave his face the appearance of a pasteboard mask . 
`` But , my dear boy , between thinking things and showing them in that irreverent manner , there is a distance which a man of good sense and good breeding should never cross . 
I am well aware that your ideas are -- Now , do n't get angry ! 
If you get angry , I will be silent . 
I say that it is one thing to have certain ideas about religion and another thing to express them . 
I will take good care not to reproach you because you believe that God did not create us in his image and likeness , but that we are descended from the monkeys ; nor because you deny the existence of the soul , asserting that it is a drug , like the little papers of rhubarb and magnesia that are sold at the apothecary 's -- '' `` Senora , for Heaven 's sake ! '' 
exclaimed Pepe , with annoyance . 
`` I see that I have a very bad reputation in Orbajosa . '' 
The others remained silent . 
`` As I said , I will not reproach you for entertaining those ideas . 
And , besides , I have not the right to do so . 
If I should undertake to argue with you , you , with your wonderful talents , would confute me a thousand times over . 
No , I will not attempt any thing of that kind . 
What I say is that these poor and humble inhabitants of Orbajosa are pious and good Christians , although they know nothing about German philosophy , and that , therefore , you ought not publicly to manifest your contempt for their beliefs . '' 
`` My dear aunt , '' said the engineer gravely , `` I have shown no contempt for any one , nor do I entertain the ideas which you attribute to me . 
Perhaps I may have been a little wanting in reverence in the church . 
I am somewhat absent-minded . 
My thoughts and my attention were engaged with the architecture of the building and , frankly speaking , I did not observe -- But this was no reason for the bishop to think of putting me out of the church , nor for you to suppose me capable of attributing to a paper from the apothecary 's the functions of the soul . 
I may tolerate that as a jest , but only as a jest . '' 
The agitation of Pepe Rey 's mind was so great that , notwithstanding his natural prudence and moderation , he was unable to conceal it . 
`` There ! 
I see that you are angry , '' said Dona Perfecta , casting down her eyes and clasping her hands . 
`` I am very sorry . 
If I had known that you would have taken it in that way , I should not have spoken to you . 
Pepe , I ask your pardon . '' 
Hearing these words and seeing his kind aunt 's deprecating attitude , Pepe felt ashamed of the sternness of his last words , and he made an effort to recover his serenity . 
The venerable Penitentiary extricated him from his embarrassing position , saying with his accustomed benevolent smile : `` Senora Dona Perfecta , we must be tolerant with artists . 
Oh , I have known a great many of them ! 
Those gentlemen , when they have before them a statue , a piece of rusty armor , a mouldy painting , or an old wall , forget every thing else . 
Senor Don Jose is an artist , and he has visited our cathedral as the English visit it , who would willingly carry it away with them to their museums , to its last tile , if they could . 
That the worshippers were praying , that the priest was elevating the Sacred Host , that the moment of supreme piety and devotion had come -- what of that ? 
What does all that matter to an artist ? 
It is true that I do not know what art is worth , apart from the sentiments which it expresses , but , in fine , at the present day , it is the custom to adore the form , not the idea . 
God preserve me from undertaking to discuss this question with Senor Don Jose , who knows so much , and who , reasoning with the admirable subtlety of the moderns , would instantly confound my mind , in which there is only faith . '' 
`` The determination which you all have to regard me as the most learned man on earth annoys me exceedingly , '' said Pepe , speaking in his former hard tone . 
`` Hold me for a fool ; for I would rather be regarded as a fool than as the possessor of that Satanic knowledge which is here attributed to me . '' 
Rosarito laughed , and Jacinto thought that a highly opportune moment had now arrived to make a display of his own erudition . 
`` Pantheism or panentheism , '' he said , `` is condemned by the Church , as well as by the teachings of Schopenhauer and of the modern Hartmann . '' 
`` Ladies and gentlemen , '' said the canon gravely , `` men who pay so fervent a worship to art , though it be only to its form , deserve the greatest respect . 
It is better to be an artist , and delight in the contemplation of beauty , though this be only represented by nude nymphs , than to be indifferent and incredulous in every thing . 
The mind that consecrates itself to the contemplation of beauty , evil will not take complete possession of . 
Est Deus in nobis . 
Deus , be it well understood . 
Let Senor Don Jose , then , continue to admire the marvels of our church ; I , for one , will willingly forgive him his acts of irreverence , with all due respect for the opinions of the bishop . '' 
`` Thanks , Senor Don Inocencio , '' said Pepe , feeling a bitter and rebellious sentiment of hostility springing up within him toward the canon , and unable to conquer his desire to mortify him . 
`` But let none of you imagine , either , that it was the beauties of art , of which you suppose the temple to be full , that engaged my attention . 
Those beauties , with the exception of the imposing architecture of a portion of the edifice and of the three tombs that are in the chapel of the apse , I do not see . 
What occupied my mind was the consideration of the deplorable decadence of the religious arts ; and the innumerable monstrosities , of which the cathedral is full , caused me not astonishment , but disgust . '' 
The amazement of all present was profound . 
`` I can not endure , '' continued Pepe , `` those glazed and painted images that resemble so much -- God forgive me for the comparison -- the dolls that little girls pay with . 
And what am I to say of the theatrical robes that cover them ? 
I saw a St. Joseph with a mantle whose appearance I will not describe , out of respect for the holy patriarch and for the church of which he is the patron . 
On the altar are crowded together images in the worst possible taste ; and the innumerable crowns , branches , stars , moons , and other ornaments of metal or gilt paper have an air of an ironmongery that offends the religious sentiment and depresses the soul . 
Far from lifting itself up to religious contemplation , the soul sinks , and the idea of the ludicrous distracts it . 
The great works of art which give sensible form to ideas , to dogmas , to religious faith , to mystic exaltation , fulfil a noble mission . 
The caricatures , the aberrations of taste , the grotesque works with which a mistaken piety fills the church , also fulfil their object ; but this is a sad one enough : They encourage superstition , cool enthusiasm , oblige the eyes of the believer to turn away from the altar , and , with the eyes , the souls that have not a very profound and a very firm faith turn away also . '' 
`` The doctrine of the iconoclasts , too , '' said Jacinto , `` has , it seems , spread widely in Germany . '' 
`` I am not an iconoclast , although I would prefer the destruction of all the images to the exhibition of buffooneries of which I speak , '' continued the young man . 
`` Seeing it , one may justly advocate a return of religious worship to the august simplicity of olden times . 
But no ; let us not renounce the admirable aid which all the arts , beginning with poetry and ending with music , lend to the relations between man and God . 
Let the arts live ; let the utmost pomp be displayed in religious ceremonies . 
I am a partisan of pomp . '' 
`` An artist , an artist , and nothing more than an artist ! '' 
exclaimed the canon , shaking his head with a sorrowful air . 
`` Fine pictures , fine statues , beautiful music ; pleasure for the senses , and let the devil take the soul ! '' 
`` Apropos of music , '' said Pepe Rey , without observing the deplorable effect which his words produced on both mother and daughter , `` imagine how disposed my mind would be to religious contemplation on entering the cathedral , when just at that moment , and precisely at the offertory at high mass , the organist played a passage from ` Traviata . ' '' 
`` Senor de Rey is right in that , '' said the little lawyer emphatically . 
`` The organist played the other day the whole of the drinking song and the waltz from the same opera , and afterward a rondeau from the ` Grande Duchesse . ' '' 
`` But when I felt my heart sink , '' continued the engineer implacably , `` was when I saw an image of the Virgin , which seems to be held in great veneration , judging from the crowd before it and the multitude of tapers which lighted it . 
They have dressed her in a puffed-out garment of velvet , embroidered with gold , of a shape so extraordinary that it surpasses the most extravagant of the fashions of the day . 
Her face is almost hidden under a voluminous frill , made of innumerable rows of lace , crimped with a crimping-iron , and her crown , half a yard in height , surrounded by golden rays , looks like a hideous catafalque erected over her head . 
Of the same material , and embroidered in the same manner , are the trousers of the Infant Jesus . 
I will not go on , for to describe the Mother and the Child might perhaps lead me to commit some irreverence . 
I will only say that it was impossible for me to keep from smiling , and for a short time I contemplated the profaned image , saying to myself : ` Mother and Lady mine , what a sight they have made of you ! ' '' 
As he ended Pepe looked at his hearers , and although , owing to the gathering darkness , he could not see their countenances distinctly , he fancied that in some of them he perceived signs of angry consternation . 
`` Well , Senor Don Jose ! '' 
exclaimed the canon quickly , smiling with a triumphant expression , `` that image , which to your philosophy and pantheism appears so ridiculous , is Our Lady of Help , patroness and advocate of Orbajosa , whose inhabitants regard her with so much veneration that they would be quite capable of dragging any one through the streets who should speak ill of her . 
The chronicles and history , Senor Don Jose , are full of the miracles which she has wrought , and even at the present day we receive constantly incontrovertible proofs of her protection . 
You must know also that your aunt , Dona Perfecta , is chief lady in waiting to the Most Holy Virgin of Help , and that the dress that to you appears so grotesque -- went out from this house , and that the trousers of the Infant are the work of the skilful needle and the ardent piety combined of your cousin Rosarito , who is now listening to us . '' 
Pepe Rey was greatly disconcerted . 
At the same instant Dona Perfecta rose abruptly from her seat , and , without saying a word , walked toward the house , followed by the Penitentiary . 
The others rose also . 
Recovering from his stupefaction , the young man was about to beg his cousin 's pardon for his irreverence , when he observed that Rosarito was weeping . 
Fixing on her cousin a look of friendly and gentle reproof , she said : `` What ideas you have ! '' 
The voice of Dona Perfecta was heard crying in an altered accent : `` Rosario ! 
Rosario ! '' 
The latter ran toward the house . 
Pepe Rey was disturbed and perplexed , enraged with himself and every one else ; he tried in vain to imagine what could be the conflict that had arisen , in spite of himself , between his ideas and the ideas of his aunt 's friends . 
Thoughtful and sad , foreseeing future discord , he remained for a short time sitting on the bench in the summer-house , his chin resting on his breast , his forehead gathered in a frown , his hands clasped . 
He thought himself alone . 
Suddenly he heard a gay voice humming the refrain of a song from a zarzuela . 
He looked up and saw Don Jacinto sitting in the opposite corner of the summer-house . 
`` Ah , Senor de Rey ! '' 
said the youth abruptly , `` one does not offend with impunity the religious sentiments of the great majority of a nation . 
If you doubt it , consider what happened in the first French revolution . '' 
When Pepe heard the buzzing of this insect his irritation increased . 
Nevertheless there was no anger in his soul toward the youthful doctor of laws . 
The latter annoyed him , as a fly might annoy him , but nothing more . 
Rey felt the irritation which every importunate being inspires , and with the air of one who brushes away a buzzing drone , he answered : `` What has the French revolution to do with the robe of the Virgin ? '' 
He got up and walked toward the house , but he had not taken half a dozen steps before he heard again beside him the buzzing of the mosquito , saying : `` Senor Don Jose , I wish to speak to you about an affair in which you are greatly interested and which may cause you some trouble . '' 
`` An affair ? '' 
said the young man , drawing back . 
`` Let us hear what affair is that . '' 
`` You suspect what it is , perhaps , '' said Jacinto , approaching Pepe , and smiling with the air of a man of business who has some unusually important matter on hand ; `` I want to speak to you about the lawsuit . '' 
`` The lawsuit ! 
My friend , I have no lawsuits . 
You , as a good lawyer , dream of lawsuits and see stamped paper everywhere . '' 
`` What ! 
You have not heard of your lawsuit ? '' 
exclaimed the youth , with amazement . 
`` Of my lawsuit ! 
But I have no lawsuits , nor have I ever had any . '' 
`` Well , if you have not heard of it , I am all the better pleased to have spoken to you about it , so that you may be on your guard . 
Yes , senor , you are going to have a suit at law . '' 
`` And with whom ? '' 
`` With Uncle Licurgo and other land-owners whose property borders on the estate called The Poplars . '' 
Pepe Rey was astounded . 
`` Yes , senor , '' continued the little lawyer . 
`` To-day Uncle Licurgo and I had a long conference . 
As I am such a friend of the family , I wanted to let you know about it , so that , if you think well of it , you may hasten to arrange the matter . '' 
`` But what have I to arrange ? 
What do those rascals claim from me ? '' 
`` It seems that a stream of water which rises in your property has changed its course and flows over some tile-works of the aforesaid Uncle Licurgo and the mill of another person , occasioning considerable damage . 
My client -- for he is determined that I shall get him out of this difficulty -- my client , as I said , demands that you shall restore the water to its former channel , so as to avoid fresh injuries , and that you shall indemnify him for the damage which his works have already sustained through the neglect of the superior proprietor . '' 
`` And I am the superior proprietor ! 
If I engage in a lawsuit , that will be the first fruit that those famous Poplars , which were mine and which now , as I understand , belong to everybody , will have ever produced me , for Licurgo , as well as some of the other farmers of the district , have been filching from me , little by little , year after year , pieces of land , and it will be very difficult to re-establish the boundaries of my property . '' 
`` That is a different question . '' 
`` That is not a different question . 
The real suit , '' exclaimed the engineer , unable to control his anger , `` will be the one that I will bring against that rabble who no doubt propose to themselves to tire me out and drive me to desperation -- so that I may abandon every thing and let them continue in possession of what they have stolen . 
We shall see if there are lawyers and judges who will uphold the infamous conduct of those village legists , who are forever at law , and who waste and consume the property of others . 
I am obliged to you , young gentleman , for having informed me of the villanous intentions of those boors , who are more perverse than Satan himself . 
When I tell you that that very tile-yard and that very mill on which Licurgo bases his claim are mine -- '' `` The title-deeds of the property ought to be examined , to see if possession may not constitute a title in this case . '' 
`` Possession ! 
Those scoundrels are not going to have the pleasure of laughing at me in that way . 
I suppose that justice is honestly and faithfully administered in the city of Orbajosa . '' 
`` Oh , as to that ! '' 
exclaimed the little lawyer , with an approving look , `` the judge is an excellent person ! 
He comes here every evening . 
But it is strange that you should have received no notice of Senor Licurgo 's claims . 
Have you not yet been summoned to appear before the tribunal of arbitration ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` It will be to-morrow , then . 
Well , I am very sorry that Senor Licurgo 's precipitation has deprived me of the pleasure and honor of defending you , but what is to be done ? 
Licurgo was determined that I should take him out of his troubles . 
I will study the matter with the greatest care . 
This vile slavery is the great drawback of jurisprudence . '' 
Pepe entered the dining-room in a deplorable state of mind . 
Dona Perfecta was talking with the Penitentiary , as he entered , and Rosarito was sitting alone , with her eyes fixed on the door . 
She was no doubt waiting for her cousin . 
`` Come here , you rascal , '' said his aunt , smiling with very little spontaneity . 
`` You have insulted us , you great atheist ! 
but we forgive you . 
I am well aware that my daughter and myself are two rustics who are incapable of soaring to the regions of mathematics where you dwell , but for all that it is possible that you may one day get down on your knees to us and beg us to teach you the Christian doctrine . '' 
Pepe answered with vague phrases and formulas of politeness and repentance . 
`` For my part , '' said Don Inocencio , with an affected air of meekness and amiability , `` if in the course of these idle disputes I have said any thing that could offend Senor Don Jose , I beg his pardon for it .
