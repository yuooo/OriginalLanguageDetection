The individuals of this faggot , seized hold of the others in such a manner , that they could not separate them ; so that the devils who united their strength for that purpose , were obliged to take the whole pile , attach it to the hook , and let it all go together . 
The mass was so great , that it seemed as if it would choke the fire of hell . 
The devils bestirred themselves , and finally made an end of the tailors ; they then cast in a great quantity of oil , tallow , and sulphur , and stirring them up with long iron tormentors , and employing large bellows , the fire caught all at once , and raised a flame , that rose above the mouth of the furnace more than three hundred feet . 
All the tailors having been cast into the fire , their demon general , with a haughty and severe air , came to demand of me , why I had not been bound with the others . 
`` Because , '' said I to him , `` I am not a tailor , a rogue , a thief , neither a cabbager of stuff nor money ; I am here with my companion , Curiosity , to inspect the beauties and antiquities of this country . '' 
`` You are a liar , '' replied the general ; `` you are one of my subjects ; I know you by your strait-cut dress , which , without doubt , you have made out of the clippings of some other ; come , obey ; cast yourself into the fire , or I will throw you in . '' 
As he was about to bind me , my demon informed the general that I was not yet dead ; that I had never been of any trade , and that he believed I should not be one of their subjects , because those who descended quick into hell , conducted themselves afterwards in such a manner , as not to revisit it after death ; furthermore , the cross of Saint James , -LRB- which I carried , -RRB- would inspire fear , and cause false alarms in the bosoms of the damned . 
`` Come hither , then , '' said the general , `` and profit by what you see ; you know , at least , that tailors are the fuel of hell , and serve to burn those that come hither . '' 
My demon advised me to go promptly , because if the general should get angry , he might do me a mischief . 
In walking along , he informed me the unhappy tailors were so numerous , that they not only fed the great furnace of hell , which warmed all the apartments , but also furnished the table of Lucifer , when he had a mind to feast . 
`` How ! '' 
exclaimed I , `` Lucifer eat ? 
Can spirits eat ? '' 
`` Do you not know , '' replied he , `` that the damned are as the herb the sheep eateth , and that death is this sheep ? 
Have you not read in your sacred books , that death devoureth the damned ? 
Mors depascet eos . '' 
While he was speaking , we met a troop of booksellers , at whose head was one Peter Marteau , a publisher , of Cologne ; he was loaded with a burden so unwieldy , that it was impossible to comprehend how any one man could bear it . 
They informed me , these were the books printed under his name , after his death . 
The booksellers of Holland were also very heavily laden ; and those of France bore also the books struck off at their houses , with the title of a Dutch bookseller . 
These people were carrying their books to the furnace , but were prevented by a singular accident : a demon , who passed by with a flambeau , approaching to look at them , their papers caught fire , and instantly spread from one to another through the whole body : when they perceived the flame , they threw down their loads , and fled with all convenient speed . 
I asked them why they were damned : they answered , for the faults of others . 
`` An author , '' observed they , `` often carries a work to the printer , which has no merit , and besides , as unsaleable as a girl , ugly and poor : by this means the printer is ruined ; in vain he curses the author , and seeks to reimburse himself by the sale of an unpopular book ; this book is the cause of his failure ; his creditors seize his goods and shop ; he maddens , and resigns himself to despair . 
A translator , who understands Greek , undertakes a dull work ; sometimes he supposes he has discovered a manuscript ; he carries his translation to the printer , who , not being able to get rid of it , sells the leaves to the grocer or butter woman . 
Another cause of our damnation ; a bookseller sells at a handsome profit , the satires of Juvenal , the comedies of Terence , and of other poets , as those of Virgil and Ovid ; a lackey , a shop-boy , a soldier , a clerk , purchase these works , and amuse themselves among serving girls , with what cost long study to these men of genius . 
Without mentioning other books we vend , and which obtain circulation , only because they flatter the taste or passions of the buyer , is it not true , that a pretty story of gallantry , secret memoirs , cabinet intrigues , which profess to expose the designs of the government , or the end of some great affair , are the most dangerous books ? 
and these are the kind we sell best . 
Is it us , then , upon whom reproach ought to fall , or on the readers ? '' 
`` He speaks advisedly , '' said a Holland publisher ; `` we have put to press all the follies of certain authors , who wished to revenge themselves , either upon a mistress , judge , minister of state , or prince ; and for this we must needs be adjudged guilty of other 's faults , and share their punishment ! 
but that would have been slight , if we had not meddled with books of religion . 
We have published in Holland the works of all parties ; Christians , Jews , Catholics , Protestants , Socinians , Quakers , and every other sect ; and often in the same book , sold both sides of the controversy . '' 
`` You have then , '' said I , `` no religion ! '' 
`` We are , '' replied the Dutchman , `` the historians of authors ; and as a historian must have neither relations , country , friends , nor religion , even so we have none of these ; but under the name of citizens of the world , have but one object , and that , the advancement of our own interests . '' 
Immediately upon these words , he hastily fled with the others , to re-assemble themselves near the demon of the book merchants , who called for his whole crew . 
I felt great compassion at the fate of these unhappy wretches , condemned to hell , because they were brought up to the profession of publishing the dreams and extravagances of authors : it is worthy also of reflection , that they are compelled to consult the taste of the age , and of the multitude . 
Now the taste of the age is exceedingly fickle : it is not that of learned men and wits ; books of morality and criticism are purchased much less readily than novels and profane histories ; so that book merchants , in their condition , have an unhappiness that attaches itself to no other trade , independently of the fact , that this business is not held in the same estimation at the present day , that it formerly was . 
They were then ranked with men of letters ; they were admitted to the bar and church ; the cardinal Ximenes bestowed on them great preferments ; he ennobled him who published the famous Bible d'arrias montars . 
We see , in his time , publishers who possessed rich abbeys and seats in the council . 
And what was not done for them by the fifth Sixtus , that incomparable genius ? 
In France , they arrived at great distinction , and have been seen in the first posts of the principal cities of the kingdom ; and we know that a celebrated emperor of Germany , was one of the first publishers , if not himself the inventor of printing . 
But to return from this digression : when the book merchants were re-assembled , the notaries , who had just arrived , wished to place themselves in their ranks ; but the devil used his authority to separate them , averring that there was , in fact , a vast difference . 
`` Without doubt , '' said the notaries , `` we are the book merchants of manuscripts ; we compose and publish our works , to which the public accord the same faith , as to things they have themselves seen ; we are faithful public witnesses , the guarantees of contracts , promises , and obligations ; the guardians of titles , rights , and privileges ; our testimony is true , infallible ; above suspicion , deceit , and fraud . '' 
`` Why , '' said the devil , `` are you come to hell ? 
for if you fulfilled those duties , you are honest people , and I declare , not only useful , but necessary to the public ; for , between ourselves , there is so little public sincerity , that if one could not prove , by writings and witnesses , the price at which he bought or sold , he would often find himself cheated of his money . '' 
`` It is , '' said one of the notaries , `` for some antedates or superfluous ciphers , that we are damned ; judge you , if the matter is of such vital consequence ; one is so often deceived by writings , and one figure is so easily substituted for another ; -- the pen too , slips sometimes , and a nought is so easily made ! '' 
`` You are right , in truth , '' said the devil , addressing himself to me ; `` they wrong these poor people , in sending them to us ; they have committed trifling faults , while they do not punish the apothecaries , even , for putting up the recipes sent them . 
I have a great mind to send these unfortunate persons home again . 
-- Go ; return , my friends ; you have suffered great injustice . '' 
`` And we also , '' said the corps of bankrupts ; for they had done them the honour to separate them from the merchants , who had dealt honestly . 
`` As to you , Signors , '' said the devil , `` enter into the furnace , without further examination : we leave it to the notaries to enter at pleasure ; they have within them a torment as cruel as fire ; it is conscience , that never yet respected any person . '' 
`` Oh , oh ! 
ah , ah ! '' 
cried the bankrupts , `` if they had not wronged us , we should have kept our faith with every one : would you , because we were cheated , that we should send our families to the almshouse ? '' 
`` I did not go to Holland , or to the islands , when I failed , '' said one ; `` I shut myself up in a private room in my house , and there negotiated , through my wife , with my creditors , making each one to remit a part of his just claims : you know what would have happened , had I appeared ; there is seldom much charity among creditors . '' 
`` I , '' said another , `` did much better ; for I transported from Madrid to Venice all the merchandises I had collected , changed my name , and after having made a fortune upon these goods , paid the principal , on condition they would remit the interest : was there not in this bankruptcy , good faith , justice , and prudence ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the devil , `` and I can not conceive on what grounds you were condemned ; it is very evident it must have been for something else . '' 
`` No , '' continued the man , `` it was for this very thing ; because they pretend that for these twenty years , I have injured my creditors , in depriving them of the enjoyment and possession of their property ; consider , Signor devil , if I am under an obligation to repair this damage ? 
would it not only be ridiculous , but render them guilty of usury towards me . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the honest man , '' said the devil ; `` why do they send to us folks so upright and sincere ? 
but my friend , '' continued he , `` you have the ill luck to be found in bad company ; we can not help you ; arm yourself , therefore , with courage , and prepare to support the sufferings to which the bankrupts are destined ; you will be forced to accustom yourself to much pain ; but console yourself , by uniting your complaints with those of your comrades . '' 
Directly the devil stamped upon the pavement , where the publishers , notaries , and bankrupts stood , when a trap door , springing open , engulphed them all , and closed itself as before . 
At this stage of my dream , I was awakened by a serenade of violins and hautboys , that some one gave to a young lady of the house . 
I immediately arose , and looking from the window , saw a number of young men , who , after a prelude upon their instruments , began to sing . 
As there was no window but mine open , they imagined they beheld the beauty to whom their homage was addressed ; and to amuse myself at their expense , I threw out a splendid handkerchief , which one of them eagerly caught ; he kissed it more than an hundred times ; then putting a diamond , worth thirty pistoles , into a purse , threw it into my chamber , with a billet couched in these terms : -- `` My charming princess , at night my heart awakes for thee ; by day , I am only occupied with your charms . 
I burn , without cessation , with the love you have inspired ; when shall I have the happiness to express to you in private , what I feel , and what your silence causes me to suffer ? 
one sweet line from your hand , shall re-assure and console me . 
Speak , and nothing can equal my happiness ; continue silent , my misery is at its height , and I have no relief , but in death . '' 
After perusing this billet , I answered it in the following manner , the substance of which was furnished by a song I happened to remember . 
`` When one reigns , or when one loves , the pain is not without its pleasures ; solicitude renders them more vivid . 
Happy prince ! 
Happy lover ! 
it is not in vain you suffer ; they will resist you but slightly , when they themselves suffer from protracted resistance ; yes , when one reigns , or when one loves , the pain is not without its pleasures . '' 
I cast my billet from the window , and it was soon taken up . 
The adventure seemed to me very pleasant : behold what followed ; I deposited in the bed of the fair , the diamond that was designed for her , not being able to keep it longer with honour , and without exposing myself to the anger of the young lady , who would soon know by what window it entered . 
Upon retiring the next night , she found it ; she informed her lover of the discovery , and he explained the whole affair . 
She thanked me graciously for my gallantry ; I gave her the billet I had received , and she returned my handkerchief . 
The mistake arose from my having lain , that night , in the chamber ordinarily occupied by this young lady , her bed having been removed to that of her father , and on that account was unable , as usual , to answer her gallant . 
She made me the confidant of her attachment , and besought my good offices with her father , which I so zealously used , that in less than a month , I assisted at the marriage of these lovers . 
Those who interpret dreams , say , that the one I had concerning hell , hardly presaged this adventure . 
I pray those who read my reveries , or nocturnal visions , to consider that they contain more truth , than one would be apt , at first , to imagine : by day they ought to occupy themselves with thoughts upon hell , as intently as they would in the most important affair ; or as they would seek the means of deliverance , if shut up in prison , for a crime against the state . 
One is damned for a less offence than the robbery of the treasury , revolt , or parricide . 
Yes , for a much slighter fault , one shall be eternally tormented in hell . 
-- Reflect often upon this , dear readers , lest you have it to say , through the interminable ages of futurity , `` I could not have thought it . '' 
AS I promenaded one day in my garden , thinking of demons , which are always at the back of every one , the foolish idea struck me , that it would not be wholly useless to reform my life . 
I felt a curiosity to see my evil demon ; but , thought I to myself , if I should see him I believe I should die with fear . 
No , said I again , I should not be terrified , if he would but show himself in a human shape . 
After having repressed this improper curiosity , and resumed my composure , I heard a man speaking to me ; and turning my eyes to that side from whence the voice proceeded , I perceived , through a grated door , which separated the garden from the park , on the other side , a gentleman of a good mien , who requested me to open the gate , as he wished to have some conversation with me . 
As he resembled a man with whom I had formerly some misunderstanding , I refused ; but he passed over it before I had the power to prevent him . 
Immediately drawing my sword , I set upon him ; and he doing the same , parried my thrusts and stood upon the defensive only . 
As I perceived that his figure at one moment contracted , and anon dilated to a huge magnitude , I began to suspect that he was either a magician or a demon ; and stepping rearward some paces , demanded who he was . 
He answered that he was my demon , and wished to render me a service . 
`` I have no need of such service , '' said I to him ; `` for demons are both deceptive and malicious . '' 
`` No , no , '' replied he ; `` fear nothing ; only come with me . '' 
Forthwith he transported me into the air , and I soon lost sight of my house and garden . 
In a short time we drew near the moon ; and while passing , I gazed attentively upon those valleys , mountains , and lakes , which are but imperfectly perceived from the earth by the aid of telescopes . 
The demon transported me to Sicily and set me down upon the summit of a mountain covered with cinders yet hot , which he told me was Etna . 
There was , from this place , a very fine prospect ; one sees all the beauties of the isle , and of the surrounding seas : in the distance , the highlands of Africa are distinguished , like fleecy clouds , upon the verge of the horizon ; a multitude of vessels were sailing in view , which seemed like white ants , or flies , sporting upon the surface of the ocean . 
After we had rested there about one hour , the demon told me to follow him . 
We descended into an aperture from whence belched forth smoke and flame that illumined the whole mountain . 
`` It is here , '' said the demon , `` that Pliny fell , when he had the temerity to approach too near . '' 
The whole way , as we proceeded , was composed of rocks and fat earth , like bitumen , and from time to time , might be seen veins of sulphur . 
The rocks were full of little crevices , from whence issued vapours and sulphurous exhalations , and sometimes slight gusts of wind . 
When we had travelled downwards about the space of an hour , we came to a vast cavern , into which we entered ; at its extremity was an immense palace , hewn in the rock , and elevated upon massive pillars . 
`` This , '' said the demon , `` is the palace of Lucifer . 
Let us enter into the great hall , where we shall see him give a general audience to the damned : listen attentively to what shall be said ; examine the events that take place , and let what you shall see serve for your instruction . '' 
The following is a correct account of what I saw in these subterraneous abodes . 
-- For a long time , Lucifer , the ruler of hell had not given audience to his subjects : the disorder that ordinarily obtain in states from the negligence of princes , are incidental as well among demons as men . 
The evil spirits remained sometimes for ages in the world , without rendering any account of the souls they had gained , and often suffered themselves to be driven from the tenements of which they were masters ; the address of some monk or priest snatching from them their conquest . 
Men performed in hell the office of demons ; and as they frequently left their chains to seek their enemies , battles were as common , as formerly between the Romans and Gauls . 
Lucifer , either from a fear for his crown , or weariness at seeing so many combats , resolved one day to hear , in general convention , the complaints of the damned ; to introduce a reform among the demons ; to re-establish the submission and obedience due to his sceptre , and to extend the boundaries of his empire by new conquests : this was very easy of execution , provided he would give access and free parlance to his subjects , and compel his demons to render an exact account of their administrations . 
With this design he secretly consulted with Belzebub , the prince of devils , Belial , the governor-general of Pagan nations , and Ashtaroth , the princess who commands all women . 
At the termination of this council , circular letters were published , which ordained that all those who had complaints to prefer , and all the demons scattered over the world , should assemble upon an appointed day in the great hall of the palace , when and where they should be heard . 
The day fixed being arrived , the hall was presently filled , and measures taken , that as soon as one party was heard , another should enter . 
Lucifer was seated upon his golden throne , having upon each side those princes I have before mentioned . 
After having inveighed against the disorders prevalent in hell , and stated his determination to rectify them , he signified his permission to the standers by to speak . 
At this intimation there arose an old man of a haughty appearance , and having a crown of laurel upon his head ; he read the Roman laws touching parricides , and amplified upon the ingratitude of natural and adopted children towards their parents . 
`` The parties , '' said Belzebub to Lucifer , `` must be ordered , before commencing their speeches , to announce their names , because many of them have been dead a great length of time . '' 
Such a decree was accordingly made ; and he who had now spoken about half an hour , said that he was Julius Cæsar , the first emperor of the Romans . 
`` Under the pretext of the liberty of our common country , '' continued he , `` Brutus and Cassius , to gratify their ambition , assassinated me in the midst of the senate , their enmity was not directed against the empire and monarchy , which were , on the contrary , the object of their desires ; but they hated the emperor , who had magnified the Roman power , and extended its dominion both north and east . 
Was the government better administered in the hands of those senators , who , by their feuds and personal dislikes , perilled the salvation of the republic , by resigning it into the hands of a perpetual dictation , whom they were obliged shortly afterwards to elect ? 
Rome having once tasted the benefits of monarchy , preferred rather to obey a Nero , a Tiberius , a Caligula , or a Heliogabulus , than to re-establish this pretended public liberty , for which Brutus and Cassius , those two traitors , took up arms against the father of their country . '' 
He continued his discourse in this strain , and concluded by moving , that they should be treated in hell as assassins , public disturbers , and traitors . 
Brutus then arose , and with a trembling voice , said : `` Senators , you have heard Cæsar ; have you not been biassed by his eloquence ? 
But will you forget the services I have rendered ? 
Remember the advice you privately gave me , to encourage the glorious design I had conceived in favour of your liberty ? 
Answer then to Cæsar , that it was by your advice I gave the fatal stab ; that if the laws had not been abrogated and violated by the formidable power of tyranny , you would , yourselves , have put him to death under the forms of justice ; and that your silence , after the execution of my project , was an evidence of your approbation . '' 
Cassius , assuming the discourse , said he would not undertake to plead his own cause if Cicero was present . 
`` I will not , '' said Cæsar , `` listen to this timid sycophant ; this cowardly soul ; this selfish orator : when he feared my power , he said , in full senate , that he would be my buckler against enemies , and , at the same time , conspired against my life , and defends the act of Brutus and Cassius . 
His cupidity was so eager , that for money , he might be bought on the same day to speak upon both sides of a case ; and so sober-tongued , that there was not a soldier in the army , who would have bestowed upon his greatest foe one tittle of the scurrility he heaped upon Anthony . 
You recollect , Signors , his phillipics : he had not the courage to support a change of fortune ; and the common cause was abandoned by this patriotic man before he was slain by Anthony . '' 
`` May all such wretches be ever punished in the same manner ! 
and with what can they reproach me ? 
Did I put any senator to death ? 
Did I pillage the commonwealth ? 
Did I not return , by my will , what I had amassed and conserved for her defence ? 
Will they accuse me of tyranny and usurpation ? 
I , who delivered the Romans from the ambition of a Pompey ? 
Will they charge me with cruelty ? 
I , who could not behold without weeping the head of my most inveterate enemy ? 
Yes , I can truly say , that it was grief at the sad fate of Pompey , that invited me to declare war against Egypt . 
I was desirous of avenging the death of this great man . 
He would have made himself master of Rome if I had not prevented him ; and because I stood forth as the defender of the public liberty , was assassinated as a usurper . 
What wickedness ! 
What perfidy ! 
What cruelty ! 
The senate recognized every thing I had done , when , after my death , they erected statues , and built me temples . 
Infernal judge , will you bear with these impious men , who killed him whom the empire delighted to honour ? '' 
Cicero would have spoken , fearing the eloquence of Cæsar , or his vehemency , would impose upon the judges ; but Cæsar constantly interrupting him , Lucifer , tired with their clamours and the length of the cause , ordered that the emperor , as a punishment for not having profited by the advice he received on his way to the senate , upon the day of his death , should remain in his present place . 
`` It was I , '' said Cicero , `` who caused this information to be sent him . '' 
`` Base liar ! 
perfidious man ! '' 
cried Cæsar , `` it was you who gave me this information ! 
why did you not bring it yourself ? '' 
`` It was the will of Fate , that Brutus , Cassius , and other senators , involved in this conspiracy , should be marks for infamy , as traitors to their country , and as having afforded a direful example of politicians without courage . '' 
After him arose Alexander the Great , very much vexed that Cæsar had spoken before him , and pretending that the cause of this Roman emperor should not be considered before that of the emperor of the world ; but he abandoned his pretensions , when a crier had made proclamation , that in hell , all conditions were equal , and that the damned had among them , no other distinctions than those of crime . 
`` Infamous prince , '' said Clytus , who stood behind Alexander , `` dare you speak , after having murdered the best of your friends ? 
Is not the brightness of thy conquests tarnished by the shame of thy cruelty ? 
What punishment dost thou merit , for having despoiled princes so distant from Macedon , who , so far from having wronged or injured you , did not even know you ? '' 
`` Silence , '' said Alexander . 
`` What ! 
I be silent ! 
if Lucifer , the chief of this empire , imposes silence upon me , I will obey : but shall I yet receive orders from you , cruel brigand , notorious robber , sacrilegious rascal , debauchee , fool , drunkard , incendiary ? '' 
`` No , no : speak , son of Olympias , '' said Lucifer to Alexander . 
He began thus : `` Alexander , son of Jupiter Amnion , lord of the world , most high and mighty emperor , conqueror of the habitable globe -- '' Clytus laughed at the boasts : `` what a lord ! 
what an emperor ! 
what a god ! 
Behold the titles which I dispute . 
In the first place , his mother was a virtuous woman . 
She but mocked her son , who , through pride , accused her with having committed adultery with Jupiter Amnion . 
Secondly , he was not lord of the world ; since he did not conquer the tenth part of it : and thirdly , it is false that he is a great emperor ; for an emperor is only ennobled by heroic virtues and qualities , which he did not possess . 
And how is it possible that he should be the conqueror of the habitable globe , having never been neither to Africa , nor very far in Europe , nor to China ? 
Thus he is only Alexander , as I am Clytus . '' 
Here Lucifer passed an order that this prince should only assume the titles that veritably pertained to him , and permitted Clytus to continue . 
`` I was , '' said Clytus , `` the prime favourite of this Alexander , who , wishing to conquer every body , had no enemy nearer and more powerful than himself . 
Contemplate our portraits : I was his favourite , and I have always seen him as ambitious of distinction in wickedness as he was for honourable action : but as a foundation to my complaints against him , I ought to state , that this prince , elevated by his flatterers to a place among the gods , was accustomed to speak without respect of Philip his father . 
He showed himself more munificent towards gladiators , musicians , and drunkards , than towards his bravest captains . 
In conformity to this disposition , he gave the kingdom of Sidon to Abdolonymus , a well-digger ; he committed numberless extravagances at the instigation of his mistresses ; to please a courtesan named Roxana , he burnt the palace of the Persian kings ; his conduct towards Parmenio , Philotas , and Calisthenes , as well as Aminthus , his relation , is sufficient proof of his barbarity . 
And did he not exhibit more than cruelty towards me ? 
I was the most faithful of his confidants ; he who flattered him the least ; who gave him the best of counsel ; to whom he owed his reputation and honour . 
Alas ! 
because I had the presumption to speak my true sentiments at a feast , he arose from the table and inflicted upon me a mortal wound . 
I now demand expiation . 
King of hell , revenge Clytus , punish Alexander . '' 
This prince then replied as follows : -- `` Favourites bear the same relation to sovereigns as mice to cats . '' 
At this exordium Clytus began to laugh , and said : `` Listen to a comparison worthy of the disciple of Aristotle . '' 
`` The mouse , '' continued Alexander , `` seems at first to divert itself with the cat ; but finally this animal , being more powerful , devours the mouse , who can not accuse her with cruelty for wishing to take her turn in the sport . 
Such , about me , was the condition of Clytus : but to demonstrate the mistake of this ungrateful favourite , I aver , that it is the policy of princes to keep favourites , who are towards them neither forward nor haughty ; and not to accord them too much power . 
The liberties they take with us cause us to fall into contempt ; their hauteur makes us appear timid , and their power fills us with just suspicions . 
Clytus having thus taken advantage of me , I was frequently ashamed of his familiarities . 
Such was his pride , that if I dared to contradict him in the least thing , he reared up like an unruly horse : my bounty had rendered him so powerful , that he was in fact Alexander , and I was but Clytus . 
In particular , he abused my mistresses , and the officers of my house ; in counsel he was always right and I wrong ; in every battle , it was he that was victorious , and I who had been slack and timid . 
If I put some to death , it was but consonant with justice , to punish the seditious or conspiring ; if I burnt the palace of the kings of Persia , it was for the purpose of destroying a fortress that had been used against me ; if the pleasures that were indulged in after my conquests were sometimes too free , it arose from a desire to gratify my generals ; in fine , the death of Clytus crushed those treasonous designs of which I had notice . 
He only waited for an opportunity to set one part of my army against the other , and to despatch me . 
I sang at a feast the songs my soldiers had composed upon their officers and myself ; I rallied Clytus for having , in a certain action , taken to flight : this madman let loose his rage upon me ; he loaded me with contumely ; the wine he had drank deprived him of reason : I thought it was time to punish his audacity , and to prevent the excesses to which it might carry him . 
Thus perished an usurping , traitorous , insolent and unworthy favourite . 
Lucifer , I have spoken the truth . '' 
After having heard the parties , the king said to his demons , `` Take notice how proper it is that a subject should be faithful and submissive to his prince ; and that a favourite should not go beyond the respect he owes to his sovereign . 
We do order that as long as Alexander shall be tormented by his ambition , Clytus shall experience all the remorse that springs from rashness and ingratitude . '' 
At the same moment was heard the voice of Seneca , speaking to Nero : `` Cruel prince , how have you profited by the lessons of clemency , goodness , and humanity I have given you ? 
Did you not murder me to repossess yourself of the wealth I had received from you ? 
Such was my recompense for having raised you to empire . 
Was it not I who saved you from the conspiracy formed by Piso , after you had set fire to all quarters of Rome ? 
Was it not I who delivered you from the snares which had been spread for you by the friends of your mother Agrippina , whom you afterwards put to death ? 
I was more careful of your reputation than yourself , when I advised you not to exhibit yourself as a comedian upon the theatre ; when you entered the lists to dispute the prize of poetry with Lucan , whom you afterwards assassinated . '' 
`` Old fool , '' said Nero , in a slender voice , `` thou wert become unworthy of my favours by thy excessive ambition , and by the dishonour you brought upon my palace . 
Great Lucifer , you see a man who , being my preceptor , did not profit by his own theory . 
He maintained a shameful commerce with my mother ; and with a view to favour it , poisoned the Emperor Claudius , my father , who did not commit suicide , as was the prevalent opinion at Rome . 
The partiality of my mother filled him with such audacity , that he projected mounting the throne , and having me poisoned . 
I was informed of the intrigue , which I suspected before having received positive advice . 
I observed that his immense wealth had obtained him very many friends among the senators , gentlemen , and officers of the army ; and it is worth while , also , to know , that this man who preached so much about frugality , and the love of mediocrity , was far from practising these virtues , which are easily reported of a man possessing twelve millions of revenue . 
After having punished the tyranny and usurpation of my mother , I was bound to punish the crimes of Seneca ; but I was yet lenient enough to leave the manner of his death to his own choice . '' 
`` The subjects and favourites of princes , '' said Lucifer , `` are always culpable , when they are ungrateful , or entertain any other desire than the prosperity of their masters : they ought to leave to them the recompense of their services , without attempting to reward themselves . 
We will , then , that the philosopher , Seneca , born in Spain , should be punished as if he had compassed his designs upon Nero : and that Nero be treated as an unjust and barbarous prince . '' 
`` This ordinance , '' said Sejanus , `` does not concern me : Tiberius caused me to be assassinated without reason , actuated by one of those suspicions to which he was usually addicted . 
He was troubled more by a fear of losing his life , than the empire . 
His courtezans had too much influence over him . 
As to myself , I have never punished any but the enemies of Tiberius : to be sure , they were also mine . 
But were not , in truth , the opposers of a minister who governed as well as I did , foes to their prince and country ? '' 
Tiberius would have answered ; but Lucifer , interrupting him , ordered that all the favourites of princes should come in . 
There appeared a vast number , among them Plautius , the favourite of Severus , was particularly remarkable : also Faustus , the favourite of Phyrrhus , king of Epirus ; Pyreneus and Cleandrus , favourites of the emperor Commodus ; Cincinnatus , favourite of Britulus ; Rufus , favourite of Domitian ; Ampronisius , favourite of Adrian ; Belisarius , favourite of Justinian . 
`` Listen , '' said Lucifer ; `` the favour of princes is like quick-silver , the motion of which can not be arrested , and which flies the endeavour to restrain it . 
If one would sublimate it , it is a vapour that exhales itself ; and often , if too much is used , it becomes dangerous . 
If one anoints with it , it penetrates to the very bones : those who are accustomed to draw it from the mine , and purify it , contract a malady which makes them tremble all their lives . 
This is the character of princes ' favour : it is inconstant , because it depends upon the humour and passion of one who seeks only novelty and the pleasure of the moment . 
If you are importunate , if you exhibit the least sign of impatience , if you are even suspected of prudence in the management of your credit or fortune , the attachment of the prince will cool . 
If you show any marks of envy against another , of discontent in yourself , or indifference in the presence of your protector , he suspects you , and passes straightway from suspicion to enmity and hatred . 
Bear then with resignation your bad fortune and the humour of your master : your pains , attentions , time , health , wealth all lost , you are at length obliged to return into your humble retreat , there to expect death ; which , to your grief , comes not soon enough to free you from regret and the remembrance of your follies . 
A casual sally , an instant of good humor , a lucky word , a sudden caprice , a nothing , makes a favourite . 
Five or six years suffice for his fortune ; if delayed , it escapes him . 
The same causes can bestow or withdraw favour . 
A favourite ought to make these reflections in his prosperity , -- that he must abstain from those liberties that are common among equals , and that freedom which friends indulge in ; that he must be constantly submissive , and know how to accompany respect with complaisance ; that the prince ought always to speak the first word in a confidential affair ; and to preserve his secrets , he must dispose himself to every kind of privation . 
He who hath not regulated his conduct by these precepts must bear the burden of his own imprudence ; and for this reason we order that those favourites who have incurred the displeasure of their sovereigns shall be punished as unfaithful subjects . '' 
Lucifer then commanded an old man to advance , whom he perceived in the hall behind the others . 
There advanced then a man of a pleasant countenance , in a Greek habit , and followed by other persons clothed in the same manner . 
`` I am Solon , '' said this old man : `` I gave to the Athenians laws which they did not exactly follow ; this person contiguous to me is the philosopher Anaxarchus , whom the tyrant Nicocreon caused to be brayed in a mortar : in this little hump-back , behold the famous Aristotle , preceptor to the great Alexander : his philosophy excused the disciple from practising the morality he taught . 
This academician is Socrates , whom his fellow citizens put to death with a cup of hemlock . 
This old man is the divine Plato , who , spite of the sublimity of his doctrine , sold oil for the defrayment of his expenses . 
All the rest are men of letters , who , like ourselves , have excited the envy , and experienced the vengeance of the princes , Archons and Tyrants , of Athens ; and it is now upon these tyrants we unitedly demand vengeance . '' 
Then Denis , the tyrant , accompanied by some other princes , presented themselves and spoke in this manner : -- `` Of whom do these old dotards complain ? 
Infatuated by their conceits , they pretended to dictate law to the whole world ! 
In fact they had so imbued the people with their dogmas and their customs , that when we wished to make some changes , they excited sedition . 
They had so much pride and presumption , that they arrogated to themselves alone the possession of common sense and reason ; while in truth they were distinguished but for opinions founded upon vain subtleties , and by a language not common and familiar to men : -- and now I should like to ask them what certain knowledge they had ; what was their idea upon the nature of the soul ? 
and what constituted the reason and equity of their laws ? '' 
`` I will add to that , '' said Julian , the apostate , `` that there are pedants , who , under the affectation of austerity , concealed the most extreme ambition . 
Do they complain of the contempt that was shown them , when their manner of living exposed them to it ? 
Will they speak of their poverty , who would not labour for a living ? 
The people of letters deceive themselves if they believe that princes and the public ought to enrich them for vain and useless sciences . 
Should they not make their calculation for that , when , idle in their cabinets , they amuse themselves in contemplating the figures and number of the stars , which they apply , to find fault with the common prejudices of our ancestors ? '' 
`` At least , '' observed Cato of Utica , `` you can not make those remarks with regard to Cicero , or myself , who have exercised the highest magistracies of Rome . '' 
`` Old fox , '' answered Julian , `` I can not , it is true , say so of you two ; for if you were attached to letters , you were still more so to your fortunes . 
And of whom can you complain , you who accelerated your own death ? 
Did you not hope to gain an easy immortality in thus quitting your terrestrial abode ? 
It was to arrive at this , that you did not wish to survive the pretended misfortunes of your country . 
Fine courage that , of a man who kills himself to escape fighting with his enemies ! 
Would you not have done better to have preserved yourselves for the defence of Rome , its liberty , and your goods ? '' 
`` I recommend you , '' said Cato , `` to the Antiochians : they will tell the truth of you better than I can : they know you ; they are fully acquainted with your pusillanimity , your vices , but , above all , with your vanity , which surpasses your knowledge and eloquence . 
Look at this great emperor , who , to punish Antioch , quits the sword , assumes the pen , and is , after all , nothing but an ignoramus . '' 
`` I am called Suetonius , '' said he , who presented himself next . 
`` Yes , this is Suetonius , '' said the emperor Domitian , who was at his side ; `` this is that notorious forger , and compiler of histories and chronicles , who , after the example of other historians , being a partisan and a flatterer , speaks the truth from caprice , and lies from inclination . '' 
`` I ! '' 
said Suetonius ; `` I have said nothing that I can not prove by indubitable evidence . 
Is it not true , that upon the testimony of vile informers , you have taken from the living , the estates of the dead who were accused ? 
Is it not true that you have levied upon your subjects tributes so enormous , that they were forced to claim protection from a foreign power ? 
Is it not true that you have despoiled the Jews of their goods only because they were born Jews ? 
Is it then a crime to have been circumcised at birth and not to adore the gods of the Roman empire ? 
Is it not true that by your excessive expenses for theatres , and buildings , you have exhausted the purses of the Romans , and left to perish with hunger the bravest soldiers of the army ? 
To escape the consequences of a sedition , you committed horrible pillages , and thus paid your debts . 
Your pride and impiety are exhibited in these few words , extracted from one of your declarations : ` Your Lord , your God , ' commands thus . '' 
`` What signifies that ? '' 
said Domitian : `` Are not the emperors gods as well during their lives as after their death ? 
Were not Augustus and Cæsar adored in the empire ? 
I was as much a god at the time I willed it , as my predecessors have been gods after their death . 
The divinity of men is nothing but a power superior to that of others , as the present divinity of Augustus is but a perfection above the virtues and qualities of living men . 
But who , among men of sense , has ever believed that the gods were like men ? 
or adored in the statue any thing more than the virtue of the original ? 
Who ever believed that the number of gods was equal to their names , their temples , or their statues ? 
No , no , Suetonius , you did not believe all this , and it is from perfidiousness that you have accused me of impiety for being called a god . '' 
`` And your unjust vexations , '' replied Suetonius . 
`` As it regards that , '' said the emperor , `` subjects who can not penetrate the designs of their sovereigns always consider the tributes imposed upon them as unjust ; but if enemies were about to inundate the kingdom ; if the empire was menaced with approaching ruin ; if there was danger of the pillage and sack of frontier cities , would not the prince have reason to take measures for the prevention of these disasters by a heavier levy , and a stronger assemblage of troops ? 
If I had apprized the Romans of these things , which I had learned by my spies , they would have been more likely to have risen against myself , than against the common enemy : so powerful is the voice of interest with the multitude ! '' 
Here Lucifer interrupted the emperor and ordered all the historians , historiographers , authors of journals , of memoirs and chronicles , to advance , to listen to their sentence . 
`` It is , '' said he , `` for the public interest , that mendacity should be punished in writers , as in those who speak falsely ; but it is of equal interest that writers should be permitted to speak the truth , without flattery and without fear , to the end , that men by reading the history of their ancestors , may learn to become good , and detest the conduct of the unjust . 
Although it is crime that brings us subjects , we wish , nevertheless , that it should be punished in our empire ; and it is that which constitutes the justice of the torments they feel . 
A prince flatters himself in vain with a fine and secret policy , if his subjects are rendered unhappy by the rules he has prescribed for their conduct ; whatever colour he may take to cover his actions , and make them appear just , if they are not so in effect , which the event proves , he expects in vain the approbation , the esteem and love of his subjects . 
The writer who undertakes a history ought to divest himself of the sentiments of both love and hatred ; he ought to have no partiality for country , relations or friends ; he is the sole judge of the affairs of which he treats , and the master of princes when he describes their actions . 
Accordingly , we ordain , that Domitian and the other princes shall submit to the judgments of their historians ; that the historians shall be punished for flatteries and lies ; for the examination of which , we order them before the tribunals of conscience , to whom we delegate plenary authority for the decision of their cases ; and as a judgment upon the geometricians , geographers , astronomers , and mathematicians , we condemn the one party to measure by minutes , seconds , and lines , the dimensions of all the provinces , kingdoms , and empires of the earth ; and the others to be shut up in the planets upon which they have pretended to make observations , to the end that they may be instructed by their experience . 
Furthermore we decree , that afterwards , the aforesaid geometricians , geographers , astronomers , and mathematicians , to be there punished for their foolish and rash opinions . '' 
The audience having now lasted a considerable time , Lucifer commanded something to eat to be brought into the middle of the hall . 
Forthwith there appeared a vast number of chirurgians , cooks of hell , with an almost equal number of apothecaries , having the title of confectioners to the devil . 
They set forth a great table of gold , upon which they placed a vast quantity of silver plate : they informed me that this table and plate had been fabricated with the gold and silver stolen , and afterwards sold to the goldsmiths . 
I have never any where seen such a quantity of linen : it proceeded from the thefts committed by linen dealers and washer women ; for all that is stolen upon earth , goes into hell after the second or third generation of thieves . 
They served for the first course a heap of tailors roasted upon the spit . 
Lucifer is very fond of this meal ; and the expression , `` may the devil swallow me , '' which the tailors often use , is not inappropriate ; for he does swallow many ; and the demons , his table companions , do the same : the subjects always having tastes similar to those of their masters , be they good or bad . 
I inquired of one of the demons , why his infernal majesty devoured more tailors than cooks , sausage makers , butchers , peruquiers , in short , people of other trades . 
`` It is , '' said he , `` for a very politic reason ; for otherwise he would soon want subjects of any other description ; those of other trades are by far the least in number , while the others are so plenty , that if we could eat them all in one day , the morrow would supply as many more : they arrive continually , in one eternal troop . 
Sometimes in beholding them afar off , we imagine them to be entire armies , coming to besiege us : this trade is more useful in hell , than you would be apt to think : we send among the tailors , young devils without experience : their shops are so many academies for our youth . 
If you had nice eyes , you might perceive more than fifty young demons in each tailor shop ; some cut the cloth ; others the list ; these take away the superfluous pieces ; those put them in the place they call the street ; while some do nothing but open and shut the place they call the eye . 
Some carry the cabbaged pieces to sell ; others make complete suits out of the patterns cut from the cloth ; in fine , there are many about the women , girls , and valets of the tailor , to assist them in stealing the cloth , or stretching the binding . 
When these young devils have finished their diabolical apprenticeship , they are sent to the merchants . 
In that station they abridge all the measures , and sometimes throw themselves into the scale , among the merchandise , to make it weigh more : if you could see all their tricks , you would be highly amused . '' 
When this course was removed from the table , they served another of tailors , roasted upon the gridiron : after that , others , baked in pates , smothered in a pot , fried in a pan , and dressed in a hundred different ways , with this only difference , that those of each nation had a particular dressing . 
The French tailors were spitted ; the English , grilled ; the Holland , fried ; the Germans , smothered in a pot ; the Italians , made into ragout ; the Spanish , boiled , because they are ordinarily hard ; the Polonese , in pates ; the Hungarians , salad ; the Turks , cooked in rice ; the Greeks , in wine ; the Arabians , dried in the sun ; the Egyptians , with onion sauce ; the Algerines , fried in lard ; the Portuguese , preserved in sugar ; the Danish , Swedish , and Muscovite , were almost all dressed in the same manner ; that is to say , baked in brandy ; the Tartar , boiled in horse grease ; the Persian , fricaseed with gravy de demon ; the Indians , baked in bananas ; the Chinese , and all the islanders , were very much seasoned with spices and sugar ; the Ethiopians , negroes of Fez , Morocco , and Guinea , were baked in black butter ; and the Americans , in milk . 
`` What an immense quantity of tailors , '' said I to the demon who was near me ; `` your cooks must understand their business , to be able to compound so many dishes of viands , which differ no more the one from the other , than the bullocks of Spain from those of Ireland . '' 
They served to Lucifer wine of the various publicans of the world . 
`` Fie ! '' 
said I to the demon ; `` your master is hardly a connoisseur of wine . '' 
`` You are mistaken , '' said he ; `` it is true , that this wine has been mixed with water , sugar , and spices ; but the publicans are obliged to separate all these drugs , even the water which they ordinarily put in , from the rest , which remains pure , fair and clear ; if the publicans did not do this , they would put them in the press , and draw from their veins all the wine they had themselves drank . '' 
`` How ! '' 
said I , `` do you live upon nothing but human flesh ? '' 
`` How should we live else ? '' 
answered he . 
`` Can we eat beef , mutton , partridges , fish , and beans ? 
These animals come not hither , but in smoke ; and herbs will not grow in a place so hot . '' 
`` How can you say that animals come here in smoke ? '' 
`` It is those the idolaters sacrifice to the prince of demons : this smoke penetrates even to this place , and is the only perfume agreeable to our sovereign ; for as to the scented oils , powders , and pomatums , of which the men and women of the other life make use , Lucifer is so incommoded , that those who are thus scented , dare not approach his apartment . '' 
`` Egad ! '' 
said I , `` Lucifer has then a smell keener than that of a hound . '' 
`` Yes : he has so fine a scent , that he instantly knows whether a girl has been cautious or not ; whether she has been married , or not , and the exact number of times : and the other day there came here a menette , who made a profession of menettisme , wearing the habits , air , et cetera : she wanted to make every thing appear smooth , saying , that she had been sent here for having administered to herself the discipline , contrary to the direction of her directors : but the prince approaching her , perceived , and said immediately , that this habit , modest as it was , covered much indevotion , sacrilege , gallantry , and falsehood . 
The young girl retired abashed ; she had not imagined that any person could discover , under the exterior of such simplicity , what she had been guilty of , during her life ; you see Lucifer has an exquisite nose . '' 
`` If he has , '' said I , `` the other senses in a similar perfection , he well merits the commandery of hell . '' 
In the mean time , Lucifer , and the other lords , invited to his table , continued to eat with good appetite : besides the individuals of his council , there were a great number whom I heard designated by the names given to the gods of fable , such as Jupiter , Saturn , Apollo , Mercury : and to goddesses , such as Juno , Venus , Diana , Proserpina , and others ; I should think there were at least fifty persons at table . 
These gods and goddesses were men and women , like the others ; and in reflecting upon that circumstance , I thought they were princesses and princes , whom the people had put in the place of gods . 
But these ignorant people deceive themselves ; for their gods , instead of being in heaven , are in hell . 
The same thing often happens in the world ; a particular person is looked upon as a man of honour , who is , in fact , worse than one whom they consider the most knavish ; another as a good man , who , in truth , is one of the worst ; they frequently speak of one as happy after death , whose lot , if they did but know it , is quite the contrary : this is the sentiment of saint Pere , who said , `` they peopled heaven with the inhabitants of hell . '' 
The dessert served up to this great demon , was very pleasant to behold : it consisted of hypocrites , bigots , and apostate monks , all preserved in sugar : in the middle of it was a country seat in sugar : one could perceive the chateau , with its fosses , garden , park , wood , closes , vineyards , fish-ponds , fountains , jets of water , mill , stables , and farms ; the whole being executed in the most perfect symmetry of architecture . 
The demon observing my surprise , told me , the devil usually devoured goods unjustly acquired : `` have you not , '' said he , `` heard it remarked , that property illy gotten , failed not to go to the devil ? 
It comes to us ; for be it known to you , that what is lost in the world , falls down here . 
You can find in our magazines things of every description : the entire shops of merchants , stores of grain and wine , tons of silver , an arsenal filled with arms , cabinets of jewellery and precious stones , tablets covered with antique medals , a kind of pantheon , filled with idols of gold , silver , and bronze , which you have no doubt seen at the houses of antiquaries : for the fruits of larcenies , spunging , and usury , always come straight to us . '' 
After the desert , the Jews and Turks brought coffee , tea , chocolate , tobacco , aqua vitæ , liquors , and opium . 
The lords drank of all , and Jupiter partook so freely of tobacco and brandy , that he became quite elevated : he began to sing a song in the Greek language , the substance of which was : `` What a charming spectacle for the mighty Lucifer ! 
the dead dispersed throughout this cavern , are to him delicious meats . 
Subtle Love , and you gods of combat , theft , and drunkenness , contribute to content the taste and desires of our sovereign . 
So long as one remains in Tartarus , he must not hope for any other pleasure ; we must not think of objects to be procured in other places . '' 
-- While Jupiter repeated this song , Juno accompanied him , saying : `` So long as one regains in Tartarus , he must not hope for any other pleasure . 
Lovers , you enhance our joy , for death hath separated you for ever . '' 
-- In imitation of Jupiter and Juno , Mercury and Mars sang thus : `` Yes , while one remains in Tartarus , he can not hope for other pleasures . 
The money which was our love , is lost for ever : we love it still , but despairing of enjoyment . '' 
-- Mars , with a voice of thunder , sang . 
`` Yes , when one is in Tartarus , he must not hope for other pleasures . 
War , which was our delight , is no more for us , but a vain flourish : here one hears neither fife nor drum . '' 
After this little concert , which amused Lucifer , he made them call the players upon instruments , who joined the gods and goddesses . 
There was then heard the most frightful music : with the sound of violins and other instruments , which were played upon by those who had been musicians in the other world , there mingled a horrid noise of thunder , and raging wind , such as it produces when it rushes through a straight street , or groans , amid a wood of firs . 
This noise was succeeded by another , like that which is heard at the eruption of Mount Vesuvius or Etna : my ear was struck with a bellowing , like that of the sea , when agitated by a furious tempest . 
All these agents yielded to a choir of voices , that issued from the lowest depths : there was heard nothing but complaints , groans , cries , and howlings , similar to those of dogs , impatient of confinement . 
I should have expired with fear , if I had not been previously warned , that this was the music which would divert the prince of hell . 
Jupiter and Mars , in spite of their intrepidity , found this music so disagreeable , that they ceased singing , and signified their uneasiness to Lucifer . 
They then removed the table , and the service of plate ; and the audience having been resumed , they began to call up cases of different states ; and after having disposed of those pertaining to the people of justice , the sword , and the church , they cited the women of all conditions . 
The beautiful Helen then appeared , who complained that at her return from the siege of Troy , she had been condemned to be hung by Polixo , her relation , at whose house , in the isle of Rhodes , she had taken refuge , Nisistratus and Megapontus having driven her from Greece . 
She was asked if she had consented to be abducted by Paris ; if she had accorded him the last favours before leaving Peloponessus ; if she had granted the same to the king of Egypt , when his vessel touched at her country . 
She answered ingenuously to these questions , that having been married by policy and force , to prince Menelaus , she had acquainted him that she did not love him . 
`` Did you love , '' said Lucifer , `` the Trojan prince before marriage ? '' 
`` I had not then seen him ; but my heart was never for Menclaus ; it was free when Paris came to Argos , and its first impression was in favour of this stranger prince . 
Am I culpable for all the evils caused by the siege of Troy ? 
Furthermore , the Greeks ought not to complain of this abduction , as a breach of hospitality : some years before , they had taken away a Trojan lady ; and in ancient times , had not Jupiter , of Grecian origin , stolen Europa , a young princess of Asia , from this part of the world , inhabited by Trojans ? '' 
Menelaus spoke after his wife , whose ingratitude and infidelity he exaggerated ; he accused her of having poisoned him on the return from Troy . 
`` Why assassinate me , when she had the liberty to go to her relations ? 
Could I have done more to express my regret at her loss , after her elopement , than by building to her memory a temple , consecrated to Venus ? '' 
`` You are a very clever man , '' said Jupiter to Menelaus ; `` who told you that a husband could make his wife love him by caresses and services ? 
A woman who does not love her husband , takes all his cares for stratagems , invented by jealousy : she believes him false and wicked . 
Accuse only your patience and weakness ; and between ourselves who are dead , since the living can not hear it , it is a very good joke , to make so much noise about the infidelity of a coquette : '' and Jupiter sang a song , the burden of which was , that one was often very happy to be rid of his wife , as he then could enjoy the advantages of liberty . 
`` Am I permitted to be as stoical as you are ? '' 
said Menelaus . 
`` One must have a great force of spirit , to vanquish a passion like that of love : how cruel , to love without return ! 
Ah ! 
I now condemn myself : let Helen prosecute her quarrel with her relation Polixo , to which I am a stranger . '' 
`` Since this Grecian prince is voluntarily condemned , '' said Lucifer , `` I am about to pass sentence upon the husbands who have complained of their wives ; and upon the wives who have complained of their husbands . '' 
The judgment was couched in these words : `` Since love is natural , and no one can dictate a woman 's will , and since neither the jealousy nor severity of a husband are of any avail , to compel a wife to conjugal fidelity , we order , that all husbands shall suffer the pain of foolish and indiscreet love , without having from that any pretence to restrain them ; provided , however , that they may revenge themselves with chance intrigues , and contribute , by their patience and complaisance , to the ruin of their rivals . 
We ordain , also , that women who complain of the amours of their husbands , shall be condemned to the torments of jealousy ; with an equal permission to those ladies who are not beloved by their husbands , to receive the cares and attentions of their neighbours . 
Finally , we forbid the married of both sexes , to bring any more actions upon these subjects , and reject them , in advance , from court . 
We command our demons , and principally Asmodeus , the demon of marriage , to bear in hand the execution of the present ordinance . 
Given in hell , at the grand audience hall , to be signified to whom it may concern . 
-- Signed , Lucifer , king of hell : and countersigned by my lord , the devil Patiras . '' 
`` Signor , '' said Cleopatra , `` this edict can not prejudice my rights against Augustus , emperor of the Romans : his ambition prompted him to attach to his triumphal car the queen of the Egyptians : to save myself from this shame , I laid violent hands upon myself . 
I demand that Augustus should be punished as guilty of my death . '' 
`` Am I responsible for your actions ? '' 
said Augustus . 
`` Who informed you that I should put this indignity upon you ? 
Cæsar had loved you ; Pompey also , as I believe : that Antony did , no one can doubt . 
The reputation of those charms by which you had subdued the conquerors of the world , had made such an impression upon my heart , that I would not only have made you its governor , but have re-established you upon the throne of your ancestors ; but the timidity so natural to your sex , pride , and haughtiness , misled you : the poison you employed to produce death was so subtle , that I could never discover its nature . '' 
`` All ! 
tyrant , '' said Antony to Augustus , `` you were not satisfied with having at the same time caused my death and the loss of my empire ; but you must also effect the death of my spouse , whom I preferred to the throne . '' 
`` I deny that , '' replied Augustus ; `` you abandoned the field of battle to follow Cleopatra ; yourself commanded a servant to give the blow of death , to prevent falling into my hands ; it was in conformity to your counsel that Cleopatra killed herself ; great Lucifer , I am innocent of these things . '' 
`` We ordain , '' said Lucifer , `` that both parties should be delivered to their remorse of conscience ; if they are not satisfied with this judgment , let them present themselves before Astarte , sovereign of women , to whom Venus and Pallas are associated , where their cases shall be more amply examined . '' 
There came next a queen , accompanied by many women and girls , armed as soldiers : this was said to be the foundress of the kingdom of the Amazons . 
To this troop , Zenobia , queen of Palmyra , Elizabeth , queen of England , and other princesses who had governed their states , joined themselves . 
Amazonide , daughter of Samornas , -LRB- so they called the foundress of this female monarchy , -RRB- complained against Hercules that he had made some of her subjects captive : against Theseus , who had married one , when their army was defeated in Greece ; against Achilles , who had put to death the princess Orythia , for having succoured the Trojans ; against Alexander the Great , because , not content with the favours he had received from the queen Thalestris , he had put her kingdom under contribution ; against the Ephesians , who , for their ingratitude towards the Amazons , who had founded their city , were themselves delivered to other masters : and thus in the same manner against many other princes and people . 
`` Illustrious women , '' said Lucifer , `` a sex so fragile as yours , a monarchy so naturally given to tenderness , could not resist the force of men , nor get away from an empire so sweet as that of love . 
You have wished to act contrary to your destiny : made to submit , you have desired to command ; but women can not reign but by submissions to the laws of love ; that renders men completely amenable to the will of woman . 
If men have done you wrong , accuse your own hearts ; they have done the injury of which you complain . 
A warrior , proud and gallant , is full of ardour for victory when a fair Amazon is the price of conquest ; and on the other hand an Amazon fears to vanquish a young soldier whose amiable qualities have now disarmed her . 
So we re-commit to yourselves the examination of those affairs you have brought to our tribunal : do yourselves the justice I should do , if I examined the matter with more care , and let all women be convinced , they have no greater enemies than their own hearts . '' 
Zenobia then took the stand , and said to Lucifer , that her heart had never been master of her head : `` I lost , '' continued she , `` my husband Odenatus , for whom I had the purest attachment : although he left me young , my subjects were willing to obey me . 
During the thirty years of my government , I can now say , that I maintained my sway with as much mildness as wisdom . 
When the thirty tyrants under Galienus divided the empire , I took possession of a province in Syria , that had formerly been separated , and united it to my kingdom . 
Aurelian declared war against me , and having taken me captive , led me in chains behind his triumphal car . 
In the endeavour to overcome the fidelity with which I preserved the memory of my spouse , and which was my sole consolation for the loss of my crown , he exiled me , under a specious pretext , into the Tybertine country ; but he could not vanquish my constancy . 
Spite and rage seized him ; he put to death Herennianus and Timolaus , my two sons , whom I had myself brought up ; I had given them an excellent education , and had taught them the Egyptian , Greek and Latin languages ; it was for their use , that I had compiled an abridgment of the oriental history , and that of Alexandria . 
What was my grief at seeing myself deprived of two children , who would have perpetuated my name , and honoured my blood upon the throne of Palmyra ! 
Let no one boast to me of the liberality of this prince towards his subjects : I am aware that he often distributed among them clothing , corn , wine and oil : but this virtue was tarnished by his avarice towards strangers . 
Could he not be contented with the boundaries of the Roman empire , which was a world of itself , in which one could make voyages both by land and sea ?
