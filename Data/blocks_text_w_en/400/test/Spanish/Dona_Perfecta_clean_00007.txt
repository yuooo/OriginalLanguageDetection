This we do not know , nor do the chronicles from which this true history is taken say a word on this important point . 
What we know positively is that , far from displeasing the two guests to be thus boxed up together , it gave them great pleasure , as they happened to be old friends . 
They were greatly surprised and delighted when they met , and they were never tired of asking each other questions and uttering exclamations , dwelling on the strange chance that had brought them together in such a place and on such an occasion . 
`` Pinzon -- you here ! 
Why , what is this ? 
I had no suspicion that you were in this neighborhood . '' 
`` I heard that you were in this part of the country , Pepe ; but I had no idea , either , that I should meet you in this horrible , this barbarous Orbajosa . '' 
`` But what a fortunate chance ! 
For this chance is most fortunate -- providential . 
Pinzon , between us both we are going to do a great thing in this wretched town . '' 
`` And we shall have time enough to consult about it , '' answered the other , seating himself on the bed in which the engineer was lying , `` for it appears that we are both to occupy this room . 
What the devil sort of a house is this ? '' 
`` Why , man , it is my aunt 's . 
Speak with more respect about it . 
Have you not met my aunt ? 
But I am going to get up . '' 
`` I am very glad of it , for then I can lie down and rest ; and badly I need it . 
What a road , friend Pepe , what a road , and what a town ! '' 
`` Tell me , have you come to set fire to Orbajosa ? '' 
`` Fire ! '' 
`` I ask you because , in that case , I might help you . '' 
`` What a town ! 
But what a town ! '' 
exclaimed the soldier , removing his shako , and laying aside sword and shoulder-belt , travelling case and cloak . 
`` This is the second time they have sent us here . 
I swear to you that the third time I will ask my discharge . '' 
`` Do n't talk ill of these good people ! 
But you have come in the nick of time . 
It seems as if Providence has sent you to my aid , Pinzon . 
I have a terrible project on hand , an adventure , -- a plot , if you wish to call it so , my friend , -- and it would have been difficult for me to carry it through without you . 
A moment ago I was in despair , wondering how I should manage , and saying to myself anxiously , ` If I only had a friend here , a good friend ! ' '' 
`` A project , a plot , an adventure ! 
One of two things , Senor Mathematician : it is either the discovery of aerial navigation , or else some love affair . '' 
`` It is serious , very serious . 
Go to bed , sleep a while , and afterward we will talk about it . '' 
`` I will go to bed , but I will not sleep . 
You may say all you wish to me . 
All that I ask is that you will say as little as possible about Orbajosa . '' 
`` It is precisely about Orbajosa that I wish to speak to you . 
But have you also an antipathy to this cradle of illustrious men ? '' 
`` These garlic-venders -- we call them the garlic-venders -- may be as illustrious as you choose , but to me they are as irritating as the product of the country . 
This is a town ruled by people who teach distrust , superstition , and hatred of the whole human race . 
When we have leisure I will relate to you an occurrence -- an adventure , half-comic , half-tragic -- that happened to me here last year . 
When I tell it to you , you will laugh and I shall be fuming . 
But , in fine , what is past is past . '' 
`` In what is happening to me there is nothing comic . '' 
`` But I have various reasons for hating this wretched place . 
You must know that my father was assassinated here in '48 by a party of barbarous guerillas . 
He was a brigadier , and he had left the service . 
The Government sent for him , and he was passing through Villahorrenda on his way to Madrid , when he was captured by half a dozen ruffians . 
Here there are several dynasties of guerilla chiefs -- the Aceros , the Caballucos , the Pelosmalos -- a periodical eruption , as some one has said who knew very well what he was talking about . '' 
`` I suppose that two infantry regiments and some cavalry have not come here solely for the pleasure of visiting these delightful regions . '' 
`` Certainly not ! 
We have come to survey the country . 
There are many deposits of arms here . 
The Government does not venture , as it desires , to remove from office the greater number of the municipal councils without first distributing a few companies of soldiers through these towns . 
As there is so much disturbance in this part of the country , as two of the neighboring provinces are already infested , and as this municipal district of Orbajosa has , besides , so brilliant a record in all the civil wars , there are fears that the bravos of the place may take to the roads and rob all they can lay hands on . '' 
`` A good precaution ! 
But I am firmly convinced that not until these people die and are born over again , not until the very stones have changed their form , will there be peace in Orbajosa . '' 
`` That is my opinion too , '' said the officer , lighting a cigarette . 
`` Do n't you see that the guerilla chiefs are the pets of this place ? 
Those who desolated the district in 1848 and at other epochs , or , if not they , their sons , are employed in the market inspector 's office , at the town gates , in the town-hall , in the post-office ; among them are constables , sacristans , bailiffs . 
Some have become powerful party leaders and they are the ones who manage the elections , have influence in Madrid , bestow places -- in short , this is terrible . '' 
`` And tell me , is there no hope of the guerilla chiefs performing some exploit in these days ? 
If that should happen , you could destroy the town , and I would help you . '' 
`` If it depended upon me -- They will play their usual pranks no doubt , '' said Pinzon , `` for the insurrection in the two neighboring provinces is spreading like wildfire . 
And between ourselves , friend Rey , I think this is going to last for a long time . 
Some people smile and say that it would be impossible that there should be another insurrection like the last one . 
They do n't know the country ; they do n't know Orbajosa and its inhabitants . 
I believe that the war that is now beginning will have serious consequences , and that we shall have another cruel and bloody struggle , that will last Heaven knows how long . 
What is your opinion ? '' 
`` Well , in Madrid I laughed at any one who spoke of the possibility of a civil war as long and as terrible as the Seven Years ' War ; but since I have been here -- '' `` One must come to the heart of this enchanting country , see the people at home , and hear them talk , to know what the real state of affairs is . '' 
`` Just so . 
Without knowing precisely on what I base my opinion , the fact is that here I see things in a different light , and I now believe that it is possible that there may be a long and bloody war . '' 
`` Exactly so . '' 
`` But at present my thoughts are occupied less by the public war than by a private war in which I am engaged and which I declared a short time ago . '' 
`` You said this was your aunt 's house . 
What is her name ? '' 
`` Dona Perfecta Rey de Polentinos . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I know her by reputation . 
She is an excellent person , and the only one of whom I have not heard the garlic-venders speak ill . 
When I was here before I heard her goodness , her charity , her innumerable virtues , everywhere extolled . '' 
`` Yes , my aunt is very kind , very amiable , '' said Rey . 
Then he fell into a thoughtful silence . 
`` But now I remember ! '' 
exclaimed Pinzon suddenly . 
`` How one thing fits in with another ! 
Yes , I heard in Madrid that you were going to be married to a cousin of yours . 
All is clear now . 
Is it that beautiful and heavenly Rosario ? '' 
`` Pinzon , we must have a long talk together . '' 
`` I imagine that there are difficulties . '' 
`` There is something more ; there is violent opposition . 
I have need of a determined friend -- a friend who is prompt to act , fruitful in resource , of great experience in emergencies , astute and courageous . '' 
`` Why , this is even more serious than a challenge . '' 
`` A great deal more serious . 
It would be easy to fight with another man . 
With women , with unseen enemies who work in the dark , it is impossible . '' 
`` Come , I am all ears . '' 
Lieutenant-colonel Pinzon lay stretched at full length upon the bed . 
Pepe Rey drew a chair up to the bedside and , leaning his elbow on the bed and his head on his hand , began his conference , consultation , exposition of plan , or whatever else it might be called , and continued talking for a long time . 
Pinzon listened to him with profound attention and without interrupting him , except to ask an occasional question for the purpose of obtaining further details or additional light upon some obscure point . 
When Pepe Rey ended , Pinzon looked grave . 
He stretched himself , yawning with the satisfaction of one who has not slept for three nights , and then said : `` You plan is dangerous and difficult . '' 
`` But not impossible . '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
for nothing is impossible . 
Reflect well about it . '' 
`` I have reflected . '' 
`` And you are resolved to carry it through ? 
Consider that these things are not now in fashion . 
They generally turn out badly and throw discredit on those who undertake them . '' 
`` I am resolved . '' 
`` For my part , then , although the business is dangerous and serious -- very serious -- I am ready to aid you in all things and for all things . '' 
`` Can I rely upon you ? '' 
`` To the death . '' 
The opening of hostilities could not long be delayed . 
When the hour of dinner arrived , after coming to an agreement with Pinzon regarding the plan to be pursued , the first condition of which was that the friends should pretend not to know each other , Pepe Rey went to the dining-room . 
There he found his aunt , who had just returned from the cathedral where she had spent the morning as was her habit . 
She was alone , and appeared to be greatly preoccupied . 
The engineer observed that on that pale and marble-like countenance , not without a certain beauty , there rested a mysterious shadow . 
When she looked up it recovered its sinister calmness , but she looked up seldom , and after a rapid examination of her nephew 's countenance , that of the amiable lady would again take on its studied gloom . 
They awaited dinner in silence . 
They did not wait for Don Cayetano , for he had gone to Mundogrande . 
When they sat down to table Dona Perfecta said : `` And that fine soldier whom the Government has sent us , is he not coming to dinner ? '' 
`` He seems to be more sleepy than hungry , '' answered the engineer , without looking at his aunt . 
`` Do you know him ? '' 
`` I have never seen him in all my life before . '' 
`` We are nicely off with the guests whom the Government sends us . 
We have beds and provisions in order to keep them ready for those vagabonds of Madrid , whenever they may choose to dispose of them . '' 
`` There are fears of an insurrection , '' said Pepe Rey , with sudden heat , `` and the Government is determined to crush the Orbajosans -- to crush them , to grind them to powder . '' 
`` Stop , man , stop , for Heaven 's sake ; do n't crush us ! '' 
cried Dona Perfecta sarcastically . 
`` Poor we ! 
Be merciful , man , and allow us unhappy creatures to live . 
And would you , then , be one of those who would aid the army in the grand work of crushing us ? '' 
`` I am not a soldier . 
I will do nothing but applaud when I see the germs of civil war ; of insubordination , of discord , of disorder , of robbery , and of barbarism that exist here , to the shame of our times and of our country , forever extirpated . '' 
`` All will be as God wills . '' 
`` Orbajosa , my dear aunt , has little else than garlic and bandits ; for those who in the name of some political or religious idea set out in search of adventures every four or five years are nothing but bandits . '' 
`` Thanks , thanks , my dear nephew ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta , turning pale . 
`` So Orbajosa has nothing more than that ? 
Yet there must be something else here -- something that you do not possess , since you have come to look for it among us . '' 
Rey felt the cut . 
His soul was on fire . 
He found it very difficult to show his aunt the consideration to which her sex , her rank , and her relation to himself entitled her . 
He was on the verge of a violent outbreak , and a force that he could not resist was impelling him against his interlocutor . 
`` I came to Orbajosa , '' he said , `` because you sent for me ; you arranged with my father -- '' `` Yes , yes ; it is true , '' she answered , interrupting him quickly and making an effort to recover her habitual serenity . 
`` I do not deny it . 
I am the one who is really to blame . 
I am to blame for your ill-humor , for the slights you put upon us , for every thing disagreeable that has been happening in my house since you entered it . '' 
`` I am glad that you are conscious of it . '' 
`` In exchange , you are a saint . 
Must I also go down on my knees to your grace and ask your pardon ? '' 
`` Senora , '' said Pepe Rey gravely , laying down his knife and fork , `` I entreat you not to mock me in so pitiless a manner . 
I can not meet you on equal ground . 
All I have said is that I came to Orbajosa at your invitation . '' 
`` And it is true . 
Your father and I arranged that you should marry Rosario . 
You came in order to become acquainted with her . 
I accepted you at once as a son . 
You pretended to love Rosario -- '' `` Pardon me , '' objected Pepe ; `` I loved and I love Rosario ; you pretended to accept me as a son ; receiving me with deceitful cordiality , you employed from the very beginning all the arts of cunning to thwart me and to prevent the fulfilment of the proposals made to my father ; you determined from the first day to drive me to desperation , to tire me out ; and with smiles and affectionate words on your lips you have been killing me , roasting me at the slow fire ; you have let loose upon me in the dark and from behind an ambush a swarm of lawsuits ; you have deprived me of the official commission which I brought to Orbajosa ; you have brought me into disrepute in the town ; you have had me turned out of the cathedral ; you have kept me constantly separated from the chosen of my heart ; you have tortured your daughter with an inquisitorial imprisonment which will cause her death , unless God interposes to prevent it . '' 
Dona Perfecta turned scarlet . 
But the flush of offended pride passed away quickly , leaving her face of a greenish pallor . 
Her lips trembled . 
Throwing down the knife and fork with which she had been eating , she rose swiftly to her feet . 
Her nephew rose also . 
`` My God ! 
Holy Virgin of Succor ! '' 
she cried , raising both her hands to her head and pressing it between them with the gesture indicative of desperation , `` is it possible that I deserve such atrocious insults ? 
Pepe , my son , is it you who speak to me in this way ? 
If I have done what you say , I am indeed very wicked . '' 
She sank on the sofa and covered her face with her hands . 
Pepe , approaching her slowly , saw that his aunt was sobbing bitterly and shedding abundant tears . 
In spite of his conviction he could not altogether conquer the feeling of compassion which took possession of him ; and while he condemned himself for his cowardice he felt something of remorse for the severity and the frankness with which he had spoken . 
`` My dear aunt , '' he said , putting his hand on her shoulder , `` if you answer me with tears and sighs , you will not convince me . 
Proofs , not emotions , are what I require . 
Speak to me , tell me that I am mistaken in thinking what I think ; then prove it to me , and I will acknowledge my error . '' 
`` Leave me , you are not my brother 's son ! 
If you were , you would not insult me as you have insulted me . 
So , then , I am an intriguer , an actress , a hypocritical harpy , a domestic plotter ? '' 
As she spoke , Dona Perfecta uncovered her face and looked at her nephew with a martyr-like expression . 
Pepe was perplexed . 
The tears as well as the gentle voice of his father 's sister could not be insignificant phenomena for the mathematician 's soul . 
Words crowded to his lips to ask her pardon . 
A man of great firmness generally , any appeal to his emotions , any thing which touched his heart , converted him at once into a child . 
Weaknesses of a mathematician ! 
It is said that Newton was the same . 
`` I will give you the proofs you ask , '' said Dona Perfecta , motioning him to a seat beside her . 
`` I will give you satisfaction . 
You shall see whether I am kind , whether I am indulgent , whether I am humble . 
Do you think that I am going to contradict you ; to deny absolutely the acts of which you have accused me ? 
Well , then , no ; I do not deny them . '' 
The engineer was astounded . 
`` I do not deny them , '' continued Dona Perfecta . 
`` What I deny is the evil intention which you attribute to them . 
By what right do you undertake to judge of what you know only from appearances and by conjecture ? 
Have you the supreme intelligence which is necessary to judge justly the actions of others and pronounce sentence upon them ? 
Are you God , to know the intentions ? '' 
Pepe was every moment more amazed . 
`` Is it not allowable at times to employ indirect means to attain a good and honorable end ? 
By what right do you judge actions of mine that you do not clearly understand ? 
I , my dear nephew , manifesting a sincerity which you do not deserve , confess to you that I have indeed employed subterfuges to attain a good end , to attain what was at the same time beneficial to you and to my daughter . 
You do not comprehend ? 
You look bewildered . 
Ah ! 
your great mathematician 's and German philosopher 's intellect is not capable of comprehending these artifices of a prudent mother . '' 
`` I am more and more astounded every moment , '' said the engineer . 
`` Be as astounded as you choose , but confess your barbarity , '' said the lady , with increasing spirit ; `` acknowledge your hastiness and your brutal conduct toward me in accusing me as you have done . 
You are a young man without any experience or any other knowledge than that which is derived from books , which teach nothing about the world or the human heart . 
All you know is how to make roads and docks . 
Ah , my young gentleman ! 
one does not enter into the human heart through the tunnel of a railroad , or descend into its depths through the shaft of a mine . 
You can not read in the conscience of another with the microscope of a naturalist , nor decide the question of another 's culpability measuring ideas with a theodolite . '' 
`` For God 's sake , dear aunt ! '' 
`` Why do you pronounce the name of God when you do not believe in him ? '' 
said Dona Perfecta , in solemn accents . 
`` If you believed in him , if you were a good Christian , you would not dare to form evil judgments about my conduct . 
I am a devout woman , do you understand ? 
I have a tranquil conscience , do you understand ? 
I know what I am doing and why I do it , do you understand ? '' 
`` I understand , I understand , I understand ! '' 
`` God in whom you do not believe , sees what you do not see and what you can not see -- the intention . 
I will say no more ; I do not wish to enter into minute explanations , for I do not need to do so . 
Nor would you understand me if I should tell you that I desired to attain my object without scandal , without offending your father , without offending you , without giving cause for people to talk by an explicit refusal -- I will say nothing of all this to you , for you would not understand it , either , Pepe . 
You are a mathematician . 
You see what is before your eyes , and nothing more ; brute matter and nothing more . 
You see the effect , and not the cause . 
God is the supreme intention of the world . 
He who does not know this must necessarily judge things as you judge them -- foolishly . 
In the tempest , for instance , he sees only destruction ; in the conflagration , ruin ; in the drought , famine ; in the earthquake , desolation ; and yet , arrogant young man , in all those apparent calamities we are to seek the good intentions -- yes , senor , the intention , always good , of Him who can do nothing evil . '' 
This confused , subtle , and mystic logic did not convince Pepe Rey ; but he did not wish to follow his aunt in the tortuous path of such a method of reasoning , and he said simply : `` Well , I respect intentions . '' 
`` Now that you seem to recognize your error , '' continued the pious lady , with ever-increasing confidence , `` I will make another confession to you , and that is that I see now that I did wrong in adopting the course I did , although my object was excellent . 
In view of your impetuous disposition , in view of your incapacity to comprehend me , I should have faced the situation boldly and said to you , ` Nephew , I do not wish that you should be my daughter 's husband . ' '' 
`` That is the language you should have used to me from the beginning , '' said the engineer , drawing a deep breath , as if his mind had been relieved from an enormous weight . 
`` I am greatly obliged to you for those words . 
After having been stabbed in the dark , this blow on the face in the light of day is a great satisfaction to me . '' 
`` Well , I will repeat the blow , nephew , '' declared Dona Perfecta , with as much energy as displeasure . 
`` You know it now -- I do not wish you to marry Rosario ! '' 
Pepe was silent . 
There was a long pause , during which the two regarded each other attentively , as if the face of each was for the other the most perfect work of art . 
`` Do n't you understand what I have said to you ? '' 
she repeated . 
`` That every thing is at an end , that there is to be no marriage . '' 
`` Permit me , dear aunt , '' said the young man , with composure , `` not to be terrified by the intimation . 
In the state at which things have arrived your refusal has little importance for me . '' 
`` What are you saying ? '' 
cried Dona Perfecta violently . 
`` What you hear . 
I will marry Rosario ! '' 
Dona Perfecta rose to her feet , indignant , majestic , terrible . 
Her attitude was that of anathema incarnated in a woman . 
Rey remained seated , serene , courageous , with the passive courage of a profound conviction and an immovable resolve . 
The whole weight of his aunt 's wrath , threatening to overwhelm him , did not make him move an eyelash . 
This was his character . 
`` You are mad . 
Marry my daughter , you ! 
Marry her against my will ! '' 
Dona Perfecta 's trembling lips articulated these words in a truly tragic tone . 
`` Against your will ! 
She is of a different way of thinking . '' 
`` Against my will ! '' 
repeated Dona Perfecta . 
`` Yes , and I repeat it again and again . 
I do not wish it , I do not wish it ! '' 
`` She and I wish it . '' 
`` Fool ! 
Is nothing else in the world to be considered but her and you ? 
Are there not parents ; is there not society ; is there not a conscience ; is there not a God ? '' 
`` Because there is society , because there is a conscience , because there is a God , '' affirmed Rey gravely , rising to his feet , and pointing with outstretched arm to the heavens , `` I say and I repeat that I will marry her . '' 
`` Wretch ! 
arrogant man ! 
And if you would dare to trample every thing under your feet , do you think there are not laws to prevent your violence ? '' 
`` Because there are laws , I say and I repeat that I will marry her . '' 
`` You respect nothing ! '' 
`` Nothing that is unworthy of respect . '' 
`` And my authority , my will , I -- am I nothing ? '' 
`` For me your daughter is every thing -- the rest is nothing . '' 
Pepe Rey 's composure was , so to say , the arrogant display of invincible and conscious strength . 
The blows he gave were hard and crushing in their force , without any thing to mitigate their severity . 
His words , if the comparison may be allowed , were like a pitiless discharge of artillery . 
Dona Perfecta sank again on the sofa ; but she shed no tears , and a convulsive tremor agitated her frame . 
`` So that for this infamous atheist , '' she exclaimed , with frank rage , `` there are no social conventionalities , there is nothing but caprice . 
This is base avarice . 
My daughter is rich ! '' 
`` If you think to wound me with that treacherous weapon , evading the question and giving a distorted meaning to my sentiments in order to offend my dignity , you are mistaken , dear aunt . 
Call me mercenary , if you choose . 
God knows what I am . '' 
`` You have no dignity ! '' 
`` That is an opinion , like any other . 
The world may hold you to be infallible . 
I do not . 
I am far from believing that from your judgments there is no appeal to God . '' 
`` But is what you say true ? 
But do you persist in your purpose , after my refusal ? 
You respect nothing , you are a monster , a bandit . '' 
`` I am a man . '' 
`` A wretch ! 
Let us end this at once . 
I refuse to give my daughter to you ; I refuse her to you ! '' 
`` I will take her then ! 
I shall take only what is mine . '' 
`` Leave my presence ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , rising suddenly to her feet . 
`` Coxcomb , do you suppose that my daughter thinks of you ? '' 
`` She loves me , as I love her . '' 
`` It is a lie ! 
It is a lie ! '' 
`` She herself has told me so . 
Excuse me if , on this point , I put more faith in her words than in her mother 's . '' 
`` How could she have told you so , when you have not seen her for several days ? '' 
`` I saw her last night , and she swore to me before the crucifix in the chapel that she would be my wife . '' 
`` Oh , scandal ; oh , libertinism ! 
But what is this ? 
My God , what a disgrace ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , pressing her head again between her hands and walking up and down the room . 
`` Rosario left her room last night ? '' 
`` She left it to see me . 
It was time . '' 
`` What vile conduct is yours ! 
You have acted like a thief ; you have acted like a vulgar seducer ! '' 
`` I have acted in accordance with the teachings of your school . 
My intention was good . '' 
`` And she came down stairs ! 
Ah , I suspected it ! 
This morning at daybreak I surprised her , dressed , in her room . 
She told me she had gone out , I do n't know for what . 
You were the real criminal , then . 
This is a disgrace ! 
Pepe , I expected any thing from you rather than an outrage like this . 
Every thing is at an end ! 
Go away ! 
You are dead to me . 
I forgive you , provided you go away . 
I will not say a word about this to your father . 
What horrible selfishness ! 
No , there is no love in you . 
You do not love my daughter ! '' 
`` God knows that I love her , and that is sufficient for me . '' 
`` Be silent , blasphemer ! 
and do n't take the name of God upon your lips ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta . 
`` In the name of God , whom I can invoke , for I believe in him , I tell you that my daughter will never be your wife . 
My daughter will be saved , Pepe ; my daughter shall not be condemned to a living hell , for a union with you would be a hell ! '' 
`` Rosario will be my wife , '' repeated the mathematician , with pathetic calmness . 
The pious lady was still more exasperated by her nephew 's calm energy . 
In a broken voice she said : `` Do n't suppose that your threats terrify me . 
I know what I am saying . 
What ! 
are a home and a family to be outraged like this ? 
Are human and divine authority to be trampled under foot in this way ? '' 
`` I will trample every thing under foot , '' said the engineer , beginning to lose his composure and speaking with some agitation . 
`` You will trample every thing under foot ! 
Ah ! 
it is easy to see that you are a barbarian , a savage , a man who lives by violence . '' 
`` No , dear aunt ; I am mild , upright , honorable , and an enemy to violence ; but between you and me -- between you who are the law and I who am to honor it -- is a poor tormented creature , one of God 's angels , subjected to iniquitous tortures . 
The spectacle of this injustice , this unheard-of violence , is what has converted my rectitude into barbarity ; my reason into brute force ; my honor into violence , like an assassin 's or a thief 's ; this spectacle , senora , is what impels me to disregard your law , what impels me to trample it under foot , braving every thing . 
This which appears to you lawlessness is obedience to an unescapable law . 
I do what society does when a brutal power , as illogical as irritating , opposes its progress . 
It tramples it under foot and destroys it in an outburst of frenzy . 
Such am I at this moment -- I do not recognize myself . 
I was reasonable , and now I am a brute ; I was respectful , and now I am insolent ; I was civilized , and now I am a savage . 
You have brought me to this horrible extremity ; infuriating me and driving me from the path of rectitude which I was tranquilly pursuing . 
Who is to blame -- I or you ? '' 
`` You , you ! '' 
`` Neither you nor I can decide the question . 
I think we are both to blame : you for your violence and injustice , I for my injustice and violence . 
We have both become equally barbarous , and we struggle with and wound each other without compassion . 
God has permitted that it should be so ; my blood will be upon your conscience , yours will be upon mine . 
Enough now , senora . 
I do not wish to trouble you with useless words . 
We will now proceed to acts . '' 
`` To acts , very well ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta , roaring rather than speaking . 
`` Do n't suppose that in Orbajosa there is no civil guard ! '' 
`` Good-by , senora . 
I will now leave this house . 
I think we shall meet again . '' 
`` Go , go ! 
go now ! '' 
she cried , pointing with an energetic gesture to the door . 
Pepe Rey left the room . 
Dona Perfecta , after pronouncing a few incoherent words , which were the clearest expression of her anger , sank into a chair , with indications of fatigue , or of a coming attack of nerves . 
The maids came running in . 
`` Go for Senor Don Inocencio ! '' 
she cried . 
`` Instantly -- hurry ! 
Ask him to come here ! '' 
Then she tore her handkerchief with her teeth . 
On the day following that of this lamentable quarrel , various rumors regarding Pepe Rey and his conduct spread through Orbajosa , going from house to house , from club to club , from the Casino to the apothecary 's and from the Paseo de las Descalzes to the Puerta de Baidejos . 
They were repeated by every body , and so many were the comments made that , if Don Cayetano had collected and compiled them , he might have formed with them a rich `` Thesaurus '' of Orbajosan benevolence . 
In the midst of the diversity of the reports circulated , there was agreement in regard to certain important particulars , one of which was the following : That the engineer , enraged at Dona Perfecta 's refusal to marry Rosario to an atheist , had raised his hand to his aunt . 
The young man was living in the widow De Cusco 's hotel , an establishment mounted , as they say now , not at the height , but at the depth of the superlative backwardness of the town . 
Lieutenant-colonel Pinzon visited him with frequency , in order that they might discuss together the plot which they had on hand , and for the successful conduct of which the soldier showed the happiest dispositions . 
New artifices and stratagems occurred to him at every instant , and he hastened to put them into effect with excellent humor , although he would often say to his friend : `` The role I am playing , dear Pepe , is not a very dignified one ; but to give an annoyance to the Orbajosans I would walk on my hands and feet . '' 
We do not know what cunning stratagems the artful soldier , skilled in the wiles of the world , employed ; but certain it is that before he had been in the house three days he had succeeded in making himself greatly liked by every body in it . 
His manners were very pleasing to Dona Perfecta , who could not hear unmoved his flattering praises of the elegance of the house , and of the nobility , piety , and august magnificence of its mistress . 
With Don Inocencio he was hand and glove .
