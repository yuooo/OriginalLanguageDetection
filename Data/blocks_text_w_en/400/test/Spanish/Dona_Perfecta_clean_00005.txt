Well-dressed and well shod they would have seemed the daughters of a duchess , and worthy to ally themselves with princes . 
When the visitors entered , the three girls were for a moment abashed : but very soon their naturally gay and frivolous dispositions became apparent . 
They lived in poverty , as birds live in confinement , singing behind iron bars as they would sing in the midst of the abundance of the forest . 
They spent the day sewing , which showed at least honorable principles ; but no one in Orbajosa , of their own station in life , held any intercourse with them . 
They were , to a certain extent , proscribed , looked down upon , avoided , which also showed that there existed some cause for scandal . 
But , to be just , it must be said that the bad reputation of the Troyas consisted , more than in any thing else , in the name they had of being gossips and mischief-makers , fond of playing practical jokes , and bold and free in their manners . 
They wrote anonymous letters to grave personages ; they gave nicknames to every living being in Orbajosa , from the bishop down to the lowest vagabond ; they threw pebbles at the passers-by ; they hissed behind the window bars , in order to amuse themselves with the perplexity and annoyance of the startled passer-by ; they found out every thing that occurred in the neighborhood ; to which end they made constant use of every window and aperture in the upper part of the house ; they sang at night in the balcony ; they masked themselves during the Carnival , in order to obtain entrance into the houses of the highest families ; and they played many other mischievous pranks peculiar to small towns . 
But whatever its cause , the fact was that on the Troya triumvirate rested one of those stigmas that , once affixed on any one by a susceptible community , accompanies that person implacably even beyond the tomb . 
`` This is the gentleman they say has come to discover the gold-mines ? '' 
said one of the girls . 
`` And to do away with the cultivation of garlic in Orbajosa to plant cotton or cinnamon trees in its stead ? '' 
Pepe could not help laughing at these absurdities . 
`` All he has come for is to make a collection of pretty girls to take back with him to Madrid , '' said Tafetan . 
`` Ah ! 
I 'll be very glad to go ! '' 
cried one . 
`` I will take the three of you with me , '' said Pepe . 
`` But I want to know one thing ; why were you laughing at me when I was at the window of the Casino ? '' 
These words were the signal for fresh bursts of laughter . 
`` These girls are silly things , '' said the eldest . 
`` It was because we said you deserved something better than Dona Perfecta 's daughter . '' 
`` It was because this one said that you are only losing your time , for Rosarito cares only for people connected with the Church . '' 
`` How absurd you are ! 
I said nothing of the kind ! 
It was you who said that the gentleman was a Lutheran atheist , and that he enters the cathedral smoking and with his hat on . '' 
`` Well , I did n't invent it ; that is what Suspiritos told me yesterday . '' 
`` And who is this Suspiritos who says such absurd things about me ? '' 
`` Suspiritos is -- Suspiritos . '' 
`` Girls , '' said Tafetan , with smiling countenance , `` there goes the orange-vender . 
Call him ; I want to invite you to eat oranges . '' 
One of the girls called the orange-vender . 
The conversation started by the Troyas displeased Pepe Rey not a little , dispelling the slight feeling of contentment which he had experienced at finding himself in such gay and communicative company . 
He could not , however , refrain from smiling when he saw Don Juan Tafetan take down a guitar and begin to play upon it with all the grace and skill of his youthful years . 
`` I have been told that you sing beautifully , '' said Rey to the girls . 
`` Let Don Juan Tafetan sing . '' 
`` I do n't sing . '' 
`` Nor I , '' said the second of the girls , offering the engineer some pieces of the skin of the orange she had just peeled . 
`` Maria Juana , do n't leave your sewing , '' said the eldest of the Troyas . 
`` It is late , and the cassock must be finished to-night . '' 
`` There is to be no work to-day . 
To the devil with the needles ! '' 
exclaimed Tafetan . 
And he began to sing a song . 
`` The people are stopping in the street , '' said the second of the girls , going out on the balcony . 
`` Don Juan Tafetan 's shouts can be heard in the Plaza -- Juana , Juana ! '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Suspiritos is walking down the street . '' 
`` Throw a piece of orange-peel at her . '' 
Pepe Rey looked out also ; he saw a lady walking down the street at whom the youngest of the Troyas , taking a skilful aim , threw a large piece of orange-peel , which struck her straight on the back of the head . 
Then they hastily closed the blinds , and the three girls tried to stifle their laughter so that it might not be heard in the street . 
`` There is no work to-day , '' cried one , overturning the sewing-basket with the tip of her shoe . 
`` That is the same as saying , to-morrow there is to be no eating , '' said the eldest , gathering up the sewing implements . 
Pepe Rey instinctively put his hand into his pocket . 
He would gladly have given them an alms . 
The spectacle of these poor orphans , condemned by the world because of their frivolity , saddened him beyond measure . 
If the only sin of the Troyas , if the only pleasure which they had to compensate them for solitude , poverty , and neglect , was to throw orange-peels at the passers-by , they might well be excused for doing it . 
The austere customs of the town in which they lived had perhaps preserved them from vice , but the unfortunate girls lacked decorum and good-breeding , the common and most visible signs of modesty , and it might easily be supposed that they had thrown out of the window something more than orange-peels . 
Pepe Rey felt profound pity for them . 
He noted their shabby dresses , made over , mended , trimmed , and retrimmed , to make them look like new ; he noted their broken shoes -- and once more he put his hand in his pocket . 
`` Vice may reign here , '' he said to himself , `` but the faces , the furniture , all show that this is the wreck of a respectable family . 
If these poor girls were as bad as it is said they are , they would not live in such poverty and they would not work . 
In Orbajosa there are rich men . '' 
The three girls went back and forward between him and the window , keeping up a gay and sprightly conversation , which indicated , it must be said , a species of innocence in the midst of all their frivolity and unconventionality . 
`` Senor Don Jose , what an excellent lady Dona Perfecta is ! '' 
`` She is the only person in Orbajosa who has no nickname , the only person in Orbajosa who is not spoken ill of . '' 
`` Every one respects her . '' 
`` Every one adores her . '' 
To these utterances the young man responded by praises of his aunt , but he had no longer any inclination to take money from his pocket and say , `` Maria Juana , take this for a pair of boots . '' 
`` Pepa , take this to buy a dress for yourself . '' 
`` Florentina , take this to provide yourself with a week 's provisions , '' as he had been on the point of doing . 
At a moment when the three girls had run out to the balcony to see who was passing , Don Juan Tafetan approached Rey and whispered to him : `` How pretty they are ! 
Are they not ? 
Poor things ! 
It seems impossible that they should be so gay when it may be positively affirmed that they have not dined to-day . '' 
`` Don Juan , Don Juan ! '' 
cried Pepilla . 
`` Here comes a friend of yours , Nicolasito Hernandez , in other words , Cirio Pascual , with this three-story hat . 
He is praying to himself , no doubt , for the souls of those whom he has sent to the grave with his extortion . '' 
`` I wager that neither of you will dare to call him by his nickname . '' 
`` It is a bet . '' 
`` Juana , shut the blinds , wait until he passes , and when he is turning the corner , I will call out , ` Cirio , Cirio Pascual ! ' '' 
Don Juan Tafetan ran out to the balcony . 
`` Come here , Don Jose , so that you may know this type , '' he called . 
Pepe Rey , availing himself of the moment in which the three girls and Don Juan were making merry in the balcony , calling Nicolasito Hernandez the nickname which so greatly enraged him , stepped cautiously to one of the sewing baskets in the room and placed in it a half ounce which he had left after his losses at play . 
Then he hurried out to the balcony just as the two youngest cried in the midst of wild bursts of laughter , `` Cirio , Cirio Pascual ! '' 
After this prank the Troyas commenced a conversation with their visitors about the people and the affairs of the town . 
The engineer , fearing that his exploit might be discovered while he was present , wished to go , which displeased the Troyas greatly . 
One of them who had left the room now returned , saying : `` Suspiritos is now in the yard ; she is hanging out the clothes . '' 
`` Don Jose will wish to see her , '' said another of the girls . 
`` She is a fine-looking woman . 
And now she arranges her hair in the Madrid fashion . 
Come , all of you . '' 
They took their visitors to the dining-room -- an apartment very little used -- which opened on a terrace , where there were a few flowers in pots and many broken and disused articles of furniture . 
The terrace overlooked the yard of an adjoining house , with a piazza full of green vines and plants in pots carefully cultivated . 
Every thing about it showed it to be the abode of neat and industrious people of modest means . 
The Troyas , approaching the edge of the roof , looked attentively at the neighboring house , and then , imposing silence by a gesture on their cavaliers , retreated to a part of the terrace from which they could not see into the yard , and where there was no danger of their being seen from it . 
`` She is coming out of the kitchen now with a pan of peas , '' said Maria Juana , stretching out her neck to look . 
`` There goes ! '' 
cried another , throwing a pebble into the yard . 
The noise of the projectile striking against the glass of the piazza was heard , and then an angry voice crying : `` Now they have broken another pane of glass ! '' 
The girls , hidden , close beside the two men , in a corner of the terrace , were suffocating with laughter . 
`` Senora Suspiritos is very angry , '' said Rey . 
`` Why do they call her by that name ? '' 
`` Because , when she is talking , she sighs after every word , and although she has every thing she wants , she is always complaining . '' 
There was a moment 's silence in the house below . 
Pepita Troya looked cautiously down . 
`` There she comes again , '' she whispered , once more imposing silence by a gesture . 
`` Maria , give me a pebble . 
Give it here -- bang ! 
there it goes ! '' 
`` You did n't hit her . 
It struck the ground . '' 
`` Let me see if I can . 
Let us wait until she comes out of the pantry again . '' 
`` Now , now she is coming out . 
Take care , Florentina . '' 
`` One , two , three ! 
There it goes ! '' 
A cry of pain was heard from below , a malediction , a masculine exclamation , for it was a man who uttered it . 
Pepe Rey could distinguish clearly these words : `` The devil ! 
They have put a hole in my head , the -- Jacinto , Jacinto ! 
But what an abominable neighborhood this is ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
what have I done ! '' 
exclaimed Florentina , filled with consternation . 
`` I have struck Senor Don Inocencio on the head . '' 
`` The Penitentiary ? '' 
said Pepe Rey . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Does he live in that house ? '' 
`` Why , where else should he live ? '' 
`` And the lady of the sighs -- '' `` Is his niece , his housekeeper , or whatever else she may be . 
We amuse ourselves with her because she is very tiresome , but we are not accustomed to play tricks on his reverence , the Penitentiary . '' 
While this dialogue was being rapidly carried on , Pepe Rey saw , in front of the terrace and very near him , a window belonging to the bombarded house open ; he saw a smiling face appear at it -- a familiar face -- a face the sight of which stunned him , terrified him , made him turn pale and tremble . 
It was that of Jacinto , who , interrupted in his grave studies , appeared at it with his pen behind his ear . 
His modest , fresh , and smiling countenance , appearing in this way , had an auroral aspect . 
`` Good-afternoon , Senor Don Jose , '' he said gayly . 
`` Jacinto , Jacinto , I say ! '' 
`` I am coming . 
I was saluting a friend . '' 
`` Come away , come away ! '' 
cried Florentina , in alarm . 
`` The Penitentiary is going up to Don Nominative 's room and he will give us a blessing . '' 
`` Yes , come away ; let us close the door of the dining-room . '' 
They rushed pell-mell from the terrace . 
`` You might have guessed that Jacinto would see you from his temple of learning , '' said Tafetan to the Troyas . 
`` Don Nominative is our friend , '' responded one of the girls . 
`` From his temple of science he says a great many sweet things to us on the sly , and he blows us kisses besides . '' 
`` Jacinto ? '' 
asked the engineer . 
`` What the deuce is that name you gave him ? '' 
`` Don Nominative . '' 
The three girls burst out laughing . 
`` We call him that because he is very learned . '' 
`` No , because when we were little he was little too . 
But , yes , now I remember . 
We used to play on the terrace , and we could hear him studying his lessons aloud . '' 
`` Yes , and the whole blessed day he used to spend singling . '' 
`` Declining , girl ! 
That is what it was . 
He would go like this : ` Nominative , rosa , Genitive , Dative , Accusative . ' '' 
`` I suppose that I have my nickname too , '' said Pepe Rey . 
`` Let Maria Juana tell you what it is , '' said Florentina , hiding herself . 
`` I ? 
Tell it to him you , Pepa . '' 
`` You have n't any name yet , Don Jose . '' 
`` But I shall have one . 
I promise you that I will come to hear what it is and to receive confirmation , '' said the young man , making a movement to go . 
`` What , are you going ? '' 
`` Yes . 
You have lost time enough already . 
To work , girls ! 
Throwing stones at the neighbors and the passers-by is not the most suitable occupation for girls as pretty and as clever as you are . 
Well , good-by . '' 
And without waiting for further remonstrances , or answering the civilities of the girls , he left the house hastily , leaving Don Juan Tafetan behind him . 
The scene which he had just witnessed , the indignity suffered by the canon , the unexpected appearance of the little doctor of laws , added still further to the perplexities , the anxieties , and the disagreeable presentiments that already disturbed the soul of the unlucky engineer . 
He regretted with his whole soul having entered the house of the Troyas , and , resolving to employ his time better while his hypochondriasm lasted , he made a tour of inspection through the town . 
He visited the market , the Calle de la Triperia , where the principal stores were ; he observed the various aspects presented by the industry and commerce of the great city of Orbajosa , and , finding only new motives of weariness , he bent his steps in the direction of the Paseo de las Descalzas ; but he saw there only a few stray dogs , for , owing to the disagreeable wind which prevailed , the usual promenaders had remained at home . 
He went to the apothecary 's , where various species of ruminant friends of progress , who chewed again and again the cud of the same endless theme , were accustomed to meet , but there he was still more bored . 
Finally , as he was passing the cathedral , he heard the strains of the organ and the beautiful chanting of the choir . 
He entered , knelt before the high altar , remembering the warnings which his aunt had given him about behaving with decorum in church ; then visited a chapel , and was about to enter another when an acolyte , warden , or beadle approached him , and with the rudest manner and in the most discourteous tone said to him : `` His lordship says that you are to get out of the church . '' 
The engineer felt the blood rush to his face . 
He obeyed without a word . 
Turned out everywhere , either by superior authority or by his own tedium , he had no resource but to return to his aunt 's house , where he found waiting for him : First , Uncle Licurgo , to announce a second lawsuit to him ; second , Senor Don Cayetano , to read him another passage from his discourse on the `` Genealogies of Orbajosa '' ; third , Caballuco , on some business which he had not disclosed ; fourth , Dona Perfecta and her affectionate smile , for what will appear in the following chapter . 
A fresh attempt to see his cousin that evening failed , and Pepe Rey shut himself up in his room to write several letters , his mind preoccupied with one thought . 
`` To-night or to-morrow , '' he said to himself , `` this will end one way or another . '' 
When he was called to supper Dona Perfecta , who was already in the dining-room , went up to him and said , without preface : `` Dear Pepe , do n't distress yourself , I will pacify Senor Don Inocencio . 
I know every thing already . 
Maria Remedios , who has just left the house , has told me all about it . '' 
Dona Perfecta 's countenance radiated such satisfaction as an artist , proud of his work , might feel . 
`` About what ? '' 
`` Set your mind at rest . 
I will make an excuse for you . 
You took a few glasses too much in the Casino , that was it , was it not ? 
There you have the result of bad company . 
Don Juan Tafetan , the Troyas ! 
This is horrible , frightful . 
Did you consider well ? '' 
`` I considered every thing , '' responded Pepe , resolved not to enter into discussions with his aunt . 
`` I shall take good care not to write to your father what you have done . '' 
`` You may write whatever you please to him . '' 
`` You will exculpate yourself by denying the truth of this story , then ? '' 
`` I deny nothing . '' 
`` You confess then that you were in the house of those -- '' `` I was . '' 
`` And that you gave them a half ounce ; for , according to what Maria Remedios has told me , Florentina went down to the shop of the Extramaduran this afternoon to get a half ounce changed . 
They could not have earned it with their sewing . 
You were in their house to-day ; consequently -- '' `` Consequently I gave it to her . 
You are perfectly right . '' 
`` You do not deny it ? '' 
`` Why should I deny it ? 
I suppose I can do whatever I please with my money ? '' 
`` But you will surely deny that you threw stones at the Penitentiary . '' 
`` I do not throw stones . '' 
`` I mean that those girls , in your presence -- '' `` That is another matter . '' 
`` And they insulted poor Maria Remedios , too . '' 
`` I do not deny that , either . '' 
`` And how do you excuse your conduct ! 
Pepe in Heaven 's name , have you nothing to say ? 
That you are sorry , that you deny -- '' `` Nothing , absolutely nothing , senora ! '' 
`` You do n't even give me any satisfaction . '' 
`` I have done nothing to offend you . '' 
`` Come , the only thing there is left for you to do now is -- there , take that stick and beat me ! '' 
`` I do n't beat people . '' 
`` What a want of respect ! 
What , do n't you intend to eat any supper ? '' 
`` I intend to take supper . '' 
For more than a quarter of an hour no one spoke . 
Don Cayetano , Dona Perfecta , and Pepe Rey ate in silence . 
This was interrupted when Don Inocencio entered the dining-room . 
`` How sorry I was for it , my dear Don Jose ! 
Believe me , I was truly sorry for it , '' he said , pressing the young man 's hand and regarding him with a look of compassion . 
The engineer was so perplexed for a moment that he did not know what to answer . 
`` I refer to the occurrence of this afternoon . '' 
`` Ah , yes ! '' 
`` To your expulsion from the sacred precincts of the cathedral . '' 
`` The bishop should consider well , '' said Pepe Rey , `` before he turns a Christian out of the church . '' 
`` That is very true . 
I do n't know who can have put it into his lordship 's head that you are a man of very bad habits ; I do n't know who has told him that you make a boast of your atheism everywhere ; that you ridicule sacred things and persons , and even that you are planning to pull down the cathedral to build a large tar factory with the stones . 
I tried my best to dissuade him , but his lordship is a little obstinate . '' 
`` Thanks for so much kindness . '' 
`` And it is not because the Penitentiary has any reason to show you these considerations . 
A little more , and they would have left him stretched on the ground this afternoon . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the ecclesiastic , laughing . 
`` But have you heard of that little prank already ? 
I wager Maria Remedios came with the story . 
And I forbade her to do it -- I forbade her positively . 
The thing in itself is of no consequence , am I not right , Senor de Rey ? '' 
`` Since you think so -- '' `` That is what I think . 
Young people 's pranks ! 
Youth , let the moderns say what they will , is inclined to vice and to vicious actions . 
Senor de Rey , who is a person of great endowments , could not be altogether perfect -- why should it be wondered at that those pretty girls should have captivated him , and , after getting his money out of him , should have made him the accomplice of their shameless and criminal insults to their neighbors ? 
My dear friend , for the painful part that I had in this afternoon 's sport , '' he added , raising his hand to the wounded spot , `` I am not offended , nor will I distress you by even referring to so disagreeable an incident . 
I am truly sorry to hear that Maria Remedios came here to tell all about it . 
My niece is so fond of gossiping ! 
I wager she told too about the half ounce , and your romping with the girls on the terrace , and your chasing one another about , and the pinches and the capers of Don Juan Tafetan . 
Bah ! 
those things ought not to be told . '' 
Pepe Rey did not know which annoyed him most -- his aunt 's severity or the hypocritical condescension of the canon . 
`` Why should they not be told ? '' 
said Dona Perfecta . 
`` He does not seem ashamed of his conduct himself . 
I assure you all that I keep this from my dear daughter only because , in her nervous condition , a fit of anger might be dangerous to her . '' 
`` Come , it is not so serious as all that , senora , '' said the Penitentiary . 
`` I think the matter should not be again referred to , and when the one who was stoned says that , the rest may surely be satisfied . 
And the blow was no joke , Senor Don Jose . 
I thought they had split my head open and that my brains were oozing out . '' 
`` I am truly sorry for the occurrence ! '' 
stammered Pepe Rey . 
`` It gives me real pain , although I had no part in it -- '' `` Your visit to those Senoras Troyas will be talked about all over the town , '' said the canon . 
`` We are not in Madrid , in that centre of corruption , of scandal -- '' `` There you can visit the vilest places without any one knowing it , '' said Dona Perfecta . 
`` Here we are very observant of one another , '' continued Don Inocencio . 
`` We take notice of everything our neighbors do , and with such a system of vigilance public morals are maintained at a proper height . 
Believe me , my friend , believe me , -- and I do not say this to mortify you , -- you are the first gentleman of your position who , in the light of day -- the first , yes , senor -- Trojoe qui primus ab oris . '' 
And bursting into a laugh , he clapped the engineer on the back in token of amity and good-will . 
`` How grateful I ought to be , '' said the young man , concealing his anger under the sarcastic words which he thought the most suitable to answer the covert irony of his interlocutors , `` to meet with so much generosity and tolerance , when my criminal conduct would deserve -- '' `` What ! 
Is a person of one 's own blood , one who bears one 's name , '' said Dona Perfecta , `` to be treated like a stranger ? 
You are my nephew , you are the son of the best and the most virtuous of men , of my dear brother Juan , and that is sufficient . 
Yesterday afternoon the secretary of the bishop came here to tell me that his lordship is greatly displeased because I have you in my house . '' 
`` And that too ? '' 
murmured the canon . 
`` And that too . 
I said that in spite of the respect which I owe the bishop , and the affection and reverence which I bear him , my nephew is my nephew , and I can not turn him out of my house . '' 
`` This is another singularity which I find in this place , '' said Pepe Rey , pale with anger . 
`` Here , apparently , the bishop governs other people 's houses . '' 
`` He is a saint . 
He is so fond of me that he imagines -- he imagines that you are going to contaminate us with your atheism , your disregard for public opinion , your strange ideas . 
I have told him repeatedly that , at bottom , you are an excellent young man . '' 
`` Some concession must always be made to superior talent , '' observed Don Inocencio . 
`` And this morning , when I was at the Cirujedas ' -- oh , you can not imagine in what a state they had my head ! 
Was it true that you had come to pull down the cathedral ; that you were commissioned by the English Protestants to go preaching heresy throughout Spain ; that you spent the whole night gambling in the Casino ; that you were drunk in the streets ? 
` But , senoras , ' I said to them , ` would you have me send my nephew to the hotel ? ' 
Besides , they are wrong about the drunkenness , and as for gambling -- I have never yet heard that you gambled . '' 
Pepe Rey found himself in that state of mind in which the calmest man is seized by a sudden rage , by a blind and brutal impulse to strangle some one , to strike some one in the face , to break some one 's head , to crush some one 's bones . 
But Dona Perfecta was a woman and was , besides , his aunt ; and Don Inocencio was an old man and an ecclesiastic . 
In addition to this , physical violence is in bad taste and unbecoming a person of education and a Christian . 
There remained the resource of giving vent to his suppressed wrath in dignified and polite language ; but this last resource seemed to him premature , and only to be employed at the moment of his final departure from the house and from Orbajosa . 
Controlling his fury , then , he waited . 
Jacinto entered as they were finishing supper . 
`` Good-evening , Senor Don Jose , '' he said , pressing the young man 's hand . 
`` You and your friends kept me from working this afternoon . 
I was not able to write a line . 
And I had so much to do ! '' 
`` I am very sorry for it , Jacinto . 
But according to what they tell me , you accompany them sometimes in their frolics . '' 
`` I ! '' 
exclaimed the boy , turning scarlet . 
`` Why , you know very well that Tafetan never speaks a word of truth . 
But is it true , Senor de Rey , that you are going away ? '' 
`` Is that the report in the town ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I heard it in the Casino and at Don Lorenzo Ruiz 's . '' 
Rey contemplated in silence for a few moments the fresh face of Don Nominative . 
Then he said : `` Well , it is not true ; my aunt is very well satisfied with me ; she despises the calumnies with which the Orbajosans are favoring me -- and she will not turn me out of her house , even though the bishop himself should try to make her do so . '' 
`` As for turning you out of the house -- never . 
What would your father say ? '' 
`` Notwithstanding all your kindness , dearest aunt , notwithstanding the cordial friendship of the reverend canon , it is possible that I may myself decide to go away . '' 
`` To go away ! '' 
`` To go away -- you ! '' 
A strange light shone in Dona Perfecta 's eyes . 
The canon , experienced though he was in dissimulation , could not conceal his joy . 
`` Yes , and perhaps this very night . '' 
`` Why , man , how impetuous you are ; Why do n't you at least wait until morning ? 
Here -- Juan , let some one go for Uncle Licurgo to get the nag ready . 
I suppose you will take some luncheon with you . 
Nicolasa , that piece of veal that is on the sideboard ! 
Librada , the senorito 's linen . '' 
`` No , I can not believe that you would take so rash a resolution , '' said Don Cayetano , thinking himself obliged to take some part in the question . 
`` But you will come back , will you not ? '' 
asked the canon . 
`` At what time does the morning train pass ? '' 
asked Dona Perfecta , in whose eyes was clearly discernible the feverish impatience of her exaltation . 
`` I am going away to-night . '' 
`` But there is no moon . '' 
In the soul of Dona Perfecta , in the soul of the Penitentiary , in the little doctor 's youthful soul echoed like a celestial harmony the word , `` To-night ! '' 
`` Of course , dear Pepe , you will come back . 
I wrote to-day to your father , your excellent father , '' exclaimed Dona Perfecta , with all the physiognomic signs that make their appearance when a tear is about to be shed . 
`` I will trouble you with a few commissions , '' said the savant . 
`` A good opportunity to order the volume that is wanting in my copy of the Abbe Gaume 's work , '' said the youthful lawyer . 
`` You take such sudden notions , Pepe ; you are so full of caprices , '' murmured Dona Perfecta , smiling , with her eyes fixed on the door of the dining-room . 
`` But I forgot to tell you that Caballuco is waiting to speak to you . '' 
Every one looked toward the door , at which appeared the imposing figure of the Centaur , serious-looking and frowning ; embarrassed by his anxiety to salute the company politely ; savagely handsome , but disfigured by the violence which he did himself in smiling civilly and treading softly and holding his herculean arms in a correct posture . 
`` Come in , Senor Ramos , '' said Pepe Rey . 
`` No , no ! '' 
objected Dona Perfecta . 
`` What he has to say to you is an absurdity . '' 
`` Let him say it . '' 
`` I ought not to allow such ridiculous questions to be discussed in my house . '' 
`` What is Senor Ramos ' business with me ? '' 
Caballuco uttered a few words . 
`` Enough , enough ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta . 
`` Do n't trouble my nephew any more . 
Pepe , do n't mind this simpleton . 
Do you wish me to tell you the cause of the great Caballuco 's anger ? '' 
she said , turning to the others . 
`` Anger ? 
I think I can imagine , '' said the Penitentiary , leaning back in his chair and laughing with boisterous hilarity . 
`` I wanted to say to Senor Don Jose -- '' growled the formidable horseman . 
`` Hold your tongue , man , for Heaven 's sake ! 
And do n't tire us any more with that nonsense . '' 
`` Senor Caballuco , '' said the canon , `` it is not to be wondered at that gentlemen from the capital should cut out the rough riders of this savage country . '' 
`` In two words , Pepe , the question is this : Caballuco is -- '' She could not go on for laughing . 
`` Is -- I do n't know just what , '' said Don Inocencio , `` of one of the Troya girls , of Mariquita Juana , if I am not mistaken . '' 
`` And he is jealous ! 
After his horse , the first thing in creation for him is Mariquilla Troya . '' 
`` A pretty insinuation that ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta . 
`` Poor Cristobal ! 
Did you suppose that a person like my nephew -- let us hear , what were you going to say to him ? 
Speak . '' 
`` Senor Don Jose and I will talk together presently , '' responded the bravo of the town brusquely . 
And without another word he left the room . 
Shortly afterward Pepe Rey left the dining-room to retire to his own room . 
In the hall he found himself face to face with his Trojan antagonist , and he could not repress a smile at the sight of the fierce and gloomy countenance of the offended lover . 
`` A word with you , '' said the latter , planting himself insolently in front of the engineer . 
`` Do you know who I am ? '' 
As he spoke he laid his heavy hand on the young man 's shoulder with such insolent familiarity that the latter , incensed , flung him off with violence , saying : `` It is not necessary to crush one to say that . '' 
The bravo , somewhat disconcerted , recovered himself in a moment , and looking at Rey with provoking boldness , repeated his refrain : `` Do you know who I am ? '' 
`` Yes ; I know now that you are a brute . '' 
He pushed the bully roughly aside and went into his room . 
As traced on the excited brain of our unfortunate friend at this moment , his plan of action might be summed up briefly and definitely as follows : To break Caballuco 's head without loss of time ; then to take leave of his aunt in severe but polite words which should reach her soul ; to bid a cold adieu to the canon and give an embrace to the inoffensive Don Cayetano ; to administer a thrashing to Uncle Licurgo , by way of winding up the entertainment , and leave Orbajosa that very night , shaking the dust from his shoes at the city gates . 
But in the midst of all these mortifications and persecutions the unfortunate young man had not ceased to think of another unhappy being , whom he believed to be in a situation even more painful and distressing than his own . 
One of the maid-servants followed the engineer into his room . 
`` Did you give her my message ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Yes , senor , and she gave me this . '' 
Rey took from the girl 's hand a fragment of a newspaper , on the margin of which he read these words : `` They say you are going away . 
I shall die if you do . '' 
When he returned to the dining-room Uncle Licurgo looked in at the door and asked : `` At what hour do you want the horse ? '' 
`` At no hour , '' answered Rey quickly . 
`` Then you are not going to-night ? '' 
said Dona Perfecta . 
`` Well , it is better to wait until to-morrow . '' 
`` I am not going to-morrow , either . '' 
`` When are you going , then ? '' 
`` We will see presently , '' said the young man coldly , looking at his aunt with imperturbable calmness . 
`` For the present I do not intend to go away . '' 
His eyes flashed forth a fierce challenge . 
Dona Perfecta turned first red , then pale .
