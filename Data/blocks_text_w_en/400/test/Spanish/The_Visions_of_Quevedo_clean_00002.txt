He took for a cravat , an hour-glass with golden sand ; and for a hat , a bonnet of mercury with wings . 
To do me honour , he preceded me . 
We entered immediately into the apartment of the girls , which was separate from that of the women who have arrived at maturity . 
In perambulating these chambers , I saw all these girls singularly occupied : there were some who wept with jealousy against the widows ; others were filled with inquietudes , not daring to avow the love with which the other sex had inspired them . 
`` My lover , '' said one , `` is extremely cold ; he is too timid ; O that the same privilege of declaring our inclinations was permitted to us , as to the other sex ! 
I would speak a language to him , which he should respond . '' 
Some of them read or wrote letters ; they used a great deal of paper in that business ; for in order to say that they would not , they destroyed , recommenced , destroyed again , and recomposed the same lines ; they desired that their words should have a double meaning , and that their lovers should understand that , which they had no intention of making them comprehend . 
Others , placed before their mirrors , studied their gestures , giving expression to their features , endeavouring to put grace into their smile , and gaiety into their laugh . 
Certain of them , plucked the hair from the chin and eye-brows ; others applied plaster to their faces ; many of them , to cause paleness and a more interesting appearance in the eyes of their lovers , ate plaster , jet , charcoal , and Spanish wax , contrary to the custom of the French , who diligently avoid those substances that can give them a yellow appearance , as saffron , pepper , salt , and every thing provocative . 
From this apartment , I passed into that of the married women . 
Some of them grieved at the jealousy of their husbands , and others at the avarice of theirs . 
There were those who caressed their spouses , that they might the more easily deceive them : there were others who concealed money from their knowledge , to purchase finery , or make presents to their gallants : there were others who made vows , and projected pilgrimages , to the end that they might enjoy the company of those whom they could not otherwise see : and others , who spoke continually of the sweetness , of the handsome mein , and good proportions of their confessors . 
Some there were , who said that there could be no pleasure more consummate , than in revenging ones self upon ones husband ; some , also , that the most insupportable torment to a married woman , was to be obliged to answer the caresses of a husband whom she did not love : many , that the pleasantest hour was that passed at the play with a gallant . 
There were those too among them , who had taken their waiting maids into confidence , and strove to engage them in their interests by every indulgence . 
Contiguous to this place , was a spacious pavilion where we found the widows . 
Some of this class affected austerity and modesty ; but others gave themselves up to all sorts of folly . 
Many were exceedingly joyous , although they were in mourning : many were sad , because black did not become them ; many , on the contrary , judged that crape was their chiefest ornament , and that it served best to exhibit the brilliant whiteness of their complexion . 
The old widows wished to imitate the young , while these sought to improve their time to the best advantage . 
Those who exhibited the most lassitude , were generally young widows , who waited with impatience for the year of mourning to expire ; but others spent their time cursing the memory of their husbands , who had prohibited second nuptials . 
I was soon weary of my visit to this apartment ; folly and libertinism were not to my taste . 
My conductor perceiving it , took me by the arm , and said that he would show me the amorous devotees . 
`` Yet , for all that , '' said I , `` love and devotion can hardly agree ; however , let us see all . '' 
`` Oh , ho , '' said Time ; `` yes , true devotion ; but know that it is as rare to see true devotees , as women without love : these same true devotees have at least those with whom they are not much upon their guard , and when they are not observed , can not resist the seductions of a handsome and assiduous cavalier : in default of that they take their confessor . '' 
Thus conversing , we entered into the apartment of the devotees . 
Almost all prayed to God , either for the health or the return of a lover : many to be soon married , or to be always handsome , or for death to rid them of a rival . 
Some of these women performed their devotions while waiting for their gallants . 
As the character of these women had in it nothing agreeable to me , I besought my conductor to lead me to the abodes of the men ; the more , because I would hear from thence a concert of instruments ; he showed me the entrance into their quarter . 
I found in the first hall , a great number of fiddlers and pipers , who concerted a serenade for the following night . 
In the second , I saw men who made their toilets , and arrayed themselves in new garments , of the favourite colours of their mistresses . 
In the third , were those who prepared to send presents to their fair friends . 
In the fourth , were lovers who put themselves in attitudes to fight in duel with their rivals . 
In the fifth , they read novels , or made extracts from them . 
In the sixth , were the old fellows who were mad for love . 
In the seventh , were young men sick , and who dared not disclose the causes of their indisposition . 
In the eighth , married men did that for their mistresses , which the wives did for their gallants . 
In the ninth , widowers imitated the actions of the widows . 
In the tenth , in fine , the gentlemen of the church showed themselves more amorous than the men of the world , because they are addicted to less general dissipation , and have fewer opportunities for the gratification of their inclinations . 
As I came out of this place , I heard a clock striking with a heavy sound , and reverberating throughout the palace . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said I to Opportunity . 
`` That , '' said he , `` marks the hour for private conversation and appointments ; enter into this large hall ; you shall soon see a great deal of the world : wait for me , until I shall return to conduct you out of the palace , for otherwise you will not be able to find your way . '' 
I went into the hall , in which were a great number of seats . 
The magnificence of the tapestry , which represented the fabulous metamorphoses , corresponded with the style of the edifice : at the extremity was a throne of ivory , silver , and gold , under a canopy enriched with pearls and precious stones . 
When the persons of both sexes had entered and sat , a woman of a strange figure , and clad in a very whimsical manner , placed herself upon the throne ; they called her Passion . 
Another woman , whom they called Folly , sat near her , and spake as if she was the queen 's chancellor . 
Forthwith this princess began to set forth the advantages that had been gained over the empire of Reason , who had been for a long time her enemy . 
While she was speaking , a stately dame named Jealousy , promenaded through every part of the hall : she inspired some with fear , and made others laugh ; at length she came near me , and said -- `` It is not without some purpose , you are here and separate from the rest ; perhaps you are more fortunate . '' 
I answered , that `` I found myself there without any particular design . '' 
-- `` Excellent , '' replied she , retiring ; and from time to time she revisited the place where I was , to see if some girl did not come to join me . 
As I divined her thoughts , I strove to give her uneasiness ; I affected to exhibit the same myself ; I looked anxiously from one side to the other , as if I had expected some one . 
I remarked this woman made the same motions . 
When the queen had finished her discourse , many persons presented petitions , which were all forthwith granted . 
After that , the princess announced to all her votaries , that she granted them the propitious moment , and retired . 
Immediately each one presented his hand to his partner , and hastened from the hall . 
Some went into chambers , and others walked about . 
There was no one but Jealousy remaining in the chamber where I was ; she promenaded about the hall , murmuring : -- `` I shall see , '' said she : `` I will watch ; I will discover : I will hinder : I will talk : I shall not be inactive . 
Ah , good , '' cried she to me with vivacity ; `` what do you do here ? 
depart , I wish to close the gate . '' 
As I expected my guide , I was not willing to go out , lest I might lose myself in this vast edifice . 
`` I wish to wait here for Opportunity , '' said I , `` who ordered me to remain in this hall , till he should come to rejoin me . '' 
`` Reckon not , '' replied she , `` upon this old dotard ; he will not return ; he is gone upon the stream , with the others : believe me ; quit this place : '' and thus speaking , she took me by the shoulders , and thrust me out . 
I walked upon the garden terrace until I saw descend a silken ladder . 
I immediately thought that this was an invitation made to me , and thinking of nothing but the novelty of the adventure , I ascended . 
I entered by a window into a chamber , where I saw a man and a young girl sitting at table : they were both surprised at my presence , but especially the young cavalier , who remained immovable : presently recovering himself , and addressing himself to the lady : -- `` Ingrate , this is then the manner in which you betray me ! 
you have then certainly two lovers , and perhaps fifty ? '' 
`` Me , sir ! '' 
said she ; `` I swear to you I know not this gentleman ; assuredly he has made a mistake , in taking my window for that of some other . '' 
`` Yes , yes , he is deceived , but it is in these two particulars ; that , in the first place , he thought me gone ; and secondly , in taking my ladder , for that you are accustomed to hang out for his accommodation ; but he shall repent it . '' 
Immediately drawing his sword , and taking his dagger in the other hand , he would have stabbed his mistress . 
I also drew my sword , and put myself before the lady , to guard her from the blows of this madman : he dealt me several lunges , which I parried ; I drove him to the window , and as he perceived himself hotly pressed , he sprang out , which gave me immense chagrin . 
The lady had left the chamber ; I sought her in vain , and the agitation of this circumstance awoke me . 
I leave it to the consideration of the reader , if this vision is not a faithful image of profane love : this is the beauty that seduces us ; this is the time we improve ; this is the passion which governs us ; this is the jealousy which torments us ; this is the hour of temptation : a rendezvous , a private conversation , a walk . 
This is that violent motion which leads to crime . 
I leave also to the reader , to make his own reflections upon the occupations of lovers , upon their desire of pleasure , upon their intrigues , upon their pains . 
I am persuaded that no one can have an idea upon the subject , without disapproving of the wanderings of love . 
It is not reason which rules in the palace I have traversed : for reason is an enemy whom they attack , whom they disarm , whom they put far from them , although she is but a kind friend , who never takes up arms but to succour us . 
IF a man of genius , or one only of ordinary discernment , could view the interior of the world , he would feel indignant at himself even for living with so much degradation ; he could not prevent himself from pitying or despising those who are attached to it , and who allow themselves to be deceived by its seductions and artifices . 
There is hardly a person who speaks as he thinks ; one never sees the intention of the actor ; honesty and knavery have often an air of resemblance ; truth and hypocrisy appear like sisters of the same father ; civility and curiosity assume the same colours ; friendship and interest are with difficulty distinguished . 
These reflections occurred to me while walking in my garden ; I entered into a summer house , favourable for meditation , and inclined to slumber by the coolness of the shade , and the murmur of a neighbouring rill , fell asleep . 
During my repose , I fancied myself in the midst of a great city , called Hypocrisy . 
They informed me that it was the capital of the internal world , and bore the same relation to it , that Rome did to the external world , in the time of the emperors . 
It was here the king of the internal world usually resided ; he was called Self Love ; and although he had this appellation , which is , for the most part , in rather bad odour , he was dear to his subjects , who made it their chiefest glory to imitate him , and had no other object than the honour of their sovereign . 
The two principal ministers of this king , were Interest and Ambition : the governor of the city was Pleasure . 
The guards of his majesty were designated by the names of other human passions ; the gentlemen of his court were lackeys , well accoutred ; the farmers of the revenue called themselves ministers of finance : the lawyers , counsellors of the king : the thieves , judges of police : the grooms of the stable , equeries of the king : the mountebanks , physicians : the bankers , masters of accounts : the clerks of the church , abbots : the clerks of the palace , secretaries : the students , doctors . 
There , tailors wear velvet and gold lace ; coblers are cordwainers to the king ; gaming houses , academies : discreditable places , houses of good society : pimps , convenient people : coquettes , ladies of honour : women of pleasure , devotees : black girls , handsome brunettes : in fine , coquetry is friendship : usury , economy : deceit , wisdom , or prudence : malice , wit : cowardice , equanimity of temper : temerity , valour : parasites are amiable people : slanderers , free people : and in like manner of others ; for in this country we perceive every thing to be contrary to that we see in the external world . 
As I promenaded the streets of this city , I met an old man , who inquired of me if I was a stranger . 
`` Yes , I am , '' said I. `` That is very apparent , from the surprise you testify at the novelties of this city ; but if you choose , I will show you things that will astonish you much more : come into my house . '' 
Having accepted this courteous invitation , he preceded me without ceremony , observing , that this was the custom in France . 
`` Oh , signor , '' said I , `` it is no more than justice , that you should be free in your own house ; and I know that it is the French humour , not to accord precedence upon such occasions : because he who first enters , escapes closing the gate upon the inside . '' 
We found in the chamber of this old man , two young friars , preparing to go abroad . 
They assured us , they could not remain any longer , because their superior had ordered them to be present at a funeral procession , to get their wax taper , and customary gratuity . 
`` What admirable charity in these people , '' said I , `` who go to a funeral , not to pray , but to gain . '' 
Soon after , hearing a chanting , we looked from the window to learn the cause . 
We saw a funeral procession , in which were arranged many priests and religious , with a long file of relations . 
It was a woman whom they carried to the grave ; the husband was almost mad ; and I said to my old friend , `` My God ! 
this man is extremely afflicted ! '' 
`` Do you believe that ? '' 
answered he : `` listen to what he says , when he arrives opposite . '' 
In fact , when he came near the house , I heard him say , `` I am not so very unhappy after all ! 
she has wasted the half of my fortune : she has been sick in bed at my expense these last six months ; and her obsequies will cost me a thousand crowns ! 
Ah , Lord ! '' 
cried he in a loud voice , `` why is she dead ? 
and why did you not take me first ? 
or rather , good Lord , why did you not take her before she had dissipated my money ? '' 
At length , reverting to a more pleasant theme , `` I must , '' said he , `` marry Lucilla : she having been a serving girl , will not be fond of ostentation ; she knows nothing about luxuries , since she can not even read . 
To be sure , being young and inexperienced , she made a misstep ; but the remembrance of her fault will make her wary . 
Of the two maids my wife kept , I shall discharge one ; so in three or four years I shall save the expense of this burial . '' 
`` I gain by this chance , '' said a relation of the deceased , who came next : `` I gain ten thousand crowns , because she died intestate . '' 
`` This pest of a woman , '' said a maid servant who followed , `` never failed to take advantage of every opportunity , and yet entertained an extreme jealousy of my master and me . '' 
`` Zounds ! '' 
said I to the old man , `` these people are very sincere ! '' 
`` The things you see here , '' observed he , `` are those which are concealed in the external world ; but if now , you have any curiosity to know with what occupations widows beguile the time , after the death of their husbands , step with me a couple of paces and you shall see . '' 
I directly consented ; the object appearing well worth the trouble . 
There was at the distance of three or four doors from this chamber a grand apartment , the entrance of which was hung with black , and the stair-case covered with the same material . 
We went in , and after traversing a long hall , garnished in the same manner , entered into a little room , the tapestry of which was black velvet ; the bed of beautiful red damask , covered with black crape , with silver fringe . 
In it reposed a young lady of the most conspicuous loveliness , one of the fairest I have ever beheld . 
I offered her my condolences upon the death of her husband , whom my old friend had informed me was a gentleman of the sword , and a loyal subject of the king -- Self-love . 
She answered , smiling in the most affable manner , that she was highly sensible of my politeness , and that she felt very happy that the death of her husband had procured her the pleasure of my acquaintance . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed I , to myself , `` what affliction ! 
but let us examine a little farther . '' 
I approached the bed , and sat down upon a sofa near by : we conversed upon many things indifferently , and at length came upon the adventures of young widows . 
At this period of the conversation , raising herself up to take her handkerchief , she exposed to my view , with a beautiful shoulder , a neck fairer than moonlight . 
Just as this sight had inspired me with love , I heard a man snore , who was upon the other side of the bed . 
She drew the curtain , and gave the gallant a slight cuff , saying , `` you are very impertinent to sleep thus near a lady in bed . '' 
The other awaking , was going to revenge himself upon the lady for her slight buffet . 
`` No , no , '' said I , `` do not ; I should rather be punished myself . '' 
Both of them then began to turn their raillery upon me . 
Perceiving this , I left the chamber , beckoning the old man to follow . 
I was greatly scandalized at such conduct , and my companion did nothing but laugh . 
What people you have here ! 
amiable widows ! 
Some hours afterwards , I accidentally met in the street , the beau whom I parted with at the widow 's . 
`` It is thus , '' said this man , accosting me , `` that widows console themselves , and redeem the time they may have lost with a cross , jealous , or avaricious husband . '' 
`` You understand these matters well , '' answered I ; `` and madam will soon forget her loss . '' 
Conferring thus together , we became familiar : he was anxious to learn my name , and told me his own , which was Joy . 
`` I am not astonished , '' said I , `` the beauty listened to you . 
A quarter of an hour spent in your society , will abundantly recompense her for the sad and weary years passed with a jealous spouse . '' 
When the old man saw us thus pleased with each other , he said he would leave me in the company of this honest person , and that he should expect me at his house to supper , after the play , to which we had determined to go . 
At the theatre we saw comedies about equivalent to our tragedies ; and , in fact , of so close a resemblance , that one might almost fancy them the same . 
The story of the one I saw was this : -- Two young persons met at the house of a mutual friend , to concert measures to gain the consent of their parents to their marriage : their degree was not equal ; the girl was nobly born , and an heiress ; the young man poor , and the son of a merchant . 
They both promised to put in requisition every possible method that could be devised , to vanquish the opposition of the old folks upon whom they depended . 
The young man said he would make himself an advocate , and afterwards a counsellor in parliament ; the expence of which he could easily defray in one year after his marriage , with the help of his wife 's dowry . 
The girl , on her part , promised not to refuse him any token of affection ; and agreeable to their plan , she was to inform her mother , that she was pregnant by Signor Virodeno ; for thus was her lover called . 
In order to the furtherance of this design , they instigated their friend to pretend to betray them , and to apprise the parents of both parties of what was passing . 
The parents hastened to the spot ; the lovers came promptly from the chamber ; they both heaped reproaches upon their daughter , and as the mother was about to strike her , she declared herself pregnant . 
`` Unhappy wretch , '' exclaimed her mother , `` you will always be a grief to me ; you will bring dishonour upon the family : I will strangle you on the spot . '' 
`` Stop , '' said her husband , `` you will only expose yourself to be hanged : we must think rather now to conceal this disgrace . '' 
`` No , no , '' said the mother ; `` let me stab her to death with this knife . '' 
She would have executed her resolution , had not her more discreet husband disarmed her , saying , `` recollect yourself , madam ; you were in the same situation when I married you ; and if your mother had killed you , you would not to-day have made all this uproar . '' 
But as she continued to give way to fresh paroxysms of indignation , her husband enforced his reasons with some wholesome correction . 
He subsequently conferred with the parents of the lover , who promised to do every thing for the advancement of their son , in consideration of the rank of the young lady 's family , with whom they would not be at variance . 
The company then gave a loose to mirth ; they found out the young couple were well matched ; they busied themselves in preparations for the nuptials , and sent to apprise the young man , who had taken refuge at the house of the governor of the city . 
He came , accompanied by the proper officers ; the marriage was celebrated ; nothing was wanting at the feast , and they parted on the best of terms . 
All this scene was in such perfect keeping , that the young espoused were married at the house of the maternal father-in-law , who himself did the honours of friendship . 
Thus they conclude marriages and other matters : so that there , one can see the minds of people , and the purpose of every man 's action . 
At the palace it is the same ; every thing is laid open ; the advocates plead not , but pro honorario ; the solicitors think of nothing but prolonging the suits by those incidents they themselves devise ; and the judges , for the purpose of enhancing their fees , deliver a hundred judgments , when one would answer . 
As a specimen of their method , take the following decree : `` Having taken into consideration the petition of Signor Thief , solicitor to the lord Stupid , the court do order , that the parties have day in court , for the space of four years , that the fees may absorb the sum of three hundred pounds , which must be expended in this suit . 
Done at our court of the palace of hypocrisy , at the winter term of the current year . 
Pecunia , President . '' 
What I have related of the palace , is to exemplify the spirit that reigns in this city ; the same influence governs the court , the army , the treasury , and the theatre . 
There were in a box adjoining ours , at the latter place , two men , who discoursed concerning the sale of certain merchandize . 
The seller said , `` I wish you to give fifty thousand livres , for what cost me thirty ; but I wish to make a thousand crowns profit . '' 
The other was not willing to give more than a hundred pistoles . 
At last they agreed upon the thousand crowns , upon condition that the seller , who was a steward , should give to the purchaser the titles to the rents of certain farms , without the knowledge of his lord , and upon which event the purchaser was also to give a feast . 
After the play , I went to seek my old friend ; upon meeting him , he informed me that the king , Self-love , was fallen ill ; and that on account of his indisposition , the whole city prepared to testify their gratitude . 
`` How , '' said I , `` can you think of diversions , when the father of the country lies sick ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said he , `` it becomes us to rejoice ; it would be hypocrisy to do otherwise , when we have a prospect of changing our master . '' 
`` In the world of which I am an inhabitant , '' rejoined I , `` we feel the most lively sorrow , if our prince falls sick ; and our religion commands us to offer up prayers for his health . '' 
`` And we , '' answered the good man , `` are taught to rejoice ; for we have no other policy than interest , and to which your religion is opposed . '' 
`` If Self-love should die , '' said I , `` you would perhaps be governed by a less popular king . 
Pleasure , who aspires to the crown , Interest , nor either of the other princes of the blood , would exercise a dominion so happy and sweet . 
These princes are naturally proud , cruel , and vindictive : in the place of which , Self-love is often , nay , almost always solicitous for the preservation of his subjects . '' 
The conversation turned upon this topic , for some time . 
The old man , contrary to the usual spirit of aged people , was desirous that Pleasure should succeed to the throne . 
As for myself , I maintained that the nation would be less happy , under such a sway . 
After our soup , he wanted to carry me to see the fireworks , and the ball the governor gave upon the occasion . 
I refused to go ; these things seeming to me very ridiculous , on account of the cause that elicited them . 
The old man was much offended at my refusal ; he told me that I was a sour , dissatisfied man , and an enemy to the general joy . 
I replied , that he was an old fool , and that if he molested me any more , I would throw him out of the window , and put his family to the sword . 
At this moment we heard the cry of fire in the house ; and the common danger caused us to forego our quarrel . 
The uproar was caused by a servant girl , who , because her mistress refused , from some cause or other , to pay her wages , had set fire to the house , from motives of revenge . 
They pretended to extinguish it in a very curious manner , which was , by throwing on light stuffs , soaked in oil . 
I dreamt that a great sheet of flame suddenly enveloped me : I awoke on the instant , crying that I was in a house environed : and thinking the noise I heard came from the flame , -- I cried , `` fire ! '' 
A servant that was seeking me in the garden , ran , upon hearing me , and told me that some one waited to see me . 
When I had finished my business with this person , my dream caused me much reflection ; the more I thought upon it , the closer seemed the resemblance to what is taking place in the world : in fact , it is Self-love that reigns , and these are the passions that govern us ; and whoever could see the heart and soul of men , would find them arrant hypocrites . 
The world itself is the city of Hypocrisy . 
It is in this city , that interest , ambition , pleasure , vengeance , anger , and all other evil passions conceal themselves . 
The more I examine , the more clearly these truths appear : -- That whosoever could disabuse himself for a single moment , would be so , for the remainder of his life : and he who really desires to know himself and the world , would learn from observation , more than he has an idea of . 
The world is , of all things , the most difficult to understand , and that which one ought to know the best . 
There is no person who distrusts himself ; consequently , there is no one who realizes , that it is deceptive , filled with self-love , attached to its own interests , seeking its own gratifications , vain , unquiet , restless , presumptuous , vindictive , pure outwardly , criminal within , lovely and fair in appearance -- deserving , at bottom , of hatred and contempt : and what is still more incomprehensible about this same world , is , there is hardly an individual who doth not love it ; they lose by this love , and they know of a surety , that it is to this attachment they must attribute their losses : meanwhile , it pleases all : they seek after it ; they wish to serve it ; they abandon to it all which they hold most dear . 
Some sacrifice to it their honour for pleasure ; others their lives for glory ; and some surrender their repose for the poor ambition of fortune . 
But it was for us , the world was created ; and that is really the victim one ought to sacrifice , to preserve his honour , to enjoy eternal pleasures , to acquire true glory , and amass treasures , that neither rust nor envy can spoil . 
-- Think not , my dear reader , what I have here presented to you , a dream , a vision ; it is more real than you imagine . 
I had been , during the autumn , at the country house of one of my friends . 
In the parish where he resided , that had not seen its bishop for thirty years , there had recently been settled a new curate , a fluent preacher , and very much devoted to the instruction of his flock -- reading every Sunday homilies and sermons , and the greater and lesser catechisms . 
One day , I went to hear one of the familiar exhortations , which he usually gave to his people , concerning heaven and hell : he depicted the latter in such strong colours , that the whole audience were moved ; and each whispered to himself , O frightful residence ! 
Full of these ideas myself , I returned to sup at my entertainer 's house . 
After quitting the table , I extended myself on a couch ; and my friend , seeing me soon overcome with a pleasant slumber , for we had fared sumptuously , left me , to enjoy himself the same refreshment . 
During sleep , I dreamed that I was at the outlet of an extensive forest , from whence diverged two roads , the one smooth and broad , the other rough , covered with stones and ditches , thorns , and thick entangled bushes . 
I pursued the first , in which I remarked many houses of pleasure , and multitudes of people , who travelled in carriages , on horseback , or on foot , at a moderate pace , without fatiguing themselves . 
One might see there , persons of all ages , sexes , conditions , and estates ; one might find there , shops , magazines , taverns , play-houses , and societies of women ; in fine , people of every country and religion . 
I was not surprised that many came from the narrow way into ours ; but I was greatly so , at some who went from this fine road into the other , which caused me to inquire where it terminated : as to ours , I thought it led to Madrid . 
Some one answered , that the little way conducted to Paradise ; and the one where I was , direct to Hell . 
I pursued my journey without making any other reflection . 
Having travelled about a quarter of a league , I began to perceive a bad odour , as of sulphur and bitumen , and supposed it proceeded from baths of mineral waters , which diffused a strong scent at a great distance around . 
I advanced constantly , and arrived at last before a large edifice , which answered the description of Pluto 's palace , as it is represented in fable . 
I found at the gate an immense devil , horrible to look upon . 
At this apparition , I stepped hastily back , two or three paces , and drew my sword , suspecting that some one was thus disguised , to do me an injury . 
The porter , perceiving my embarrassment , approached , telling me to fear nothing ; for he was thus clothed , to deter the saints , who constantly endeavoured to abstract the damned from hell . 
`` It is then true , that this is hell , '' said I. `` Yes , at your service : enter , enter , my lord , one had better come here living than dead . '' 
I immediately walked in , and besought a devil whom I met , to show me the apartments of the palace : he called himself Curiosity ; this was his appellation of war , or rather that of his employment ; for as angels take theirs from their offices near God or men , so likewise demons are named , from the services they execute , or the dignities with which they are invested . 
`` They denominate me Curiosity , '' said the demon , `` because it is I who inspire men with the desire of seeing , listening , proving , and tasting ; and as it is curiosity that opens the door of sin , so it is I who open that of hell . '' 
`` You may conduct me there , '' said I , `` on condition that you bring me back to the gate again , after I have examined it ; and you will oblige me still farther , by leading me afterwards to paradise , which I would also visit . '' 
`` It is not I , '' replied Curiosity , `` who can conduct you thither , and open the door ; the guide of the way is Retirement , the porter , Virtue ; but I will show you every thing worthy of notice here , and reconduct you to the place from whence I take you . '' 
`` Very well , '' said I , and followed him . 
We first entered into a spacious court , where the devils were scourging the unhappy , who cried , `` pardon , pardon , my God ! 
I did not reflect -- I did not believe -- who told me of these things ; '' and many other similar expostulations . 
`` These , '' observed the devil , `` are people , that have come to hell without thinking about it , without fear , and without believing it . '' 
`` They were then honest in their faith ; but why punish those guilty only through ignorance ? '' 
The devil replied , `` they ought to think upon the matter , to instruct themselves , and be persuaded that hell is no place for mercy -- so much the worse for them . '' 
I passed from thence into a great chamber , where there were many men gaming , who swore and blasphemed because they had lost a little money , or played a bad card . 
`` Behold these people , '' said I to the devil , `` how impatient and hasty ! '' 
`` That is the cause of their being here . '' 
In another room we found comedians , who mourned at their captivity , shut up for having made the world laugh . 
Said they ; `` if by chance some equivocal words have impressed the spectators with evil thoughts , was it not rather their fault than ours ? '' 
`` Oh , '' said the devil to me , `` if they had done no more than that , they should scarcely have come here ; but think of their lost time , knaveries , and secret crimes ! 
In the terrestrial paradise , a male and female comedian enacted a scene , that hath given to the devil the whole human race . '' 
`` Ah ! 
who had they for spectators when they were alone in the world ? '' 
`` No , it is not the comedy which damns the players ; it is what passes behind the scenes . '' 
In the following chamber were the physicians and their suit : they composed poisons for themselves ; they took the doses when prepared ; they bled and purged themselves , and tried every dangerous and disagreeable remedy in medicine , surgery , and chemistry , to procure death to themselves , and could not succeed . 
`` They once used their art , '' said the devil , `` for a bad purpose , and now their art fails them at their utmost need : do what they will , they can not die , because the air of hell is a fire which purifies and conserves . '' 
In a cabinet near this chamber , were a number of persons endeavouring to make gold , or to speak more plainly , sought to discover the philosopher 's stone : among them I recognised Tarnesier , he who made the nail half gold and half iron , which is in the museum of the duke of Tuscany ; also a duke of Saxony , and a duke of the Medici , who knew how to make gold during their lives , but forgot the secret when they came to hell . 
`` Is , then , the making of gold so heinous a sin ? '' 
inquired I of the devil . 
`` No , '' answered he , `` but it is a grievous offence not to know how to make it , and that is the reason these gentlemen are here . '' 
`` And the others , '' said I , `` who never pretended to have made the discovery ! '' 
`` Oh , they have not passed off copper for gold , as these have done . '' 
`` Let me see the devotees now , '' said I to my conductor ; `` they are a species of humanity that will divert me . '' 
`` You are right ; these are the fools of hell ; it will be more instinctive to look at them than those of this apartment . '' 
As we repassed the chambers we had visited , I heard some one exclaim , `` Look at this poor devil , who knows not where to bestow himself ; Curiosity is seeking a lodging for him . '' 
`` Signor , '' said one of them to me , `` remain here , with the devil 's permission , if you can not be accommodated elsewhere . '' 
I passed by without answer , not wishing to hold any intercourse with the damned . 
I found in this place monks and devotees who had hated one another so rancorously , that they had abused the most holy things of religion , and wasted the time of the church in giving vent to their malice , and afterwards would excuse their conduct in terms not used in the world but to express the most moral , sacred , and holy actions . 
`` Ah , what hypocrites , '' said the devil ; `` it would have been better for them , if they had delivered themselves openly to those pleasures , they concealed under the appearances which deceive the vulgar . '' 
In another part they were praying after this fashion : -- `` Lord , let my father soon taste the joys of Paradise , that I may take possession of his estate . '' 
-- `` Lord , take speedily my uncle to thy bosom , that I may have his benefice . '' 
-- `` Great saint , make me fortunate at play ; disdain not my prayer ; grant that my children may contract opulent marriages , and prosper in the world . '' 
-- `` Let my daughter espouse the noble Spaniard . '' 
-- They uttered other supplications fully as extravagant , and added promises and vows . 
-- `` I will give a hundred crowns to the poor , ornaments to my church , a dowry to six unhappy orphans , two wax tapers , and a chaplet of flowers to our lady . '' 
-- `` I will wear a dark coloured habit , '' said one girl ; `` and I a white , '' said another . 
The first replies , `` I am brunette , the violet suits my complexion ; '' the second , `` I am red , the white becomes me best . '' 
Next to this apartment was that of women and girls who had been lovers , and whose number was very considerable . 
As the history of their folly was similar , I felt unwilling to listen to it , but traversed their chamber without stopping , and entered into the quarter of the poets , to have the satisfaction of beholding the great geniuses of antiquity . 
There I was much surprised to find Homer , sitting in the midst of the Grecian poets , and reading his own Iliad , he who had been so blind during his life . 
I was tempted to ask him some questions respecting his works , and had an idea he would reply in verse . 
With this view I walked round the circle that was formed , and spoke in these terms to the prince of poets : -- `` O , illustrious Homer ! 
light of the universe ! 
author of the most sublime fictions ! 
the beauty and price of thy writings surpass the grandeur of the king of Spain , the wisdom of Charlemagne , the abundance of Ceres , the girdle of the Graces , the tenderness of Venus , the delicacies of Bacchus , the brightness of Aurora , the height of heaven , the depth of hell , the vastidity of the ocean , and the variety of the world , a Spaniard who wants neither spirit nor courage , of Quevedo , demands of thee if the victory thou hast attributed to the Greeks before Troy truly belongs to them ; and if Paris , that tender lover , actually in vain took so much trouble to carry off their chaste Helen . '' 
Homer , rubbing his eyes , answered me thus : -- `` Here there must needs be sincerity and truth ; for we pay dearly for the boldness and obloquy , that weak mortals admire : our torments are eternal . 
I never was in Ionia : I passed my life in Greece ; to honour this nation I sacked Troy ; a city strong , rich , fortunate , and always victorious , and that was finally destroyed by an earthquake . 
Helen , to whom I have accorded the honours of fidelity , was the least scrupulous of all our frail damsels . 
Leave me to relent over what hath charmed all the poets of the world . 
Go from this place , and tell mortals you found me reading , against my inclination , those works that have attained the universal suffrage . '' 
His discourse affected me . 
I pitied this old man , who wept upon reading his poems ; but I reflected that he had invented all those fabulous incidents , to which both pagans and Christians are equally attached . 
Homer , this genius who knew how to assume so many changes , had he need to endow with heavenly powers , those brave men whom he sent to the siege of Troy ? 
he might have created heroes , without making them gods : to be sure , it is always permitted to poets to feign and magnify their subjects ; or , in other words , the subjects thus aggrandised and exalted to heaven have no sublimity but in poesy and upon paper , like the figures that painters trace on canvass , or sculptors upon marble . 
How could the Greeks mistake and worship gods who had such an origin ? 
however the thing has happened , Homer is the cause , and now mourns over his poetry and himself ; he has for companions in misery , his disciples and imitators . 
Ought this not to serve as a lesson to living poets , who , abusing their talents , compose and read seductive works , causing those who think themselves in a condition to do the like , to lose their time , and often corrupting the heart in recreating the mind . 
From this chamber I passed into that of the Latin poets . 
Ovid and Virgil there disputed the throne . 
Horace chafed that he was not admitted into the contest , and Martial revenged himself upon them by a piquant epigram . 
Horace protested against the whole proceeding of the two first ; he demanded arbitrators , and nominated on his own behalf Scaliger , who has declared that he would rather have been the author of the ninth ode , than the possessor of the crown of Arragon ; but they would not notice him . 
The other poets espoused the party that suited them best : many declared for Seneca the tragedian , for Terence , and Plautus . 
These last , read in a corner of the chamber the finest passages of their compositions . 
They now began to talk of settling the dispute with blows : fearing , therefore , that I might get an unlucky hit in the mêlée , I left the place , and passed hastily into the chambers of the Spaniards , Italians , French , English , Turkish , Chinese , and Persian . 
I noticed the ancient Gaulish poets , crowned with misletoe of the oak , making processions , and singing the histories of their first kings . 
`` Here , upon this side , '' said Curiosity to me , `` is a chamber of perfumers ; they have fine scents for the gratification of the damned ; but you would hardly be able to bear them . '' 
`` I will take , '' said I , `` a pinch of snuff . '' 
I drew forth my box , helped myself , and offered it to my devil ; he filled his nose , but from the titilation he felt in his olfactories , he withdrew his fingers , when he began to sneeze in such a manner , and with such a noise , that hell itself seemed sinking under us , he belched forth fire from his nose , as lightning flashes from a cloud ; he put his fore-finger to it , and there issued forth a rivulet of liquid sulphur , which uniting with his saliva , formed a torrent of boiling water , that flowed across the chamber , and passed through the doors and windows ; without that I believe I should have been drowned . 
These waters fell upon people underneath , who began to call for help , thinking a river of melted sulphur and pitch fell upon them . 
The devil laughed heartily at this disorder , and told me my snuff was excellent : he asked for another pinch ; I did not dare to refuse him , because he was in his own house ; and such a refusal might , perhaps , have made him regard me as impolite . 
But this time , when I put my fingers into the box , the powder took fire as if it had been saltpetre , and burnt in my hands , at which accident I was not sorry , being apprehensive of another disorder , similar to the first . 
We then entered the chamber of the perfumers : they were occupied in extracting essences of intolerable odours , which are as agreeable to them as jessamine , tuberose , orange , and others in use among the men and women of our world : they made these essences from the oil of the box tree , from wax , jet , and yellow amber . 
Their pomatums were composed of galbanum , assafœtida , rosin , pitch , and turpentine . 
I was informed that these were for the use of the ladies of hell , who were served by the perfumers , and who were , at the same time , obliged to use their compounds , in obedience to the laws of Lucifer . 
From thence , we proceeded along a broad aisle , which terminated at an elevated pavilion , the apartment of the astrologers and magicians . 
I met at the door a chiromancer , who desired to inspect my hand . 
I extended it without ceremony ; but scarcely had I touched his , before I was glad to withdraw it , it seemed so hot and fiery . 
`` I have remarked at a glance , '' said he , `` that you will be happy if you are prudent . '' 
`` And you , '' said I , `` what have you noticed with regard to your own ? '' 
`` I knew , '' replied he , `` by the mount of Saturn , that I was to be damned . '' 
`` Ah , well ! 
if you had exercised the prudence you recommend to me , you would not have been here . '' 
I passed without further speech , and saw a man , who , with compasses , measured upon a globe , the distances between the celestial signs : `` what are you doing , good man ? '' 
said I. `` Ah , God ! '' 
replied he , `` if I had been born but half an hour sooner , when Saturn changed his aspect , and Mars lodged in the house of life , my salvation had been certain . '' 
The others made similar observations , so that one could hardly forbear laughing at their complaints . 
There came up one named Taisnerius , author of a book upon physiognomy and chiromancy , who gazed in my face for such a length of time , that he quite embarrassed me . 
`` You look like an old burnt shoe , '' said I to him ; `` go your ways ; do not stop so near me . '' 
`` Look at this beggar , '' said he ; `` see how he affects the man of consequence , because he wears a sword by his side , and hath the cross of Saint James ! 
What a physiognomy ! 
What an aspect ! 
What a figure ! 
This man goes straight to the gibbet : besides , there is here neither wealth nor rank ; all are equal . '' 
`` Insolent fellow , '' said I ; `` if I draw my sword , I will teach you how to speak to a man of honour ; have you not had experience enough to be wise ? 
you ought to bear in mind the correction you received in Portugal , for treating a gentleman in the same indecorous manner you have me ; but you are incorrigible . '' 
`` Taisnerius , '' said my devil , `` get into your hole , and draw your own horoscope . '' 
After this trifling dispute , we advanced , and encountered many astrologers , among whom were Hali , Gerard of Cremona , Barthelemi of Parma , a certain personage by the name of Tondin , and Cornelius Agrippa . 
The moment this last perceived me , he cried out that `` the world did him injustice , in calling him Agrippa the black -- in accusing him of magic , and other similar things , for which , he averred , he had not been damned : that he was born in an age of ignorance , when good physicians passed for magicians , astrologers for sorcerers , and all learned men for people who had converse with the devil ; that his book upon the Cabala , was nothing more but a satire upon the cabalistic art of the Jews , and the little key of Solomon ; and finally , the book itself might be taken as a criterion of his faith , in those things by which they deceived the simple , and of the vanity of that science . 
I am no more a magician , '' continued he , `` than Cardan , whom you can see if you wish . '' 
`` Why then have you been damned ? '' 
`` Because I abused my knowledge , and amused myself with people 's credulity ; if I had indeed been a magician , I should have become penitent , and been saved . '' 
While I was speaking , I heard a tremendous uproar , proceeding from another apartment , and inquiring the cause , was informed the Turks were fighting ; and as I happened to understand their language , discovered the quarrel was , in fact , between Mahomet and the two prophets , who had each established a sect in the Mahometan law . 
Mahomet complained very bitterly against Ali , because he had given to the Persians a false Alcoran , and because Albubekir had so illy explained his own , in Africa . 
He , on the contrary , maintained that the Alcoran could have no other meaning , than what he had attached to it . 
Ali asserted , there was no reason in this law ; and furthermore , he contended , that Mahomet himself knew nothing about the book he had composed . 
They chafed furiously upon this , and cried out , as if enraged to madness ; I heard their dialogue , but do not wish to be the herald of their quarrels . 
This was gentleness itself , compared with what passed among the heretic and schismatic Christians ; there I saw Luther in the habit of the Augustine order , with his monks about him , and a pot of wine on the table . 
`` Do the dead drink , '' said I , `` to the devil ? '' 
`` Not at all ; but this wine is set before their eyes , for the purpose of tormenting them with the sight of what they loved so well ; it is for the same reason , that Luther has his wife with him . '' 
Melancthon was also there ; he wept continually , and was so unquiet , that he could not remain an instant at rest : he traversed from right to left upon all sides , and then returned to the place from whence he set out , only to recommence the same journey . 
`` What is this man doing ? '' 
said I to Curiosity . 
`` He imitates the conduct he pursued in the world ; for there he was alternately with Luther and the church ; sometimes a Zuinglian , and sometimes a Calvinist ; thus are the inconstant tormented . 
This good old man whom you see here , is Erasmus ; this other is Grotius ; unhappily , they neither of them had any religion . 
This man , who appears so sour , and is surrounded with ministers , is Calvin , who brought about the reformation . 
These others , are heretics of the first ages , who are here for being reluctant to submit to legitimate authority . 
See the great Photius patriarch of Constantinople , how the Greeks surround him : he is justly punished for having quitted the ministry for the patriarchate ; if he had remained in a civil station he would have been saved ; but being mixed up in ecclesiastical affairs , he committed so much wickedness , that he now suffers no more than he deserves . '' 
`` A man so learned ! '' 
said I to the devil . 
`` Yes , too much so ; and too much knowledge is often more injurious than profitable . '' 
I began now to tire of hell , and fatigued with my walk , intimated a desire to my conductor to depart , and to be accompanied by him as far as the gate . 
He replied , he wished first to show me the apartment of the contractors , whom I had not yet seen , and which was upon a line with that in which we were . 
I then entered into the chambers of these farmers of the revenue , and was surprised to see such a multitude , each habited in the garb of his own country . 
`` There are here , then , '' said I , `` people from all quarters of the globe . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the devil , `` since there are every where imposts . '' 
`` But why , '' demanded I , `` are these people damned , who have levied the lawful tribute of legitimate princes ? 
I have read in the scripture that it is lawful to pay tribute unto Cæsar : how shall this tribute be paid , unless there are people to collect it ? 
must one be damned for doing a duty ? '' 
`` Hold , hold , '' cried the demon ; `` not quite so much philosophy ; these contractors were full as philosophical as you are ; but it is nevertheless true , if they had only levied the tribute due to their prince , they would not have been damned ; but they raised one not due , either to the prince or to themselves : they would have been much better off , had they not made so much expense , and the prince had given them but a shilling for a pound . 
Calculate , for a moment , what an enormous sum is requisite , for the compensation of the host of subalterns attached to an office ; consider then , how much the principal must gain ; add to that , what goes into the coffers of the king , without mentioning what is styled the perquisites , and you will find that not more than one per cent of the ducats are realized at the treasury ; and that , he who gets the most , is doubtless the farmer . 
If the king of Spain would oblige them to send straight to him the custom on exports and imports , he would profit by that the contractors get . 
There needs but one commissary , for all the revenues of the king , in each office ; he should supervise all the books and accounts , contenting himself with a generous salary for his care , punishing frauds by pecuniary fines , and by corporeal inflictions for second offences . 
If the matter was thus managed , the king would be richer , and taxes less ; the people would be less burthened , and almost all this great number of contractors , would remain in commerce , in the army , or country . 
How much should you say , '' demanded the devil , `` the king received , of what is annually taken from the royal mines ? '' 
`` About three quarters , '' replied I. `` He would be too well off , '' exclaimed he , with a cry of admiration ; `` he does not get the thousandth part ; all goes in outfits , in expenses ; and I verily believe , that if these things are to continue thus , the king would gain more by closing them , than in causing them to be worked . '' 
`` At present , '' said I , `` there is a necessity of levying imposts , of having contractors , and paying them well : the neighbouring princes do the same , to furnish their charges and expenses of war : if this is an evil , it is one that must be endured , to preserve the whole body politic from destruction . 
But how is it possible , you can so vehemently dislike the gentlemen of the revenue , who form by far the largest part of your infernal population ? '' 
`` It is the force of reason , '' answered he , `` that compels even demons to avow the truth , and both to love and detest the wickedness we are desirous of detecting in others , to make them companions of our misery . '' 
`` I admire , '' said I , `` the force of truth ; and I admire not less to see injustice hated , even among the unjust ; but I can not comprehend , why you should say , that however legitimate the tribute due to the prince , the contractors can not conscientiously take the public money . '' 
`` You misapprehend me ; that they can do ; but the farmers collect more money than is consistent with equity , or the orders of the prince ; they extort that which should be useful for the maintenance of the public weal : it is of this charge , of this waste , the contractors are guilty . '' 
`` I understand you , '' said I to the demon ; `` but conduct me from hence , for I am weary . '' 
He continued : -- `` Do you comprehend what I say , that it is the contractors who are most happy and rich ? 
and from whence come those superb mansions , as magnificently furnished as the Escurial palace ? 
how can they support such enormous expenses ? 
entertain so many gentlemen ? 
give their daughters such ample dowries ? 
contract advantageous alliances with the noblest families of Castile and Arragon ? 
Such an one shall command to-day , and be covered in the king 's presence , who a year since drove a chariot , or stood behind a carriage . 
Another , who hired his land , shall presently purchase the farm he formerly cultivated . 
Appointed a subaltern in one of the offices , he soon becomes its head , and is elevated by degrees to the nobility . '' 
The demon having finished , I thanked him , and wishing to impress the lesson on my memory , engaged him to repeat it . 
He summed up the whole in the following manner : -- `` Observe neither what reason or the law prescribes to thee , respect neither God nor the king , lay the peasantry under contribution , succumb to the great , become a great proprietary farmer , cause the purchaser to pay you twice for what you sell : to put out of sight the baseness of your origin , obtain an appointment in one of the bureaux , and accustom yourself to command ; for by these gradations one may arrive at the highest dignities . '' 
`` What signifies all that , '' said one of the contractors , who listened to our discourse ; `` is it not natural for a person to elevate himself if he can ? 
Is it not the order of Providence , that the lofty should be abased , and the humble exalted ? 
Fortune is but a wheel , which in its revolutions puts underneath what but now was on top . 
If the subjects were more attached to the government , the sovereign would have less need of imposts , and consequently of collectors . 
If they were perfectly just , they would not need a king . 
To complain of our avarice is to accuse heaven ; instead of which only the impenetrability of individuals should be reproached , who would rather see a great kingdom like Spain entirely overthrown , than advance a single real to repair the slightest breach . 
Know , Signor Devil , who has delivered such a philippic against the contractors , that we have been to our country , what the bones and muscles are to the human body , or numerous armies to a province threatened with an invasion : if the king of hell would but consult with us , we should teach him to fortify his dominions in such a manner , that they would be impregnable to both saints and angels . 
In the first place , I would lay a tax upon every demon who plies his occupation in the world : secondly , I would establish a daily employment for each soul in the infernal world : thirdly , I would make the magicians and sorcerers pay an annual tribute : this will be done , for I have heard the king of the demons was about to organise a council of financiers ; and this is a subject that might well engage even the attention of that celebrated Englishman , who invented the first paper currency of England . '' 
`` And wherefore , '' said the demon , `` impose a tax on us ? 
What will you do when we refuse to pay ? 
Can you confiscate our estates ? 
In what prisons will you confine us when you have decreed our arrest ? 
We should mock at all your projects : ah , little man ! 
you grow licentious ! 
you must be chained up ; come , obey ; extend your hands and legs . '' 
`` I shall do neither the one nor the other , '' said the contractor ; `` you are not here our master ; I will call the financial council together ; and I am going this instant to denounce you to the grand inquisition , because you resist paying tribute to the king of Spain . '' 
`` I laugh at your inquisition , '' said the demon , `` and to be beforehand with you , I will denounce you to the prince of devils himself : come , quick , obey ; extend your hands and legs . '' 
The contractor found himself loaded with irons , in spite of his remonstrances : the devil then went into the apartment of the inquisitors to subject them to the same treatment , and afterwards returned to accompany me to the gate , as I had requested . 
`` These insolents , '' muttered he , `` these insects ! 
what pride ! 
what rodomontades ! 
was there ever seen such supercilious knaves ? 
But I will humble them in such a manner , and make them suffer so much , that they will have no stomach to talk of imposts and taxes . '' 
When we had left these contractors , -LRB- whom I regard as the most unhappy class in hell , because , let them do ever so much good to the prince or to the state , let them be ever so upright in their administration , nay , even if they were angels , they could not escape accusation and hatred -RRB- our attention was attracted by an immense crowd , which had arrived and filled up the avenue in such a manner , that we could not pass , and so were obliged to fall back to the opposite gate . 
`` Who are these people ? '' 
inquired I of the demon . 
`` They are , '' replied he , `` a corps of tailors ; they arrive here in crowds , like great armies , and when they come , all the demons are put in requisition to confine them ; my duty compels me to assist ; go with me , and amuse yourself with our proceedings . '' 
We made our way through this crowd of tailors , and arrived at length , before a great furnace , the mouth of which was more than ten fathoms in diameter . 
There they bound these tailors in faggots , putting from ten to a dozen in each bundle : they fastened each one by the feet , and then brought a rope about the whole package , and afterwards suspending the faggot to a hook , which was elevated by means of a pulley , over the centre of the furnace , a devil detached it , and let it fall into the fire . 
Sometimes the tailors who had their arms free , grasped so firmly the pulley , that the devil had an infinite deal of trouble to loose their hold : when that took place , he caused the whole mass to make a pirouette in the air , and as the motion was violent , the tailors were always forced to let go , and drop into the fire . 
It happened that one of these faggots fell outside the aperture , upon a quantity of others , which were ranged like a pile of wood , and which the devil measured .
