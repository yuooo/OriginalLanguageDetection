`` I have a blind faith in the triumph of the law of God . 
Some one must stand up in defence of it . 
If not one , it will be another . 
The palm of victory , and with it eternal glory , some one must bear . 
The wicked will perish , if not to-day , to-morrow . 
That which goes against the law of God will fall irremediably . 
Let it be in this manner or in that , fall it must . 
Neither its sophistries , nor its evasions , nor its artifices will save it . 
The hand of God is raised against it and will infallibly strike it . 
Let us pity them and desire their repentance . 
As for you , my children , do not expect that I shall say a word to you about the step which you are no doubt going to take . 
I know that you are good ; I know that your generous determination and the noble end which you have in view will wash away from you all the stain of the sin of shedding blood . 
I know that God will bless you ; that your victory , the same as your death , will exalt you in the eyes of men and in the eyes of God . 
I know that you deserve palms and glory and all sorts of honors ; but in spite of this , my children , my lips will not incite you to the combat . 
They have never done it , and they will not do it now . 
Act according to the impulse of your own noble hearts . 
If they bid you to remain in your houses , remain in them ; if they bid you to leave them -- why , then , leave them . 
I will resign myself to be a martyr and to bow my neck to the executioner , if that vile army remains here . 
But if a noble and ardent and pious impulse of the sons of Orbajosa contributes to the great work of the extirpation of our country 's ills , I shall hold myself the happiest of men , solely in being your fellow-townsman ; and all my life of study , of penitence , of resignation , will seem to me less meritorious , less deserving of heaven , than a single one of your heroic days . '' 
`` Impossible to say more or to say it better ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , in a burst of enthusiasm . 
Caballuco had leaned forward in his chair and was resting his elbows on his knees ; when the canon ended he took his hand and kissed it with fervor . 
`` A better man was never born , '' said Uncle Licurgo , wiping , or pretending to wipe away a tear . 
`` Long life to the Senor Penitentiary ! '' 
cried Frasquito Gonzalez , rising to his feet and throwing his cap up to the ceiling . 
`` Silence ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta . 
`` Sit down , Frasquito ! 
You are one of those with whom it is always much cry and little wool . '' 
`` Blessed be God who gave you that eloquent tongue ! '' 
exclaimed Cristobal , inflamed with admiration . 
`` What a pair I have before me ! 
While these two live what need is there of any one else ? 
All the people in Spain ought to be like them . 
But how could that be , when there is nothing in it but roguery ! 
In Madrid , which is the capital where the law and the mandarins come from , every thing is robbery and cheating . 
Poor religion , what a state they have brought it to ! 
There is nothing to be seen but crimes . 
Senor Don Inocencio , Senora Dona Perfecta , by my father 's soul , by the soul of my grandfather , by the salvation of my own soul , I swear that I wish to die ! '' 
`` To die ! '' 
`` That I wish those rascally dogs may kill me , and I say that I wish they may kill me , because I can not cut them in quarters . 
I am very little . '' 
`` Ramos , you are great , '' said Dona Perfecta solemnly . 
`` Great ? 
Great ? 
Very great , as far as my courage is concerned ; but have I fortresses , have I cavalry , have I artillery ? '' 
`` That is a thing , Ramos , '' said Dona Perfecta , smiling , `` about which I would not concern myself . 
Has not the enemy what you lack ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Take it from him , then . '' 
`` We will take it from him , yes , senora . 
When I say that we will take it from him -- '' `` My dear Ramos , '' exclaimed Don Inocencio , `` yours is an enviable position . 
To distinguish yourself , to raise yourself above the base multitude , to put yourself on an equality with the greatest heroes of the earth , to be able to say that the hand of God guides your hand -- oh , what grandeur and honor ! 
My friend , this is not flattery . 
What dignity , what nobleness , what magnanimity ! 
No ; men of such a temper can not die . 
The Lord goes with them , and the bullet and the steel of the enemy are arrested in their course ; they do not dare -- how should they dare -- to touch them , coming from the musket and the hand of heretics ? 
Dear Caballuco , seeing you , seeing your bravery and your nobility , there come to my mind involuntarily the verses of that ballad on the conquest of the Empire of Trebizond : '' ` Came the valiant Roland Armed at every point , On his war-horse mounted , The gallant Briador ; His good sword Durlindana Girded to his side , Couched for the attack his lance , On his arm his buckler stout , Through his helmet 's visor Flashing fire he came ; Quivering like a slender reed Shaken by the wind his lance , And all the host united Defying haughtily . ' '' 
`` Very good , '' exclaimed Licurgo , clapping his hands . 
`` And I say like Don Renialdos : '' ` Let none the wrath of Don Renialdos Dare brave and hope to escape unscathed ; For he who seeks with him a quarrel , Shall pay so dearly for his rashness That he , and all his cause who champion , Shall at my hand or meet destruction Or chastisement severe shall suffer . ' '' 
`` Ramos , you will take some supper , you will eat something ; wo n't you ? '' 
said the mistress of the house . 
`` Nothing , nothing ; '' answered the Centaur . 
`` Or if you give me any thing , let it be a plate of gunpowder . '' 
And bursting into a boisterous laugh , he walked up and down the room several times , attentively observed by every one ; then , stopping beside the group , he looked fixedly at Dona Perfecta and thundered forth these words : `` I say that there is nothing more to be said . 
Long live Orbajosa ! 
death to Madrid ! '' 
And he brought his hand down on the table with such violence that the floor shook . 
`` What a valiant spirit ! '' 
said Don Inocencio . 
`` What a fist you have ! '' 
Every one was looking at the table , which had been split in two by the blow . 
Then they looked at the never-enough-to-be-admired Renialdos or Caballuco . 
Undoubtedly there was in his handsome countenance , in his green eyes animated by a strange , feline glow , in his black hair , in his herculean frame , a certain expression and air of grandeur -- a trace , or rather a memory , of the grand races that dominated the world . 
But his general aspect was one of pitiable degeneration , and it was difficult to discover the noble and heroic filiation in the brutality of the present . 
He resembled Don Cayetano 's great men as the mule resembles the horse . 
The conference lasted for some time longer , but we omit what followed as not being necessary to a clear understanding of our story . 
At last they separated , Senor Don Inocencio remaining to the last , as usual . 
Before the canon and Dona Perfecta had had time to exchange a word , an elderly woman , Dona Perfecta 's confidential servant and her right hand , entered the dining-room , and her mistress , seeing that she looked disturbed and anxious , was at once filled with disquietude , suspecting that something wrong was going on in the house . 
`` I ca n't find the senorita anywhere , '' said the servant , in answer to her mistress ' questions . 
`` Good Heavens -- Rosario ! 
Where is my daughter ? '' 
`` Virgin of Succor protect us ! '' 
cried the Penitentiary , taking up his hat and preparing to hurry out with Dona Perfecta . 
`` Search for her well . 
But was she not with you in her room ? '' 
`` Yes , senora , '' answered the old woman , trembling , `` but the devil tempted me , and I fell asleep . '' 
`` A curse upon your sleep ! 
What is this ? 
Rosario , Rosario ! 
Librada ! '' 
They went upstairs and came down again , they went up a second time and came down again ; carrying a light and looking carefully in all the rooms . 
At last the voice of the Penitentiary was heard saying joyfully from the stairs : `` Here she is , here she is ! 
She has been found . '' 
A moment later mother and daughter were standing face to face in the hall . 
`` Where were you ? '' 
asked Dona Perfecta , in a severe voice , scrutinizing her daughter 's face closely . 
`` In the garden , '' answered the girl , more dead than alive . 
`` In the garden at this hour ? 
Rosario ! '' 
`` I was warm , I went to the window , my handkerchief dropped out , and I came down stairs for it ! '' 
`` Why did n't you ask Librada to get it for you ? 
Librada ! 
Where is that girl ? 
Has she fallen asleep too ? '' 
Librada at last made her appearance . 
Her pale face revealed the consternation and the apprehension of the delinquent . 
`` What is this ? 
Where were you ? '' 
asked her mistress , with terrible anger . 
`` Why , senora , I came down stairs to get the clothes out of the front room -- and I fell asleep . '' 
`` Every one here seems to have fallen asleep to-night . 
Some of you , I fancy , will not sleep in my house to-morrow night . 
Rosario , you may go . '' 
Comprehending that it was necessary to act with promptness and energy , Dona Perfecta and the canon began their investigations without delay . 
Questions , threats , entreaties , promises , were skilfully employed to discover the truth regarding what had happened . 
Not even the shadow of guilt was found to attach to the old servant ; but Librada confessed frankly between tears and sighs all her delinquencies , which we will sum up as follows : Shortly after his arrival in the house Senor Pinzon had begun to cast loving glances at Senorita Rosario . 
He had given money to Librada , according to what the latter said , to carry messages and love-letters to her . 
The young lady had not seemed angry , but , on the contrary , pleased , and several days had passed in this manner . 
Finally , the servant declared that Rosario and Senor Pinzon had agreed to meet and talk with each other on this night at the window of the room of the latter , which opened on the garden . 
They had confided their design to the maid , who promised to favor it , in consideration of a sum which was at once given her . 
It had been agreed that Senor Pinzon was to leave the house at his usual hour and return to it secretly at nine o'clock , go to his room , and leave it and the house again , clandestinely also , a little later , to return , without concealment , at his usual late hour . 
In this way no suspicion would fall upon him . 
Librada had waited for Pinzon , who had entered the house closely enveloped in his cloak , without speaking a word . 
He had gone to his room at the same moment in which the young lady descended to the garden . 
During the interview , at which she was not present , Librada had remained on guard in the hall to warn Pinzon , if any danger should threaten ; and at the end of an hour the latter had left the house enveloped in his cloak , as before , and without speaking a word . 
When the confession was ended Don Inocencio said to the wretched girl : `` Are you sure that the person who came into and went out of the house was Senor Pinzon ? '' 
The culprit answered nothing , but her features expressed the utmost perplexity . 
Her mistress turned green with anger . 
`` Did you see his face ? '' 
`` But who else could it be but he ? '' 
answered the maid . 
`` I am certain that it was he . 
He went straight to his room -- he knew the way to it perfectly well . '' 
`` It is strange , '' said the canon . 
`` Living in the house there was no need for him to use such mystery . 
He might have pretended illness and remained in the house . 
Does it not seem so to you , senora ? '' 
`` Librada , '' exclaimed the latter , in a paroxysm of anger , `` I vow that you shall go to prison . '' 
And clasping her hands , she dug the nails of the one into the other with such force as almost to draw blood . 
`` Senor Don Inocencio , '' she exclaimed , `` let us die -- there is no remedy but to die . '' 
Then she burst into a fit of inconsolable weeping . 
`` Courage , senora , '' said the priest , in a moved voice . 
`` Courage -- now it is necessary to be very brave . 
This requires calmness and a great deal of courage . 
`` Mine is immense , '' said Senora de Polentinos , in the midst of her sobs . 
`` Mine is very small , '' said the canon ; `` but we shall see , we shall see . '' 
Meanwhile Rosario -- with her heart torn and bleeding , unable to shed tears , unable to be at peace or rest , transpierced by grief as by a sharp sword , with her thoughts passing swiftly from the world to God and from God to the world , bewildered and half-crazed , her hands clasped , her bare feet resting on the floor -- was kneeling , late in the evening , in her own room , beside her bed , on the edge of which she rested her burning forehead , in darkness , in solitude , and in silence . 
She was careful not to make the slightest noise , in order not to attract the attention of her mother , who was asleep , or seemed to be asleep , in the adjoining room . 
She lifted up her distracted thoughts to Heaven in this form : `` Lord , my God , why is it that before I did not know how to lie , and now I know ? 
Why did I not know before how to deceive , and now I deceive ? 
Am I a vile woman ? 
Is this that I feel , is this that is happening to me , a fall from which there can be no arising ? 
Have I ceased to be virtuous and good ? 
I do not recognize myself . 
Is it I or is it some one else who is in this place ? 
How many terrible things in a few days ! 
How many different sensations ! 
My heart is consumed with all it has felt . 
Lord , my God , dost thou hear my voice , or am I condemned to pray eternally without being heard ? 
I am good , nothing will convince me that I am not good . 
To love , to love boundlessly , is that wickedness ? 
But no -- it is no illusion , no error -- I am worse than the worst woman on earth . 
A great serpent is within me , and has fastened his poisonous fangs in my heart . 
What is this that I feel ? 
My God , why dost thou not kill me ? 
Why dost thou not plunge me forever into the depths of hell ? 
It is frightful , but I confess it to the priest -- I hate my mother . 
Why is this ? 
I can not explain it to myself . 
He has not said a word to me against my mother . 
I do not know how this is come to pass . 
How wicked I am ! 
The demons have taken possession of me . 
Lord , come to my help , for with my own strength alone I can not vanquish myself . 
A terrible impulse urges me to leave this house . 
I wish to escape , to fly from it . 
If he does not take me , I will drag myself after him through the streets . 
What divine joy is this that mingles in my breast with so cruel a grief ? 
Lord God , my father , illumine me . 
I desire only to love . 
I was not born for this hatred that is consuming me . 
I was not born to deceive , to lie , to cheat . 
To-morrow I will go out into the streets and cry aloud to all the passers-by : ' I love ! 
I hate ! ' 
My heart will relieve itself in this way . 
What happiness it would be to be able to reconcile every thing , to love and respect every one ! 
May the Most Holy Virgin protect me . 
Again that terrible idea ! 
I do n't wish to think it , and I think it . 
Ah ! 
I can not deceive myself in regard to this . 
I can neither destroy it nor diminish it -- but I can confess it ; and I confess it , saying to thee : ` Lord , I hate my mother ! ' '' 
At last she fell into a doze . 
In her uneasy sleep her imagination reproduced in her mind all she had done that night , distorting it , without altering it in substance . 
She heard again the clock of the cathedral striking nine ; she saw with joy the old servant fall into a peaceful sleep ; and she left the room very slowly , in order to make no noise ; she descended the stairs softly , step by step and on tiptoe , in order to avoid making the slightest sound . 
She went into the garden , going around through the servants ' quarters and the kitchen ; in the garden she paused for a moment to look up at the sky , which was dark and studded with stars . 
The wind was hushed . 
Not a breath disturbed the profound stillness of the night . 
It seemed to maintain a fixed and silent attention -- the attention of eyes that look without winking and ears that listen attentively , awaiting a great event . 
The night was watching . 
She then approached the glass door of the dining-room and looked cautiously through it , from a little distance , fearing that those within might perceive her . 
By the light of the dining-room lamp she saw her mother sitting with her back toward her . 
The Penitentiary was on her right , and his profile seemed to undergo a strange transformation , his nose grew larger and larger , seeming like the beak of some fabulous bird ; and his whole face became a black silhouette with angles here and there , sharp derisive , irritating . 
In front of him sat Caballuco , who resembled a dragon rather than a man . 
Rosario could see his green eyes , like two lanterns of convex glass . 
This glow , and the imposing figure of the animal , inspired her with fear . 
Uncle Licurgo and the other three men appeared to her imagination like grotesque little figures . 
She had seen somewhere , doubtless in some of the clay figures at the fairs , that foolish smile , those coarse faces , that stupid look . 
The dragon moved his arms which , instead of gesticulating , turned round , like the arms of a windmill , and the green globes , like the lights of a pharmacy , moved from side to side . 
His glance was blinding . 
The conversation appeared to be interesting . 
The Penitentiary was flapping his wings . 
He was a presumptuous bird , who tried to fly and could not . 
His beak lengthened itself , twisting round and round . 
His feathers stood out , as if with rage ; and then , collecting himself and becoming pacified , he hid his bald head under his wings . 
Then the little clay figures began to move , wishing to be persons , and Frasquito Gonzalez was trying to pass for a man . 
Rosario felt an inexplicable terror , witnessing this friendly conference . 
She went away from the door and advanced , step by step , looking around her to see if she was observed . 
Although she saw no one , she fancied that a million eyes were fastened upon her . 
But suddenly her fears and her shame were dispelled . 
At the window of the room occupied by Senor Pinzon appeared a man , dressed in blue ; the buttons on his coat shone like rows of little lights . 
She approached . 
At the same instant she felt a pair of arms with galloons lift her up as if she were a feather and with a swift movement place her in the room . 
All was changed . 
Suddenly a crash was heard , a violent blow that shook the house to its foundations . 
Neither knew the cause of the noise . 
They trembled and were silent . 
It was the moment in which the dragon had broken the table in the dining-room . 
The scene changes . 
We see before us a handsome room , bright , modest , gay , comfortable , and surprisingly clean . 
A fine matting covers the floor , and the white walls are covered with good prints of saints and some sculptures of doubtful artistic value . 
The old mahogany of the furniture shines with the polish of many Saturday rubbings , and the altar , on which a magnificent Virgin , dressed in blue and silver , receives domestic worship , is covered with innumerable pretty trifles , half sacred , half profane . 
There are on it , besides , little pictures in beads , holy-water fonts , a watch-case with an Agnes Dei , a Palm Sunday palm-branch , and not a few odorless artificial flowers . 
A number of oaken bookshelves contain a rich and choice library , in which Horace , the Epicurean and Sybarite , stands side by side with the tender Virgil , in whose verses we see the heart of the enamored Dido throbbing and melting ; Ovid the large-nosed , as sublime as he is obscene and sycophantic , side by side with Martial , the eloquent and witty vagabond ; Tibullus the impassioned , with Cicero the grand ; the severe Titus Livius with the terrible Tacitus , the scourge of the Caesars ; Lucretius the pantheist ; Juvenal , who flayed with his pen ; Plautus , who composed the best comedies of antiquity while turning a mill-wheel ; Seneca the philosopher , of whom it is said that the noblest act of his life was his death ; Quintilian the rhetorician ; the immoral Sallust , who speaks so eloquently of virtue ; the two Plinys ; Suetonius and Varro -- in a word , all the Latin letters from the time when they stammered their first word with Livius Andronicus until they exhaled their last sigh with Rutilius . 
But while making this unnecessary though rapid enumeration , we have not observed that two women have entered the room . 
It is very early , but the Orbajosans are early risers . 
The birds are singing to burst their throats in their cages ; the church-bells are ringing for mass , and the goats , going from house to house to be milked , are tinkling their bells gayly . 
The two ladies whom we see in the room that we have described have just come back from hearing mass . 
They are dressed in black , and each of them carries in her right hand her little prayer-book , and the rosary twined around her fingers . 
`` Your uncle can not delay long now , '' said one of them . 
`` We left him beginning mass ; but he gets through quickly , and by this time he will be in the sacristy , taking off his chasuble . 
I would have stayed to hear him say mass , but to-day is a very busy day for me . '' 
`` I heard only the prebendary 's mass to-day , '' said the other , `` and he says mass in a twinkling ; and I do n't think it has done me any good , for I was greatly preoccupied . 
I could not get the thought of the terrible things that are happening to us out of my head . '' 
`` What is to be done ? 
We must only have patience . 
Let us see what advice your uncle will give us . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed the other , heaving a deep and pathetic sigh ; `` I feel my blood on fire . '' 
`` God will protect us . '' 
`` To think that a person like you should be threatened by a -- . 
And he persists in his designs ! 
Last night Senora Dona Perfecta , I went back to the widow De Cuzco 's hotel , as you told me , and asked her for later news . 
Don Pepito and the brigadier Batalla are always consulting together -- ah , my God ! 
consulting about their infernal plans , and emptying bottle after bottle of wine . 
They are a pair of rakes , a pair of drunkards . 
No doubt they are plotting some fine piece of villany together . 
As I take such an interest in you , last night , seeing Don Pepito having the hotel while I was there , I followed him -- '' `` And where did you go ? '' 
`` To the Casino ; yes , senora , to the Casino , '' responded the other , with some confusion . 
`` Afterward he went back to his hotel . 
And how my uncle scolded me because I remained out so late , playing the spy in that way ! 
But I ca n't help it , and to see a person like you threatened by such dangers makes me wild . 
For there is no use in talking ; I foresee that the day we least expect it those villains will attack the house and carry off Rosarito . '' 
Dona Perfecta , for she it was , bending her eyes on the floor , remained for a long time wrapped in thought . 
She was pale , and her brows were gathered in a frown . 
At last she exclaimed : `` Well , I see no way of preventing it ! '' 
`` But I see a way , '' quickly said the other woman , who was the niece of the Penitentiary and Jacinto 's mother ; `` I see a very simple way , that I explained to you , and that you do not like . 
Ah , senora ! 
you are too good . 
On occasions like this it is better to be a little less perfect -- to lay scruples aside . 
Why , would that be an offence to God ? '' 
`` Maria Remedios , '' said Dona Perfecta haughtily , `` do n't talk nonsense . '' 
`` Nonsense ! 
You , with all your wisdom , can not make your nephew do as you wish . 
What could be simpler than what I propose ? 
Since there is no justice now to protect us , let us do a great act of justice ourselves . 
Are there not men in your house who are ready for any thing ? 
Well , call them and say to them : ` Look , Caballuco , Paso Largo , ' or whoever it may be , ` to-night disguise yourself well , so that you may not be recognized ; take with you a friend in whom you have confidence , and station yourself at the corner of the Calle de Santa Faz . 
Wait a while , and when Don Jose Rey passes through the Calle de la Triperia on his way to the Casino , -- for he will certainly go to the Casino , understand me well , -- when he is passing you will spring out on him and give him a fright . ' '' 
`` Maria Remedios , do n't be a fool ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta with magisterial dignity . 
`` Nothing more than a fright , senora ; attend well to what I say , a fright . 
Why ! 
Do you suppose I would advise a crime ? 
Good God ! 
the very idea fills me with horror , and I fancy I can see before my eyes blood and fire ! 
Nothing of the sort , senora . 
A fright -- nothing but a fright , which will make that ruffian understand that we are well protected . 
He goes alone to the Casino , senora , entirely alone ; and there he meets his valiant friends , those of the sabre and the helmet . 
Imagine that he gets the fright and that he has a few bones broken , in addition -- without any serious wounds , of course . 
Well , in that case , either his courage will fail him and he will leave Orbajosa , or he will be obliged to keep his bed for a fortnight . 
But they must be told to make the fright a good one . 
No killing , of course ; they must take care of that , but just a good beating . '' 
`` Maria , '' said Dona Perfecta haughtily , `` you are incapable of a lofty thought , of a great and saving resolve . 
What you advise me is an unworthy piece of cowardice . '' 
`` Very well , I will be silent . 
Poor me ! 
what a fool I am ! '' 
exclaimed the Penitentiary 's niece with humility . 
`` I will keep my follies to console you after you have lost your daughter . '' 
`` My daughter ! 
Lose my daughter ! '' 
exclaimed Dona Perfecta , with a sudden access of rage . 
`` Only to hear you puts me out of my senses . 
No , they shall not take her from me ! 
If Rosario does not abhor that ruffian as I wish her to do , she shall abhor him . 
For a mother 's authority must have some weight . 
We will tear this passion , or rather this caprice , from her heart , as a tender plant is torn out of the ground before it has had time to cast roots . 
No , this can not be , Remedios . 
Come what may , it shall not be ! 
Not even the most infamous means he could employ will avail that madman . 
Rather than see her my nephew 's wife , I would accept any evil that might happen to her , even death ! '' 
`` Better dead , better buried and food for worms , '' affirmed Remedios , clasping her hands as if she were saying a prayer -- `` than see her in the power of -- ah , senora , do not be offended if I say something to you , and that is , that it would be a great weakness to yield merely because Rosarito has had a few secret interviews with that audacious man . 
The affair of the night before last , as my uncle related it to me , seems to me a vile trick on Don Jose to obtain his object by means of a scandal . 
A great many men do that . 
Ah , Divine Saviour , I do n't know how there are women who can look any man in the face unless it be a priest . '' 
`` Be silent , be silent ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta , with vehemence . 
`` Do n't mention the occurrence of the night before last to me . 
What a horrible affair ! 
Maria Remedios , I understand now how anger can imperil the salvation of a soul . 
I am burning with rage -- unhappy that I am , to see such things and not to be a man ! 
But to speak the truth in regard to the occurrence of the night before last -- I still have my doubts . 
Librada vows and declares that Pinzon was the man who came into the house . 
My daughter denies every thing ; my daughter has never told me a lie ! 
I persist in my suspicions . 
I think that Pinzon is a hypocritical go-between , but nothing more . '' 
`` We come back to the same thing -- that the author of all the trouble is the blessed mathematician . 
Ah ! 
my heart did not deceive me when I first saw him . 
Well , then senora ! 
resign yourself to see something still more terrible , unless you make up your mind to call Caballuco and say to him , ` Caballuco , I hope that -- ' '' `` The same thing again ; what a simpleton you are ! '' 
`` Oh yes ! 
I know I am a great simpleton ; but how can I help it if I am not any wiser ? 
I say what comes into my head , without any art . '' 
`` What you think of -- that silly and vulgar idea of the beating and the fright -- is what would occur to any one . 
You have not an ounce of brains , Remedios ; to solve a serious question you can think of nothing better than a piece of folly like that . 
I have thought of a means more worthy of noble-minded and well-bred persons . 
A beating ! 
What stupidity ! 
Besides , I would not on any account have my nephew receive even so much as a scratch by an order of mine . 
God will send him his punishment through some one of the wonderful ways which he knows how to choose . 
All we have to do is to work in order that the designs of God may find no obstacle . 
Maria Remedios , it is necessary in matters of this kind to go directly to the causes of things . 
But you know nothing about causes -- you can see only trifles . '' 
`` That may be so , '' said the priest 's niece , with humility . 
`` I wonder why God made me so foolish that I can understand nothing of those sublime ideas ! '' 
`` It is necessary to go to the bottom -- to the bottom , Remedios . 
Do n't you understand yet ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` My nephew is not my nephew , woman ; he is blasphemy , sacrilege , atheism , demagogy . 
Do you know what demagogy is ? '' 
`` Something relating to those people who burned Paris with petroleum ; and those who pull down the churches and fire on the images . 
So far I understand very well . '' 
`` Well , my nephew is all that ! 
Ah ! 
if he were alone in Orbajosa -- but no , child . 
My nephew , through a series of fatalities , which are trials , the transitory evils that God permits for our chastisement , is equivalent to an army ; is equivalent to the authority of the government ; equivalent to the alcalde ; equivalent to the judge . 
My nephew is not my nephew ; he is the official nation , Remedios -- that second nation composed of the scoundrels who govern in Madrid , and who have made themselves masters of its material strength ; of that apparent nation -- for the real nation is the one that is silent , that pays and suffers ; of that fictitious nation that signs decrees and pronounces discourses and makes a farce of government , and a farce of authority , and a farce of every thing . 
That is what my nephew is to-day ; you must accustom yourself to look under the surface of things . 
My nephew is the government , the brigadier , the new alcalde , the new judge -- for they all protect him , because of the unanimity of their ideas ; because they are chips of the same block , birds of a feather . 
Understand it well ; we must defend ourselves against them all , for they are all one , and one is all ; we must attack them all together ; and not by beating a man as he turns a corner , but as our forefathers attacked the Moors -- the Moors , Remedios . 
Understand this well , child ; open your understanding and allow an idea that is not vulgar to enter it -- rise above yourself ; think lofty thoughts , Remedios ! '' 
Don Inocencio 's niece was struck dumb by so much loftiness of soul . 
She opened her mouth to say something that should be in consonance with so sublime an idea , but she only breathed a sigh . 
`` Like the Moors , '' repeated Dona Perfecta . 
`` It is a question of Moors and Christians . 
And did you suppose that by giving a fright to my nephew all would be ended ? 
How foolish you are ! 
Do n't you see that his friends support him ? 
Do n't you see that you are at the mercy of that rabble ? 
Do n't you see that any little lieutenant can set fire to my house , if he takes it into his head to do so ? 
But do n't you know this ? 
Do n't you comprehend that it is necessary to go to the bottom of things ? 
Do n't you comprehend how vast , how tremendous is the power of my enemy , who is not a man , but a sect ? 
Do n't you comprehend that my nephew , as he confronts me to-day , is not a calamity , but a plague ? 
Against this plague , dear Remedios , we shall have here a battalion sent by God that will annihilate the infernal militia from Madrid . 
I tell you that this is going to be great and glorious . '' 
`` If it were at last so ! '' 
`` But do you doubt it ? 
To-day we shall see terrible things here , '' said Dona Perfecta , with great impatience . 
`` To-day , to-day ! 
What o'clock is it ? 
Seven ? 
So late , and nothing has happened ! '' 
`` Perhaps my uncle has heard something ; he is here now , I hear him coming upstairs . '' 
`` Thank God ! '' 
said Dona Perfecta , rising to receive the Penitentiary . 
`` He will have good news for us . '' 
Don Inocencio entered hastily . 
His altered countenance showed that his soul , consecrated to religion and to the study of the classics , was not as tranquil as usual . 
`` Bad news ! '' 
he said , laying his hat on a chair and loosening the cords of his cloak . 
Dona Perfecta turned pale . 
`` They are arresting people , '' added Don Inocencio , lowering his voice , as if there was a soldier hidden under every chair . 
`` They suspect , no doubt , that the people here would not put up with their high-handed measures , and they have gone from house to house , arresting all who have a reputation for bravery . '' 
Dona Perfecta threw herself into an easy chair and clutched its arms convulsively . 
`` It remains to be seen whether they have allowed themselves to be arrested , '' observed Remedios . 
`` Many of them have -- a great many of them , '' said Don Inocencio , with an approving look , addressing Dona Perfecta , `` have had time to escape , and have gone with arms and horses to Villahorrenda . ''
