Now , by closing up the holes in the chest , he 's closing the door to my happiness , too , and opening the one to my troubles . '' 
That 's what I kept sighing while my conscientious carpenter finished up his job with nails and little boards , and said , `` Now , my dear treacherous mice , you 'd better think about changing your ways . 
You wo n't get anywhere in this house . '' 
As soon as he left , I went to see his work . 
And I found that he did n't leave a hole where even a mosquito could get into the sorry old chest . 
I opened it up with my useless key , without a hope of getting anything . 
And there I saw the two or three loaves that I 'd started to eat and that my master thought the mice had chewed on , and I still got a little bit off of them by touching them very lightly like an expert swordsman . 
Since necessity is the father of invention and I always had so much of it , day and night I kept thinking about how I was going to keep myself alive . 
And I think that hunger lit up my path to these black solutions : they say that hunger sharpens your wits and that stuffing yourself dulls them , and that 's just the way it worked with me . 
Well , while I was lying awake one night thinking about this -- how I could manage to start using the chest again -- I saw that my master was asleep : it was obvious from the snoring and loud wheezing he always made while he slept . 
I got up very , very quietly , and since during the day I had planned out what I would do and had left an old knife lying where I 'd find it , I went over to the sorry-looking chest , and in the place where it looked most defenseless , I attacked it with the knife , using it like a boring tool . 
It was really an old chest , and it had been around for so many years that it did n't have any strength or backbone left . 
It was so soft and worm-eaten that it gave in to me right away and let me put a good-sized hole in its side so I could relieve my own suffering . 
When I finished this , I opened the slashed-up chest very quietly , and feeling around and finding the cut-up loaf , I did the usual thing -- what you 've seen before . 
Feeling a little better after that , I closed it up again and went back to my straw mat . 
I rested there and even slept a while . 
But I did n't sleep very well , and I thought it was because I had n't eaten enough . 
And that 's what it must have been because at that time all the troubles of the King of France would n't have been able to keep me awake . 
The next day my master saw the damage that had been done to the bread along with the hole I 'd made , and he began to swear at the mice and say , `` How can this be ? 
I 've never even seen a mouse in this house until now ! '' 
And I really think he must have been telling the truth . 
If there was one house in the whole country that by rights should have been free of mice , it was that one , because they do n't usually stay where there 's nothing to eat . 
He began to look around on the walls of the house again for nails and pieces of wood to keep them out . 
Then when night came and he was asleep , there I was on my feet with my knife in hand , and all the holes he plugged up during the day I unplugged at night . 
That 's how things went , me following him so quickly that this must be where the saying comes from : `` Where one door is closed , another opens . '' 
Well , we seemed to be doing Penelope 's work on the cloth because whatever he wove during the day I took apart at night . 
And after just a few days and nights we had the poor pantry box in such a shape that , if you really wanted to call it by its proper name , you 'd have to call it an old piece of armor instead of a chest because of all the nails and tacks in it . 
When he saw that his efforts were n't doing any good , he said , `` This chest is so beat up and the wood in it is so old and thin that it would n't be able to stand up against any mouse . 
And it 's getting in such bad shape that if we put up with it any longer it wo n't keep anything secure . 
The worst part of it is that even though it does n't keep things very safe , if I got rid of it I really would n't be able to get along without it , and I 'd just end up having to pay three or four pieces of silver to get another one . 
The best thing that I can think of , since what I 've tried so far has n't done any good , is to set a trap inside the chest for those blasted mice . '' 
Then he asked someone to lend him a mousetrap , and with the cheese rinds that he begged from the neighbors , the trap was kept set and ready inside the chest . 
And that really turned out to be a help to me . 
Even though I did n't require any frills for eating , I was still glad to get the cheese rinds that I took out of the mousetrap , and even at that I did n't stop the mouse from raiding the bread . 
When he found that mice had been into the bread and eaten the cheese , but that not one of them had been caught , he swore a blue streak and asked his neighbors , `` How could a mouse take cheese out of a trap , eat it , leave the trap sprung , and still not get caught ? '' 
The neighbors agreed that it could n't be a mouse that was causing the trouble because it would have had to have gotten caught sooner or later . 
So one neighbor said to him , `` I remember that there used to be a snake around your house -- that must be who the culprit is . 
It only stands to reason : it 's so long it can get the food , and even though the trap is sprung on it , it 's not completely inside , so it can get out again . '' 
Everyone agreed with what he 'd said , and that really upset my master . 
From then on he did n't sleep so soundly . 
Whenever he heard even a worm moving around in the wood at night , he thought it was the snake gnawing on the chest . 
Then he would be up on his feet , and he 'd grab a club that he kept by the head of the bed ever since they 'd mentioned a snake to him , and he would really lay into that poor old chest , hoping to scare the snake away . 
He woke up the neighbors with all the noise he made , and he would n't let me sleep at all . 
He came up to my straw mat and turned it over and me with it , thinking that the snake had headed for me and gotten into the straw or inside my coat . 
Because they told him that at night these creatures look for some place that 's warm and even get into babies ' cribs and bite them . 
Most of the time I pretended to be asleep , and in the morning he would ask me , `` Did n't you feel anything last night , son ? 
I was right behind the snake , and I think it got into your bed : they 're very cold-blooded creatures , and they try to find a place that 's warm . '' 
`` I hope to God it does n't bite me , '' I said . 
`` I 'm really scared of it . '' 
He went around all excited and not able to sleep , so that -- on my word of honor -- the snake -LRB- a male one , of course -RRB- did n't dare go out chewing at night , or even go near the chest . 
But in the daytime , while he was at church or in town , I did my looting . 
And when he saw the damage and that he was n't able to do anything about it , he wandered around at night -- as I 've said -- like a spook . 
I was afraid that in his wanderings he might stumble onto my key that I kept under the straw . 
So it seemed to me that the safest thing was to put it in my mouth at night . 
Because since I 'd been with the blind man my mouth had gotten round like a purse , and I could hold twenty or thirty coppers in it -- all in half-copper coins -- and eat at the same time . 
If I had n't been able to do that I could n't have gotten hold of even a copper that the blasted blind man would n't have found : he was always searching every patch and seam on my clothes . 
Well , as I say , I put the key in my mouth every night , and I went to sleep without being afraid that the zombie master of mine would stumble onto it . 
But when trouble is going to strike , you ca n't do a thing to stop it . 
The fates -- or to be more exact , my sins -- had it in store for me that one night while I was sleeping my mouth must have been open , and the key shifted so that the air I breathed out while I was asleep went through the hollow part of the key . 
It was tubular , and -LRB- unfortunately for me -RRB- it whistled so loud that my master heard it and got excited . 
He must have thought it was the snake hissing , and I guess it really sounded like one . 
He got up very quietly with his club in hand , and by feeling his way toward the sound he came up to me very softly so the snake would n't hear him . 
And when he found himself so close , he thought that it had come over to where I was lying , looking for a warm place , and had slipped into the straw . 
So , lifting the club up high , and thinking that he had the snake trapped down there and that he would hit it so hard that he 'd kill it , he swung down on me with such a mighty blow that he knocked me unconscious and left my head bashed in . 
Then he saw that he 'd hit me -LRB- I must have really cried out when the blow leveled me -RRB- , and -- as he later told me -- he reached over and shouted at me , calling my name and trying to revive me . 
But when his hands touched me and he felt all the blood , he realized what he 'd done , and he went off to get a light right away . 
When he came back with it he found me moaning with the key still in my mouth : I had never let loose of it , and it was still sticking half out -- just like it must have been when I was whistling through it . 
The snake killer was terrified , wondering what it could be . 
He took it all the way out of my mouth and looked at it . 
Then he realized what it was because its ridges matched his key exactly . 
He went to try it out , and he solved the crime . 
Then that cruel hunter must have said : `` I 've found the mouse and the snake that were fighting me and eating me out of house and home . '' 
I ca n't say for sure what happened during the next three days because I spent them inside the belly of the whale . 
But what I 've just told I heard about from my master when I came to ; he was telling what had happened in detail to everyone who came by . 
At the end of three days , when I was back in my senses , I found myself stretched out on my straw bed with my head all bandaged up and full of oils and salves . 
And I got scared and said , `` What is this ? '' 
The cruel priest answered , `` It seems that I caught the mice and snakes that were ruining me . '' 
I looked myself over , and when I saw how badly beaten up I was , I guessed what had happened . 
Then an old lady who was a healer came in , along with the neighbors . 
And they began to take the wrappings off my head and treat the wound . 
When they saw that I was conscious again , they were very happy , and they said , ` Well , he 's got his senses back . 
God willing , it wo n't be too serious . '' 
Then they began to talk again about what had happened to me and to laugh . 
While I -- sinner that I am -- I was crying . 
Anyway , they fed me , and I was famished , but they really did n't give me enough . 
Yet , little by little , I recovered , and two weeks later I was able to get up , out of any danger -LRB- but not out of my state of hunger -RRB- and nearly cured . 
The next day when I 'd gotten up , my master took me by the hand and led me out the door , and when I was in the street he said to me : `` Lazaro , from now on you 're on your own -- I do n't want you . 
Go get yourself another master , and God be with you . 
I do n't want such a diligent servant here with me . 
You could only have become this way from being a blind man 's guide . '' 
Then he crossed himself as if I had the devil in me and went back into his house and closed the door . 
So I had to push on ahead , as weak as I was . 
And little by little , with the help of some good people , I ended up in this great city of Toledo . 
And here , by the grace of God , my wounds healed in about two weeks . 
People were always giving me things while I was hurt , but when I was well again , they told me , `` You -- you 're nothing but a lazy , no-good sponger . 
Go on -- go find yourself a good master you can work for . '' 
`` And where will I meet up with one of those , '' I said to myself , `` unless God makes him from scratch , the way he created the world ? '' 
While I was going along begging from door to door -LRB- without much success , since charity seemed to have gone up to heaven -RRB- , God had me run into a squire who was walking down the street . 
He was well dressed , his hair was combed , and he walked and looked like a real gentleman . 
I looked at him , and he looked at me , and he said , `` Boy , are you looking for a master ? '' 
And I said , `` Yes , sir . '' 
`` Well , come with me , '' he said . 
`` God has been good to you , making you run into me . 
You must have been doing some good praying today . '' 
So I went with him . 
And I thanked God that he asked me to go along because -- with his nice-looking clothes and the way he looked -- I thought he was just what I needed . 
It was morning when I found my third master . 
And I followed him through most of the city . 
We went through squares where they were selling bread and different things . 
And I was hoping and praying that he would load me up with some of the food they were selling because it was just the right time for shopping . 
But very quickly , without stopping , we went right past those places . 
Maybe he does n't like what he sees here , I thought , and he wants to buy his groceries somewhere else . 
So we kept on walking until it was eleven o'clock . 
Then he went into the cathedral , and I was right behind him . 
I saw him listen to mass and go through the other holy ceremonies very devoutly , until it was over and the people had gone . 
Then we came out of the church . 
We began to go down a street at a good clip . 
And I was the happiest fellow in the world , since we had n't stopped to buy any food . 
I really thought my new master was one of those people who do all their shopping at once , and that our meal would be there , ready and waiting for us , just the way I wanted -- and , in fact , the way I needed . 
At that minute the clock struck one -- an hour past noon -- and we came to a house where my master stopped , and so did his cape to the left , he took a key out of his sleeve and opened the door , and we both went into the house . 
The entrance was dark and gloomy : it looked like it would make anyone who went in afraid . 
But inside there was a little patio and some fairly nice rooms . 
Once we were in , he took off his cape : he asked me if my hands were clean , and then we shook it out and folded it . 
And blowing the dust very carefully off a stone bench that was there , he put the cape down on top of it . 
And when that was done , he sat down next to it and asked me a lot of questions about where I was from and how I 'd happened to come to that city . 
I talked about myself longer than I wanted to because I thought it was more a time to have the table set and the stew dished up than to tell him about all that . 
Still , I satisfied him about myself , lying as well as I could . 
I told him all my good points but kept quiet about the rest , since I did n't think that was the time for them . 
When that was over , he just sat there for a while . 
I began to realize that that was a bad sign , since it was almost two o'clock and I had n't seen him show any more desire to eat than a dead man . 
Then I began to think about his keeping the door locked , and the fact that I had n't heard any other sign of life in the whole house . 
The only thing I 'd seen were walls : not a chair , not a meat-cutting board , a stool , a table , or even a chest like the one I 'd had before . 
And I began to wonder if that house was under a spell . 
While I was thinking about this , he said to me , `` Boy , have you eaten ? '' 
`` No , sir , '' I said . 
`` It was n't even eight o'clock when I met you . '' 
`` Well , even though it was still morning , I 'd already had breakfast . 
And when I eat like that , I want you to know that I 'm satisfied until nighttime . 
So you 'll just have to get along as well as you can : we 'll have supper later . '' 
You can see how , when I heard this , I nearly dropped in my tracks -- not so much from hunger but because fate seemed to be going completely against me . 
Then all my troubles passed before my eyes again , and I began to cry over my hardships once more . 
I remembered my reasoning when I was thinking about leaving the priest : I figured that even though he was mean and stingy , it might turn out that I would meet up with someone worse . 
So there I was , moping over the hard life I 'd had and over my death that was getting nearer and nearer . 
And yet , keeping back my emotions as well as I could , I said to him , `` Sir , I am only a boy , and thank God I 'm not too concerned about eating . 
I can tell you that I was the lightest eater of all my friends , and all the masters I 've ever had have praised that about me right up to now . '' 
`` That really is a virtue , '' he said , `` and it makes me appreciate you even more . 
Because only pigs stuff themselves : gentlemen eat moderately . '' 
I get the picture ! 
I thought to myself . 
Well , damn all the health and virtue that these masters I run into find in staying hungry . 
I went over next to the door and took out of my shirt some pieces of bread that I still had from begging . 
When he saw this , he said to me , `` Come here , boy . 
What are you eating ? '' 
I went over to him and showed him the bread . 
There were three pieces , and he took one -- the biggest and best one . 
Then he said , `` Well , well , this does look like good bread . '' 
`` It is ! '' 
I said . 
`` But tell me , sir , do you really think so now ? '' 
`` Yes , I do , '' he said . 
`` Where did you get it ? 
I wonder if the baker had clean hands ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that , '' I said , but it certainly does n't taste bad . '' 
`` Let 's see if you 're right , '' said my poor master . 
And he put it in his mouth and began to gobble it down as ferociously as I was doing with mine . 
`` Bless me , this bread is absolutely delicious , '' he said . 
When I saw what tree he was barking up , I began to eat faster . 
Because I realized that if he finished before I did , he would be nice enough to help me with what was left . 
So we finished almost at the same time . 
And he began to brush off a few crumbs -- very tiny ones -- that were left on his shirt . 
Then he went into a little room nearby and brought out a chipped-up jug -- not a very new one -- and after he had drunk , he offered it to me . 
But , so I would look like a teetotaler , I said , `` Sir , I do n't drink wine . '' 
`` It 's water , '' he said . 
`` You can drink that . '' 
Then I took the jug , and I drank . 
But not much , because being thirsty was n't exactly my trouble . 
So that 's how we spent the day until nighttime : him asking me questions and me answering as best I could . 
Then he took me to the room where the jug that we 'd drunk from was , and he said to me , `` Boy , get over there , and I 'll show you how this bed is made up so that you 'll be able to do it from now on . '' 
I went down to one end , and he went over to the other , and we made up the blasted bed . 
There really was n't much to do : it just had a bamboo frame sitting on some benches , and on top of that there was a filthy mattress with the bedclothes stretched over it . 
And since it had n't been washed very often , it really did n't look much like a mattress . 
But that 's what it was used for , though there was a lot less stuffing than it needed . 
We stretched it out and tried to soften it up . 
But that was impossible because you ca n't make a really hard object soft . 
And that blessed packsaddle had hardly a damned thing inside of it . 
When it was put on the frame , every strut showed through , and it looked just like the rib cage of a real skinny pig . 
And on top of that starving pad he put a cover of the same stamp : I never could decide what color it was . 
With the bed made and night on us , he said to me , `` Lazaro , it 's late now , and it 's a long way from here to the square . 
And besides , there are a lot of thieves who go around stealing at night in this city . 
Let 's get along as well as we can , and tomorrow , when it 's daytime , God will be good to us . 
I 've been living alone , and so I have n't stocked up any groceries : instead , I 've been eating out . 
But from now on we 'll do things differently . '' 
`` Sir , '' I said , `` do n't worry about me . 
I can spend one night -- or more , if I have to -- without eating . '' 
`` You 'll live longer and you 'll be healthier too , '' he answered . 
`` Because as we were saying today , there 's nothing in the world like eating moderately to live a long life . '' 
If that 's the way things are , I thought to myself , I never will die . 
Because I 've always been forced to keep that rule , and with my luck I 'll probably keep it all my life . 
And he lay down on the bed , using his pants and jacket as a pillow . 
He told me to stretch out at his feet , so I did . 
But I did n't get a damned bit of sleep ! 
The frame struts and my protruding bones did n't stop squabbling and fighting all night long . 
With all the pains , hunger , and trouble I 'd been through , I do n't think there was a pound of flesh left on my body . 
And since I 'd hardly had a bite to eat that day , I was groveling in hunger -- and hunger and sleep do n't exactly make good bedfellows . 
So I cursed myself -LRB- God forgive me ! -RRB- 
and my bad luck over and over , nearly all night long . 
And what was worse , I did n't dare to turn over because I might wake him up . 
So I just kept asking God for death . 
When morning came we got up , and he began to shake out and clean his pants and jacket and his coat and cape -LRB- while I stood around like an idle servant ! -RRB- . 
And he took his own good time about getting dressed . 
I brought some water for him to wash his hands , and then he combed his hair and put his sword in the belt , and while he was doing that , he said : `` If you only knew what a prize this is , boy ! 
I would n't sell it for any amount of money in the world . 
And I 'll have you know that of all the swords the famous Toledan swordmaker Antonio made , there is n't one that he put as sharp an edge on as this one has . '' 
And he pulled it out of the sheath and felt it with his fingers and said , `` Look here . 
I 'll bet I could slice a ball of wool with it . '' 
And I thought to myself : And with my teeth -- even though they 're not made of steel -- I could slice a four-pound loaf of bread . 
He put it back in the sheath and strapped it on , and then he hung a string of large beads from the sword belt . 
And he walked slowly , holding his body straight and swaying gracefully as he walked . 
And every so often he would put the tail of the cape over his shoulder or under his arm . 
And with his right hand on his side , he went out the door , saying , `` Lazaro , while I go to mass , you watch the house . 
Make the bed and fill the pitcher up with water from the river just down below us . 
Be sure to lock the door so that nothing will get stolen , and put the key on the hinge here so that if I come back while you 're gone I can get in . '' 
Then he went up the street with such a stately expression and manner that anyone who did n't know him would think he was a close relative to the Count of Arcos , or at least his valet . 
I stood there , thinking : `` Bless You , Lord -- You give us sickness and You cure us too ! 
My master looks so content that anyone who saw him would think he 'd eaten a huge supper last night and slept in a nice bed . 
And even though it 's early in the morning , they 'd think he 'd had a good breakfast . 
Your ways are mighty mysterious , Lord , and people do n't understand them ! 
With that refined way he acts and that nice-looking cape and coat he 'd fool anyone . 
And who would believe that that gracious man got by all day yesterday on a piece of bread that his servant Lazaro had carried all day and night inside his shirt for safekeeping -- not really the most sanitary place in the world -- and that today when he washed his hands and face , he dried them on his shirttail because we did n't have any towels ? 
Nobody would suspect it , of course . 
Oh Lord , how many of these people do You have scattered around the world who suffer for the filth that they call honor what they would never suffer for You ! '' 
So I stood at the door , thinking about these things and looking until my master had disappeared down the long , narrow street . 
Then I went back into the house , and in a second I walked through the whole place , both upstairs and down , without stopping or finding anything to stop for . 
I made up that blasted hard bed and took the jug down to the river . 
And I saw my master in a garden , trying hard to coax two veiled women -- they looked like the kind that are always hanging around that place . 
In fact , a lot of them go there in the summer to take the early morning air . 
And they go down to those cool riverbanks to eat breakfast -- without even bringing any food along ; they 're sure someone will give them some , since the men around there have got them in the habit of doing that . 
As I say , there he was with them just like the troubador Macias , telling them more sweet words than Ovid ever wrote . 
And when they saw that he was pretty well softened up , they were n't ashamed to ask him for some breakfast , promising the usual payment . 
But his pocketbook was as cold as his stomach was warm , and he began to have such hot chills that the color drained from his face , and he started to trip over his tongue and make up some lame excuses . 
They must have been pretty experienced women because they caught on to his illness right away and left him there for what he was . 
I 'd been eating some cabbage stalks , and that was my breakfast . 
And since I was a new servant , I went back home very diligently without my master seeing me . 
I decided I 'd sweep out a little there , since that 's what the place really needed , but I could n't find anything to sweep with . 
Then I began to think about what I should do , and I decided to wait until noon for my master because if he came he might bring something to eat ; but that turned out to be a waste of time . 
When I saw that it was getting to be two o'clock and he still had n't come , I began to be attacked by hunger . 
So I locked the door and put the key where he told me to , and then I went back to my old trade . 
With a low , sickly voice , my hands crossed over my chest , and with my eyes looking up to heaven and God 's name on my tongue , I began to beg for bread at the doors of the biggest houses I saw . 
But I 'd been doing this almost from the cradle -- I mean I learned it from that great teacher , the blind man , and I turned out to be a pretty good student -- so even though this town had never been very charitable , and it had been a pretty lean year besides , I handled myself so well that before the clock struck four I had that many pounds of bread stored away in my stomach and at least two more in my sleeves and inside my shirt . 
I went back to the house , and on my way through the meat market I begged from one of the women there , and she gave me a piece of cow 's hoof along with some cooked tripe . 
When I got home my good master was there , his cape folded and lying on the stone bench , and he was walking around in the patio . 
I went inside , and he came over to me . 
I thought he was going to scold me for being late , but God had something better in store . 
He asked me where I 'd been , and I told him , `` Sir , I was here until two o'clock , and when I saw that you were n't coming , I went to the city and put myself in the hands of the good people there , and they gave me what you see here . '' 
I showed him the bread and the tripe that I was carrying in my shirttail , and his face lit up , and he said : ` Well , I held up dinner for you , but when I saw that you were n't going to come , I went ahead and ate . 
But what you 've done there is all right because it 's better to beg in God 's name than it is to steal . 
That 's my opinion , so help me . 
The only thing I ask is that you do n't tell anyone that you 're living with me because it will hurt my honor . 
But I think it would stay a secret anyway , since hardly anyone in this town knows me . 
I wish I 'd never come here ! '' 
`` Do n't worry about that , sir , '' I said . 
`` No one would give a damn about asking me that , and I would n't tell them even if they did . '' 
`` Well then , eat , you poor sinner . 
If it 's God 's will , we 'll soon see ourselves out of these straits . 
But I want you to know that ever since I came to this house nothing has gone right for me . 
There must be an evil spell on it . 
You know there are some unlucky houses that are cursed , and the bad luck rubs off on the people who live in them . 
I do n't doubt for a minute that this is one of them , but I tell you that after this month is over , I would n't live here even if they gave the place to me . '' 
I sat down at the end of the stone bench , and I kept quiet about my snack so that he would n't take me for a glutton . 
So , for supper I began to eat my tripe and bread , while I was watching my poor master out of the corner of my eye . 
And he kept staring at my shirttail that I was using for a plate . 
I hope God takes as much pity on me as I felt for him . 
I knew just what he was feeling , since the same thing had happened to me lots of times -- and , in fact , it was still happening to me . 
I thought about asking him to join me , but since he told me that he 'd already eaten I was afraid he would n't accept the invitation . 
The fact is , I was hoping that the sinner would help himself to the food I had gone to the trouble of getting and that he 'd eat the way he did the day before so he could get out of his own troubles . 
This was really a better time for it , since there was more food and I was n't as hungry . 
God decided to grant my wish -- and his , too , I guess . 
Because he was still walking around , but when I began to eat , he came over to me and said , `` I tell you , Lazaro , I 've never seen anyone eat with as much gusto as you put into it . 
Anyone watching you would get hungry on the spot , even if he had n't been before . '' 
The marvelous appetite you have , I thought to myself , makes you think mine is beautiful . 
Still , I decided to help him , since he had opened up a way for me himself . 
So I said to him , `` Sir , a man can do a good job if he has good tools . 
This bread is absolutely delicious , and the cow 's hoof is so well cooked and seasoned that no one could possibly resist its taste . '' 
`` Is it cow 's hoof ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` I tell you , there 's no better dish in the world . 
I do n't even like pheasant as much . '' 
`` Well , dig in , sir , and you 'll see how good it really is . '' 
I put the cow 's hooves into his , along with three or four of the whiter pieces of bread . 
And he sat down beside me and began to eat like a man who was really hungry . 
He chewed the meat off of every little bone better than any hound of his would have done . 
`` With garlic sauce , '' he said , `` this is an exceptional dish . '' 
`` You do n't need any sauce with your appetite , '' I said under my breath . 
`` By God , that tasted so good you 'd think I had n't had a bite to eat all day . '' 
That 's true as sure as I was born , I said to myself . 
He asked me for the water jug , and when I gave it to him it was as full as when I 'd first brought it in . 
Since there was no water gone from it , there was a sure sign that my master had n't been overeating that day . 
We drank and went to sleep , very content , like we 'd done the night before . 
Well , to make a long story short , that 's the way we spent the next nine or ten days : that sinner would go out in the morning with his satisfied , leisurely pace , to dawdle around the streets while I was out hoofing it for him . 
I used to think lots of times about my catastrophe : having escaped from those terrible masters I 'd had and looking for someone better , I ran into a man who not only could n't support me but who I had to support . 
Still , I really liked him because I saw that he did n't have anything and he could n't do more than he was already doing . 
I felt more sorry for him than angry . 
And lots of times , just so I could bring back something for him to eat , I did n't eat anything myself . 
I did this because one morning the pitiful fellow got up in his shirt and went to the top floor of the house to take care of a certain necessity . 
And to satisfy my curiosity I unfolded the jacket and pants he 'd left at the head of the bed . 
And I found an old , crumpled-up little purse of satiny velvet that did n't have a damned cent in it , and there was n't any sign that it had had one for a long time . 
`` This man , '' I said , `` is poor . 
And no one can give what he does n't have . 
But both the stingy blind man and that blasted miser of a priest did all right in God 's name -- one of them with a quick tongue and the other one with his hand-kissing . 
And they were starving me to death . 
So it 's only right that I should hate them and feel sorry for this man . '' 
As God is my witness , even today when I run into someone like him , with that pompous way of walking of his , I feel sorry for them because I think that they may be suffering what I saw this one go through . 
But even with all his poverty , I 'd still be glad to serve him more than the others because of the things I 've just mentioned . 
There was only one little thing that I did n't like about him : I wished that he would n't act so superior ; if only he 'd let his vanity come down a little to be in line with his growing necessity . 
But it seems to me that that 's a rule his kind always keeps : even if they do n't have a red cent to their name , they have to keep up the masquerade . 
God help them or that 's the way they 'll go to their graves . 
Well , while I was there , getting along the way I said , my bad luck -LRB- which never got tired of haunting me -RRB- decided that that hard , foul way of life should n't last . 
The way it happened was that , since there had been a crop failure there that year , the town council decided to make all the beggars who came from other towns get out of the city . 
And they announced that from then on if they found one of them there , he 'd be whipped . 
So the law went into effect , and four days after the announcement was given I saw a procession of beggars being led through the streets and whipped . 
And I got so scared that I did n't dare go out begging any more . 
It 's not hard to imagine the dieting that went on in my house and the sadness and silence of the people living there . 
It was so bad that for two or three days at a time we would n't have a bite to eat or even say one word to each other . 
I knew some ladies who lived next door to us ; they spun cotton and made hats , and they kept me alive . 
From what little they brought in they always gave me something , and I just about managed to get by . 
But I did n't feel as sorry for myself as I did for my poor master : he did n't have a damned bite to eat in a week . 
At least , we did n't have anything to eat at the house . 
When he went out I do n't know how he got along , where he went or what he ate . 
And if you could only have seen him coming down the street at noon , holding himself straight , and skinnier than a full-blooded greyhound ! 
And because of his damn what-do-you-call it -- honor -- he would take a toothpick -LRB- and there were n't very many of those in the house either -RRB- and go out the door , picking at what did n't have anything between them and still grumbling about the cursed place . 
He 'd say , `` Look how bad things are . 
And it 's this blasted house that 's causing it all . 
Look how gloomy and dark and dismal it is . 
As long as we stay here , we 're going to suffer . 
I wish the month were over so we could get out of here . '' 
Well , while we were in this terrible , hungry state , one day -- I do n't know by what stroke of luck or good fortune -- a silver piece found its way into the poor hands of my master . 
And he brought it home with him , looking as proud as if he had all the money in Venice , and smiling very happily , he gave it to me and said : `` Take this , Lazaro . 
God is beginning to be good to us . 
Go down to the square and buy bread and wine and meat . 
Let 's shoot the works ! 
And also -- this should make you happy -- I want you to know that I 've rented another house , so we 'll only stay in this unlucky place until the end of the month . 
Damn the place and damn the person who put the first tile on its roof -- I should never have rented it . 
I swear to God that as long as I 've lived here I have n't had a drop of wine or a bite of meat , and I have n't gotten any rest . 
And it 's all because of the way this place looks -- so dark and gloomy ! 
Go on now , and come back as quick as you can : we 'll eat like kings today . '' 
I took my silver coin and my jug , and hurrying along , I went up the street , heading for the square , very content and happy . 
But what 's the use if my bad luck has it planned for me that I ca n't enjoy anything without trouble coming along with it ? 
And that 's the way this thing went . 
I was going up the street , thinking about how I would spend the money in the best way possible and get the most out of it . 
And I was thanking God with all my heart for letting my master have some money , when suddenly I came upon a corpse that a bunch of clergy and other people were carrying down the street on a litter . 
I squeezed up next to the wall to let them by , and after the body had gone past there came right behind the litter a woman who must have been the dead man 's wife , all dressed up in mourning -LRB- and a lot of other women with her -RRB- . 
And she came along , crying loudly and saying , `` My husband and lord , where are they taking you ? 
It 's to that poor , unhappy house , that dark and gloomy house , that house where they never eat or drink ! '' 
And when I heard that , I felt like I had fallen through the ground , and I said , `` Oh -- no ! 
They 're taking this dead man to my house . '' 
I turned around and squeezed through the crowd and ran back down the street as fast as I could toward my house . 
And when I got inside I closed the door right behind me and called out for my master to come and help me . 
And I grabbed hold of him and begged him to help me block the door . 
He was a little stunned , thinking it might be something else , and he asked me , `` What is it , boy ? 
Why are you shouting ? 
What 's the matter ? 
Why did you slam the door so hard ? '' 
`` Oh , sir , '' I said , `` help me ! 
They 're bringing a dead man here . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I stumbled into him just up the way from here , and his wife was coming along saying , ` My husband and lord , where are they taking you ? 
To the dark and gloomy house , the poor , unhappy house , the house where they never eat or drink ! ' 
Oh , sir , they 're bringing him here . '' 
And I tell you that when my master heard that , even though he did n't have any reason for being very cheerful , he laughed so hard that for a long time he could n't even talk . 
In the meantime I had the bolt snapped shut on the door and my shoulder against it to hold them all back . 
The people passed by with their corpse , and I was still afraid that they were going to stick him in our house . 
And when he 'd had his bellyful of laughter -LRB- more than of food -RRB- my good master said to me : `` It 's true , Lazaro , that taking the words of the widow at face value , you had every reason to think what you did . 
But since it was God 's will to do something else and they 've gone by , go on and open the door and go get us something to eat . '' 
`` Sir , wait until they 've gone down the street , '' I said . 
Finally my master came up to the door that led to the street and opened it , reassuring me -- and I really needed that because I was so upset and afraid . 
So I started up the street again . 
But even though we ate well that day , I did n't enjoy it a damn bit . 
In fact , I did n't get my color back for three days . 
And my master would grin every time he thought about what I 'd done . 
So that 's what happened to me during those days with my third poor master , this squire , and all the time I was wishing I knew how he 'd come to this place and why he was staying here . 
Because from the very first day that I started serving him , I realized he was a stranger here : he hardly knew anyone , and he did n't associate with very many of the people around here . 
Finally my wish came true , and I found out what I wanted to know . 
One day after we 'd eaten fairly well and he was pretty content , he told me about himself . 
He said he was from Old Castile . 
And he said the only reason he 'd left there was because he did n't want to take his hat off to a neighbor of his who was a high - class gentleman . 
`` Sir , '' I said , `` if he was the kind of man you say he was and his status was higher than yours , it was only right for you to take your hat off first -- after all , you say that he took off his hat , too . '' 
`` That is the kind of man he was : his status was higher and he did take his hat off to me . 
But considering all the time I took mine off first , it would n't have been asking too much for him to be civil and make the first move once in a while . '' 
`` It seems to me , sir , '' I told him , `` that I would n't even think about that -- especially with people who are my superiors and are better off than I am . '' 
`` You 're just a boy , '' he answered , `` and you do n't understand honor . 
That is the most important thing to any self-respecting gentleman these days . 
Well , I want you to know that I 'm a squire -- as you can see . 
But I swear to God that if I meet a count on the street and he does n't take his hat all the way off his head for me , the next time I see him coming , I 'll duck right into a house and pretend that I have some business or other to do there . 
Or I 'll go up another street , if there is one , before he gets up to me -- just so I wo n't have to take off my hat to him . 
Because a gentleman does n't owe anything to anyone except God or the King . 
And it is n't right , if he 's a man of honor , for him to let his self-respect fall even for a minute . 
`` I remember one day when I put a craftsman from my town in his place , and I felt like strangling him , too , because every time I ran into him he would say , ` God keep you , friend . ' 
` You little peasant , ' I said to him , ` How dare you address me with `` God keep you '' as if I were just anybody ? 
Where were you brought up ? '
