I must away . 
She has returned to town , and is at the house of a friend . 
And then , Albert -- yes , I must go . 
Oh , what a night , Wilhelm ! 
I can henceforth bear anything . 
I shall never see her again . 
Oh , why can not I fall on your neck , and , with floods of tears and raptures , give utterance to all the passions which distract my heart ! 
Here I sit gasping for breath , and struggling to compose myself . 
I wait for day , and at sunrise the horses are to be at the door . 
And she is sleeping calmly , little suspecting that she has seen me for the last time . 
I am free . 
I have had the courage , in an interview of two hours ' duration , not to betray my intention . 
And O Wilhelm , what a conversation it was ! 
Albert had promised to come to Charlotte in the garden immediately after supper . 
I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees , and watched the setting sun . 
I saw him sink for the last time beneath this delightful valley and silent stream . 
I had often visited the same spot with Charlotte , and witnessed that glorious sight ; and now -- I was walking up and down the very avenue which was so dear to me . 
A secret sympathy had frequently drawn me thither before I knew Charlotte ; and we were delighted when , in our early acquaintance , we discovered that we each loved the same spot , which is indeed as romantic as any that ever captivated the fancy of an artist . 
From beneath the chestnut trees , there is an extensive view . 
But I remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter , and have described the tall mass of beech trees at the end , and how the avenue grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them , till it ends in a gloomy recess , which has all the charm of a mysterious solitude . 
I still remember the strange feeling of melancholy which came over me the first time I entered that dark retreat , at bright midday . 
I felt some secret foreboding that it would , one day , be to me the scene of some happiness or misery . 
I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts of going and returning , when I heard them coming up the terrace . 
I ran to meet them . 
I trembled as I took her hand , and kissed it . 
As we reached the top of the terrace , the moon rose from behind the wooded hill . 
We conversed on many subjects , and , without perceiving it , approached the gloomy recess . 
Charlotte entered , and sat down . 
Albert seated himself beside her . 
I did the same , but my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated . 
I got up , and stood before her , then walked backward and forward , and sat down again . 
I was restless and miserable . 
Charlotte drew our attention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight , which threw a silver hue over the terrace in front of us , beyond the beech trees . 
It was a glorious sight , and was rendered more striking by the darkness which surrounded the spot where we were . 
We remained for some time silent , when Charlotte observed , `` Whenever I walk by moonlight , it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed friends , and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity . 
We shall live again , Werther ! '' 
she continued , with a firm but feeling voice ; `` but shall we know one another again what do you think ? 
what do you say ? '' 
`` Charlotte , '' I said , as I took her hand in mine , and my eyes filled with tears , `` we shall see each other again -- here and hereafter we shall meet again . '' 
I could say no more . 
Why , Wilhelm , should she put this question to me , just at the moment when the fear of our cruel separation filled my heart ? 
`` And oh ! 
do those departed ones know how we are employed here ? 
do they know when we are well and happy ? 
do they know when we recall their memories with the fondest love ? 
In the silent hour of evening the shade of my mother hovers around me ; when seated in the midst of my children , I see them assembled near me , as they used to assemble near her ; and then I raise my anxious eyes to heaven , and wish she could look down upon us , and witness how I fulfil the promise I made to her in her last moments , to be a mother to her children . 
With what emotion do I then exclaim , ` Pardon , dearest of mothers , pardon me , if I do not adequately supply your place ! 
Alas ! 
I do my utmost . 
They are clothed and fed ; and , still better , they are loved and educated . 
Could you but see , sweet saint ! 
the peace and harmony that dwells amongst us , you would glorify God with the warmest feelings of gratitude , to whom , in your last hour , you addressed such fervent prayers for our happiness . ' '' 
Thus did she express herself ; but O Wilhelm ! 
who can do justice to her language ? 
how can cold and passionless words convey the heavenly expressions of the spirit ? 
Albert interrupted her gently . 
`` This affects you too deeply , my dear Charlotte . 
I know your soul dwells on such recollections with intense delight ; but I implore -- '' `` O Albert ! '' 
she continued , `` I am sure you do not forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little round table , when papa was absent , and the little ones had retired . 
You often had a good book with you , but seldom read it ; the conversation of that noble being was preferable to everything , -- that beautiful , bright , gentle , and yet ever-toiling woman . 
God alone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch , that I might be like her . '' 
I threw myself at her feet , and , seizing her hand , bedewed it with a thousand tears . 
`` Charlotte ! '' 
I exclaimed , `` God 's blessing and your mother 's spirit are upon you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
that you had known her , '' she said , with a warm pressure of the hand . 
`` She was worthy of being known to you . '' 
I thought I should have fainted : never had I received praise so flattering . 
She continued , `` And yet she was doomed to die in the flower of her youth , when her youngest child was scarcely six months old . 
Her illness was but short , but she was calm and resigned ; and it was only for her children , especially the youngest , that she felt unhappy . 
When her end drew nigh , she bade me bring them to her . 
I obeyed . 
The younger ones knew nothing of their approaching loss , while the elder ones were quite overcome with grief . 
They stood around the bed ; and she raised her feeble hands to heaven , and prayed over them ; then , kissing them in turn , she dismissed them , and said to me , ` Be you a mother to them . ' 
I gave her my hand . 
` You are promising much , my child , ' she said : ' a mother 's fondness and a mother 's care ! 
I have often witnessed , by your tears of gratitude , that you know what is a mother 's tenderness : show it to your brothers and sisters , and be dutiful and faithful to your father as a wife ; you will be his comfort . ' 
She inquired for him . 
He had retired to conceal his intolerable anguish , -- he was heartbroken , ` Albert , you were in the room . ' 
She heard some one moving : she inquired who it was , and desired you to approach . 
She surveyed us both with a look of composure and satisfaction , expressive of her conviction that we should be happy , -- happy with one another . '' 
Albert fell upon her neck , and kissed her , and exclaimed , `` We are so , and we shall be so ! '' 
Even Albert , generally so tranquil , had quite lost his composure ; and I was excited beyond expression . 
`` And such a being , '' She continued , `` was to leave us , Werther ! 
Great God , must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this world ? 
Nobody felt this more acutely than the children : they cried and lamented for a long time afterward , complaining that men had carried away their dear mamma . '' 
Charlotte rose . 
It aroused me ; but I continued sitting , and held her hand . 
`` Let us go , '' she said : `` it grows late . '' 
She attempted to withdraw her hand : I held it still . 
`` We shall see each other again , '' I exclaimed : `` we shall recognise each other under every possible change ! 
I am going , '' I continued , `` going willingly ; but , should I say for ever , perhaps I may not keep my word . 
Adieu , Charlotte ; adieu , Albert . 
We shall meet again . '' 
`` Yes : tomorrow , I think , '' she answered with a smile . 
Tomorrow ! 
how I felt the word ! 
Ah ! 
she little thought , when she drew her hand away from mine . 
They walked down the avenue . 
I stood gazing after them in the moonlight . 
I threw myself upon the ground , and wept : I then sprang up , and ran out upon the terrace , and saw , under the shade of the linden-trees , her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate . 
I stretched out my arms , and she vanished . 
We arrived here yesterday . 
The ambassador is indisposed , and will not go out for some days . 
If he were less peevish and morose , all would be well . 
I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined me to severe trials ; but courage ! 
a light heart may bear anything . 
A light heart ! 
I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen . 
A little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest being under the sun . 
But must I despair of my talents and faculties , whilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with the utmost self-satisfaction ? 
Gracious Providence , to whom I owe all my powers , why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I possess , and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence and contentment ? 
But patience ! 
all will yet be well ; for I assure you , my dear friend , you were right : since I have been obliged to associate continually with other people , and observe what they do , and how they employ themselves , I have become far better satisfied with myself . 
For we are so constituted by nature , that we are ever prone to compare ourselves with others ; and our happiness or misery depends very much on the objects and persons around us . 
On this account , nothing is more dangerous than solitude : there our imagination , always disposed to rise , taking a new flight on the wings of fancy , pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem the most inferior . 
All things appear greater than they really are , and all seem superior to us . 
This operation of the mind is quite natural : we so continually feel our own imperfections , and fancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess , attributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves , that by this process we form the idea of a perfect , happy man , -- a man , however , who only exists in our own imagination . 
But when , in spite of weakness and disappointments , we set to work in earnest , and persevere steadily , we often find , that , though obliged continually to tack , we make more way than others who have the assistance of wind and tide ; and , in truth , there can be no greater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip them in the race . 
I begin to find my situation here more tolerable , considering all circumstances . 
I find a great advantage in being much occupied ; and the number of persons I meet , and their different pursuits , create a varied entertainment for me . 
I have formed the acquaintance of the Count C -- and I esteem him more and more every day . 
He is a man of strong understanding and great discernment ; but , though he sees farther than other people , he is not on that account cold in his manner , but capable of inspiring and returning the warmest affection . 
He appeared interested in me on one occasion , when I had to transact some business with him . 
He perceived , at the first word , that we understood each other , and that he could converse with me in a different tone from what he used with others . 
I can not sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me . 
It is the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great mind in sympathy with our own . 
As I anticipated , the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance . 
He is the most punctilious blockhead under heaven . 
He does everything step by step , with the trifling minuteness of an old woman ; and he is a man whom it is impossible to please , because he is never pleased with himself . 
I like to do business regularly and cheerfully , and , when it is finished , to leave it . 
But he constantly returns my papers to me , saying , `` They will do , '' but recommending me to look over them again , as `` one may always improve by using a better word or a more appropriate particle . '' 
I then lose all patience , and wish myself at the devil 's . 
Not a conjunction , not an adverb , must be omitted : he has a deadly antipathy to all those transpositions of which I am so fond ; and , if the music of our periods is not tuned to the established , official key , he can not comprehend our meaning . 
It is deplorable to be connected with such a fellow . 
My acquaintance with the Count C -- is the only compensation for such an evil . 
He told me frankly , the other day , that he was much displeased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador ; that people like him are obstacles , both to themselves and to others . 
`` But , '' added he , `` one must submit , like a traveller who has to ascend a mountain : if the mountain was not there , the road would be both shorter and pleasanter ; but there it is , and he must get over it . '' 
The old man perceives the count 's partiality for me : this annoys him , and , he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count in my hearing . 
I naturally defend him , and that only makes matters worse . 
Yesterday he made me indignant , for he also alluded to me . 
`` The count , '' he said , `` is a man of the world , and a good man of business : his style is good , and he writes with facility ; but , like other geniuses , he has no solid learning . '' 
He looked at me with an expression that seemed to ask if I felt the blow . 
But it did not produce the desired effect : I despise a man who can think and act in such a manner . 
However , I made a stand , and answered with not a little warmth . 
The count , I said , was a man entitled to respect , alike for his character and his acquirements . 
I had never met a person whose mind was stored with more useful and extensive knowledge , -- who had , in fact , mastered such an infinite variety of subjects , and who yet retained all his activity for the details of ordinary business . 
This was altogether beyond his comprehension ; and I took my leave , lest my anger should be too highly excited by some new absurdity of his . 
And you are to blame for all this , you who persuaded me to bend my neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me . 
If the man who plants vegetables , and carries his corn to town on market-days , is not more usefully employed than I am , then let me work ten years longer at the galleys to which I am now chained . 
Oh , the brilliant wretchedness , the weariness , that one is doomed to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here ! 
The ambition of rank ! 
How they watch , how they toil , to gain precedence ! 
What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in their utter nakedness ! 
We have a woman here , for example , who never ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her family and her estates . 
Any stranger would consider her a silly being , whose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property ; but she is in reality even more ridiculous , the daughter of a mere magistrate 's clerk from this neighbourhood . 
I can not understand how human beings can so debase themselves . 
Every day I observe more and more the folly of judging of others by ourselves ; and I have so much trouble with myself , and my own heart is in such constant agitation , that I am well content to let others pursue their own course , if they only allow me the same privilege . 
What provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions of rank are carried . 
I know perfectly well how necessary are inequalities of condition , and I am sensible of the advantages I myself derive therefrom ; but I would not have these institutions prove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy on this earth . 
I have lately become acquainted with a Miss B -- , a very agreeable girl , who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial life . 
Our first conversation pleased us both equally ; and , at taking leave , I requested permission to visit her . 
She consented in so obliging a manner , that I waited with impatience for the arrival of the happy moment . 
She is not a native of this place , but resides here with her aunt . 
The countenance of the old lady is not prepossessing . 
I paid her much attention , addressing the greater part of my conversation to her ; and , in less than half an hour , I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me , that her aged aunt , having but a small fortune , and a still smaller share of understanding , enjoys no satisfaction except in the pedigree of her ancestors , no protection save in her noble birth , and no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of the humble citizens . 
She was , no doubt , handsome in her youth , and in her early years probably trifled away her time in rendering many a poor youth the sport of her caprice : in her riper years she has submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer , who , in return for her person and her small independence , has spent with her what we may designate her age of brass . 
He is dead ; and she is now a widow , and deserted . 
She spends her iron age alone , and would not be approached , except for the loveliness of her niece . 
JANUARY 8 , 1772 . 
What beings are men , whose whole thoughts are occupied with form and ceremony , who for years together devote their mental and physical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one step , and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table . 
Not that such persons would otherwise want employment : on the contrary , they give themselves much trouble by neglecting important business for such petty trifles . 
Last week a question of precedence arose at a sledging-party , and all our amusement was spoiled . 
The silly creatures can not see that it is not place which constitutes real greatness , since the man who occupies the first place but seldom plays the principal part . 
How many kings are governed by their ministers -- how many ministers by their secretaries ? 
Who , in such cases , is really the chief ? 
He , as it seems to me , who can see through the others , and possesses strength or skill enough to make their power or passions subservient to the execution of his own designs . 
JANUARY 20 . 
I must write to you from this place , my dear Charlotte , from a small room in a country inn , where I have taken shelter from a severe storm . 
During my whole residence in that wretched place D -- , where I lived amongst strangers , -- strangers , indeed , to this heart , -- I never at any time felt the smallest inclination to correspond with you ; but in this cottage , in this retirement , in this solitude , with the snow and hail beating against my lattice-pane , you are my first thought . 
The instant I entered , your figure rose up before me , and the remembrance ! 
O my Charlotte , the sacred , tender remembrance ! 
Gracious Heaven ! 
restore to me the happy moment of our first acquaintance . 
Could you but see me , my dear Charlotte , in the whirl of dissipation , -- how my senses are dried up , but my heart is at no time full . 
I enjoy no single moment of happiness : all is vain -- nothing touches me . 
I stand , as it were , before the raree-show : I see the little puppets move , and I ask whether it is not an optical illusion . 
I am amused with these puppets , or , rather , I am myself one of them : but , when I sometimes grasp my neighbour 's hand , I feel that it is not natural ; and I withdraw mine with a shudder . 
In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning 's sunrise , and yet I remain in bed : in the day I promise to ramble by moonlight ; and I , nevertheless , remain at home . 
I know not why I rise , nor why I go to sleep . 
The leaven which animated my existence is gone : the charm which cheered me in the gloom of night , and aroused me from my morning slumbers , is for ever fled . 
I have found but one being here to interest me , a Miss B -- . 
She resembles you , my dear Charlotte , if any one can possibly resemble you . 
`` Ah ! '' 
you will say , `` he has learned how to pay fine compliments . '' 
And this is partly true . 
I have been very agreeable lately , as it was not in my power to be otherwise . 
I have , moreover , a deal of wit : and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better , or falsehoods you will add ; since the one accomplishment invariably accompanies the other . 
But I must tell you of Miss B -- . 
She has abundance of soul , which flashes from her deep blue eyes . 
Her rank is a torment to her , and satisfies no one desire of her heart . 
She would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion , and we often picture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distant scenes of rural retirement : and then we speak of you , my dear Charlotte ; for she knows you , and renders homage to your merits ; but her homage is not exacted , but voluntary , she loves you , and delights to hear you made the subject of conversation . 
Oh , that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room , with the dear children playing around us ! 
If they became troublesome to you , I would tell them some appalling goblin story ; and they would crowd round me with silent attention . 
The sun is setting in glory ; his last rays are shining on the snow , which covers the face of the country : the storm is over , and I must return to my dungeon . 
Adieu ! 
-- Is Albert with you ? 
and what is he to you ? 
God forgive the question . 
For a week past we have had the most wretched weather : but this to me is a blessing ; for , during my residence here , not a single fine day has beamed from the heavens , but has been lost to me by the intrusion of somebody . 
During the severity of rain , sleet , frost , and storm , I congratulate myself that it can not be worse indoors than abroad , nor worse abroad than it is within doors ; and so I become reconciled . 
When the sun rises bright in the morning , and promises a glorious day , I never omit to exclaim , `` There , now , they have another blessing from Heaven , which they will be sure to destroy : they spoil everything , -- health , fame , happiness , amusement ; and they do this generally through folly , ignorance , or imbecility , and always , according to their own account , with the best intentions ! '' 
I could often beseech them , on my bended knees , to be less resolved upon their own destruction . 
I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer together . 
He is really growing past endurance . 
He transacts his business in so ridiculous a manner , that I am often compelled to contradict him , and do things my own way ; and then , of course , he thinks them very ill done . 
He complained of me lately on this account at court ; and the minister gave me a reprimand , -- a gentle one it is true , but still a reprimand . 
In consequence of this , I was about to tender my resignation , when I received a letter , to which I submitted with great respect , on account of the high , noble , and generous spirit which dictated it . 
He endeavoured to soothe my excessive sensibility , paid a tribute to my extreme ideas of duty , of good example , and of perseverance in business , as the fruit of my youthful ardour , an impulse which he did not seek to destroy , but only to moderate , that it might have proper play and be productive of good . 
So now I am at rest for another week , and no longer at variance with myself . 
Content and peace of mind are valuable things : I could wish , my dear friend , that these precious jewels were less transitory . 
God bless you , my dear friends , and may he grant you that happiness which he denies to me ! 
I thank you , Albert , for having deceived me . 
I waited for the news that your wedding-day was fixed ; and I intended on that day , with solemnity , to take down Charlotte 's profile from the wall , and to bury it with some other papers I possess . 
You are now united , and her picture still remains here . 
Well , let it remain ! 
Why should it not ? 
I know that I am still one of your society , that I still occupy a place uninjured in Charlotte 's heart , that I hold the second place therein ; and I intend to keep it . 
Oh , I should become mad if she could forget ! 
Albert , that thought is hell ! 
Farewell , Albert farewell , angel of heaven farewell , Charlotte ! 
I have just had a sad adventure , which will drive me away from here . 
I lose all patience ! 
-- Death ! 
-- It is not to be remedied ; and you alone are to blame , for you urged and impelled me to fill a post for which I was by no means suited . 
I have now reason to be satisfied , and so have you ! 
But , that you may not again attribute this fatality to my impetuous temper , I send you , my dear sir , a plain and simple narration of the affair , as a mere chronicler of facts would describe it . 
The Count of O -- likes and distinguishes me . 
It is well known , and I have mentioned this to you a hundred times . 
Yesterday I dined with him . 
It is the day on which the nobility are accustomed to assemble at his house in the evening . 
I never once thought of the assembly , nor that we subalterns did not belong to such society . 
Well , I dined with the count ; and , after dinner , we adjourned to the large hall . 
We walked up and down together : and I conversed with him , and with Colonel B -- , who joined us ; and in this manner the hour for the assembly approached . 
God knows , I was thinking of nothing , when who should enter but the honourable Lady accompanied by her noble husband and their silly , scheming daughter , with her small waist and flat neck ; and , with disdainful looks and a haughty air they passed me by . 
As I heartily detest the whole race , I determined upon going away ; and only waited till the count had disengaged himself from their impertinent prattle , to take leave , when the agreeable Miss B -- came in . 
As I never meet her without experiencing a heartfelt pleasure , I stayed and talked to her , leaning over the back of her chair , and did not perceive , till after some time , that she seemed a little confused , and ceased to answer me with her usual ease of manner . 
I was struck with it . 
`` Heavens ! '' 
I said to myself , `` can she , too , be like the rest ? '' 
I felt annoyed , and was about to withdraw ; but I remained , notwithstanding , forming excuses for her conduct , fancying she did not mean it , and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition . 
The rest of the company now arrived . 
There was the Baron F -- , in an entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I. ; the Chancellor N -- , with his deaf wife ; the shabbily-dressed I -- , whose old-fashioned coat bore evidence of modern repairs : this crowned the whole . 
I conversed with some of my acquaintances , but they answered me laconically . 
I was engaged in observing Miss B -- , and did not notice that the women were whispering at the end of the room , that the murmur extended by degrees to the men , that Madame S -- addressed the count with much warmth -LRB- this was all related to me subsequently by Miss B -- -RRB- ; till at length the count came up to me , and took me to the window . 
`` You know our ridiculous customs , '' he said . 
`` I perceive the company is rather displeased at your being here . 
I would not on any account -- '' `` I beg your excellency 's pardon ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` I ought to have thought of this before , but I know you will forgive this little inattention . 
I was going , '' I added , `` some time ago , but my evil genius detained me . '' 
And I smiled and bowed , to take my leave . 
He shook me by the hand , in a manner which expressed everything . 
I hastened at once from the illustrious assembly , sprang into a carriage , and drove to M -- . 
I contemplated the setting sun from the top of the hill , and read that beautiful passage in Homer , where Ulysses is entertained by the hospitable herdsmen . 
This was indeed delightful . 
I returned home to supper in the evening . 
But few persons were assembled in the room . 
They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth , and were playing at dice . 
The good-natured A -- came in . 
He laid down his hat when he saw me , approached me , and said in a low tone , `` You have met with a disagreeable adventure . '' 
`` I ! '' 
I exclaimed . 
`` The count obliged you to withdraw from the assembly ! '' 
`` Deuce take the assembly ! '' 
said I. `` I was very glad to be gone . '' 
`` I am delighted , '' he added , `` that you take it so lightly . 
I am only sorry that it is already so much spoken of . '' 
The circumstance then began to pain me . 
I fancied that every one who sat down , and even looked at me , was thinking of this incident ; and my heart became embittered . 
And now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom , when I hear myself everywhere pitied , and observe the triumph of my enemies , who say that this is always the case with vain persons , whose heads are turned with conceit , who affect to despise forms and such petty , idle nonsense . 
Say what you will of fortitude , but show me the man who can patiently endure the laughter of fools , when they have obtained an advantage over him . 
'T is only when their nonsense is without foundation that one can suffer it without complaint . 
Everything conspires against me . 
I met Miss B -- walking to-day . 
I could not help joining her ; and , when we were at a little distance from her companions , I expressed my sense of her altered manner toward me . 
`` O Werther ! '' 
she said , in a tone of emotion , `` you , who know my heart , how could you so ill interpret my distress ? 
What did I not suffer for you , from the moment you entered the room ! 
I foresaw it all , a hundred times was I on the point of mentioning it to you . 
I knew that the S -- s and T -- s , with their husbands , would quit the room , rather than remain in your company . 
I knew that the count would not break with them : and now so much is said about it . '' 
`` How ! '' 
I exclaimed , and endeavoured to conceal my emotion ; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurred to me painfully at that moment . 
`` Oh , how much it has already cost me ! '' 
said this amiable girl , while her eyes filled with tears . 
I could scarcely contain myself , and was ready to throw myself at her feet . 
`` Explain yourself ! '' 
I cried . 
Tears flowed down her cheeks . 
I became quite frantic . 
She wiped them away , without attempting to conceal them . 
`` You know my aunt , '' she continued ; `` she was present : and in what light does she consider the affair ! 
Last night , and this morning , Werther , I was compelled to listen to a lecture upon my acquaintance with you . 
I have been obliged to hear you condemned and depreciated ; and I could not -- I dared not -- say much in your defence . '' 
Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart . 
She did not feel what a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me . 
She told me , in addition , all the impertinence that would be further circulated , and how the malicious would triumph ; how they would rejoice over the punishment of my pride , over my humiliation for that want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached . 
To hear all this , Wilhelm , uttered by her in a voice of the most sincere sympathy , awakened all my passions ; and I am still in a state of extreme excitement . 
I wish I could find a man to jeer me about this event . 
I would sacrifice him to my resentment . 
The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury . 
A hundred times have I seized a dagger , to give ease to this oppressed heart . 
Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open a vein with their teeth , when heated and exhausted by a long course , in order to breathe more freely . 
I am often tempted to open a vein , to procure for myself everlasting liberty . 
I have tendered my resignation to the court . 
I hope it will be accepted , and you will forgive me for not having previously consulted you . 
It is necessary I should leave this place . 
I know all you will urge me to stay , and therefore I beg you will soften this news to my mother . 
I am unable to do anything for myself : how , then , should I be competent to assist others ? 
It will afflict her that I should have interrupted that career which would have made me first a privy councillor , and then minister , and that I should look behind me , in place of advancing . 
Argue as you will , combine all the reasons which should have induced me to remain , I am going : that is sufficient . 
But , that you may not be ignorant of my destination , I may mention that the Prince of -- is here . 
He is much pleased with my company ; and , having heard of my intention to resign , he has invited me to his country house , to pass the spring months with him . 
I shall be left completely my own master ; and , as we agree on all subjects but one , I shall try my fortune , and accompany him . 
Thanks for both your letters . 
I delayed my reply , and withheld this letter , till I should obtain an answer from the court . 
I feared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose . 
But my request is granted , my resignation is accepted . 
I shall not recount with what reluctance it was accorded , nor relate what the minister has written : you would only renew your lamentations . 
The crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats ; and , indeed , such goodness has affected me to tears . 
For this reason I shall not require from my mother the money for which I lately applied . 
I leave this place to-morrow ; and , as my native place is only six miles from the high road , I intend to visit it once more , and recall the happy dreams of my childhood . 
I shall enter at the same gate through which I came with my mother , when , after my father 's death , she left that delightful retreat to immure herself in your melancholy town . 
Adieu , my dear friend : you shall hear of my future career . 
I have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion of a pilgrim , and have experienced many unexpected emotions . 
Near the great elm tree , which is a quarter of a league from the village , I got out of the carriage , and sent it on before , that alone , and on foot , I might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure of my recollections . 
I stood there under that same elm which was formerly the term and object of my walks . 
How things have since changed ! 
Then , in happy ignorance , I sighed for a world I did not know , where I hoped to find every pleasure and enjoyment which my heart could desire ; and now , on my return from that wide world , O my friend , how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful plans have I brought back ! 
As I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me , I thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires . 
Here used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them , ardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods , to lose myself in those valleys , which form so delightful an object in the distance . 
With what reluctance did I leave this charming spot ; when my hour of recreation was over , and my leave of absence expired ! 
I drew near to the village : all the well-known old summerhouses and gardens were recognised again ; I disliked the new ones , and all other alterations which had taken place . 
I entered the village , and all my former feelings returned . 
I can not , my dear friend , enter into details , charming as were my sensations : they would be dull in the narration . 
I had intended to lodge in the market-place , near our old house . 
As soon as I entered , I perceived that the schoolroom , where our childhood had been taught by that good old woman , was converted into a shop . 
I called to mind the sorrow , the heaviness , the tears , and oppression of heart , which I experienced in that confinement . 
Every step produced some particular impression . 
A pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meet so many spots pregnant with tender recollections , and his soul is hardly moved with greater devotion . 
One incident will serve for illustration . 
I followed the course of a stream to a farm , formerly a delightful walk of mine , and paused at the spot , where , when boys , we used to amuse ourselves making ducks and drakes upon the water . 
I recollected so well how I used formerly to watch the course of that same stream , following it with inquiring eagerness , forming romantic ideas of the countries it was to pass through ; but my imagination was soon exhausted : while the water continued flowing farther and farther on , till my fancy became bewildered by the contemplation of an invisible distance . 
Exactly such , my dear friend , so happy and so confined , were the thoughts of our good ancestors . 
Their feelings and their poetry were fresh as childhood . 
And , when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea and boundless earth , his epithets are true , natural , deeply felt , and mysterious . 
Of what importance is it that I have learned , with every schoolboy , that the world is round ? 
Man needs but little earth for enjoyment , and still less for his final repose . 
I am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge . 
He is a man with whom one can live happily . 
He is honest and unaffected . 
There are , however , some strange characters about him , whom I can not at all understand . 
They do not seem vicious , and yet they do not carry the appearance of thoroughly honest men . 
Sometimes I am disposed to believe them honest , and yet I can not persuade myself to confide in them . 
It grieves me to hear the prince occasionally talk of things which he has only read or heard of , and always with the same view in which they have been represented by others . 
He values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart , but I am proud of the latter only . 
It is the sole source of everything of our strength , happiness , and misery . 
All the knowledge I possess every one else can acquire , but my heart is exclusively my own . 
I have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speak to you until it was accomplished : now that it has failed , I may as well mention it . 
I wished to enter the army , and had long been desirous of taking the step . 
This , indeed , was the chief reason for my coming here with the prince , as he is a general in the service . 
I communicated my design to him during one of our walks together . 
He disapproved of it , and it would have been actual madness not to have listened to his reasons . 
Say what you will , I can remain here no longer . 
Why should I remain ? 
Time hangs heavy upon my hands . 
The prince is as gracious to me as any one could be , and yet I am not at my ease . 
There is , indeed , nothing in common between us . 
He is a man of understanding , but quite of the ordinary kind . 
His conversation affords me no more amusement than I should derive from the perusal of a well-written book . 
I shall remain here a week longer , and then start again on my travels . 
My drawings are the best things I have done since I came here . 
The prince has a taste for the arts , and would improve if his mind were not fettered by cold rules and mere technical ideas . 
I often lose patience , when , with a glowing imagination , I am giving expression to art and nature , he interferes with learned suggestions , and uses at random the technical phraseology of artists . 
Once more I am a wanderer , a pilgrim , through the world . 
But what else are you ! 
Whither am I going ? 
I will tell you in confidence . 
I am obliged to continue a fortnight longer here , and then I think it would be better for me to visit the mines in -- . 
But I am only deluding myself thus . 
The fact is , I wish to be near Charlotte again , that is all . 
I smile at the suggestions of my heart , and obey its dictates . 
No , no ! 
it is yet well all is well ! 
I her husband ! 
O God , who gave me being , if thou hadst destined this happiness for me , my whole life would have been one continual thanksgiving ! 
But I will not murmur -- forgive these tears , forgive these fruitless wishes . 
She -- my wife !
