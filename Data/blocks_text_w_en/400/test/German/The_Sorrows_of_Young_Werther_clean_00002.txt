`` I should be glad to hear one , '' said Charlotte : `` at least , I think very much depends upon ourselves ; I know it is so with me . 
When anything annoys me , and disturbs my temper , I hasten into the garden , hum a couple of country dances , and it is all right with me directly . '' 
`` That is what I meant , '' I replied ; `` ill-humour resembles indolence : it is natural to us ; but if once we have courage to exert ourselves , we find our work run fresh from our hands , and we experience in the activity from which we shrank a real enjoyment . '' 
Frederica listened very attentively : and the young man objected , that we were not masters of ourselves , and still less so of our feelings . 
`` The question is about a disagreeable feeling , '' I added , `` from which every one would willingly escape , but none know their own power without trial . 
Invalids are glad to consult physicians , and submit to the most scrupulous regimen , the most nauseous medicines , in order to recover their health . '' 
I observed that the good old man inclined his head , and exerted himself to hear our discourse ; so I raised my voice , and addressed myself directly to him . 
`` We preach against a great many crimes , '' I observed , `` but I never remember a sermon delivered against ill-humour . '' 
`` That may do very well for your town clergymen , '' said he : `` country people are never ill-humoured ; though , indeed , it might be useful , occasionally , to my wife for instance , and the judge . '' 
We all laughed , as did he likewise very cordially , till he fell into a fit of coughing , which interrupted our conversation for a time . 
Herr Schmidt resumed the subject . 
`` You call ill humour a crime , '' he remarked , `` but I think you use too strong a term . '' 
`` Not at all , '' I replied , `` if that deserves the name which is so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours . 
Is it not enough that we want the power to make one another happy , must we deprive each other of the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves ? 
Show me the man who has the courage to hide his ill-humour , who bears the whole burden himself , without disturbing the peace of those around him . 
No : ill-humour arises from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit , from a discontent which ever accompanies that envy which foolish vanity engenders . 
We see people happy , whom we have not made so , and can not endure the sight . '' 
Charlotte looked at me with a smile ; she observed the emotion with which I spoke : and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed . 
`` Woe unto those , '' I said , `` who use their power over a human heart to destroy the simple pleasures it would naturally enjoy ! 
All the favours , all the attentions , in the world can not compensate for the loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny has destroyed . '' 
My heart was full as I spoke . 
A recollection of many things which had happened pressed upon my mind , and filled my eyes with tears . 
`` We should daily repeat to ourselves , '' I exclaimed , `` that we should not interfere with our friends , unless to leave them in possession of their own joys , and increase their happiness by sharing it with them ! 
But when their souls are tormented by a violent passion , or their hearts rent with grief , is it in your power to afford them the slightest consolation ? 
`` And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimely grave you have prepared , when she lies languid and exhausted before you , her dim eyes raised to heaven , and the damp of death upon her pallid brow , there you stand at her bedside like a condemned criminal , with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune could not save her ; and the agonising thought wrings you , that all your efforts are powerless to impart even a moment 's strength to the departing soul , or quicken her with a transitory consolation . '' 
At these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I had been once present fell with full force upon my heart . 
I buried my face in my handkerchief , and hastened from the room , and was only recalled to my recollection by Charlotte 's voice , who reminded me that it was time to return home . 
With what tenderness she chid me on the way for the too eager interest I took in everything ! 
She declared it would do me injury , and that I ought to spare myself . 
Yes , my angel ! 
I will do so for your sake . 
She is still with her dying friend , and is still the same bright , beautiful creature whose presence softens pain , and sheds happiness around whichever way she turns . 
She went out yesterday with her little sisters : I knew it , and went to meet them ; and we walked together . 
In about an hour and a half we returned to the town . 
We stopped at the spring I am so fond of , and which is now a thousand times dearer to me than ever . 
Charlotte seated herself upon the low wall , and we gathered about her . 
I looked around , and recalled the time when my heart was unoccupied and free . 
`` Dear fountain ! '' 
I said , `` since that time I have no more come to enjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream : I have passed thee with careless steps , and scarcely bestowed a glance upon thee . '' 
I looked down , and observed Charlotte 's little sister , Jane , coming up the steps with a glass of water . 
I turned toward Charlotte , and I felt her influence over me . 
Jane at the moment approached with the glass . 
Her sister , Marianne , wished to take it from her . 
`` No ! '' 
cried the child , with the sweetest expression of face , `` Charlotte must drink first . '' 
The affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmed me , that I sought to express my feelings by catching up the child and kissing her heartily . 
She was frightened , and began to cry . 
`` You should not do that , '' said Charlotte : I felt perplexed . 
`` Come , Jane , '' she continued , taking her hand , and leading her down the steps again , `` it is no matter : wash yourself quickly in the fresh water . '' 
I stood and watched them ; and when I saw the little dear rubbing her cheeks with her wet hands , in full belief that all the impurities contracted from my ugly beard would be washed off by the miraculous water , and how , though Charlotte said it would do , she continued still to wash with all her might , as though she thought too much were better than too little , I assure you , Wilhelm , I never attended a baptism with greater reverence ; and , when Charlotte came up from the well , I could have prostrated myself as before the prophet of an Eastern nation . 
In the evening I would not resist telling the story to a person who , I thought , possessed some natural feeling , because he was a man of understanding . 
But what a mistake I made . 
He maintained it was very wrong of Charlotte , that we should not deceive children , that such things occasioned countless mistakes and superstitions , from which we were bound to protect the young . 
It occurred to me then , that this very man had been baptised only a week before ; so I said nothing further , but maintained the justice of my own convictions . 
We should deal with children as God deals with us , we are happiest under the influence of innocent delusions . 
What a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look ! 
What a child is man ! 
We had been to Walheim : the ladies went in a carriage ; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte 's dark eyes -- I am a fool -- but forgive me ! 
you should see them , -- those eyes . 
-- However , to be brief -LRB- for my own eyes are weighed down with sleep -RRB- , you must know , when the ladies stepped into their carriage again , young W. Seldstadt , Andran , and I were standing about the door . 
They are a merry set of fellows , and they were all laughing and joking together . 
I watched Charlotte 's eyes . 
They wandered from one to the other ; but they did not light on me , on me , who stood there motionless , and who saw nothing but her ! 
My heart bade her a thousand times adieu , but she noticed me not . 
The carriage drove off ; and my eyes filled with tears . 
I looked after her : suddenly I saw Charlotte 's bonnet leaning out of the window , and she turned to look back , was it at me ? 
My dear friend , I know not ; and in this uncertainty I find consolation . 
Perhaps she turned to look at me . 
Perhaps ! 
Good-night -- what a child I am ! 
You should see how foolish I look in company when her name is mentioned , particularly when I am asked plainly how I like her . 
How I like her ! 
I detest the phrase . 
What sort of creature must he be who merely liked Charlotte , whose whole heart and senses were not entirely absorbed by her . 
Like her ! 
Some one asked me lately how I liked Ossian . 
Madame M -- is very ill . 
I pray for her recovery , because Charlotte shares my sufferings . 
I see her occasionally at my friend 's house , and to-day she has told me the strangest circumstance . 
Old M -- is a covetous , miserly fellow , who has long worried and annoyed the poor lady sadly ; but she has borne her afflictions patiently . 
A few days ago , when the physician informed us that her recovery was hopeless , she sent for her husband -LRB- Charlotte was present -RRB- , and addressed him thus : `` I have something to confess , which , after my decease , may occasion trouble and confusion . 
I have hitherto conducted your household as frugally and economically as possible , but you must pardon me for having defrauded you for thirty years . 
At the commencement of our married life , you allowed a small sum for the wants of the kitchen , and the other household expenses . 
When our establishment increased and our property grew larger , I could not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance in proportion : in short , you know , that , when our wants were greatest , you required me to supply everything with seven florins a week . 
I took the money from you without an observation , but made up the weekly deficiency from the money-chest ; as nobody would suspect your wife of robbing the household bank . 
But I have wasted nothing , and should have been content to meet my eternal Judge without this confession , if she , upon whom the management of your establishment will devolve after my decease , would be free from embarrassment upon your insisting that the allowance made to me , your former wife , was sufficient . '' 
I talked with Charlotte of the inconceivable manner in which men allow themselves to be blinded ; how any one could avoid suspecting some deception , when seven florins only were allowed to defray expenses twice as great . 
But I have myself known people who believed , without any visible astonishment , that their house possessed the prophet 's never-failing cruse of oil . 
No , I am not deceived . 
In her dark eyes I read a genuine interest in me and in my fortunes . 
Yes , I feel it ; and I may believe my own heart which tells me -- dare I say it ? 
-- dare I pronounce the divine words ? 
-- that she loves me ! 
That she loves me ! 
How the idea exalts me in my own eyes ! 
And , as you can understand my feelings , I may say to you , how I honour myself since she loves me ! 
Is this presumption , or is it a consciousness of the truth ? 
I do not know a man able to supplant me in the heart of Charlotte ; and yet when she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth and affection , I feel like the soldier who has been stripped of his honours and titles , and deprived of his sword . 
How my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger , or my feet meet hers under the table ! 
I draw back as if from a furnace ; but a secret force impels me forward again , and my senses become disordered . 
Her innocent , unconscious heart never knows what agony these little familiarities inflict upon me . 
Sometimes when we are talking she lays her hand upon mine , and in the eagerness of conversation comes closer to me , and her balmy breath reaches my lips , -- when I feel as if lightning had struck me , and that I could sink into the earth . 
And yet , Wilhelm , with all this heavenly confidence , -- if I know myself , and should ever dare -- you understand me . 
No , no ! 
my heart is not so corrupt , it is weak , weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption ? 
She is to me a sacred being . 
All passion is still in her presence : I can not express my sensations when I am near her . 
I feel as if my soul beat in every nerve of my body . 
There is a melody which she plays on the piano with angelic skill , -- so simple is it , and yet so spiritual ! 
It is her favourite air ; and , when she plays the first note , all pain , care , and sorrow disappear from me in a moment . 
I believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music . 
How her simple song enchants me ! 
Sometimes , when I am ready to commit suicide , she sings that air ; and instantly the gloom and madness which hung over me are dispersed , and I breathe freely again . 
Wilhelm , what is the world to our hearts without love ? 
What is a magic-lantern without light ? 
You have but to kindle the flame within , and the brightest figures shine on the white wall ; and , if love only show us fleeting shadows , we are yet happy , when , like mere children , we behold them , and are transported with the splendid phantoms . 
I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day . 
I was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself . 
What was to be done ? 
I sent my servant to her house , that I might at least see somebody to-day who had been near her . 
Oh , the impatience with which I waited for his return ! 
the joy with which I welcomed him ! 
I should certainly have caught him in my arms , and kissed him , if I had not been ashamed . 
It is said that the Bonona stone , when placed in the sun , attracts the rays , and for a time appears luminous in the dark . 
So was it with me and this servant . 
The idea that Charlotte 's eyes had dwelt on his countenance , his cheek , his very apparel , endeared them all inestimably to me , so that at the moment I would not have parted from him for a thousand crowns . 
His presence made me so happy ! 
Beware of laughing at me , Wilhelm . 
Can that be a delusion which makes us happy ? 
`` I shall see her today ! '' 
I exclaim with delight , when I rise in the morning , and look out with gladness of heart at the bright , beautiful sun . 
`` I shall see her today ! '' 
And then I have no further wish to form : all , all is included in that one thought . 
I can not assent to your proposal that I should accompany the ambassador to ------ . 
I do not love subordination ; and we all know that he is a rough , disagreeable person to be connected with . 
You say my mother wishes me to be employed . 
I could not help laughing at that . 
Am I not sufficiently employed ? 
And is it not in reality the same , whether I shell peas or count lentils ? 
The world runs on from one folly to another ; and the man who , solely from regard to the opinion of others , and without any wish or necessity of his own , toils after gold , honour , or any other phantom , is no better than a fool . 
You insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing , that it would be as well for me to say nothing as to confess how little I have lately done . 
I never felt happier , I never understood nature better , even down to the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass ; and yet I am unable to express myself : my powers of execution are so weak , everything seems to swim and float before me , so that I can not make a clear , bold outline . 
But I fancy I should succeed better if I had some clay or wax to model . 
I shall try , if this state of mind continues much longer , and will take to modelling , if I only knead dough . 
I have commenced Charlotte 's portrait three times , and have as often disgraced myself . 
This is the more annoying , as I was formerly very happy in taking likenesses . 
I have since sketched her profile , and must content myself with that . 
Yes , dear Charlotte ! 
I will order and arrange everything . 
Only give me more commissions , the more the better . 
One thing , however , I must request : use no more writing-sand with the dear notes you send me . 
Today I raised your letter hastily to my lips , and it set my teeth on edge . 
I have often determined not to see her so frequently . 
But who could keep such a resolution ? 
Every day I am exposed to the temptation , and promise faithfully that to-morrow I will really stay away : but , when tomorrow comes , I find some irresistible reason for seeing her ; and , before I can account for it , I am with her again . 
Either she has said on the previous evening `` You will be sure to call to-morrow , '' -- and who could stay away then ? 
-- or she gives me some commission , and I find it essential to take her the answer in person ; or the day is fine , and I walk to Walheim ; and , when I am there , it is only half a league farther to her . 
I am within the charmed atmosphere , and soon find myself at her side . 
My grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone . 
When any vessels came near it , they were instantly deprived of their ironwork : the nails flew to the mountain , and the unhappy crew perished amidst the disjointed planks . 
Albert is arrived , and I must take my departure . 
Were he the best and noblest of men , and I in every respect his inferior , I could not endure to see him in possession of such a perfect being . 
Possession ! 
-- enough , Wilhelm : her betrothed is here , -- a fine , worthy fellow , whom one can not help liking . 
Fortunately I was not present at their meeting . 
It would have broken my heart ! 
And he is so considerate : he has not given Charlotte one kiss in my presence . 
Heaven reward him for it ! 
I must love him for the respect with which he treats her . 
He shows a regard for me , but for this I suspect I am more indebted to Charlotte than to his own fancy for me . 
Women have a delicate tact in such matters , and it should be so . 
They can not always succeed in keeping two rivals on terms with each other ; but , when they do , they are the only gainers . 
I can not help esteeming Albert . 
The coolness of his temper contrasts strongly with the impetuosity of mine , which I can not conceal . 
He has a great deal of feeling , and is fully sensible of the treasure he possesses in Charlotte . 
He is free from ill-humour , which you know is the fault I detest most . 
He regards me as a man of sense ; and my attachment to Charlotte , and the interest I take in all that concerns her , augment his triumph and his love . 
I shall not inquire whether he may not at times tease her with some little jealousies ; as I know , that , were I in his place , I should not be entirely free from such sensations . 
But , be that as it may , my pleasure with Charlotte is over . 
Call it folly or infatuation , what signifies a name ? 
The thing speaks for itself . 
Before Albert came , I knew all that I know now . 
I knew I could make no pretensions to her , nor did I offer any , that is , as far as it was possible , in the presence of so much loveliness , not to pant for its enjoyment . 
And now , behold me like a silly fellow , staring with astonishment when another comes in , and deprives me of my love . 
I bite my lips , and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me to be resigned , because there is no help for it . 
Let me escape from the yoke of such silly subterfuges ! 
I ramble through the woods ; and when I return to Charlotte , and find Albert sitting by her side in the summer-house in the garden , I am unable to bear it , behave like a fool , and commit a thousand extravagances . 
`` For Heaven 's sake , '' said Charlotte today , `` let us have no more scenes like those of last night ! 
You terrify me when you are so violent . '' 
Between ourselves , I am always away now when he visits her : and I feel delighted when I find her alone . 
Believe me , dear Wilhelm , I did not allude to you when I spoke so severely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate . 
I did not think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment . 
But in fact you are right . 
I only suggest one objection . 
In this world one is seldom reduced to make a selection between two alternatives . 
There are as many varieties of conduct and opinion as there are turns of feature between an aquiline nose and a flat one . 
You will , therefore , permit me to concede your entire argument , and yet contrive means to escape your dilemma . 
Your position is this , I hear you say : `` Either you have hopes of obtaining Charlotte , or you have none . 
Well , in the first case , pursue your course , and press on to the fulfilment of your wishes . 
In the second , be a man , and shake off a miserable passion , which will enervate and destroy you . '' 
My dear friend , this is well and easily said . 
But would you require a wretched being , whose life is slowly wasting under a lingering disease , to despatch himself at once by the stroke of a dagger ? 
Does not the very disorder which consumes his strength deprive him of the courage to effect his deliverance ? 
You may answer me , if you please , with a similar analogy , `` Who would not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of life by doubt and procrastination ! '' 
But I know not if I am right , and let us leave these comparisons . 
Enough ! 
There are moments , Wilhelm , when I could rise up and shake it all off , and when , if I only knew where to go , I could fly from this place . 
THE SAME EVENING . 
My diary , which I have for some time neglected , came before me today ; and I am amazed to see how deliberately I have entangled myself step by step . 
To have seen my position so clearly , and yet to have acted so like a child ! 
Even still I behold the result plainly , and yet have no thought of acting with greater prudence . 
If I were not a fool , I could spend the happiest and most delightful life here . 
So many agreeable circumstances , and of a kind to ensure a worthy man 's happiness , are seldom united . 
Alas ! 
I feel it too sensibly , -- the heart alone makes our happiness ! 
To be admitted into this most charming family , to be loved by the father as a son , by the children as a father , and by Charlotte ! 
then the noble Albert , who never disturbs my happiness by any appearance of ill-humour , receiving me with the heartiest affection , and loving me , next to Charlotte , better than all the world ! 
Wilhelm , you would be delighted to hear us in our rambles , and conversations about Charlotte . 
Nothing in the world can be more absurd than our connection , and yet the thought of it often moves me to tears . 
He tells me sometimes of her excellent mother ; how , upon her death-bed , she had committed her house and children to Charlotte , and had given Charlotte herself in charge to him ; how , since that time , a new spirit had taken possession of her ; how , in care and anxiety for their welfare , she became a real mother to them ; how every moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love in their behalf , -- and yet her mirth and cheerfulness had never forsaken her . 
I walk by his side , pluck flowers by the way , arrange them carefully into a nosegay , then fling them into the first stream I pass , and watch them as they float gently away . 
I forget whether I told you that Albert is to remain here . 
He has received a government appointment , with a very good salary ; and I understand he is in high favour at court . 
I have met few persons so punctual and methodical in business . 
Certainly Albert is the best fellow in the world . 
I had a strange scene with him yesterday . 
I went to take leave of him ; for I took it into my head to spend a few days in these mountains , from where I now write to you . 
As I was walking up and down his room , my eye fell upon his pistols . 
`` Lend me those pistols , '' said I , `` for my journey . '' 
`` By all means , '' he replied , `` if you will take the trouble to load them ; for they only hang there for form . '' 
I took down one of them ; and he continued , `` Ever since I was near suffering for my extreme caution , I will have nothing to do with such things . '' 
I was curious to hear the story . 
`` I was staying , '' said he , `` some three months ago , at a friend 's house in the country . 
I had a brace of pistols with me , unloaded ; and I slept without any anxiety . 
One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself , doing nothing , when it occurred to me I do not know how that the house might be attacked , that we might require the pistols , that we might in short , you know how we go on fancying , when we have nothing better to do . 
I gave the pistols to the servant , to clean and load . 
He was playing with the maid , and trying to frighten her , when the pistol went off -- God knows how ! 
-- the ramrod was in the barrel ; and it went straight through her right hand , and shattered the thumb . 
I had to endure all the lamentation , and to pay the surgeon 's bill ; so , since that time , I have kept all my weapons unloaded . 
But , my dear friend , what is the use of prudence ? 
We can never be on our guard against all possible dangers . 
However , '' -- now , you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to `` however ; '' -- for it is self-evident that every universal rule must have its exceptions . 
But he is so exceedingly accurate , that , if he only fancies he has said a word too precipitate , or too general , or only half true , he never ceases to qualify , to modify , and extenuate , till at last he appears to have said nothing at all . 
Upon this occasion , Albert was deeply immersed in his subject : I ceased to listen to him , and became lost in reverie . 
With a sudden motion , I pointed the mouth of the pistol to my forehead , over the right eye . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
cried Albert , turning back the pistol . 
`` It is not loaded , '' said I. `` And even if not , '' he answered with impatience , `` what can you mean ? 
I can not comprehend how a man can be so mad as to shoot himself , and the bare idea of it shocks me . '' 
`` But why should any one , '' said I , `` in speaking of an action , venture to pronounce it mad or wise , or good or bad ? 
What is the meaning of all this ? 
Have you carefully studied the secret motives of our actions ? 
Do you understand -- can you explain the causes which occasion them , and make them inevitable ? 
If you can , you will be less hasty with your decision . '' 
`` But you will allow , '' said Albert ; `` that some actions are criminal , let them spring from whatever motives they may . '' 
I granted it , and shrugged my shoulders . 
`` But still , my good friend , '' I continued , `` there are some exceptions here too . 
Theft is a crime ; but the man who commits it from extreme poverty , with no design but to save his family from perishing , is he an object of pity , or of punishment ? 
Who shall throw the first stone at a husband , who , in the heat of just resentment , sacrifices his faithless wife and her perfidious seducer ? 
or at the young maiden , who , in her weak hour of rapture , forgets herself in the impetuous joys of love ? 
Even our laws , cold and cruel as they are , relent in such cases , and withhold their punishment . '' 
`` That is quite another thing , '' said Albert ; `` because a man under the influence of violent passion loses all power of reflection , and is regarded as intoxicated or insane . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you people of sound understandings , '' I replied , smiling , `` are ever ready to exclaim ` Extravagance , and madness , and intoxication ! ' 
You moral men are so calm and so subdued ! 
You abhor the drunken man , and detest the extravagant ; you pass by , like the Levite , and thank God , like the Pharisee , that you are not like one of them . 
I have been more than once intoxicated , my passions have always bordered on extravagance : I am not ashamed to confess it ; for I have learned , by my own experience , that all extraordinary men , who have accomplished great and astonishing actions , have ever been decried by the world as drunken or insane . 
And in private life , too , is it not intolerable that no one can undertake the execution of a noble or generous deed , without giving rise to the exclamation that the doer is intoxicated or mad ? 
Shame upon you , ye sages ! '' 
`` This is another of your extravagant humours , '' said Albert : `` you always exaggerate a case , and in this matter you are undoubtedly wrong ; for we were speaking of suicide , which you compare with great actions , when it is impossible to regard it as anything but a weakness . 
It is much easier to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude . '' 
I was on the point of breaking off the conversation , for nothing puts me so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretched commonplace when I am talking from my inmost heart . 
However , I composed myself , for I had often heard the same observation with sufficient vexation ; and I answered him , therefore , with a little warmth , `` You call this a weakness -- beware of being led astray by appearances . 
When a nation , which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant , rises at last and throws off its chains , do you call that weakness ? 
The man who , to rescue his house from the flames , finds his physical strength redoubled , so that he lifts burdens with ease , which , in the absence of excitement , he could scarcely move ; he who , under the rage of an insult , attacks and puts to flight half a score of his enemies , are such persons to be called weak ? 
My good friend , if resistance be strength , how can the highest degree of resistance be a weakness ? '' 
Albert looked steadfastly at me , and said , `` Pray forgive me , but I do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation to the question . '' 
`` Very likely , '' I answered ; `` for I have often been told that my style of illustration borders a little on the absurd . 
But let us see if we can not place the matter in another point of view , by inquiring what can be a man 's state of mind who resolves to free himself from the burden of life , -- a burden often so pleasant to bear , -- for we can not otherwise reason fairly upon the subject . 
`` Human nature , '' I continued , `` has its limits . 
It is able to endure a certain degree of joy , sorrow , and pain , but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded . 
The question , therefore , is , not whether a man is strong or weak , but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings . 
The suffering may be moral or physical ; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys himself , as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever . '' 
`` Paradox , all paradox ! '' 
exclaimed Albert . 
`` Not so paradoxical as you imagine , '' I replied . 
`` You allow that we designate a disease as mortal when nature is so severely attacked , and her strength so far exhausted , that she can not possibly recover her former condition under any change that may take place . 
`` Now , my good friend , apply this to the mind ; observe a man in his natural , isolated condition ; consider how ideas work , and how impressions fasten on him , till at length a violent passion seizes him , destroying all his powers of calm reflection , and utterly ruining him . 
`` It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the condition of such a wretched being , in vain he counsels him . 
He can no more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthy man can instil his strength into the invalid , by whose bedside he is seated . '' 
Albert thought this too general . 
I reminded him of a girl who had drowned herself a short time previously , and I related her history . 
She was a good creature , who had grown up in the narrow sphere of household industry and weekly appointed labour ; one who knew no pleasure beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays , arrayed in her best attire , accompanied by her friends , or perhaps joining in the dance now and then at some festival , and chatting away her spare hours with a neighbour , discussing the scandal or the quarrels of the village , trifles sufficient to occupy her heart . 
At length the warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown wishes . 
Inflamed by the flatteries of men , her former pleasures become by degrees insipid , till at length she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling ; upon him she now rests all her hopes ; she forgets the world around her ; she sees , hears , desires nothing but him , and him only . 
He alone occupies all her thoughts . 
Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervating vanity , her affection moving steadily toward its object , she hopes to become his , and to realise , in an everlasting union with him , all that happiness which she sought , all that bliss for which she longed . 
His repeated promises confirm her hopes : embraces and endearments , which increase the ardour of her desires , overmaster her soul . 
She floats in a dim , delusive anticipation of her happiness ; and her feelings become excited to their utmost tension . 
She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the object of all her wishes and her lover forsakes her . 
Stunned and bewildered , she stands upon a precipice . 
All is darkness around her . 
No prospect , no hope , no consolation -- forsaken by him in whom her existence was centred ! 
She sees nothing of the wide world before her , thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply the void in her heart ; she feels herself deserted , forsaken by the world ; and , blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her soul , she plunges into the deep , to end her sufferings in the broad embrace of death . 
See here , Albert , the history of thousands ; and tell me , is not this a case of physical infirmity ? 
Nature has no way to escape from the labyrinth : her powers are exhausted : she can contend no longer , and the poor soul must die . 
`` Shame upon him who can look on calmly , and exclaim , ` The foolish girl ! 
she should have waited ; she should have allowed time to wear off the impression ; her despair would have been softened , and she would have found another lover to comfort her . ' 
One might as well say , ` The fool , to die of a fever ! 
why did he not wait till his strength was restored , till his blood became calm ? 
all would then have gone well , and he would have been alive now . ' '' 
Albert , who could not see the justice of the comparison , offered some further objections , and , amongst others , urged that I had taken the case of a mere ignorant girl . 
But how any man of sense , of more enlarged views and experience , could be excused , he was unable to comprehend . 
`` My friend ! '' 
I exclaimed , `` man is but man ; and , whatever be the extent of his reasoning powers , they are of little avail when passion rages within , and he feels himself confined by the narrow limits of nature . 
It were better , then -- but we will talk of this some other time , '' I said , and caught up my hat . 
Alas ! 
my heart was full ; and we parted without conviction on either side . 
How rarely in this world do men understand each other ! 
There can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensable as love . 
I observe that Charlotte could not lose me without a pang , and the very children have but one wish ; that is , that I should visit them again to-morrow . 
I went this afternoon to tune Charlotte 's piano . 
But I could not do it , for the little ones insisted on my telling them a story ; and Charlotte herself urged me to satisfy them . 
I waited upon them at tea , and they are now as fully contented with me as with Charlotte ; and I told them my very best tale of the princess who was waited upon by dwarfs . 
I improve myself by this exercise , and am quite surprised at the impression my stories create . 
If I sometimes invent an incident which I forget upon the next narration , they remind one directly that the story was different before ; so that I now endeavour to relate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone , which never changes . 
I find by this , how much an author injures his works by altering them , even though they be improved in a poetical point of view . 
The first impression is readily received . 
We are so constituted that we believe the most incredible things ; and , once they are engraved upon the memory , woe to him who would endeavour to efface them . 
Must it ever be thus , -- that the source of our happiness must also be the fountain of our misery ? 
The full and ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of nature , overwhelming me with a torrent of delight , and which brought all paradise before me , has now become an insupportable torment , a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me . 
When in bygone days I gazed from these rocks upon yonder mountains across the river , and upon the green , flowery valley before me , and saw all nature budding and bursting around ; the hills clothed from foot to peak with tall , thick forest trees ; the valleys in all their varied windings , shaded with the loveliest woods ; and the soft river gliding along amongst the lisping reeds , mirroring the beautiful clouds which the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky , -- when I heard the groves about me melodious with the music of birds , and saw the million swarms of insects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun , whose setting rays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds , whilst the subdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground , and I there observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the dry moss , whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands below me , all this displayed to me the inner warmth which animates all nature , and filled and glowed within my heart . 
I felt myself exalted by this overflowing fulness to the perception of the Godhead , and the glorious forms of an infinite universe became visible to my soul ! 
Stupendous mountains encompassed me , abysses yawned at my feet , and cataracts fell headlong down before me ; impetuous rivers rolled through the plain , and rocks and mountains resounded from afar . 
In the depths of the earth I saw innumerable powers in motion , and multiplying to infinity ; whilst upon its surface , and beneath the heavens , there teemed ten thousand varieties of living creatures . 
Everything around is alive with an infinite number of forms ; while mankind fly for security to their petty houses , from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginations over the wide-extended universe . 
Poor fool ! 
in whose petty estimation all things are little . 
From the inaccessible mountains , across the desert which no mortal foot has trod , far as the confines of the unknown ocean , breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator ; and every atom to which he has given existence finds favour in his sight . 
Ah , how often at that time has the flight of a bird , soaring above my head , inspired me with the desire of being transported to the shores of the immeasurable waters , there to quaff the pleasures of life from the foaming goblet of the Infinite , and to partake , if but for a moment even , with the confined powers of my soul , the beatitude of that Creator who accomplishes all things in himself , and through himself ! 
My dear friend , the bare recollection of those hours still consoles me . 
Even this effort to recall those ineffable sensations , and give them utterance , exalts my soul above itself , and makes me doubly feel the intensity of my present anguish . 
It is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes , and , instead of prospects of eternal life , the abyss of an ever open grave yawned before me . 
Can we say of anything that it exists when all passes away , when time , with the speed of a storm , carries all things onward , -- and our transitory existence , hurried along by the torrent , is either swallowed up by the waves or dashed against the rocks ? 
There is not a moment but preys upon you , -- and upon all around you , not a moment in which you do not yourself become a destroyer . 
The most innocent walk deprives of life thousands of poor insects : one step destroys the fabric of the industrious ant , and converts a little world into chaos . 
No : it is not the great and rare calamities of the world , the floods which sweep away whole villages , the earthquakes which swallow up our towns , that affect me . 
My heart is wasted by the thought of that destructive power which lies concealed in every part of universal nature . 
Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself , and every object near it : so that , surrounded by earth and air , and all the active powers , I wander on my way with aching heart ; and the universe is to me a fearful monster , for ever devouring its own offspring . 
In vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in the morning from my weary slumbers . 
In vain do I seek for her at night in my bed , when some innocent dream has happily deceived me , and placed her near me in the fields , when I have seized her hand and covered it with countless kisses . 
And when I feel for her in the half confusion of sleep , with the happy sense that she is near , tears flow from my oppressed heart ; and , bereft of all comfort , I weep over my future woes . 
What a misfortune , Wilhelm ! 
My active spirits have degenerated into contented indolence . 
I can not be idle , and yet I am unable to set to work . 
I can not think : I have no longer any feeling for the beauties of nature , and books are distasteful to me . 
Once we give ourselves up , we are totally lost . 
Many a time and oft I wish I were a common labourer ; that , awakening in the morning , I might have but one prospect , one pursuit , one hope , for the day which has dawned . 
I often envy Albert when I see him buried in a heap of papers and parchments , and I fancy I should be happy were I in his place . 
Often impressed with this feeling I have been on the point of writing to you and to the minister , for the appointment at the embassy , which you think I might obtain . 
I believe I might procure it . 
The minister has long shown a regard for me , and has frequently urged me to seek employment . 
It is the business of an hour only . 
Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me . 
Weary of liberty , he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled , and was ridden to death for his pains . 
I know not what to determine upon . 
For is not this anxiety for change the consequence of that restless spirit which would pursue me equally in every situation of life ? 
If my ills would admit of any cure , they would certainly be cured here . 
This is my birthday , and early in the morning I received a packet from Albert . 
Upon opening it , I found one of the pink ribbons which Charlotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her , and which I had several times asked her to give me . 
With it were two volumes in duodecimo of Wetstein 's `` Homer , '' a book I had often wished for , to save me the inconvenience of carrying the large Ernestine edition with me upon my walks . 
You see how they anticipate my wishes , how well they understand all those little attentions of friendship , so superior to the costly presents of the great , which are humiliating . 
I kissed the ribbon a thousand times , and in every breath inhaled the remembrance of those happy and irrevocable days which filled me with the keenest joy . 
Such , Wilhelm , is our fate . 
I do not murmur at it : the flowers of life are but visionary . 
How many pass away , and leave no trace behind -- how few yield any fruit -- and the fruit itself , how rarely does it ripen ! 
And yet there are flowers enough ! 
and is it not strange , my friend , that we should suffer the little that does really ripen , to rot , decay , and perish unenjoyed ? 
Farewell ! 
This is a glorious summer . 
I often climb into the trees in Charlotte 's orchard , and shake down the pears that hang on the highest branches . 
She stands below , and catches them as they fall . 
Unhappy being that I am ! 
Why do I thus deceive myself ? 
What is to come of all this wild , aimless , endless passion ? 
I can not pray except to her . 
My imagination sees nothing but her : all surrounding objects are of no account , except as they relate to her . 
In this dreamy state I enjoy many happy hours , till at length I feel compelled to tear myself away from her . 
Ah , Wilhelm , to what does not my heart often compel me ! 
When I have spent several hours in her company , till I feel completely absorbed by her figure , her grace , the divine expression of her thoughts , my mind becomes gradually excited to the highest excess , my sight grows dim , my hearing confused , my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a murderer , and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching senses . 
I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist . 
If in such moments I find no sympathy , and Charlotte does not allow me to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with my tears , I feel compelled to tear myself from her , when I either wander through the country , climb some precipitous cliff , or force a path through the trackless thicket , where I am lacerated and torn by thorns and briers ; and thence I find relief . 
Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground , overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst ; sometimes , late in the night , when the moon shines above me , I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest , to rest my weary limbs , when , exhausted and worn , I sleep till break of day . 
O Wilhelm ! 
the hermit 's cell , his sackcloth , and girdle of thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared with what I suffer . 
Adieu ! 
I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave . 
I must away . 
Thank you , Wilhelm , for determining my wavering purpose . 
For a whole fortnight I have thought of leaving her .
