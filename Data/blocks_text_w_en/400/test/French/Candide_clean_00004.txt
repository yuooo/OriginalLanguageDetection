cried Candide . 
`` What horrors among a people who dance and sing ! 
Is there no way of getting quickly out of this country where monkeys provoke tigers ? 
I have seen no bears in my country , but men I have beheld nowhere except in El Dorado . 
In the name of God , sir , conduct me to Venice , where I am to await Miss Cunegonde . '' 
`` I can conduct you no further than lower Normandy , '' said the officer . 
Immediately he ordered his irons to be struck off , acknowledged himself mistaken , sent away his men , set out with Candide and Martin for Dieppe , and left them in the care of his brother . 
There was then a small Dutch ship in the harbour . 
The Norman , who by the virtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men , put Candide and his attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to set sail for Portsmouth in England . 
This was not the way to Venice , but Candide thought he had made his way out of hell , and reckoned that he would soon have an opportunity for resuming his journey . 
`` Ah , Pangloss ! 
Pangloss ! 
Ah , Martin ! 
Martin ! 
Ah , my dear Cunegonde , what sort of a world is this ? '' 
said Candide on board the Dutch ship . 
`` Something very foolish and abominable , '' said Martin . 
`` You know England ? 
Are they as foolish there as in France ? '' 
`` It is another kind of folly , '' said Martin . 
`` You know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in Canada , and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than Canada is worth . 
To tell you exactly , whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other , is what my imperfect intelligence will not permit . 
I only know in general that the people we are going to see are very atrabilious . '' 
Talking thus they arrived at Portsmouth . 
The coast was lined with crowds of people , whose eyes were fixed on a fine man kneeling , with his eyes bandaged , on board one of the men of war in the harbour . 
Four soldiers stood opposite to this man ; each of them fired three balls at his head , with all the calmness in the world ; and the whole assembly went away very well satisfied . 
`` What is all this ? '' 
said Candide ; `` and what demon is it that exercises his empire in this country ? '' 
He then asked who was that fine man who had been killed with so much ceremony . 
They answered , he was an Admiral . 
`` And why kill this Admiral ? '' 
`` It is because he did not kill a sufficient number of men himself . 
He gave battle to a French Admiral ; and it has been proved that he was not near enough to him . '' 
`` But , '' replied Candide , `` the French Admiral was as far from the English Admiral . '' 
`` There is no doubt of it ; but in this country it is found good , from time to time , to kill one Admiral to encourage the others . '' 
Candide was so shocked and bewildered by what he saw and heard , that he would not set foot on shore , and he made a bargain with the Dutch skipper -LRB- were he even to rob him like the Surinam captain -RRB- to conduct him without delay to Venice . 
The skipper was ready in two days . 
They coasted France ; they passed in sight of Lisbon , and Candide trembled . 
They passed through the Straits , and entered the Mediterranean . 
At last they landed at Venice . 
`` God be praised ! '' 
said Candide , embracing Martin . 
`` It is here that I shall see again my beautiful Cunegonde . 
I trust Cacambo as myself . 
All is well , all will be well , all goes as well as possible . '' 
Upon their arrival at Venice , Candide went to search for Cacambo at every inn and coffee-house , and among all the ladies of pleasure , but to no purpose . 
He sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in . 
But there was no news of Cacambo . 
`` What ! '' 
said he to Martin , `` I have had time to voyage from Surinam to Bordeaux , to go from Bordeaux to Paris , from Paris to Dieppe , from Dieppe to Portsmouth , to coast along Portugal and Spain , to cross the whole Mediterranean , to spend some months , and yet the beautiful Cunegonde has not arrived ! 
Instead of her I have only met a Parisian wench and a Perigordian Abbé . 
Cunegonde is dead without doubt , and there is nothing for me but to die . 
Alas ! 
how much better it would have been for me to have remained in the paradise of El Dorado than to come back to this cursed Europe ! 
You are in the right , my dear Martin : all is misery and illusion . '' 
He fell into a deep melancholy , and neither went to see the opera , nor any of the other diversions of the Carnival ; nay , he was proof against the temptations of all the ladies . 
`` You are in truth very simple , '' said Martin to him , `` if you imagine that a mongrel valet , who has five or six millions in his pocket , will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to Venice . 
If he find her , he will keep her to himself ; if he do not find her he will get another . 
I advise you to forget your valet Cacambo and your mistress Cunegonde . '' 
Martin was not consoling . 
Candide 's melancholy increased ; and Martin continued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness upon earth , except perhaps in El Dorado , where nobody could gain admittance . 
While they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for Cunegonde , Candide saw a young Theatin friar in St. Mark 's Piazza , holding a girl on his arm . 
The Theatin looked fresh coloured , plump , and vigorous ; his eyes were sparkling , his air assured , his look lofty , and his step bold . 
The girl was very pretty , and sang ; she looked amorously at her Theatin , and from time to time pinched his fat cheeks . 
`` At least you will allow me , '' said Candide to Martin , `` that these two are happy . 
Hitherto I have met with none but unfortunate people in the whole habitable globe , except in El Dorado ; but as to this pair , I would venture to lay a wager that they are very happy . '' 
`` I lay you they are not , '' said Martin . 
`` We need only ask them to dine with us , '' said Candide , `` and you will see whether I am mistaken . '' 
Immediately he accosted them , presented his compliments , and invited them to his inn to eat some macaroni , with Lombard partridges , and caviare , and to drink some Montepulciano , Lachrymæ Christi , Cyprus and Samos wine . 
The girl blushed , the Theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him , casting her eyes on Candide with confusion and surprise , and dropping a few tears . 
No sooner had she set foot in Candide 's apartment than she cried out : `` Ah ! 
Mr. Candide does not know Paquette again . '' 
Candide had not viewed her as yet with attention , his thoughts being entirely taken up with Cunegonde ; but recollecting her as she spoke . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said he , `` my poor child , it is you who reduced Doctor Pangloss to the beautiful condition in which I saw him ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
it was I , sir , indeed , '' answered Paquette . 
`` I see that you have heard all . 
I have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell the family of my lady Baroness , and the fair Cunegonde . 
I swear to you that my fate has been scarcely less sad . 
I was very innocent when you knew me . 
A Grey Friar , who was my confessor , easily seduced me . 
The consequences were terrible . 
I was obliged to quit the castle some time after the Baron had sent you away with kicks on the backside . 
If a famous surgeon had not taken compassion on me , I should have died . 
For some time I was this surgeon 's mistress , merely out of gratitude . 
His wife , who was mad with jealousy , beat me every day unmercifully ; she was a fury . 
The surgeon was one of the ugliest of men , and I the most wretched of women , to be continually beaten for a man I did not love . 
You know , sir , what a dangerous thing it is for an ill-natured woman to be married to a doctor . 
Incensed at the behaviour of his wife , he one day gave her so effectual a remedy to cure her of a slight cold , that she died two hours after , in most horrid convulsions . 
The wife 's relations prosecuted the husband ; he took flight , and I was thrown into jail . 
My innocence would not have saved me if I had not been good-looking . 
The judge set me free , on condition that he succeeded the surgeon . 
I was soon supplanted by a rival , turned out of doors quite destitute , and obliged to continue this abominable trade , which appears so pleasant to you men , while to us women it is the utmost abyss of misery . 
I have come to exercise the profession at Venice . 
Ah ! 
sir , if you could only imagine what it is to be obliged to caress indifferently an old merchant , a lawyer , a monk , a gondolier , an abbé , to be exposed to abuse and insults ; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat , only to go and have it raised by a disagreeable man ; to be robbed by one of what one has earned from another ; to be subject to the extortions of the officers of justice ; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age , a hospital , and a dung-hill ; you would conclude that I am one of the most unhappy creatures in the world . '' 
Paquette thus opened her heart to honest Candide , in the presence of Martin , who said to his friend : `` You see that already I have won half the wager . '' 
Friar Giroflée stayed in the dining-room , and drank a glass or two of wine while he was waiting for dinner . 
`` But , '' said Candide to Paquette , `` you looked so gay and content when I met you ; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the Theatin , that you seemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse . '' 
`` Ah ! 
sir , '' answered Paquette , `` this is one of the miseries of the trade . 
Yesterday I was robbed and beaten by an officer ; yet to-day I must put on good humour to please a friar . '' 
Candide wanted no more convincing ; he owned that Martin was in the right . 
They sat down to table with Paquette and the Theatin ; the repast was entertaining ; and towards the end they conversed with all confidence . 
`` Father , '' said Candide to the Friar , `` you appear to me to enjoy a state that all the world might envy ; the flower of health shines in your face , your expression makes plain your happiness ; you have a very pretty girl for your recreation , and you seem well satisfied with your state as a Theatin . '' 
`` My faith , sir , '' said Friar Giroflée , `` I wish that all the Theatins were at the bottom of the sea . 
I have been tempted a hundred times to set fire to the convent , and go and become a Turk . 
My parents forced me at the age of fifteen to put on this detestable habit , to increase the fortune of a cursed elder brother , whom God confound . 
Jealousy , discord , and fury , dwell in the convent . 
It is true I have preached a few bad sermons that have brought me in a little money , of which the prior stole half , while the rest serves to maintain my girls ; but when I return at night to the monastery , I am ready to dash my head against the walls of the dormitory ; and all my fellows are in the same case . '' 
Martin turned towards Candide with his usual coolness . 
`` Well , '' said he , `` have I not won the whole wager ? '' 
Candide gave two thousand piastres to Paquette , and one thousand to Friar Giroflée . 
`` I 'll answer for it , '' said he , `` that with this they will be happy . '' 
`` I do not believe it at all , '' said Martin ; `` you will , perhaps , with these piastres only render them the more unhappy . '' 
`` Let that be as it may , '' said Candide , `` but one thing consoles me . 
I see that we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more ; so that , perhaps , as I have found my red sheep and Paquette , it may well be that I shall also find Cunegonde . '' 
`` I wish , '' said Martin , `` she may one day make you very happy ; but I doubt it very much . '' 
`` You are very hard of belief , '' said Candide . 
`` I have lived , '' said Martin . 
`` You see those gondoliers , '' said Candide , `` are they not perpetually singing ? '' 
`` You do not see them , '' said Martin , `` at home with their wives and brats . 
The Doge has his troubles , the gondoliers have theirs . 
It is true that , all things considered , the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of a Doge ; but I believe the difference to be so trifling that it is not worth the trouble of examining . '' 
`` People talk , '' said Candide , `` of the Senator Pococurante , who lives in that fine palace on the Brenta , where he entertains foreigners in the politest manner . 
They pretend that this man has never felt any uneasiness . '' 
`` I should be glad to see such a rarity , '' said Martin . 
Candide immediately sent to ask the Lord Pococurante permission to wait upon him the next day . 
Candide and Martin went in a gondola on the Brenta , and arrived at the palace of the noble Signor Pococurante . 
The gardens , laid out with taste , were adorned with fine marble statues . 
The palace was beautifully built . 
The master of the house was a man of sixty , and very rich . 
He received the two travellers with polite indifference , which put Candide a little out of countenance , but was not at all disagreeable to Martin . 
First , two pretty girls , very neatly dressed , served them with chocolate , which was frothed exceedingly well . 
Candide could not refrain from commending their beauty , grace , and address . 
`` They are good enough creatures , '' said the Senator . 
`` I make them lie with me sometimes , for I am very tired of the ladies of the town , of their coquetries , of their jealousies , of their quarrels , of their humours , of their pettinesses , of their prides , of their follies , and of the sonnets which one must make , or have made , for them . 
But after all , these two girls begin to weary me . '' 
After breakfast , Candide walking into a long gallery was surprised by the beautiful pictures . 
He asked , by what master were the two first . 
`` They are by Raphael , '' said the Senator . 
`` I bought them at a great price , out of vanity , some years ago . 
They are said to be the finest things in Italy , but they do not please me at all . 
The colours are too dark , the figures are not sufficiently rounded , nor in good relief ; the draperies in no way resemble stuffs . 
In a word , whatever may be said , I do not find there a true imitation of nature . 
I only care for a picture when I think I see nature itself ; and there are none of this sort . 
I have a great many pictures , but I prize them very little . '' 
While they were waiting for dinner Pococurante ordered a concert . 
Candide found the music delicious . 
`` This noise , '' said the Senator , `` may amuse one for half an hour ; but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody , though they durst not own it . 
Music , to-day , is only the art of executing difficult things , and that which is only difficult can not please long . 
Perhaps I should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making of it a monster which shocks me . 
Let who will go to see bad tragedies set to music , where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place , to show off an actress 's voice . 
Let who will , or who can , die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quavering the rôle of Cæsar , or of Cato , and strutting awkwardly upon the stage . 
For my part I have long since renounced those paltry entertainments which constitute the glory of modern Italy , and are purchased so dearly by sovereigns . '' 
Candide disputed the point a little , but with discretion . 
Martin was entirely of the Senator 's opinion . 
They sat down to table , and after an excellent dinner they went into the library . 
Candide , seeing a Homer magnificently bound , commended the virtuoso on his good taste . 
`` There , '' said he , `` is a book that was once the delight of the great Pangloss , the best philosopher in Germany . '' 
`` It is not mine , '' answered Pococurante coolly . 
`` They used at one time to make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him . 
But that continual repetition of battles , so extremely like one another ; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive ; that Helen who is the cause of the war , and who yet scarcely appears in the piece ; that Troy , so long besieged without being taken ; all these together caused me great weariness . 
I have sometimes asked learned men whether they were not as weary as I of that work . 
Those who were sincere have owned to me that the poem made them fall asleep ; yet it was necessary to have it in their library as a monument of antiquity , or like those rusty medals which are no longer of use in commerce . '' 
`` But your Excellency does not think thus of Virgil ? '' 
said Candide . 
`` I grant , '' said the Senator , `` that the second , fourth , and sixth books of his Æneid are excellent , but as for his pious Æneas , his strong Cloanthus , his friend Achates , his little Ascanius , his silly King Latinus , his bourgeois Amata , his insipid Lavinia , I think there can be nothing more flat and disagreeable . 
I prefer Tasso a good deal , or even the soporific tales of Ariosto . '' 
`` May I presume to ask you , sir , '' said Candide , `` whether you do not receive a great deal of pleasure from reading Horace ? '' 
`` There are maxims in this writer , '' answered Pococurante , `` from which a man of the world may reap great benefit , and being written in energetic verse they are more easily impressed upon the memory . 
But I care little for his journey to Brundusium , and his account of a bad dinner , or of his low quarrel between one Rupilius whose words he says were full of poisonous filth , and another whose language was imbued with vinegar . 
I have read with much distaste his indelicate verses against old women and witches ; nor do I see any merit in telling his friend Mæcenas that if he will but rank him in the choir of lyric poets , his lofty head shall touch the stars . 
Fools admire everything in an author of reputation . 
For my part , I read only to please myself . 
I like only that which serves my purpose . '' 
Candide , having been educated never to judge for himself , was much surprised at what he heard . 
Martin found there was a good deal of reason in Pococurante 's remarks . 
`` Oh ! 
here is Cicero , '' said Candide . 
`` Here is the great man whom I fancy you are never tired of reading . '' 
`` I never read him , '' replied the Venetian . 
`` What is it to me whether he pleads for Rabirius or Cluentius ? 
I try causes enough myself ; his philosophical works seem to me better , but when I found that he doubted of everything , I concluded that I knew as much as he , and that I had no need of a guide to learn ignorance . '' 
`` Ha ! 
here are four-score volumes of the Academy of Sciences , '' cried Martin . 
`` Perhaps there is something valuable in this collection . '' 
`` There might be , '' said Pococurante , `` if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins ; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems , and not a single useful thing . '' 
`` And what dramatic works I see here , '' said Candide , `` in Italian , Spanish , and French . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the Senator , `` there are three thousand , and not three dozen of them good for anything . 
As to those collections of sermons , which altogether are not worth a single page of Seneca , and those huge volumes of theology , you may well imagine that neither I nor any one else ever opens them . '' 
Martin saw some shelves filled with English books . 
`` I have a notion , '' said he , `` that a Republican must be greatly pleased with most of these books , which are written with a spirit of freedom . '' 
`` Yes , '' answered Pococurante , `` it is noble to write as one thinks ; this is the privilege of humanity . 
In all our Italy we write only what we do not think ; those who inhabit the country of the Cæsars and the Antoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a Dominican friar . 
I should be pleased with the liberty which inspires the English genius if passion and party spirit did not corrupt all that is estimable in this precious liberty . '' 
Candide , observing a Milton , asked whether he did not look upon this author as a great man . 
`` Who ? '' 
said Pococurante , `` that barbarian , who writes a long commentary in ten books of harsh verse on the first chapter of Genesis ; that coarse imitator of the Greeks , who disfigures the Creation , and who , while Moses represents the Eternal producing the world by a word , makes the Messiah take a great pair of compasses from the armoury of heaven to circumscribe His work ? 
How can I have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled Tasso 's hell and the devil , who transforms Lucifer sometimes into a toad and other times into a pigmy , who makes him repeat the same things a hundred times , who makes him dispute on theology , who , by a serious imitation of Ariosto 's comic invention of firearms , represents the devils cannonading in heaven ? 
Neither I nor any man in Italy could take pleasure in those melancholy extravagances ; and the marriage of Sin and Death , and the snakes brought forth by Sin , are enough to turn the stomach of any one with the least taste , -LSB- and his long description of a pest-house is good only for a grave-digger -RSB- . 
This obscure , whimsical , and disagreeable poem was despised upon its first publication , and I only treat it now as it was treated in its own country by contemporaries . 
For the matter of that I say what I think , and I care very little whether others think as I do . '' 
Candide was grieved at this speech , for he had a respect for Homer and was fond of Milton . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said he softly to Martin , `` I am afraid that this man holds our German poets in very great contempt . '' 
`` There would not be much harm in that , '' said Martin . 
`` Oh ! 
what a superior man , '' said Candide below his breath . 
`` What a great genius is this Pococurante ! 
Nothing can please him . '' 
After their survey of the library they went down into the garden , where Candide praised its several beauties . 
`` I know of nothing in so bad a taste , '' said the master . 
`` All you see here is merely trifling . 
After to-morrow I will have it planted with a nobler design . '' 
`` Well , '' said Candide to Martin when they had taken their leave , `` you will agree that this is the happiest of mortals , for he is above everything he possesses . '' 
`` But do you not see , '' answered Martin , `` that he is disgusted with all he possesses ? 
Plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not the best that reject all sorts of food . '' 
`` But is there not a pleasure , '' said Candide , `` in criticising everything , in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties ? '' 
`` That is to say , '' replied Martin , `` that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure . '' 
`` Well , well , '' said Candide , `` I find that I shall be the only happy man when I am blessed with the sight of my dear Cunegonde . '' 
`` It is always well to hope , '' said Martin . 
However , the days and the weeks passed . 
Cacambo did not come , and Candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that Paquette and Friar Giroflée did not return to thank him . 
One evening that Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn , a man whose complexion was as black as soot , came behind Candide , and taking him by the arm , said : `` Get yourself ready to go along with us ; do not fail . '' 
Upon this he turned round and saw -- Cacambo ! 
Nothing but the sight of Cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more . 
He was on the point of going mad with joy . 
He embraced his dear friend . 
`` Cunegonde is here , without doubt ; where is she ? 
Take me to her that I may die of joy in her company . '' 
`` Cunegonde is not here , '' said Cacambo , `` she is at Constantinople . '' 
`` Oh , heavens ! 
at Constantinople ! 
But were she in China I would fly thither ; let us be off . '' 
`` We shall set out after supper , '' replied Cacambo . 
`` I can tell you nothing more ; I am a slave , my master awaits me , I must serve him at table ; speak not a word , eat , and then get ready . '' 
Candide , distracted between joy and grief , delighted at seeing his faithful agent again , astonished at finding him a slave , filled with the fresh hope of recovering his mistress , his heart palpitating , his understanding confused , sat down to table with Martin , who saw all these scenes quite unconcerned , and with six strangers who had come to spend the Carnival at Venice . 
Cacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers ; towards the end of the entertainment he drew near his master , and whispered in his ear : `` Sire , your Majesty may start when you please , the vessel is ready . '' 
On saying these words he went out . 
The company in great surprise looked at one another without speaking a word , when another domestic approached his master and said to him : `` Sire , your Majesty 's chaise is at Padua , and the boat is ready . '' 
The master gave a nod and the servant went away . 
The company all stared at one another again , and their surprise redoubled . 
A third valet came up to a third stranger , saying : `` Sire , believe me , your Majesty ought not to stay here any longer . 
I am going to get everything ready . '' 
And immediately he disappeared . 
Candide and Martin did not doubt that this was a masquerade of the Carnival . 
Then a fourth domestic said to a fourth master : `` Your Majesty may depart when you please . '' 
Saying this he went away like the rest . 
The fifth valet said the same thing to the fifth master . 
But the sixth valet spoke differently to the sixth stranger , who sat near Candide . 
He said to him : `` Faith , Sire , they will no longer give credit to your Majesty nor to me , and we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night . 
Therefore I will take care of myself . 
Adieu . '' 
The servants being all gone , the six strangers , with Candide and Martin , remained in a profound silence . 
At length Candide broke it . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` this is a very good joke indeed , but why should you all be kings ? 
For me I own that neither Martin nor I is a king . '' 
Cacambo 's master then gravely answered in Italian : `` I am not at all joking . 
My name is Achmet III . 
I was Grand Sultan many years . 
I dethroned my brother ; my nephew dethroned me , my viziers were beheaded , and I am condemned to end my days in the old Seraglio . 
My nephew , the great Sultan Mahmoud , permits me to travel sometimes for my health , and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice . '' 
A young man who sat next to Achmet , spoke then as follows : `` My name is Ivan . 
I was once Emperor of all the Russias , but was dethroned in my cradle . 
My parents were confined in prison and I was educated there ; yet I am sometimes allowed to travel in company with persons who act as guards ; and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice . '' 
The third said : `` I am Charles Edward , King of England ; my father has resigned all his legal rights to me . 
I have fought in defence of them ; and above eight hundred of my adherents have been hanged , drawn , and quartered . 
I have been confined in prison ; I am going to Rome , to pay a visit to the King , my father , who was dethroned as well as myself and my grandfather , and I am come to spend the Carnival at Venice . '' 
The fourth spoke thus in his turn : `` I am the King of Poland ; the fortune of war has stripped me of my hereditary dominions ; my father underwent the same vicissitudes ; I resign myself to Providence in the same manner as Sultan Achmet , the Emperor Ivan , and King Charles Edward , whom God long preserve ; and I am come to the Carnival at Venice . '' 
The fifth said : `` I am King of Poland also ; I have been twice dethroned ; but Providence has given me another country , where I have done more good than all the Sarmatian kings were ever capable of doing on the banks of the Vistula ; I resign myself likewise to Providence , and am come to pass the Carnival at Venice . '' 
It was now the sixth monarch 's turn to speak : `` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I am not so great a prince as any of you ; however , I am a king . 
I am Theodore , elected King of Corsica ; I had the title of Majesty , and now I am scarcely treated as a gentleman . 
I have coined money , and now am not worth a farthing ; I have had two secretaries of state , and now I have scarce a valet ; I have seen myself on a throne , and I have seen myself upon straw in a common jail in London . 
I am afraid that I shall meet with the same treatment here though , like your majesties , I am come to see the Carnival at Venice . '' 
The other five kings listened to this speech with generous compassion . 
Each of them gave twenty sequins to King Theodore to buy him clothes and linen ; and Candide made him a present of a diamond worth two thousand sequins . 
`` Who can this private person be , '' said the five kings to one another , `` who is able to give , and really has given , a hundred times as much as any of us ? '' 
Just as they rose from table , in came four Serene Highnesses , who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war , and were come to spend the Carnival at Venice . 
But Candide paid no regard to these newcomers , his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to Constantinople , in search of his beloved Cunegonde . 
The faithful Cacambo had already prevailed upon the Turkish skipper , who was to conduct the Sultan Achmet to Constantinople , to receive Candide and Martin on his ship . 
They both embarked after having made their obeisance to his miserable Highness . 
`` You see , '' said Candide to Martin on the way , `` we supped with six dethroned kings , and of those six there was one to whom I gave charity . 
Perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate . 
For my part , I have only lost a hundred sheep ; and now I am flying into Cunegonde 's arms . 
My dear Martin , yet once more Pangloss was right : all is for the best . '' 
`` I wish it , '' answered Martin . 
`` But , '' said Candide , `` it was a very strange adventure we met with at Venice . 
It has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn . '' 
`` It is not more extraordinary , '' said Martin , `` than most of the things that have happened to us . 
It is a very common thing for kings to be dethroned ; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company , it is a trifle not worth our attention . '' 
No sooner had Candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old valet and friend Cacambo , and tenderly embraced him . 
`` Well , '' said he , `` what news of Cunegonde ? 
Is she still a prodigy of beauty ? 
Does she love me still ? 
How is she ? 
Thou hast doubtless bought her a palace at Constantinople ? '' 
`` My dear master , '' answered Cacambo , `` Cunegonde washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis , in the service of a prince , who has very few dishes to wash ; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named Ragotsky , to whom the Grand Turk allows three crowns a day in his exile . 
But what is worse still is , that she has lost her beauty and has become horribly ugly . '' 
`` Well , handsome or ugly , '' replied Candide , `` I am a man of honour , and it is my duty to love her still . 
But how came she to be reduced to so abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her ? '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Cacambo , `` was I not to give two millions to Senor Don Fernando d'Ibaraa , y Figueora , y Mascarenes , y Lampourdos , y Souza , Governor of Buenos Ayres , for permitting Miss Cunegonde to come away ? 
And did not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest ? 
Did not this corsair carry us to Cape Matapan , to Milo , to Nicaria , to Samos , to Petra , to the Dardanelles , to Marmora , to Scutari ? 
Cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince I now mentioned to you , and I am slave to the dethroned Sultan . '' 
`` What a series of shocking calamities ! '' 
cried Candide . 
`` But after all , I have some diamonds left ; and I may easily pay Cunegonde 's ransom . 
Yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly . '' 
Then , turning towards Martin : `` Who do you think , '' said he , `` is most to be pitied -- the Sultan Achmet , the Emperor Ivan , King Charles Edward , or I ? '' 
`` How should I know ! '' 
answered Martin . 
`` I must see into your hearts to be able to tell . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Candide , `` if Pangloss were here , he could tell . '' 
`` I know not , '' said Martin , `` in what sort of scales your Pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows . 
All that I can presume to say is , that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than King Charles Edward , the Emperor Ivan , or the Sultan Achmet . '' 
`` That may well be , '' said Candide . 
In a few days they reached the Bosphorus , and Candide began by paying a very high ransom for Cacambo . 
Then without losing time , he and his companions went on board a galley , in order to search on the banks of the Propontis for his Cunegonde , however ugly she might have become . 
Among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly , and to whose bare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull 's pizzle . 
Candide , from a natural impulse , looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen , and approached them with pity . 
Their features though greatly disfigured , had a slight resemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian Baron , brother to Miss Cunegonde . 
This moved and saddened him . 
He looked at them still more attentively . 
`` Indeed , '' said he to Cacambo , `` if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged , and if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron , I should think it was they that were rowing . '' 
At the names of the Baron and of Pangloss , the two galley-slaves uttered a loud cry , held fast by the seat , and let drop their oars . 
The captain ran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull 's pizzle . 
`` Stop ! 
stop ! 
sir , '' cried Candide . 
`` I will give you what money you please . '' 
`` What ! 
it is Candide ! '' 
said one of the slaves . 
`` What ! 
it is Candide ! '' 
said the other . 
`` Do I dream ? '' 
cried Candide ; `` am I awake ? 
or am I on board a galley ? 
Is this the Baron whom I killed ? 
Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw hanged ? '' 
`` It is we ! 
it is we ! '' 
answered they . 
`` Well ! 
is this the great philosopher ? '' 
said Martin . 
`` Ah ! 
captain , '' said Candide , `` what ransom will you take for Monsieur de Thunder-ten-Tronckh , one of the first barons of the empire , and for Monsieur Pangloss , the profoundest metaphysician in Germany ? '' 
`` Dog of a Christian , '' answered the Levantine captain , `` since these two dogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians , which I doubt not are high dignities in their country , you shall give me fifty thousand sequins . '' 
`` You shall have them , sir . 
Carry me back at once to Constantinople , and you shall receive the money directly . 
But no ; carry me first to Miss Cunegonde . '' 
Upon the first proposal made by Candide , however , the Levantine captain had already tacked about , and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air . 
Candide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times . 
`` And how happened it , my dear Baron , that I did not kill you ? 
And , my dear Pangloss , how came you to life again after being hanged ? 
And why are you both in a Turkish galley ? '' 
`` And it is true that my dear sister is in this country ? '' 
said the Baron . 
`` Yes , '' answered Cacambo . 
`` Then I behold , once more , my dear Candide , '' cried Pangloss . 
Candide presented Martin and Cacambo to them ; they embraced each other , and all spoke at once . 
The galley flew ; they were already in the port . 
Instantly Candide sent for a Jew , to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand , though the fellow swore to him by Abraham that he could give him no more . 
He immediately paid the ransom for the Baron and Pangloss . 
The latter threw himself at the feet of his deliverer , and bathed them with his tears ; the former thanked him with a nod , and promised to return him the money on the first opportunity . 
`` But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey ? '' 
said he . 
`` Nothing is more possible , '' said Cacambo , `` since she scours the dishes in the service of a Transylvanian prince . '' 
Candide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds , and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde from slavery . 
`` I ask your pardon once more , '' said Candide to the Baron , `` your pardon , reverend father , for having run you through the body . '' 
`` Say no more about it , '' answered the Baron . 
`` I was a little too hasty , I own , but since you wish to know by what fatality I came to be a galley-slave I will inform you . 
After I had been cured by the surgeon of the college of the wound you gave me , I was attacked and carried off by a party of Spanish troops , who confined me in prison at Buenos Ayres at the very time my sister was setting out thence . 
I asked leave to return to Rome to the General of my Order . 
I was appointed chaplain to the French Ambassador at Constantinople . 
I had not been eight days in this employment when one evening I met with a young Ichoglan , who was a very handsome fellow . 
The weather was warm . 
The young man wanted to bathe , and I took this opportunity of bathing also . 
I did not know that it was a capital crime for a Christian to be found naked with a young Mussulman . 
A cadi ordered me a hundred blows on the soles of the feet , and condemned me to the galleys . 
I do not think there ever was a greater act of injustice . 
But I should be glad to know how my sister came to be scullion to a Transylvanian prince who has taken shelter among the Turks . '' 
`` But you , my dear Pangloss , '' said Candide , `` how can it be that I behold you again ? '' 
`` It is true , '' said Pangloss , `` that you saw me hanged . 
I should have been burnt , but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me ; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire , so I was hanged because they could do no better . 
A surgeon purchased my body , carried me home , and dissected me . 
He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula . 
One could not have been worse hanged than I was . 
The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon , and knew how to burn people marvellously well , but he was not accustomed to hanging . 
The cord was wet and did not slip properly , and besides it was badly tied ; in short , I still drew my breath , when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back , and imagining that he had been dissecting the devil he ran away , dying with fear , and fell down the staircase in his flight . 
His wife , hearing the noise , flew from the next room . 
She saw me stretched out upon the table with my crucial incision . 
She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband , fled , and tumbled over him . 
When they came to themselves a little , I heard the wife say to her husband : ` My dear , how could you take it into your head to dissect a heretic ?
