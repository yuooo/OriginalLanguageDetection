The train , on leaving Sacramento , and passing the junction , Roclin , Auburn , and Colfax , entered the range of the Sierra Nevada . 
` Cisco was reached at seven in the morning ; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car , and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming . 
The railway track wound in and out among the passes , now approaching the mountain-sides , now suspended over precipices , avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves , plunging into narrow defiles , which seemed to have no outlet . 
The locomotive , its great funnel emitting a weird light , with its sharp bell , and its cow-catcher extended like a spur , mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades , and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines . 
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route . 
The railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another . 
The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock , going always northeasterly ; and at midday reached Reno , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast . 
From this point the road , running along Humboldt River , passed northward for several miles by its banks ; then it turned eastward , and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range , nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada . 
Having breakfasted , Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . 
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . 
These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . 
The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear . 
This happened , indeed , to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling . 
About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track . 
The locomotive , slackening its speed , tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher ; but the mass of animals was too great . 
The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait , uttering now and then deafening bellowings . 
There was no use of interrupting them , for , having taken a particular direction , nothing can moderate and change their course ; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain . 
The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms ; but Phileas Fogg , who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry , remained in his seat , and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way . 
Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned , and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them . 
`` What a country ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel ! 
Parbleu ! 
I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme ! 
And here 's an engineer who does n't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts ! '' 
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise . 
He would have crushed the first buffaloes , no doubt , with the cow-catcher ; but the locomotive , however powerful , would soon have been checked , the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track , and would then have been helpless . 
The best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed . 
The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear . 
The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon . 
It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the Humboldt Range , and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah , the region of the Great Salt Lake , the singular colony of the Mormons . 
During the night of the 5th of December , the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles ; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction , towards the Great Salt Lake . 
Passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . 
The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . 
The sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform . 
This personage , who had taken the train at Elko , was tall and dark , with black moustache , black stockings , a black silk hat , a black waistcoat , black trousers , a white cravat , and dogskin gloves . 
He might have been taken for a clergyman . 
He went from one end of the train to the other , and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript . 
Passepartout approached and read one of these notices , which stated that Elder William Hitch , Mormon missionary , taking advantage of his presence on train No. 48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No. 117 , from eleven to twelve o'clock ; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the `` Latter Day Saints '' to attend . 
`` I 'll go , '' said Passepartout to himself . 
He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy , which is its foundation . 
The news quickly spread through the train , which contained about one hundred passengers , thirty of whom , at most , attracted by the notice , ensconced themselves in car No. 117 . 
Passepartout took one of the front seats . 
Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend . 
At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose , and , in an irritated voice , as if he had already been contradicted , said , `` I tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr , that his brother Hiram is a martyr , and that the persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham Young . 
Who dares to say the contrary ? '' 
No one ventured to gainsay the missionary , whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage . 
No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected . 
The government had just succeeded , with some difficulty , in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule . 
It had made itself master of Utah , and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union , after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy . 
The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts , and resisted , by words at least , the authority of Congress . 
Elder Hitch , as is seen , was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains . 
Then , emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures , he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times : how that , in Israel , a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion , and bequeathed them to his son Mormon ; how , many centuries later , a translation of this precious book , which was written in Egyptian , was made by Joseph Smith , junior , a Vermont farmer , who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825 ; and how , in short , the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest , and gave him the annals of the Lord . 
Several of the audience , not being much interested in the missionary 's narrative , here left the car ; but Elder Hitch , continuing his lecture , related how Smith , junior , with his father , two brothers , and a few disciples , founded the church of the `` Latter Day Saints , '' which , adopted not only in America , but in England , Norway and Sweden , and Germany , counts many artisans , as well as men engaged in the liberal professions , among its members ; how a colony was established in Ohio , a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars , and a town built at Kirkland ; how Smith became an enterprising banker , and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians . 
The Elder 's story became somewhat wearisome , and his audience grew gradually less , until it was reduced to twenty passengers . 
But this did not disconcert the enthusiast , who proceeded with the story of Joseph Smith 's bankruptcy in 1837 , and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers ; his reappearance some years afterwards , more honourable and honoured than ever , at Independence , Missouri , the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples , and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles , and retirement into the Far West . 
Ten hearers only were now left , among them honest Passepartout , who was listening with all his ears . 
Thus he learned that , after long persecutions , Smith reappeared in Illinois , and in 1839 founded a community at Nauvoo , on the Mississippi , numbering twenty-five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general-in-chief ; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States ; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at Carthage , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks . 
Passepartout was now the only person left in the car , and the Elder , looking him full in the face , reminded him that , two years after the assassination of Joseph Smith , the inspired prophet , Brigham Young , his successor , left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake , where , in the midst of that fertile region , directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California , the new colony , thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons , had flourished beyond expectations . 
`` And this , '' added Elder William Hitch , `` this is why the jealousy of Congress has been aroused against us ! 
Why have the soldiers of the Union invaded the soil of Utah ? 
Why has Brigham Young , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ? 
Shall we yield to force ? 
Never ! 
Driven from Vermont , driven from Illinois , driven from Ohio , driven from Missouri , driven from Utah , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents . 
And you , my brother , '' continued the Elder , fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor , `` will you not plant yours there , too , under the shadow of our flag ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
replied Passepartout courageously , in his turn retiring from the car , and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy . 
During the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt Lake . 
Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the Dead Sea , and into which flows an American Jordan . 
It is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth . 
The Salt Lake , seventy miles long and thirty-five wide , is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea . 
Quite different from Lake Asphaltite , whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea , it contains considerable salt , and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter , its specific weight being 1,170 , and , after being distilled , 1,000 . 
Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the Jordan , the Weber , and other streams soon perish . 
The country around the lake was well cultivated , for the Mormons are mostly farmers ; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals , fields of wheat , corn , and other cereals , luxuriant prairies , hedges of wild rose , clumps of acacias and milk-wort , would have been seen six months later . 
Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow . 
The train reached Ogden at two o'clock , where it rested for six hours , Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City , connected with Ogden by a branch road ; and they spent two hours in this strikingly American town , built on the pattern of other cities of the Union , like a checker-board , `` with the sombre sadness of right-angles , '' as Victor Hugo expresses it . 
The founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons . 
In this strange country , where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions , everything is done `` squarely '' -- cities , houses , and follies . 
The travellers , then , were promenading , at three o'clock , about the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs of the Wahsatch Range . 
They saw few or no churches , but the prophet 's mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts . 
A clay and pebble wall , built in 1853 , surrounded the town ; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions . 
The place did not seem thickly populated . 
The streets were almost deserted , except in the vicinity of the temple , which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades . 
There were many women , which was easily accounted for by the `` peculiar institution '' of the Mormons ; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists . 
They are free to marry or not , as they please ; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry , as , according to the Mormon religion , maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys . 
These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy . 
Some -- the more well-to-do , no doubt -- wore short , open , black silk dresses , under a hood or modest shawl ; others were habited in Indian fashion . 
Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women , charged , in groups , with conferring happiness on a single Mormon . 
His common sense pitied , above all , the husband . 
It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life , and to conduct them , as it were , in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith , who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place , to all eternity . 
He felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation , and he imagined -- perhaps he was mistaken -- that the fair ones of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person . 
Happily , his stay there was but brief . 
At four the party found themselves again at the station , took their places in the train , and the whistle sounded for starting . 
Just at the moment , however , that the locomotive wheels began to move , cries of `` Stop ! 
stop ! '' 
were heard . 
Trains , like time and tide , stop for no one . 
The gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon . 
He was breathless with running . 
Happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers . 
He rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats . 
Passepartout , who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast , approached him with lively interest , and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene . 
When the Mormon had recovered his breath , Passepartout ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had ; for , from the manner in which he had decamped , it might be thought that he had twenty at least . 
`` One , sir , '' replied the Mormon , raising his arms heavenward -- `` one , and that was enough ! '' 
The train , on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden , passed northward for an hour as far as Weber River , having completed nearly nine hundred miles from San Francisco . 
From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains . 
It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains . 
But the engineers , instead of violating nature , avoided its difficulties by winding around , instead of penetrating the rocks . 
One tunnel only , fourteen thousand feet in length , was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin . 
The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake . 
From this point it described a long curve , descending towards Bitter Creek Valley , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific . 
There were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek , Green Creek , and others , upon culverts . 
Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on , while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region , and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents , and set foot on English soil . 
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station , and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory , following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout . 
The next day , 7th December , they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station . 
Snow had fallen abundantly during the night , but , being mixed with rain , it had half melted , and did not interrupt their progress . 
The bad weather , however , annoyed Passepartout ; for the accumulation of snow , by blocking the wheels of the cars , would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg 's tour . 
`` What an idea ! '' 
he said to himself . 
`` Why did my master make this journey in winter ? 
Could n't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances ? '' 
While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause . 
Several passengers had got off at Green River , and were walking up and down the platforms ; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor , the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting . 
Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery . 
She was attached to the man who , however coldly , gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion . 
She did not comprehend , perhaps , the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her , which she called gratitude , but which , though she was unconscious of it , was really more than that . 
Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired , sooner or later , to call to account for his conduct . 
Chance alone , it was clear , had brought Colonel Proctor on this train ; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary . 
Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen . 
`` That Proctor on this train ! '' 
cried Fix . 
`` Well , reassure yourself , madam ; before he settles with Mr. Fogg ; he has got to deal with me ! 
It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two . '' 
`` And , besides , '' added Passepartout , `` I 'll take charge of him , colonel as he is . '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' resumed Aouda , `` Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him . 
He said that he would come back to America to find this man . 
Should he perceive Colonel Proctor , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results . 
He must not see him . '' 
`` You are right , madam , '' replied Fix ; `` a meeting between them might ruin all . 
Whether he were victorious or beaten , Mr. Fogg would be delayed , and -- '' `` And , '' added Passepartout , `` that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club . 
In four days we shall be in New York . 
Well , if my master does not leave this car during those four days , we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American . 
We must , if possible , prevent his stirring out of it . '' 
The conversation dropped . 
Mr. Fogg had just woke up , and was looking out of the window . 
Soon after Passepartout , without being heard by his master or Aouda , whispered to the detective , `` Would you really fight for him ? '' 
`` I would do anything , '' replied Fix , in a tone which betrayed determined will , `` to get him back living to Europe ! '' 
Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame , but his confidence in his master remained unbroken . 
Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car , to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel ? 
It ought not to be a difficult task , since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious . 
The detective , at least , seemed to have found a way ; for , after a few moments , he said to Mr. Fogg , `` These are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway . '' 
`` Yes , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` but they pass . '' 
`` You were in the habit of playing whist , '' resumed Fix , `` on the steamers . '' 
`` Yes ; but it would be difficult to do so here . 
I have neither cards nor partners . '' 
`` Oh , but we can easily buy some cards , for they are sold on all the American trains . 
And as for partners , if madam plays -- '' `` Certainly , sir , '' Aouda quickly replied ; `` I understand whist . 
It is part of an English education . '' 
`` I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game . 
Well , here are three of us , and a dummy -- '' `` As you please , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway . 
Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth . 
The game commenced . 
Aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg . 
As for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent . 
`` Now , '' thought Passepartout , `` we 've got him . 
He wo n't budge . '' 
At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass , seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains . 
After going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road . 
On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the North Platte River , already appeared . 
The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains , the highest being Laramie Peak . 
Between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . 
On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River , one of the great tributaries of the Missouri . 
At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed . 
There was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . 
The snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . 
Large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . 
No wild beast appeared on the plain . 
It was a desert in its vast nakedness . 
After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , Mr. Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped . 
Passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view . 
Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , `` See what is the matter . '' 
Passepartout rushed out of the car . 
Thirty or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor . 
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way . 
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man , whom the station-master at Medicine Bow , the next stopping place , had sent on before . 
The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion , in which Colonel Proctor , with his insolent manner , was conspicuous . 
Passepartout , joining the group , heard the signal-man say , `` No ! 
you ca n't pass . 
The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky , and would not bear the weight of the train . '' 
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were . 
According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage . 
He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge . 
It may be taken for granted that , rash as the Americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it . 
Passepartout , not daring to apprise his master of what he heard , listened with set teeth , immovable as a statue . 
`` Hum ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor ; `` but we are not going to stay here , I imagine , and take root in the snow ? '' 
`` Colonel , '' replied the conductor , `` we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train , but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less than six hours . '' 
`` Six hours ! '' 
cried Passepartout . 
`` Certainly , '' returned the conductor , `` besides , it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot . '' 
`` But it is only a mile from here , '' said one of the passengers . 
`` Yes , but it 's on the other side of the river . '' 
`` And ca n't we cross that in a boat ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` That 's impossible . 
The creek is swelled by the rains . 
It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford . '' 
The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor ; and Passepartout , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him . 
Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his master 's banknotes could not remove . 
There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow . 
They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game . 
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true Yankee , named Forster called out , `` Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over . '' 
`` On the bridge ? '' 
asked a passenger . 
`` On the bridge . '' 
`` With our train ? '' 
`` With our train . '' 
Passepartout stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer . 
`` But the bridge is unsafe , '' urged the conductor . 
`` No matter , '' replied Forster ; `` I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
muttered Passepartout . 
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer 's proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one . 
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam ; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer 's mind . 
`` We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , '' said one . 
`` Eighty ! 
ninety ! '' 
Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American . 
`` Besides , '' thought he , `` there 's a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people ! 
Sir , '' said he aloud to one of the passengers , `` the engineer 's plan seems to me a little dangerous , but -- '' `` Eighty chances ! '' 
replied the passenger , turning his back on him . 
`` I know it , '' said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , `` but a simple idea -- '' `` Ideas are no use , '' returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , `` as the engineer assures us that we can pass . '' 
`` Doubtless , '' urged Passepartout , `` we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent -- '' `` What ! 
Prudent ! '' 
cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . 
`` At full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! '' 
`` I know -- I see , '' repeated Passepartout ; `` but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural -- '' `` Who ! 
What ! 
What 's the matter with this fellow ? '' 
cried several . 
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself . 
`` Are you afraid ? '' 
asked Colonel Proctor . 
`` I afraid ? 
Very well ; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they ! '' 
`` All aboard ! '' 
cried the conductor . 
`` Yes , all aboard ! '' 
repeated Passepartout , and immediately . 
`` But they ca n't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after ! '' 
But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice . 
The passengers resumed their places in the cars . 
Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed . 
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game . 
The locomotive whistled vigorously ; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap . 
Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second . 
They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all . 
And they passed over ! 
It was like a flash . 
No one saw the bridge . 
The train leaped , so to speak , from one bank to the other , and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station . 
But scarcely had the train passed the river , when the bridge , completely ruined , fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow . 
The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing Fort Saunders , crossing Cheyne Pass , and reaching Evans Pass . 
The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey , eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea . 
The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains , levelled by nature . 
A branch of the `` grand trunk '' led off southward to Denver , the capital of Colorado . 
The country round about is rich in gold and silver , and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there . 
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco , in three days and three nights ; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York . 
Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand . 
During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left ; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado . 
They entered Nebraska at eleven , passed near Sedgwick , and touched at Julesburg , on the southern branch of the Platte River . 
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , General Dodge . 
Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train . 
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist . 
The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than Amphion 's lyre , was about to bid them rise from American soil . 
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha . 
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River , on its left bank . 
At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha . 
The one hundred and first meridian was passed . 
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game ; no one -- not even the dummy -- complained of the length of the trip . 
Fix had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose ; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg . 
During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman . 
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands . 
Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , `` I should play a diamond . '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix raised their heads , and beheld Colonel Proctor . 
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , is it , Englishman ? '' 
cried the colonel ; `` it 's you who are going to play a spade ! '' 
`` And who plays it , '' replied Phileas Fogg coolly , throwing down the ten of spades . 
`` Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , '' replied Colonel Proctor , in an insolent tone . 
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , `` You do n't understand anything about whist . '' 
`` Perhaps I do , as well as another , '' said Phileas Fogg , rising . 
`` You have only to try , son of John Bull , '' replied the colonel . 
Aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold . 
She seized Mr. Fogg 's arm and gently pulled him back . 
Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American , who was staring insolently at his opponent . 
But Fix got up , and , going to Colonel Proctor said , `` You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck ! '' 
`` Mr. Fix , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only . 
The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it . '' 
`` When and where you will , '' replied the American , `` and with whatever weapon you choose . '' 
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his . 
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . 
Phileas Fogg left the car , and the American followed him upon the platform . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to his adversary , `` I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . '' 
`` Well , what 's that to me ? '' 
replied Colonel Proctor . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg , very politely , `` after our meeting at San Francisco , I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England . '' 
`` Really ! '' 
`` Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ? '' 
`` Why not ten years hence ? '' 
`` I say six months , '' returned Phileas Fogg ; `` and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly . '' 
`` All this is an evasion , '' cried Stamp Proctor . 
`` Now or never ! '' 
`` Very good . 
You are going to New York ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Chicago ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` To Omaha ? '' 
`` What difference is it to you ? 
Do you know Plum Creek ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
`` It 's the next station . 
The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes . 
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I will stop at Plum Creek . '' 
`` And I guess you 'll stay there too , '' added the American insolently . 
`` Who knows ? '' 
replied Mr. Fogg , returning to the car as coolly as usual . 
He began to reassure Aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse . 
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness . 
At eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station . 
Mr. Fogg rose , and , followed by Fix , went out upon the platform . 
Passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . 
Aouda remained in the car , as pale as death . 
The door of the next car opened , and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second . 
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , `` You ca n't get off , gentlemen ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
asked the colonel . 
`` We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop . '' 
`` But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman . '' 
`` I am sorry , '' said the conductor ; `` but we shall be off at once . 
There 's the bell ringing now . '' 
The train started . 
`` I 'm really very sorry , gentlemen , '' said the conductor . 
`` Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you . 
But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ? '' 
`` That would n't be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , '' said the colonel , in a jeering tone . 
`` It would be perfectly so , '' replied Phileas Fogg . 
`` Well , we are really in America , '' thought Passepartout , `` and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order ! '' 
So muttering , he followed his master . 
The two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train . 
The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle . 
The passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform . 
The car , which was some fifty feet long , was very convenient for their purpose . 
The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle , and fire at their ease . 
Never was duel more easily arranged . 
Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor , each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers , entered the car . 
The seconds , remaining outside , shut them in . 
They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive . 
After an interval of two minutes , what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car . 
Nothing could be more simple . 
Indeed , it was all so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack . 
They were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were . 
The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train . 
Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars . 
Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg , revolvers in hand , hastily quitted their prison , and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous . 
They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux . 
This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians , for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road . 
A hundred of them had , according to their habit , jumped upon the steps without stopping the train , with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop . 
The Sioux were armed with guns , from which came the reports , to which the passengers , who were almost all armed , responded by revolver-shots . 
The Indians had first mounted the engine , and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets . 
A Sioux chief , wishing to stop the train , but not knowing how to work the regulator , had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve , and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity . 
The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars , skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs , thrusting open the doors , and fighting hand to hand with the passengers . 
Penetrating the baggage-car , they pillaged it , throwing the trunks out of the train . 
The cries and shots were constant . 
The travellers defended themselves bravely ; some of the cars were barricaded , and sustained a siege , like moving forts , carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour . 
Aouda behaved courageously from the first . 
She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver , which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance . 
Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground , and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms . 
Several passengers , shot or stunned , lay on the seats . 
It was necessary to put an end to the struggle , which had lasted for ten minutes , and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped . 
Fort Kearney station , where there was a garrison , was only two miles distant ; but , that once passed , the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond . 
The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg , when he was shot and fell . 
At the same moment he cried , `` Unless the train is stopped in five minutes , we are lost ! '' 
`` It shall be stopped , '' said Phileas Fogg , preparing to rush from the car . 
`` Stay , monsieur , '' cried Passepartout ; `` I will go . '' 
Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the Indians , succeeded in slipping under the car ; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train . 
There , suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender , with the other he loosened the safety chains ; but , owing to the traction , he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar , had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out . 
The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed . 
Carried on by the force already acquired , the train still moved for several minutes ; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped , less than a hundred feet from Kearney station . 
The soldiers of the fort , attracted by the shots , hurried up ; the Sioux had not expected them , and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped . 
But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing ; among others the courageous Frenchman , whose devotion had just saved them . 
Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared . 
Had they been killed in the struggle ? 
Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux ? 
It was impossible to tell .
