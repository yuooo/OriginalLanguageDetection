An English criminal , you know , is always better concealed in London than anywhere else . '' 
This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office . 
Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia . 
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . 
But Fix 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia . 
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer . 
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road . 
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay . 
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . 
Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . 
Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . 
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard . 
`` Is this your passport ? '' 
asked he . 
`` No , it 's my master 's . '' 
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . '' 
`` But he must go to the consul 's in person , so as to establish his identity . '' 
`` Oh , is that necessary ? '' 
`` Quite indispensable . '' 
`` And where is the consulate ? '' 
`` There , on the corner of the square , '' said Fix , pointing to a house two hundred steps off . 
`` I 'll go and fetch my master , who wo n't be much pleased , however , to be disturbed . '' 
The passenger bowed to Fix , and returned to the steamer . 
The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consul 's office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official . 
`` Consul , '' said he , without preamble , `` I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia . '' 
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport . 
`` Well , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul , `` I shall not be sorry to see the rascal 's face ; but perhaps he wo n't come here -- that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be . 
A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . '' 
`` If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come . '' 
`` To have his passport visaed ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues . 
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do ; but I hope you will not visa the passport . '' 
`` Why not ? 
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse . '' 
`` Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London . '' 
`` Ah , that 's your look-out . 
But I can not -- '' The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay . 
The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it . 
The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst Fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room . 
`` You are Mr. Phileas Fogg ? '' 
said the consul , after reading the passport . 
`` I am . '' 
`` And this man is your servant ? '' 
`` He is : a Frenchman , named Passepartout . '' 
`` You are from London ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And you are going -- '' `` To Bombay . '' 
`` Very good , sir . 
You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? '' 
`` I know it , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg ; `` but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by Suez . '' 
`` Very well , sir . '' 
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal . 
Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant . 
`` Well ? '' 
queried the detective . 
`` Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , '' replied the consul . 
`` Possibly ; but that is not the question . 
Do you think , consul , that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ? '' 
`` I concede that ; but then , you know , all descriptions -- '' `` I 'll make certain of it , '' interrupted Fix . 
`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a Frenchman , and ca n't help talking . 
Excuse me for a little while , consul . '' 
Fix started off in search of Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin . 
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` Left Paris , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` Left Turin , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158 + ; or , in days , six days and a half . '' 
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . 
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . 
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . 
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics . 
Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything . 
`` Well , my friend , '' said the detective , coming up with him , `` is your passport visaed ? '' 
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? '' 
responded Passepartout . 
`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . '' 
`` And you are looking about you ? '' 
`` Yes ; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream . 
So this is Suez ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` In Egypt ? '' 
`` Certainly , in Egypt . '' 
`` And in Africa ? '' 
`` In Africa . '' 
`` In Africa ! '' 
repeated Passepartout . 
`` Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris ; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the Northern and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain ! 
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees ! '' 
`` You are in a great hurry , then ? '' 
`` I am not , but my master is . 
By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts . 
We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag . '' 
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . '' 
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . '' 
And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along . 
`` Above all , '' said he ; `` do n't let me lose the steamer . '' 
`` You have plenty of time ; it 's only twelve o'clock . '' 
Passepartout pulled out his big watch . 
`` Twelve ! '' 
he exclaimed ; `` why , it 's only eight minutes before ten . '' 
`` Your watch is slow . '' 
`` My watch ? 
A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather ! 
It does n't vary five minutes in the year . 
It 's a perfect chronometer , look you . '' 
`` I see how it is , '' said Fix . 
`` You have kept London time , which is two hours behind that of Suez . 
You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country . '' 
`` I regulate my watch ? 
Never ! '' 
`` Well , then , it will not agree with the sun . '' 
`` So much the worse for the sun , monsieur . 
The sun will be wrong , then ! '' 
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture . 
After a few minutes silence , Fix resumed : `` You left London hastily , then ? '' 
`` I rather think so ! 
Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening , Monsieur Fogg came home from his club , and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off . '' 
`` But where is your master going ? '' 
`` Always straight ahead . 
He is going round the world . '' 
`` Round the world ? '' 
cried Fix . 
`` Yes , and in eighty days ! 
He says it is on a wager ; but , between us , I do n't believe a word of it . 
That would n't be common sense . 
There 's something else in the wind . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Mr. Fogg is a character , is he ? '' 
`` I should say he was . '' 
`` Is he rich ? '' 
`` No doubt , for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him . 
And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time . '' 
`` And you have known your master a long time ? '' 
`` Why , no ; I entered his service the very day we left London . '' 
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . 
The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed Fix in his theory . 
He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in London , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . 
Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez , but was really going on to Bombay . 
`` Is Bombay far from here ? '' 
asked Passepartout . 
`` Pretty far . 
It is a ten days ' voyage by sea . '' 
`` And in what country is Bombay ? '' 
`` India . '' 
`` In Asia ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` The deuce ! 
I was going to tell you there 's one thing that worries me -- my burner ! '' 
`` What burner ? '' 
`` My gas-burner , which I forgot to turn off , and which is at this moment burning at my expense . 
I have calculated , monsieur , that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours , exactly sixpence more than I earn ; and you will understand that the longer our journey -- '' Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout 's trouble about the gas ? 
It is not probable . 
He was not listening , but was cogitating a project . 
Passepartout and he had now reached the shop , where Fix left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate . 
Now that he was fully convinced , Fix had quite recovered his equanimity . 
`` Consul , '' said he , `` I have no longer any doubt . 
I have spotted my man . 
He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days . '' 
`` Then he 's a sharp fellow , '' returned the consul , `` and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track . '' 
`` We 'll see about that , '' replied Fix . 
`` But are you not mistaken ? '' 
`` I am not mistaken . '' 
`` Why was this robber so anxious to prove , by the visa , that he had passed through Suez ? '' 
`` Why ? 
I have no idea ; but listen to me . '' 
He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout . 
`` In short , '' said the consul , `` appearances are wholly against this man . 
And what are you going to do ? '' 
`` Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay , take passage on board the Mongolia , follow my rogue to India , and there , on English ground , arrest him politely , with my warrant in my hand , and my hand on his shoulder . '' 
Having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office . 
A quarter of an hour later found Fix , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the Mongolia ; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea . 
The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles , and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it . 
The Mongolia , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time . 
The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay , others for Calcutta by way of Bombay , the nearest route thither , now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula . 
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades , the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops , and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company : for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds , brigadiers , 2,400 pounds , and generals of divisions , 4,000 pounds . 
What with the military men , a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels , and the hospitable efforts of the purser , the time passed quickly on the Mongolia . 
The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and the eight o'clock supper , and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day ; and the hours were whirled away , when the sea was tranquil , with music , dancing , and games . 
But the Red Sea is full of caprice , and often boisterous , like most long and narrow gulfs . 
When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia , with her long hull , rolled fearfully . 
Then the ladies speedily disappeared below ; the pianos were silent ; singing and dancing suddenly ceased . 
Yet the good ship ploughed straight on , unretarded by wind or wave , towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb . 
What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time ? 
It might be thought that , in his anxiety , he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind , the disorderly raging of the billows -- every chance , in short , which might force the Mongolia to slacken her speed , and thus interrupt his journey . 
But , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . 
Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . 
How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia ? 
He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself . 
A tax-collector , on the way to his post at Goa ; the Rev. Decimus Smith , returning to his parish at Bombay ; and a brigadier-general of the English army , who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares , made up the party , and , with Mr. Fogg , played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence . 
As for Passepartout , he , too , had escaped sea-sickness , and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin . 
He rather enjoyed the voyage , for he was well fed and well lodged , took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing , and consoled himself with the delusion that his master 's whim would end at Bombay . 
He was pleased , on the day after leaving Suez , to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays . 
`` If I am not mistaken , '' said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , `` you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I quite recognise you . 
You are the servant of the strange Englishman -- '' `` Just so , monsieur -- '' `` Fix . '' 
`` Monsieur Fix , '' resumed Passepartout , `` I 'm charmed to find you on board . 
Where are you bound ? '' 
`` Like you , to Bombay . '' 
`` That 's capital ! 
Have you made this trip before ? '' 
`` Several times . 
I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company . '' 
`` Then you know India ? '' 
`` Why yes , '' replied Fix , who spoke cautiously . 
`` A curious place , this India ? '' 
`` Oh , very curious . 
Mosques , minarets , temples , fakirs , pagodas , tigers , snakes , elephants ! 
I hope you will have ample time to see the sights . '' 
`` I hope so , Monsieur Fix . 
You see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days ! 
No ; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at Bombay . '' 
`` And Mr. Fogg is getting on well ? '' 
asked Fix , in the most natural tone in the world . 
`` Quite well , and I too . 
I eat like a famished ogre ; it 's the sea air . '' 
`` But I never see your master on deck . '' 
`` Never ; he has n't the least curiosity . '' 
`` Do you know , Mr. Passepartout , that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand -- perhaps a diplomatic mission ? '' 
`` Faith , Monsieur Fix , I assure you I know nothing about it , nor would I give half a crown to find out . '' 
After this meeting , Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together , the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man 's confidence . 
He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room , which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity , mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows . 
Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly ; on the 13th , Mocha , surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing , was sighted , and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields . 
Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place , and thought that , with its circular walls and dismantled fort , it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer . 
The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears , and the next day they put in at Steamer Point , north-west of Aden harbour , to take in coal . 
This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines ; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year . 
In these distant seas , coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton . 
The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up . 
But this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect Phileas Fogg 's programme ; besides , the Mongolia , instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours . 
Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed ; Fix , unobserved , followed them . 
The visa procured , Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while Passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis , Banyans , Parsees , Jews , Arabs , and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden . 
He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean , and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon . 
`` Very curious , very curious , '' said Passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer . 
`` I see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . '' 
At six p.m. the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead , and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean . 
She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay , and the sea was favourable , the wind being in the north-west , and all sails aiding the engine . 
The steamer rolled but little , the ladies , in fresh toilets , reappeared on deck , and the singing and dancing were resumed . 
The trip was being accomplished most successfully , and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix . 
On Sunday , October 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the Indian coast : two hours later the pilot came on board . 
A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view . 
The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay . 
Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage , and his partner and himself having , by a bold stroke , captured all thirteen of the tricks , concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory . 
The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd ; she arrived on the 20th . 
This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from London , and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary , in the column of gains . 
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called India , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls . 
The British Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta , governors at Madras , Bombay , and in Bengal , and a lieutenant-governor at Agra . 
But British India , properly so called , only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles , and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants . 
A considerable portion of India is still free from British authority ; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent . 
The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756 , when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras , down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection . 
It gradually annexed province after province , purchasing them of the native chiefs , whom it seldom paid , and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates , civil and military . 
But the East India Company has now passed away , leaving the British possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown . 
The aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . 
Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days . 
This railway does not run in a direct line across India . 
The distance between Bombay and Calcutta , as the bird flies , is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles ; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third . 
The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows : Leaving Bombay , it passes through Salcette , crossing to the continent opposite Tannah , goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts , runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor , skirts the nearly independent territory of Bundelcund , ascends to Allahabad , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the Ganges at Benares , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor , has its terminus at Calcutta . 
The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four p.m. ; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta . 
Mr. Fogg , after bidding good-bye to his whist partners , left the steamer , gave his servant several errands to do , urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight , and , with his regular step , which beat to the second , like an astronomical clock , directed his steps to the passport office . 
As for the wonders of Bombay -- its famous city hall , its splendid library , its forts and docks , its bazaars , mosques , synagogues , its Armenian churches , and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill , with its two polygonal towers -- he cared not a straw to see them . 
He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta , or the mysterious hypogea , concealed south-east from the docks , or those fine remains of Buddhist architecture , the Kanherian grottoes of the island of Salcette . 
Having transacted his business at the passport office , Phileas Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station , where he ordered dinner . 
Among the dishes served up to him , the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of `` native rabbit , '' on which he prided himself . 
Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish , but , despite its spiced sauce , found it far from palatable . 
He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , `` Is this rabbit , sir ? '' 
`` Yes , my lord , '' the rogue boldly replied , `` rabbit from the jungles . '' 
`` And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed ? '' 
`` Mew , my lord ! 
What , a rabbit mew ! 
I swear to you -- '' `` Be so good , landlord , as not to swear , but remember this : cats were formerly considered , in India , as sacred animals . 
That was a good time . '' 
`` For the cats , my lord ? '' 
`` Perhaps for the travellers as well ! '' 
After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner . 
Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg , and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police . 
He made himself known as a London detective , told his business at Bombay , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London . 
It had not reached the office ; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive . 
Fix was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police . 
This the director refused , as the matter concerned the London office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant . 
Fix did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document ; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay . 
He did not doubt for a moment , any more than Passepartout , that Phileas Fogg would remain there , at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive . 
Passepartout , however , had no sooner heard his master 's orders on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris , and that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta , and perhaps beyond that place . 
He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest , and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him , despite his love of repose , around the world in eighty days ! 
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes , he took a leisurely promenade about the streets , where crowds of people of many nationalities -- Europeans , Persians with pointed caps , Banyas with round turbans , Sindes with square bonnets , Parsees with black mitres , and long-robed Armenians -- were collected . 
It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival . 
These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster -- the most thrifty , civilised , intelligent , and austere of the East Indians , among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay -- were celebrating a sort of religious carnival , with processions and shows , in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls , clothed in rose-coloured gauze , looped up with gold and silver , danced airily , but with perfect modesty , to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines . 
It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth , and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable . 
Unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . 
At last , having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior . 
He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door . 
It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions . 
Passepartout , however , thinking no harm , went in like a simple tourist , and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes , when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging . 
He looked up to behold three enraged priests , who forthwith fell upon him ; tore off his shoes , and began to beat him with loud , savage exclamations . 
The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes ; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets . 
At five minutes before eight , Passepartout , hatless , shoeless , and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes , rushed breathlessly into the station . 
Fix , who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay , was there , upon the platform . 
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta , and farther , if necessary . 
Passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg . 
`` I hope that this will not happen again , '' said Phileas Fogg coldly , as he got into the train . 
Poor Passepartout , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word . 
Fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan . 
`` No , I 'll stay , '' muttered he . 
`` An offence has been committed on Indian soil . 
I 've got my man . '' 
Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night . 
The train had started punctually . 
Among the passengers were a number of officers , Government officials , and opium and indigo merchants , whose business called them to the eastern coast . 
Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master , and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them . 
This was Sir Francis Cromarty , one of Mr. Fogg 's whist partners on the Mongolia , now on his way to join his corps at Benares . 
Sir Francis was a tall , fair man of fifty , who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt . 
He made India his home , only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals ; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs , history , and character of India and its people . 
But Phileas Fogg , who was not travelling , but only describing a circumference , took no pains to inquire into these subjects ; he was a solid body , traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe , according to the laws of rational mechanics . 
He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London , and , had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration , would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction . 
Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion -- although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards , and between two rubbers -- and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior , and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature . 
The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that , of all the eccentric persons he had ever met , none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences . 
Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . 
In the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else . 
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the Island of Salcette , and had got into the open country . 
At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah ; and , passing Pauwell , they entered the defiles of the mountains , with their basalt bases , and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests . 
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time , and now Sir Francis , reviving the conversation , observed , `` Some years ago , Mr. Fogg , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager . '' 
`` How so , Sir Francis ? '' 
`` Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah , on the other side . '' 
`` Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles . '' 
`` But , Mr. Fogg , '' pursued Sir Francis , `` you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow 's adventure at the pagoda . '' 
Passepartout , his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket , was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him . 
`` The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence . 
It takes particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected , and if your servant were caught -- '' `` Very well , Sir Francis , '' replied Mr. Fogg ; `` if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to Europe . 
I do n't see how this affair could have delayed his master . '' 
The conversation fell again . 
During the night the train left the mountains behind , and passed Nassik , and the next day proceeded over the flat , well-cultivated country of the Khandeish , with its straggling villages , above which rose the minarets of the pagodas . 
This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams , mostly tributaries of the Godavery . 
Passepartout , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train . 
The locomotive , guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis -LRB- sort of abandoned monasteries -RRB- , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture . 
Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train ; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed . 
The travellers crossed , beyond Milligaum , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali . 
Not far off rose Ellora , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous Aurungabad , capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam . 
It was thereabouts that Feringhea , the Thuggee chief , king of the stranglers , held his sway . 
These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death , without ever shedding blood ; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction . 
The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders , though the Thuggees still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites . 
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet . 
The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty , which empties into the Gulf of Cambray , near Surat . 
Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . 
Up to his arrival at Bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . 
His old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . 
He came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . 
Already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . 
He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . 
Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer . 
The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway . 
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains , which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund , towards evening . 
The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . 
This famous timepiece , always regulated on the Greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . 
Sir Francis corrected Passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at London time . 
It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one . 
The train stopped , at eight o'clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal , where there were several bungalows , and workmen 's cabins . 
The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , `` Passengers will get out here ! '' 
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias . 
Passepartout , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying : `` Monsieur , no more railway ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` I mean to say that the train is n't going on . '' 
The general at once stepped out , while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` At the hamlet of Kholby . '' 
`` Do we stop here ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
The railway is n't finished . '' 
`` What ! 
not finished ? '' 
`` No . 
There 's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad , where the line begins again . '' 
`` But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout . '' 
`` What would you have , officer ? 
The papers were mistaken . '' 
`` Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta , '' retorted Sir Francis , who was growing warm . 
`` No doubt , '' replied the conductor ; `` but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad . '' 
Sir Francis was furious . 
Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down , and did not dare to look at his master . 
`` Sir Francis , '' said Mr. Fogg quietly , `` we will , if you please , look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage . '' 
`` No , Sir Francis ; it was foreseen . '' 
`` What ! 
You knew that the way -- '' `` Not at all ; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route . 
Nothing , therefore , is lost . 
I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice . 
A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon , on the 25th . 
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach Calcutta in time . '' 
There was nothing to say to so confident a response . 
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . 
The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . 
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything . 
`` I shall go afoot , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
Passepartout , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail Indian shoes . 
Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moment 's hesitation , said , `` Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` An elephant ! 
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . '' 
`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question . 
An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure . 
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
