That is the history of our call . 
Well , he has seen his daughter at any rate . 
How he can refuse to acknowledge her I can not think , for they are as alike as two peas . '' 
The boarders dropped in one after another , interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty . 
Dulness is their prevailing ingredient , and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture . 
This kind of argot is always changing . 
The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event , an incident in the police courts , a street song , or a bit of burlesque at some theatre , and forgotten in a month . 
Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas . 
The diorama , a recent invention , which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas , had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama . 
The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders . 
`` Well , Monsieur-r-r Poiret , '' said the employe from the Museum , `` how is your health-orama ? '' 
Then , without waiting for an answer , he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a `` Ladies , you seem melancholy . '' 
`` Is dinner ready ? '' 
cried Horace Bianchon , a medical student , and a friend of Rastignac 's ; `` my stomach is sinking usque ad talones . '' 
`` There is an uncommon frozerama outside , '' said Vautrin . 
`` Make room there , Father Goriot ! 
Confound it , your foot covers the whole front of the stove . '' 
`` Illustrious M. Vautrin , '' put in Bianchon , `` why do you say frozerama ? 
It is incorrect ; it should be frozenrama . '' 
`` No , it should n't , '' said the official from the Museum ; '' frozerama is right by the same rule that you say ` My feet are froze . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
`` Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac , Doctor of the Law of Contraries , '' cried Bianchon , seizing Eugene by the throat , and almost throttling him . 
`` Hallo there ! 
hallo ! '' 
Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in , bowed to the rest of the party , and took her place beside the three women without saying a word . 
`` That old bat always makes me shudder , '' said Bianchon in a low voice , indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin . 
`` I have studied Gall 's system , and I am sure she has the bump of Judas . '' 
`` Then you have seen a case before ? '' 
said Vautrin . 
`` Who has not ? '' 
answered Bianchon . 
`` Upon my word , that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through , give them time enough . '' 
`` That is the way , young man , '' returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers : `` The rose has lived the life of a rose -- A morning 's space . '' 
`` Aha ! 
here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama , '' cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed . 
`` I beg your pardon , sir , '' said Mme. Vauquer ; `` it is soupe aux choux . '' 
All the young men roared with laughter . 
`` Had you there , Poiret ! '' 
`` Poir-r-r-rette ! 
she had you there ! '' 
`` Score two points to Mamma Vauquer , '' said Vautrin . 
`` Did any of you notice the fog this morning ? '' 
asked the official . 
`` It was a frantic fog , '' said Bianchon , `` a fog unparalleled , doleful , melancholy , sea-green , asthmatical -- a Goriot of a fog ! '' 
`` A Goriorama , '' said the art student , `` because you could n't see a thing in it . '' 
`` Hey ! 
Milord Gaoriotte , they air talking about yoo-o-ou ! '' 
Father Goriot , seated at the lower end of the table , close to the door through which the servant entered , raised his face ; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin , an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity , that still showed itself at times . 
`` Well , '' Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones , that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices , `` and is there anything the matter with the bread ? '' 
`` Nothing whatever , madame , '' he answered ; `` on the contrary , it is made of the best quality of corn ; flour from Etampes . '' 
`` How could you tell ? '' 
asked Eugene . 
`` By the color , by the flavor . '' 
`` You knew the flavor by the smell , I suppose , '' said Mme. Vauquer . 
`` You have grown so economical , you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last . '' 
`` Take out a patent for it , then , '' cried the Museum official ; `` you would make a handsome fortune . '' 
`` Never mind him , '' said the artist ; `` he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker . '' 
`` Your nose is a corn-sampler , it appears ? '' 
inquired the official . 
`` Corn what ? '' 
asked Bianchon . 
`` Corn-el . '' 
`` Corn-et . '' 
`` Corn-elian . '' 
`` Corn-ice . '' 
`` Corn-ucopia . '' 
`` Corn-crake . '' 
`` Corn-cockle . '' 
`` Corn-orama . '' 
The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room , and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look , like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand . 
`` Corn ? 
... '' he said , turning to Vautrin , his next neighbor . 
`` Corn on your foot , old man ! '' 
said Vautrin , and he drove Father Goriot 's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown . 
The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything . 
Christophe carried off his plate , thinking that he had finished his soup , so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table . 
Every one burst out laughing . 
`` You are a disagreeable joker , sir , '' said the old man , `` and if you take any further liberties with me -- '' `` Well , what then , old boy ? '' 
Vautrin interrupted . 
`` Well , then , you shall pay dearly for it some day -- '' `` Down below , eh ? '' 
said the artist , `` in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys . '' 
`` Well , mademoiselle , '' Vautrin said , turning to Victorine , `` you are eating nothing . 
So papa was refractory , was he ? '' 
`` A monster ! '' 
said Mme. Couture . 
`` Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit ; she is not eating anything . 
Eh ! 
eh ! 
just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine . '' 
The old man had forgotten his dinner , he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl ; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable , -- the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her . 
`` We are mistaken about Father Goriot , my dear boy , '' said Eugene in a low voice . 
`` He is not an idiot , nor wanting in energy . 
Try your Gall system on him , and let me know what you think . 
I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax ; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now , to judge by his face . 
His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying . 
Oh ! 
you may laugh , Bianchon ; I am not joking . '' 
`` The man is a subject , is he ? '' 
said Bianchon ; `` all right ! 
I will dissect him , if he will give me the chance . '' 
`` No ; feel his bumps . '' 
`` Hm ! 
-- his stupidity might perhaps be contagious . '' 
The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly , and about three o'clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud . 
On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement . 
Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers ; they see success in every direction ; imagination has free play , and turns their lives into a romance ; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy . 
If youth were not ignorant and timid , civilization would be impossible . 
Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition , but on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de Restaud and what he should say to her . 
He equipped himself with wit , rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation , and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand , conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future ; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud , and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed . 
`` If I were rich , '' he said , as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen , `` I would take a cab , then I could think at my ease . '' 
At last he reached the Rue du Helder , and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud . 
He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants , who had seen him cross the court on foot , with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day . 
He understood the meaning of their glances at once , for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court , where a smart cab was waiting . 
All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance . 
A fine horse , in magnificent harness , was pawing the ground , and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself . 
Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast ; he grew positively stupid . 
He sent up his name to the Countess , and waited in the ante-chamber , standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court ; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash , and stared before him . 
The time seemed long ; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded . 
`` Madame is in her boudoir , and can not see any one at present , sir , '' said the servant . 
`` She gave me no answer ; but if you will go into the dining-room , there is some one already there . '' 
Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word ; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber , meaning , no doubt , to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house ; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers , where lamps were standing , and hot-water pipes , on which towels were being dried ; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it . 
Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion . 
`` This way to the drawing-room , sir , '' said the servant , with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense . 
Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath . 
By good luck , he managed to keep his hat on his head , and saved it from immersion in the water ; but just as he turned , a door opened at the further end of the dark passage , dimly lighted by a small lamp . 
Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss ; one of the speakers was Mme. de Restaud , the other was Father Goriot . 
Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room ; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard , and stood there for a while . 
He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew . 
His heart beat unwontedly fast ; he remembered Vautrin 's hideous insinuations . 
A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it , saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door : `` I am going , Maurice . 
Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her . '' 
Whereupon this insolent being , who , doubtless , had a right to be insolent , sang an Italian trill , and went towards the window where Eugene was standing , moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student 's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard . 
`` But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer ; madame is disengaged , '' said Maurice , as he returned to the ante-chamber . 
Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate ; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase . 
The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury , in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated . 
Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself . 
The horse took fright at the umbrella , swerved , and dashed forward towards the flight of steps . 
The young man looked round in annoyance , saw Father Goriot , and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy , such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services , or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon , so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance . 
Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile . 
All this happened with lightning speed . 
Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess ' voice . 
`` Oh ! 
Maxime , were you going away ? '' 
she said reproachfully , with a shade of pique in her manner . 
The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury . 
Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him , coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there ; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head , as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning ; there was a soft fragrance about her -- doubtless she was fresh from a bath ; -- her graceful form seemed more flexible , her beauty more luxuriant . 
Her eyes glistened . 
A young man can see everything at a glance ; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air ; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness . 
He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown ; it had fallen slightly open , giving glimpses of a bare throat , on which the student 's eyes rested . 
The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets ; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist ; her throat was a challenge to love ; her feet , thrust into slippers , were daintily small . 
As Maxime took her hand and kissed it , Eugene became aware of Maxime 's existence , and the Countess saw Eugene . 
`` Oh ! 
is that you M. de Rastignac ? 
I am very glad to see you , '' she said , but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart . 
Maxime , as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing , looked from Eugene to the lady , and from the lady to Eugene ; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter . 
An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words : `` Look here , my dear ; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business . '' 
The Countess consulted the young man 's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman 's heart , and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently . 
To begin with , the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other 's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous ; Maxime 's boots , moreover , were elegant and spotless , while his own , in spite of all his care , bore some traces of his recent walk ; and , finally , Maxime 's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully , he looked like a pretty woman , while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two . 
The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall , slender dandy , with the clear gaze and the pale face , one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple . 
Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak ; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight , so that she looked like a white butterfly , and Maxime hurried after her . 
Eugene , in a fury , followed Maxime and the Countess , and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room . 
The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way , and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Restaud , he meant to annoy the dandy . 
It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant 's ball ; he guessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud ; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success , he said to himself , `` This is my rival ; I mean to cut him out . '' 
Rash resolve ! 
He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted , so as to fire first and kill his man . 
Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot , but he had not yet hit the bulls 's eye twenty times out of twenty-two . 
The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth , took up the tongs , and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily , that Anastasie 's fair face suddenly clouded over . 
She turned to Eugene , with a cool , questioning glance that asked plainly , `` Why do you not go ? '' 
a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit . 
Eugene assumed an amiable expression . 
`` Madame , '' he began , `` I hastened to call upon you -- '' He stopped short . 
The door opened , and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared . 
He had left his hat outside , and did not greet the Countess ; he looked meditatively at Rastignac , and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial `` Good morning , '' that astonished Eugene not a little . 
The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance . 
`` M. de Restaud , '' said the Countess , introducing her husband to the law student . 
Eugene bowed profoundly . 
`` This gentleman , '' she continued , presenting Eugene to her husband , `` is M. de Rastignac ; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball . '' 
Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs ! 
These words , on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis , by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house , produced a magical effect . 
The Count 's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student 's bow . 
`` Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance , '' he said . 
Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance , and suddenly dropped his insolent manner . 
The mighty name had all the power of a fairy 's wand ; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again ; Rastignac 's carefully drilled faculties returned . 
It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris , and he began to see , though everything was indistinct as yet . 
Mme. Vauquer 's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts . 
`` I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct , '' the Comte de Restaud said , addressing Eugene . 
`` Yes , they are extinct , '' answered the law student . 
`` My great-uncle , the Chevalier de Rastignac , married the heiress of the Marcillac family . 
They had only one daughter , who married the Marechal de Clarimbault , Mme. de Beauseant 's grandfather on the mother 's side . 
We are the younger branch of the family , and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle , the Vice-Admiral , lost all that he had in the King 's service . 
The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated . '' 
`` Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789 ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather , who commanded the Warwick . '' 
Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders , as who should say , `` If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow , it is all over with us . '' 
Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her . 
With a woman 's admirable tact , she began to smile and said : `` Come with me , Maxime ; I have something to say to you . 
We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur . '' 
She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her , mirth and mischief in her whole attitude , and the two went in the direction of the boudoir . 
The morganatic couple -LRB- to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent -RRB- had reached the door , when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene . 
`` Anastasie ! '' 
he cried pettishly , `` just stay a moment , dear ; you know very well that -- '' `` I am coming back in a minute , '' she interrupted ; `` I have a commission for Maxime to execute , and I want to tell him about it . '' 
She came back almost immediately . 
She had noticed the inflection in her husband 's voice , and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir ; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands ' characters in order to have their own way , and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding , she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life . 
It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident ; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation . 
M. de Trailles addressed the Count , the Countess , and Eugene with the pointed remark , `` You are busy , I do not want to interrupt you ; good-day , '' and he went . 
`` Just wait a moment , Maxime ! '' 
the Count called after him . 
`` Come and dine with us , '' said the Countess , leaving Eugene and her husband together once more . 
She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room , where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave . 
The law student heard their laughter , and their voices , and the pauses in their talk ; he grew malicious , exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud , flattered him , and drew him into discussions , to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot . 
This Countess with a husband and a lover , for Maxime clearly was her lover , was a mystery . 
What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman ? 
This mystery he meant to penetrate , hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian . 
`` Anastasie ! '' 
the Count called again to his wife . 
`` Poor Maxime ! '' 
she said , addressing the young man . 
`` Come , we must resign ourselves . 
This evening -- '' `` I hope , Nasie , '' he said in her ear , `` that you will give orders not to admit that youngster , whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you . 
He will make you a declaration , and compromise you , and then you will compel me to kill him . '' 
`` Are you mad , Maxime ? '' 
she said . 
`` A young lad of a student is , on the contrary , a capital lightning-conductor ; is not that so ? 
Of course , I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him . '' 
Maxime burst out laughing , and went out , followed by the Countess , who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage ; he shook his whip , and made his horse prance . 
She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him . 
`` What do you think , dear ? '' 
cried the Count , her husband , `` this gentleman 's family estate is not far from Verteuil , on the Charente ; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted . '' 
`` Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common , '' said the Countess , with a preoccupied manner . 
`` More than you think , '' said Eugene , in a low voice . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
she asked quickly . 
`` Why , only just now , '' said the student , `` I saw a gentleman go out at the gate , Father Goriot , my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging . '' 
At the sound of this name , and the prefix that embellished it , the Count , who was stirring the fire , let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers , and rose to his feet . 
`` Sir , '' he cried , `` you might have called him ` Monsieur Goriot ' ! '' 
The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband 's vexation , then she reddened ; clearly she was embarrassed , her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural , and with an air of assumed carelessness : `` You could not know any one who is dearer to us both ... '' She broke off , glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind , and asked , `` Are you fond of music , M. de Rastignac ? '' 
`` Exceedingly , '' answered Eugene , flushing , and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly . 
`` Do you sing ? '' 
she cried , going to the piano , and , sitting down before it , she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end . 
R-r-r-rah ! 
`` No , madame . '' 
The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro . 
`` That is a pity ; you are without one great means of success . 
-- Ca-ro , ca-a-ro , ca-a-a-ro , non du-bi-ta-re , '' sang the Countess . 
Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot 's name , but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula `` related to Mme. de Beauseant . '' 
His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities , when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures , and three or four heads , imperfectly secured , fall at the shock . 
He wished the earth would open and swallow him . 
Mme. de Restaud 's expression was reserved and chilly , her eyes had grown indifferent , and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law . 
`` Madame , '' he said , `` you wish to talk with M. de Restaud ; permit me to wish you good-day -- '' The Countess interrupted him by a gesture , saying hastily , `` Whenever you come to see us , both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you . '' 
Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave , followed by M. de Restaud , who insisted , in spite of his remonstrances , on accompanying him into the hall . 
`` Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls , '' the Count said to Maurice . 
As Eugene set foot on the steps , he saw that it was raining . 
`` Come , '' said he to himself , `` somehow I have just made a mess of it , I do not know how . 
And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain . 
I ought to stop in my corner , grind away at law , and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate . 
How can I go into society , when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs , varnished boots , gold watch chains , and all sorts of things ; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning , and primrose kid gloves every evening ? 
A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot ! '' 
When he reached the street door , the driver of a hackney coach , who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door , and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer 's knowledge , saw that Eugene had no umbrella , remarked his black coat , white waistcoat , yellow gloves , and varnished boots , and stopped and looked at him inquiringly . 
Eugene , in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss , as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths , nodded in reply to the driver 's signal , and stepped into the cab ; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party . 
`` Where am I to drive , sir ? '' 
demanded the man , who , by this time , had taken off his white gloves . 
`` Confound it ! '' 
Eugene said to himself , `` I am in for it now , and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing ! 
-- Drive to the Hotel Beauseant , '' he said aloud . 
`` Which ? '' 
asked the man , a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion . 
This young man of fashion , species incerta , did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant ; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him . 
`` The Vicomte de Beauseant , Rue -- '' `` De Grenelle , '' interrupted the driver , with a jerk of his head . 
`` You see , there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique , '' he added , drawing up the step . 
`` I know all about that , '' said Eugene , severely . 
-- `` Everybody is laughing at me to-day , it seems ! '' 
he said to himself , as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat . 
`` This escapade will cost me a king 's ransom , but , at any rate , I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion . 
Goriot has cost me ten francs already , the old scoundrel . 
My word ! 
I will tell Mme. de Beauseant about my adventure ; perhaps it may amuse her . 
Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail . 
It would be better to find favor in my cousin 's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman , who seems to me to have very expensive tastes . 
Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse 's personal interest would turn the scale for me , when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect . 
Let us look higher . 
If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven , you must face God . '' 
The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases . 
He grew calmer , and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain . 
He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him , the money was well laid out in preserving his coat , boots , and hat ; and his cabman 's cry of `` Gate , if you please , '' almost put him in spirits . 
A Swiss , in scarlet and gold , appeared , the great door groaned on its hinges , and Rastignac , with sweet satisfaction , beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning . 
The driver , in a blue-and-red greatcoat , dismounted and let down the step . 
As Eugene stepped out of the cab , he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle . 
Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle . 
In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity ; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris ; a coachman , with powdered hair , seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses , who stood chafing the bit . 
In Mme. de Restaud 's courtyard , in the Chaussee d'Antin , he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty ; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank ; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it . 
`` Who can be here ? '' 
said Eugene to himself . 
He began to understand , though somewhat tardily , that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated , and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed . 
`` Confound it all ! 
I expect my cousin also has her Maxime . '' 
He went up the steps , feeling that he was a blighted being . 
The glass door was opened for him ; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb . 
So far , Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant ; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation , that he had not had time to call on his cousin , and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant 's apartments ; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life . 
He was the more curious , because Mme. de Restaud 's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison . 
At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible . 
Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin , but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris . 
He was conducted up the wide , white-painted , crimson-carpeted staircase , between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants , to Mme. de Beauseant 's apartments . 
He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Beauseant , one of the biographies told , with variations , in whispers , every evening in the salons of Paris . 
For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles , the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto . 
It was one of those innocent liaisons which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable . 
The Vicomte de Beauseant , therefore , had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting , with as good a grace as might be , this morganatic union . 
Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto there . 
As , under the circumstances , Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors , she gave them such a cold reception , and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling , that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her ; and when it became known in Paris that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock , she was left in perfect solitude during that interval . 
She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d'Ajuda-Pinto ; and M. de Beauseant , like a well-bred man of the world , always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them . 
But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry , and a Mlle. de Rochefide was the young lady . 
In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement , and that was Mme. de Beauseant . 
Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility , and she had laughed at them , believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief . 
And now , though the bans were about to be published , and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse , he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery . 
How was it ? 
Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind . 
There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who , after two hours of lamentations and reproaches , falls into a dead swoon and requires salts . 
At this moment , therefore , M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns , and anxious to take his leave . 
He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme. de Beauseant ; he would write , it would be much better to do it by letter , and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart . 
So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac , the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy . 
To be sure , a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness ; and when she is about to be forsaken , she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil 's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze . 
It was impossible , therefore , that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction ; slight though it was , it was appalling in its artlessness . 
Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner , and of its owner 's wife and family , so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation , `` Harness five bullocks to your cart ! '' 
probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you . 
If , down to the present day , our language has no name for these conversational disasters , it is probably because they are believed to be impossible , the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious . 
After the awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud 's , no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de Beauseant 's drawing-room . 
But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way , M. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief . 
`` Good-bye , '' said the Portuguese , hurrying to the door , as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room , where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste . 
`` Until this evening , '' said Mme. de Beauseant , turning her head to give the Marquis a glance . 
`` We are going to the Bouffons , are we not ? '' 
`` I can not go , '' he said , with his fingers on the door handle . 
Mme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return . 
She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene , who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him ; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real , and did not know where to hide himself , when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence . 
The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand , and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her . 
The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture ; he came back towards her . 
Eugene watched him , not without a feeling of envy . 
`` That is the owner of the brougham ! '' 
he said to himself . 
`` But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses , servants in livery , and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris ? '' 
The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart , greed burned in his veins , his throat was parched with the thirst of gold . 
He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter . 
His father , mother , brothers , sisters , and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them . 
This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties . 
`` Why not ? '' 
the Vicomtesse was saying , as she smiled at the Portuguese . 
`` Why can not you come to the Italiens ? '' 
`` Affairs ! 
I am to dine with the English Ambassador . '' 
`` Throw him over . '' 
When a man once enters on a course of deception , he is compelled to add lie to lie . 
M. d'Ajuda therefore said , smiling , `` Do you lay your commands on me ? '' 
`` Yes , certainly . '' 
`` That was what I wanted to have you say to me , '' he answered , dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman . 
He took the Vicomtesse 's hand , kissed it , and went . 
Eugene ran his fingers through his hair , and constrained himself to bow . 
He thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her attention ; but suddenly she sprang forward , rushed to a window in the gallery , and watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage ; she listened to the order that he gave , and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman : `` To M. de Rochefide 's house . '' 
Those words , and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage , were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her ; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart . 
The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights . 
The Vicomtesse went to her own room , sat down at a table , and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper . 
`` When , instead of dining with the English Ambassador , '' she wrote , `` you go to the Rochefides , you owe me an explanation , which I am waiting to hear . '' 
She retraced several of the letters , for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct ; then she signed the note with an initial C for `` Claire de Bourgogne , '' and rang the bell . 
`` Jacques , '' she said to the servant , who appeared immediately , `` take this note to M. de Rochefide 's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d'Ajuda . 
If M. d'Ajuda is there , leave the note without waiting for an answer ; if he is not there , bring the note back to me . '' 
`` Madame la Vicomtess , there is a visitor in the drawing-room . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , of course , '' she said , opening the door . 
Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable , but at last the Vicomtesse appeared ; she spoke to him , and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart . 
`` Pardon me , monsieur , '' she said ; `` I had a letter to write . 
Now I am quite at liberty . '' 
She scarcely knew what she was saying , for even as she spoke she thought , `` Ah ! 
he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide ? 
But is he still free ? 
This evening the marriage shall be broken off , or else ... But before to-morrow I shall know . '' 
`` Cousin ... '' the student replied . 
`` Eh ? '' 
said the Countess , with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene ; he understood what that `` Eh ? '' 
meant ; he had learned a great deal in three hours , and his wits were on the alert . 
He reddened : `` Madame ... '' he began ; he hesitated a moment , and then went on . 
`` Pardon me ; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm . '' 
Mme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile ; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain , the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst . 
`` If you knew how my family are situated , '' he went on , `` you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege . '' 
`` Well , cousin , '' she said , laughing , `` and how can I be of service to you ? '' 
`` But do I know even that ? 
I am distantly related to you , and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me . 
You have confused my ideas ; I can not remember the things that I meant to say to you . 
I know no one else here in Paris ... . 
Ah ! 
if I could only ask you to counsel me , ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress , who would lay down his life for you . '' 
`` Would you kill a man for me ? '' 
`` Two , '' said Eugene . 
`` You , child . 
Yes , you are a child , '' she said , keeping back the tears that came to her eyes ; `` you would love sincerely . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
he cried , flinging up his head . 
The audacity of the student 's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him . 
The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time . 
Between Mme. de Restaud 's blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant 's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years ' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris , although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence , and , when well understood , is a highroad to success of every kind . 
`` Ah ! 
that is what I meant to say ! ''
