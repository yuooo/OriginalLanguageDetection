After his first depression , Passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . 
It was certainly not an enviable one . 
He found himself on the way to Japan , and what should he do when he got there ? 
His pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . 
His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . 
He fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and himself . 
He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for . 
At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama . 
This is an important port of call in the Pacific , where all the mail-steamers , and those carrying travellers between North America , China , Japan , and the Oriental islands put in . 
It is situated in the bay of Yeddo , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese Empire , and the residence of the Tycoon , the civil Emperor , before the Mikado , the spiritual Emperor , absorbed his office in his own . 
The Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations . 
Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the Sons of the Sun . 
He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama . 
He found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter , the houses having low fronts , and being adorned with verandas , beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles . 
This quarter occupied , with its streets , squares , docks , and warehouses , all the space between the `` promontory of the Treaty '' and the river . 
Here , as at Hong Kong and Calcutta , were mixed crowds of all races , Americans and English , Chinamen and Dutchmen , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything . 
The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of Hottentots . 
He had , at least , one resource , -- to call on the French and English consuls at Yokohama for assistance . 
But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master ; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid . 
As chance did not favour him in the European quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese , determined , if necessary , to push on to Yeddo . 
The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten , after the goddess of the sea , who is worshipped on the islands round about . 
There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves , sacred gates of a singular architecture , bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds , temples shaded by immense cedar-trees , holy retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius , and interminable streets , where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children , who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens , and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats , might have been gathered . 
The streets were crowded with people . 
Priests were passing in processions , beating their dreary tambourines ; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists ; soldiers , clad in blue cotton with white stripes , and bearing guns ; the Mikado 's guards , enveloped in silken doubles , hauberks and coats of mail ; and numbers of military folk of all ranks -- for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China -- went hither and thither in groups and pairs . 
Passepartout saw , too , begging friars , long-robed pilgrims , and simple civilians , with their warped and jet-black hair , big heads , long busts , slender legs , short stature , and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white , but never yellow , like the Chinese , from whom the Japanese widely differ . 
He did not fail to observe the curious equipages -- carriages and palanquins , barrows supplied with sails , and litters made of bamboo ; nor the women -- whom he thought not especially handsome -- who took little steps with their little feet , whereon they wore canvas shoes , straw sandals , and clogs of worked wood , and who displayed tight-looking eyes , flat chests , teeth fashionably blackened , and gowns crossed with silken scarfs , tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan . 
Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd , looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops , the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments , the restaurants decked with streamers and banners , the tea-houses , where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki , a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice , and the comfortable smoking-houses , where they were puffing , not opium , which is almost unknown in Japan , but a very fine , stringy tobacco . 
He went on till he found himself in the fields , in the midst of vast rice plantations . 
There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves , with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes , not on bushes , but on trees , and within bamboo enclosures , cherry , plum , and apple trees , which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit , and which queerly-fashioned , grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows , pigeons , ravens , and other voracious birds . 
On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles ; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons , solemnly standing on one leg ; and on every hand were crows , ducks , hawks , wild birds , and a multitude of cranes , which the Japanese consider sacred , and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity . 
As he was strolling along , Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs . 
`` Good ! '' 
said he ; `` I 'll have some supper . '' 
But , on smelling them , he found that they were odourless . 
`` No chance there , '' thought he . 
The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . 
He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the Japanese eat almost exclusively . 
But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . 
Night came , and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari-coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . 
Then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats . 
The streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd . 
Each time a company passed , Passepartout chuckled , and said to himself : `` Good ! 
another Japanese embassy departing for Europe ! '' 
The next morning poor , jaded , famished Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards , and the sooner he did so the better . 
He might , indeed , sell his watch ; but he would have starved first . 
Now or never he must use the strong , if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him . 
He knew several French and English songs , and resolved to try them upon the Japanese , who must be lovers of music , since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals , tam-tams , and tambourines , and could not but appreciate European talent . 
It was , perhaps , rather early in the morning to get up a concert , and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers , might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado 's features . 
Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours ; and , as he was sauntering along , it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist . 
The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project ; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger . 
The resolution taken , it remained to carry it out . 
It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange . 
The man liked the European costume , and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat , and a sort of one-sided turban , faded with long use . 
A few small pieces of silver , moreover , jingled in his pocket . 
`` Good ! '' 
thought he . 
`` I will imagine I am at the Carnival ! '' 
His first care , after being thus `` Japanesed , '' was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance , and , upon half a bird and a little rice , to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved . 
`` Now , '' thought he , when he had eaten heartily , `` I must n't lose my head . 
I ca n't sell this costume again for one still more Japanese . 
I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun , of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories , as quickly as possible . '' 
It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America . 
He would offer himself as a cook or servant , in payment of his passage and meals . 
Once at San Francisco , he would find some means of going on . 
The difficulty was , how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World . 
Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks . 
But , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind . 
What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ? 
What references could he give ? 
As he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets . 
This placard , which was in English , read as follows : ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE , HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR , PROPRIETOR , LAST REPRESENTATIONS , PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES , OF THE LONG NOSES ! 
LONG NOSES ! 
UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU ! 
GREAT ATTRACTION ! 
`` The United States ! '' 
said Passepartout ; `` that 's just what I want ! '' 
He followed the clown , and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter . 
A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers . 
This was the Honourable William Batulcar 's establishment . 
That gentleman was a sort of Barnum , the director of a troupe of mountebanks , jugglers , clowns , acrobats , equilibrists , and gymnasts , who , according to the placard , was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union . 
Passepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar , who straightway appeared in person . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
said he to Passepartout , whom he at first took for a native . 
`` Would you like a servant , sir ? '' 
asked Passepartout . 
`` A servant ! '' 
cried Mr. Batulcar , caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin . 
`` I already have two who are obedient and faithful , have never left me , and serve me for their nourishment and here they are , '' added he , holding out his two robust arms , furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol . 
`` So I can be of no use to you ? '' 
`` None . '' 
`` The devil ! 
I should so like to cross the Pacific with you ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar . 
`` You are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey ! 
Who are you dressed up in that way ? '' 
`` A man dresses as he can . '' 
`` That 's true . 
You are a Frenchman , are n't you ? '' 
`` Yes ; a Parisian of Paris . '' 
`` Then you ought to know how to make grimaces ? '' 
`` Why , '' replied Passepartout , a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question , `` we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces , it is true but not any better than the Americans do . '' 
`` True . 
Well , if I ca n't take you as a servant , I can as a clown . 
You see , my friend , in France they exhibit foreign clowns , and in foreign parts French clowns . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` You are pretty strong , eh ? '' 
`` Especially after a good meal . '' 
`` And you can sing ? '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Passepartout , who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets . 
`` But can you sing standing on your head , with a top spinning on your left foot , and a sabre balanced on your right ? '' 
`` Humph ! 
I think so , '' replied Passepartout , recalling the exercises of his younger days . 
`` Well , that 's enough , '' said the Honourable William Batulcar . 
The engagement was concluded there and then . 
Passepartout had at last found something to do . 
He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe . 
It was not a very dignified position , but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco . 
The performance , so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar , was to commence at three o'clock , and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door . 
Passepartout , though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part , was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the `` human pyramid , '' executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou . 
This `` great attraction '' was to close the performance . 
Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators , comprising Europeans and natives , Chinese and Japanese , men , women and children , who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage . 
The musicians took up a position inside , and were vigorously performing on their gongs , tam-tams , flutes , bones , tambourines , and immense drums . 
The performance was much like all acrobatic displays ; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world . 
One , with a fan and some bits of paper , performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers ; another traced in the air , with the odorous smoke of his pipe , a series of blue words , which composed a compliment to the audience ; while a third juggled with some lighted candles , which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips , and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling . 
Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top ; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling ; they ran over pipe-stems , the edges of sabres , wires and even hairs stretched across the stage ; they turned around on the edges of large glasses , crossed bamboo ladders , dispersed into all the corners , and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone . 
The jugglers tossed them in the air , threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores , and yet they kept on spinning ; they put them into their pockets , and took them out still whirling as before . 
It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts . 
The turning on ladders , poles , balls , barrels , & c. , was executed with wonderful precision . 
But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses , a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger . 
The Long Noses form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god Tingou . 
Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings ; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them . 
These noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them . 
It was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises . 
A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning-rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults . 
As a last scene , a `` human pyramid '' had been announced , in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut . 
But , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other 's shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses . 
It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , Passepartout had been chosen to take his place . 
The poor fellow really felt sad when -- melancholy reminiscence of his youth ! 
-- he donned his costume , adorned with vari-coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long . 
But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat . 
He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut . 
They all stretched themselves on the floor , their noses pointing to the ceiling . 
A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages , then a third above these , then a fourth , until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses . 
This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards ! 
It was Passepartout 's fault . 
Abandoning his position , clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings , and , clambering up to the right-hand gallery , he fell at the feet of one of the spectators , crying , `` Ah , my master ! 
my master ! '' 
`` You here ? '' 
`` Myself . '' 
`` Very well ; then let us go to the steamer , young man ! '' 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside , where they encountered the Honourable Mr. Batulcar , furious with rage . 
He demanded damages for the `` breakage '' of the pyramid ; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes . 
At half-past six , the very hour of departure , Mr. Fogg and Aouda , followed by Passepartout , who in his hurry had retained his wings , and nose six feet long , stepped upon the American steamer . 
What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be easily guessed . 
The signals made by the Tankadere had been seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half-mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . 
Phileas Fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix ; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama . 
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November . 
Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic , where he learned , to Aouda 's great delight -- and perhaps to his own , though he betrayed no emotion -- that Passepartout , a Frenchman , had really arrived on her the day before . 
The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find Passepartout , if possible , without delay . 
Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . 
Chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar 's theatre . 
He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . 
He could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the `` pyramid '' pell-mell upon the stage . 
All this Passepartout learned from Aouda , who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere , in company with one Mr. Fix . 
Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name . 
He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself ; and , in the account he gave of his absence , he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness , in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong . 
Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly , without a word ; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position . 
Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his nose and parted with his wings , and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou . 
The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company , and was named the General Grant . 
She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . 
The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting-rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . 
The General Grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . 
By making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days . 
Phileas Fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of December , New York by the 11th , and London on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December . 
There was a full complement of passengers on board , among them English , many Americans , a large number of coolies on their way to California , and several East Indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world . 
Nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the Pacific almost justified its name . 
Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever . 
His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector . 
Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey . 
She often chatted with Passepartout , who did not fail to perceive the state of the lady 's heart ; and , being the most faithful of domestics , he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg 's honesty , generosity , and devotion . 
He took pains to calm Aouda 's doubts of a successful termination of the journey , telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed , that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of Japan and China , and were fairly on their way to civilised places again . 
A railway train from San Francisco to New York , and a transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon . 
On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama , Phileas Fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . 
The General Grant passed , on the 23rd of November , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of London . 
Mr. Fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left . 
But , though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden , from Aden to Bombay , from Calcutta to Singapore , and from Singapore to Yokohama . 
Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of London , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty-six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of November , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . 
And now the course was a straight one , and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way ! 
It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that Passepartout made a joyful discovery . 
It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable . 
Now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship 's chronometers . 
His triumph was hilarious . 
He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard ! 
`` The rogue told me a lot of stories , '' repeated Passepartout , `` about the meridians , the sun , and the moon ! 
Moon , indeed ! 
moonshine more likely ! 
If one listened to that sort of people , a pretty sort of time one would keep ! 
I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch ! '' 
Passepartout was ignorant that , if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours , like the Italian clocks , he would have no reason for exultation ; for the hands of his watch would then , instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning , indicate nine o'clock in the evening , that is , the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian . 
But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect , Passepartout would not have admitted , even if he had comprehended it . 
Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner . 
Where was Fix at that moment ? 
He was actually on board the General Grant . 
On reaching Yokohama , the detective , leaving Mr. Fogg , whom he expected to meet again during the day , had repaired at once to the English consulate , where he at last found the warrant of arrest . 
It had followed him from Bombay , and had come by the Carnatic , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be . 
Fix 's disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless . 
Mr. Fogg had left English ground , and it was now necessary to procure his extradition ! 
`` Well , '' thought Fix , after a moment of anger , `` my warrant is not good here , but it will be in England . 
The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country , thinking he has thrown the police off his track . 
Good ! 
I will follow him across the Atlantic . 
As for the money , heaven grant there may be some left ! 
But the fellow has already spent in travelling , rewards , trials , bail , elephants , and all sorts of charges , more than five thousand pounds . 
Yet , after all , the Bank is rich ! '' 
His course decided on , he went on board the General Grant , and was there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived . 
To his utter amazement , he recognised Passepartout , despite his theatrical disguise . 
He quickly concealed himself in his cabin , to avoid an awkward explanation , and hoped -- thanks to the number of passengers -- to remain unperceived by Mr. Fogg 's servant . 
On that very day , however , he met Passepartout face to face on the forward deck . 
The latter , without a word , made a rush for him , grasped him by the throat , and , much to the amusement of a group of Americans , who immediately began to bet on him , administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows , which proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic skill . 
When Passepartout had finished , he found himself relieved and comforted . 
Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition , and , looking at his adversary , coldly said , `` Have you done ? '' 
`` For this time -- yes . '' 
`` Then let me have a word with you . '' 
`` But I -- '' `` In your master 's interests . '' 
Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix 's coolness , for he quietly followed him , and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers . 
`` You have given me a thrashing , '' said Fix . 
`` Good , I expected it . 
Now , listen to me . 
Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg 's adversary . 
I am now in his game . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
cried Passepartout ; `` you are convinced he is an honest man ? '' 
`` No , '' replied Fix coldly , `` I think him a rascal . 
Sh ! 
do n't budge , and let me speak . 
As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground , it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived . 
I did everything I could to keep him back . 
I sent the Bombay priests after him , I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong , I separated you from him , and I made him miss the Yokohama steamer . '' 
Passepartout listened , with closed fists . 
`` Now , '' resumed Fix , `` Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England . 
Well , I will follow him there . 
But hereafter I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in his path . 
I 've changed my game , you see , and simply because it was for my interest to change it . 
Your interest is the same as mine ; for it is only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man . '' 
Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix , and was convinced that he spoke with entire good faith . 
`` Are we friends ? '' 
asked the detective . 
`` Friends ? 
-- no , '' replied Passepartout ; `` but allies , perhaps . 
At the least sign of treason , however , I 'll twist your neck for you . '' 
`` Agreed , '' said the detective quietly . 
Eleven days later , on the 3rd of December , the General Grant entered the bay of the Golden Gate , and reached San Francisco . 
Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day . 
It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout set foot upon the American continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked . 
These quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels . 
Alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries . 
There were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico , Chili , Peru , Brazil , Europe , Asia , and all the Pacific islands . 
Passepartout , in his joy on reaching at last the American continent , thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style ; but , tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks , he fell through them . 
Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus `` set foot '' upon the New World , he uttered a loud cry , which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays , that they flew noisily away . 
Mr. Fogg , on reaching shore , proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for New York , and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. ; he had , therefore , an entire day to spend in the Californian capital . 
Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars , he and Aouda entered it , while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver , and they set out for the International Hotel . 
From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets , the low , evenly ranged houses , the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches , the great docks , the palatial wooden and brick warehouses , the numerous conveyances , omnibuses , horse-cars , and upon the side-walks , not only Americans and Europeans , but Chinese and Indians . 
Passepartout was surprised at all he saw . 
San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849 -- a city of banditti , assassins , and incendiaries , who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder ; a paradise of outlaws , where they gambled with gold-dust , a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other : it was now a great commercial emporium . 
The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues , which cut each other at right-angles , and in the midst of which appeared pleasant , verdant squares , while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter , seemingly imported from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box . 
Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen ; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active , gentlemanly-looking men . 
Some of the streets -- especially Montgomery Street , which is to San Francisco what Regent Street is to London , the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris , and Broadway to New York -- were lined with splendid and spacious stores , which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world . 
When Passepartout reached the International Hotel , it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all . 
The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar , a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by , who might partake of dried beef , oyster soup , biscuits , and cheese , without taking out their purses . 
Payment was made only for the ale , porter , or sherry which was drunk . 
This seemed `` very American '' to Passepartout . 
The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable , and Mr. Fogg and Aouda , installing themselves at a table , were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue . 
After breakfast , Mr. Fogg , accompanied by Aouda , started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed . 
As he was going out , he met Passepartout , who asked him if it would not be well , before taking the train , to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt 's revolvers . 
He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees . 
Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution , but told him to do as he thought best , and went on to the consulate . 
He had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , `` by the greatest chance in the world , '' he met Fix . 
The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise . 
What ! 
Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together , and not met on the steamer ! 
At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to Europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company . 
Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his ; and the detective -- who was determined not to lose sight of him -- begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco -- a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted . 
They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street , where a great crowd was collected ; the side-walks , street , horsecar rails , the shop-doors , the windows of the houses , and even the roofs , were full of people . 
Men were going about carrying large posters , and flags and streamers were floating in the wind ; while loud cries were heard on every hand . 
`` Hurrah for Camerfield ! '' 
`` Hurrah for Mandiboy ! '' 
It was a political meeting ; at least so Fix conjectured , who said to Mr. Fogg , `` Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd . 
There may be danger in it . '' 
`` Yes , '' returned Mr. Fogg ; `` and blows , even if they are political are still blows . '' 
Fix smiled at this remark ; and , in order to be able to see without being jostled about , the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street . 
Opposite them , on the other side of the street , between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse , a large platform had been erected in the open air , towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed . 
For what purpose was this meeting ? 
What was the occasion of this excited assemblage ? 
Phileas Fogg could not imagine . 
Was it to nominate some high official -- a governor or member of Congress ? 
It was not improbable , so agitated was the multitude before them . 
Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . 
All the hands were raised in the air . 
Some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . 
The crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . 
The undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . 
Many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height . 
`` It is evidently a meeting , '' said Fix , `` and its object must be an exciting one . 
I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama , despite the fact that that question is settled . '' 
`` Perhaps , '' replied Mr. Fogg , simply . 
`` At least , there are two champions in presence of each other , the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy . '' 
Aouda , leaning upon Mr. Fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . 
Before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . 
Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . 
Boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . 
One of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand . 
`` It would be prudent for us to retire , '' said Fix , who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to London . 
`` If there is any question about England in all this , and we were recognised , I fear it would go hard with us . '' 
`` An English subject -- '' began Mr. Fogg . 
He did not finish his sentence ; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood , and there were frantic shouts of , `` Hurrah for Mandiboy ! 
Hip , hip , hurrah ! '' 
It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the Camerfield forces in flank . 
Mr. Fogg , Aouda , and Fix found themselves between two fires ; it was too late to escape . 
The torrent of men , armed with loaded canes and sticks , was irresistible . 
Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion ; the former , as cool as ever , tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman 's arm , but in vain . 
A big brawny fellow with a red beard , flushed face , and broad shoulders , who seemed to be the chief of the band , raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg , whom he would have given a crushing blow , had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead . 
An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective 's silk hat , which was completely smashed in . 
`` Yankee ! '' 
exclaimed Mr. Fogg , darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian . 
`` Englishman ! '' 
returned the other . 
`` We will meet again ! '' 
`` When you please . '' 
`` What is your name ? '' 
`` Phileas Fogg . 
And yours ? '' 
`` Colonel Stamp Proctor . '' 
The human tide now swept by , after overturning Fix , who speedily got upon his feet again , though with tattered clothes . 
Happily , he was not seriously hurt . 
His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on . 
Aouda had escaped unharmed , and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise . 
`` Thanks , '' said Mr. Fogg to the detective , as soon as they were out of the crowd . 
`` No thanks are necessary , '' replied . 
Fix ; `` but let us go . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` To a tailor 's . '' 
Such a visit was , indeed , opportune . 
The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and Fix was in rags , as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy . 
An hour after , they were once more suitably attired , and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel . 
Passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers . 
When he perceived Fix , he knit his brows ; but Aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression . 
Fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word . 
Dinner over , the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door . 
As he was getting in , Mr. Fogg said to Fix , `` You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I will come back to America to find him , '' said Phileas Fogg calmly . 
`` It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way , without retaliating . '' 
The detective smiled , but did not reply . 
It was clear that Mr. Fogg was one of those Englishmen who , while they do not tolerate duelling at home , fight abroad when their honour is attacked . 
At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station , and found the train ready to depart . 
As he was about to enter it , Mr. Fogg called a porter , and said to him : `` My friend , was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco ? '' 
`` It was a political meeting , sir , '' replied the porter . 
`` But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets . '' 
`` It was only a meeting assembled for an election . '' 
`` The election of a general-in-chief , no doubt ? '' 
asked Mr. Fogg . 
`` No , sir ; of a justice of the peace . '' 
Phileas Fogg got into the train , which started off at full speed . 
`` From ocean to ocean '' -- so say the Americans ; and these four words compose the general designation of the `` great trunk line '' which crosses the entire width of the United States . 
The Pacific Railroad is , however , really divided into two distinct lines : the Central Pacific , between San Francisco and Ogden , and the Union Pacific , between Ogden and Omaha . 
Five main lines connect Omaha with New York . 
New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles . 
Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts , and a large tract which the Mormons , after they were driven from Illinois in 1845 , began to colonise . 
The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months . 
It is now accomplished in seven days . 
It was in 1862 that , in spite of the Southern Members of Congress , who wished a more southerly route , it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels . 
President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha , in Nebraska . 
The work was at once commenced , and pursued with true American energy ; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution . 
The road grew , on the prairies , a mile and a half a day . 
A locomotive , running on the rails laid down the evening before , brought the rails to be laid on the morrow , and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position . 
The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa , Kansas , Colorado , and Oregon . 
On leaving Omaha , it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch , follows its southern branch , crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains , turns the Great Salt Lake , and reaches Salt Lake City , the Mormon capital , plunges into the Tuilla Valley , across the American Desert , Cedar and Humboldt Mountains , the Sierra Nevada , and descends , via Sacramento , to the Pacific -- its grade , even on the Rocky Mountains , never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile . 
Such was the road to be traversed in seven days , which would enable Phileas Fogg -- at least , so he hoped -- to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool . 
The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels , and with no compartments in the interior . 
It was supplied with two rows of seats , perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms . 
These platforms were found throughout the train , and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other . 
It was supplied with saloon cars , balcony cars , restaurants , and smoking-cars ; theatre cars alone were wanting , and they will have these some day . 
Book and news dealers , sellers of edibles , drinkables , and cigars , who seemed to have plenty of customers , were continually circulating in the aisles . 
The train left Oakland station at six o'clock . 
It was already night , cold and cheerless , the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow . 
The train did not proceed rapidly ; counting the stoppages , it did not run more than twenty miles an hour , which was a sufficient speed , however , to enable it to reach Omaha within its designated time . 
There was but little conversation in the car , and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep . 
Passepartout found himself beside the detective ; but he did not talk to him . 
After recent events , their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold ; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them . 
Fix 's manner had not changed ; but Passepartout was very reserved , and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation . 
Snow began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect . 
At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived ; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory . 
The backs of the seats were thrown back , bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system , berths were suddenly improvised , and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed , protected from curious eyes by thick curtains . 
The sheets were clean and the pillows soft . 
It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did -- while the train sped on across the State of California . 
The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly . 
The Central Pacific , taking Sacramento for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha . 
The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction , along the American River , which empties into San Pablo Bay . 
The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours , and towards midnight , while fast asleep , the travellers passed through Sacramento ; so that they saw nothing of that important place , the seat of the State government , with its fine quays , its broad streets , its noble hotels , squares , and churches .
