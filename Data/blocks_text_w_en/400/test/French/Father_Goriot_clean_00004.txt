said Eugene . 
`` I met Mme. de Restaud at your ball , and this morning I went to see her . 
`` You must have been very much in the way , '' said Mme. de Beauseant , smiling as she spoke . 
`` Yes , indeed . 
I am a novice , and my blunders will set every one against me , if you do not give me your counsel . 
I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young , beautiful , and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me , what you women can explain so well -- life . 
I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere . 
So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle , to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning . 
I mentioned an old man -- '' `` Madame la Duchess de Langeais , '' Jacques cut the student short ; Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture . 
`` If you mean to succeed , '' said the Vicomtesse in a low voice , `` in the first place you must not be so demonstrative . '' 
`` Ah ! 
good morning , dear , '' she continued , and rising and crossing the room , she grasped the Duchess ' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters ; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way . 
`` Two intimate friends ! '' 
said Rastignac to himself . 
`` Henceforward I shall have two protectresses ; those two women are great friends , no doubt , and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend 's cousin . '' 
`` To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune , dear Antoinette ? '' 
asked Mme. de Beauseant . 
`` Well , I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide 's door , so I thought that if I came I should find you alone . '' 
Mme. de Beauseant 's mouth did not tighten , her color did not rise , her expression did not alter , or rather , her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words . 
`` If I had known that you were engaged -- '' the speaker added , glancing at Eugene . 
`` This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac , one of my cousins , '' said the Vicomtesse . 
`` Have you any news of General de Montriveau ? '' 
she continued . 
`` Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now ; has he been to see you to-day ? '' 
It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau , and that he was a faithless lover ; she felt the question in her very heart , and her face flushed as she answered : `` He was at the Elysee yesterday . '' 
`` In attendance ? '' 
`` Claire , '' returned the Duchess , and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme. de Beauseant ; `` of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide ; the bans will be published to-morrow . '' 
This thrust was too cruel ; the Vicomtesse 's face grew white , but she answered , laughing , `` One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with . 
What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides ? 
The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday . '' 
`` But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year , they say . '' 
`` M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money . '' 
`` But , my dear , Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` And , as a matter of fact , he is dining with them to-day ; the thing is settled . 
It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it . '' 
Mme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac . 
`` What was the blunder that you made , monsieur ? '' 
she asked . 
`` The poor boy is only just launched into the world , Antoinette , so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of . 
Be merciful to him , and let us finish our talk to-morrow . 
Everything will be announced to-morrow , you know , and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation . '' 
The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot , and leave him crushed and annihilated . 
`` Madame , I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud 's heart ; unwittingly -- therein lies my offence , '' said the student of law , whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well , for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk . 
`` You continue to receive , possibly you fear , those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict ; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities , and every one despises him . '' 
Mme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance , one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude . 
It was like balm to the law student , who was still smarting under the Duchess ' insolent scrutiny ; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value . 
`` Imagine , too , that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud ; for I should tell you , madame , '' he went on , turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner , `` that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student , very much alone in the world , and very poor -- '' `` You should not tell us that , M. de Rastignac . 
We women never care about anything that no one else will take . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Eugene . 
`` I am only two-and-twenty , and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life . 
Besides , I am confessing my sins , and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional ; you commit your sins in one drawing-room , and receive absolution for them in another . '' 
The Duchess ' expression grew colder , she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks , and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with -- `` This gentleman has only just come -- '' Mme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both . 
`` He has only just come to Paris , dear , and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste . '' 
`` Mme. la Duchesse , '' said Eugene , `` is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us ? '' 
-LRB- `` Come , now , '' he said to himself , `` my language is superfinely elegant , I 'm sure . '' -RRB- 
`` But Mme. de Restaud is herself , I believe , M. de Trailles ' pupil , '' said the Duchess . 
`` Of that I had no idea , madame , '' answered the law student , `` so I rashly came between them . 
In fact , I got on very well with the lady 's husband , and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase , a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage . '' 
`` Who was it ? '' 
both women asked together . 
`` An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau , where I , a poor student , lodge likewise . 
He is a truly unfortunate creature , everybody laughs at him -- we all call him ` Father Goriot . ' '' 
`` Why , child that you are , '' cried the Vicomtesse , `` Mme. de Restaud was a Mlle. Goriot ! '' 
`` The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer , '' the Duchess added ; `` and when the little creature went to Court , the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day . 
Do you remember , Claire ? 
The King began to laugh , and made some joke in Latin about flour . 
People -- what was it ? 
-- people -- '' '' Ejusdem farinoe , '' said Eugene . 
`` Yes , that was it , '' said the Duchess . 
`` Oh ! 
is that her father ? '' 
the law student continued , aghast . 
`` Yes , certainly ; the old man had two daughters ; he dotes on them , so to speak , though they will scarcely acknowledge him . '' 
`` Did n't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name ? '' 
the Vicomtesse asked , turning to Mme. de Langeais , `` a Baron de Nucingen ? 
And her name is Delphine , is it not ? 
Is n't she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera ? 
She comes sometimes to the Bouffons , and laughs loudly to attract attention . '' 
The Duchess smiled and said : `` I wonder at you , dear . 
Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind ? 
One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was , to be infatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks . 
Oh ! 
he will not find her a good bargain ! 
She is in M. de Trailles ' hands , and he will ruin her . '' 
`` And they do not acknowledge their father ! '' 
Eugene repeated . 
`` Oh ! 
well , yes , their father , the father , a father , '' replied the Vicomtesse , `` a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs , it is said , to secure their happiness by marrying them well ; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself , thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters , thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again , that in their houses he should find two homes , where he would be loved and looked up to , and made much of . 
And in two years ' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts . '' 
Tears came into Eugene 's eyes . 
He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs , he had just left home , pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him , and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris . 
Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence . '' 
Eh , mon Dieu ! '' 
said Mme. de Langeais ; `` yes , it seems very horrible , and yet we see such things every day . 
Is there not a reason for it ? 
Tell me , dear , have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is ? 
A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up , you and I , a dear little one , bound to us very closely in innumerable ways ; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family , its ` white soul , ' as Lamartine says , and suddenly she will become its scourge . 
When HE comes and takes her from us , his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling 's heart , and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed . 
But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father , as we had no thought that was not for her ; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger . 
The tragedy is always going on under our eyes . 
On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son , and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence . 
On the other hand , it is the son-in-law who turns his wife 's mother out of the house . 
I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days ; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling , to say nothing of our marriages , which have come to be very poor farces . 
I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker 's case . 
I think I recollect that Foriot -- '' `` Goriot , madame . '' 
`` Yes , that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution . 
He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain , and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost . 
He had as much flour as he wanted . 
My grandmother 's steward sold him immense quantities . 
No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation , as that sort of person always did . 
I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security , because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism . 
Well , then , this Loriot , who sold corn to those butchers , has never had but one passion , they say -- he idolizes his daughters . 
He settled one of them under Restaud 's roof , and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree , the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist . 
You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor , the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three ; but after the restoration of the Bourbons , M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man 's society , and the banker was still more tired of it . 
His daughters were still fond of him ; they wanted ` to keep the goat and the cabbage , ' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there , under pretence of affection . 
` Come to-day , papa , we shall have you all to ourselves , and that will be much nicer ! ' 
and all that sort of thing . 
As for me , dear , I believe that love has second-sight : poor Ninety-three ; his heart must have bled . 
He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him , that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief . 
So he immolated himself . 
He made the sacrifice because he was a father ; he went into voluntary exile . 
His daughters were satisfied , so he thought that he had done the best thing he could ; but it was a family crime , and father and daughters were accomplices . 
You see this sort of thing everywhere . 
What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters ' drawing-rooms ? 
He would only have been in the way , and bored other people , besides being bored himself . 
And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best ; if her love grows tiresome , he will go ; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her . 
It is the same with all love and friendship . 
Our heart is a treasury ; if you pour out all its wealth at once , you are bankrupt . 
We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left . 
Their father had given them all he had . 
For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them ; then , one day , he gave them all his fortune too . 
The lemon was squeezed ; the girls left the rest in the gutter . '' 
`` The world is very base , '' said the Vicomtesse , plucking at the threads of her shawl . 
She did not raise her head as she spoke ; the words that Mme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick . 
`` Base ? 
Oh , no , '' answered the Duchess ; `` the world goes its own way , that is all . 
If I speak in this way , it is only to show that I am not duped by it . 
I think as you do , '' she said , pressing the Vicomtesse 's hand . 
`` The world is a slough ; let us try to live on the heights above it . '' 
She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as she said : `` You look very charming to-day , dear . 
I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before . '' 
Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin . 
`` Father Goriot is sublime ! '' 
said Eugene to himself , as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night . 
Mme. de Beauseant did not hear him ; she was absorbed in her own thoughts . 
For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment , and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word . 
`` The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured , '' said the Vicomtesse at last . 
`` No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle . 
Epigrams and sarcasms already ! 
Ah ! 
I will defend myself ! '' 
She raised her head like the great lady that she was , and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes . 
`` Ah ! '' 
she said , as she saw Eugene , `` are you there ? '' 
`` Still , '' he said piteously . 
`` Well , then , M. de Rastignac , deal with the world as it deserves . 
You are determined to succeed ? 
I will help you . 
You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman ; you shall measure the extent of man 's pitiful vanity . 
Deeply as I am versed in such learning , there were pages in the book of life that I had not read . 
Now I know all . 
The more cold-blooded your calculations , the further you will go . 
Strike ruthlessly ; you will be feared . 
Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses ; take a fresh relay , and leave the last to drop by the roadside ; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition . 
You will be nothing here , you see , unless a woman interests herself in you ; and she must be young and wealthy , and a woman of the world . 
Yet , if you have a heart , lock it carefully away like a treasure ; do not let any one suspect it , or you will be lost ; you would cease to be the executioner , you would take the victim 's place . 
And if ever you should love , never let your secret escape you ! 
Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart . 
Learn to mistrust every one ; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet . 
Listen , Miguel '' -- the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake -- `` there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead , and that is a rivalry between two sisters . 
Restaud comes of a good family , his wife has been received into their circle ; she has been presented at court ; and her sister , her wealthy sister , Mme. Delphine de Nucingen , the wife of a great capitalist , is consumed with envy , and ready to die of spleen . 
There is gulf set between the sisters -- indeed , they are sisters no longer -- the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other . 
So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon . 
She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay ; she has made herself de Marsay 's slave , and she bores him . 
De Marsay cares very little about her . 
If you will introduce her to me , you will be her darling , her Benjamin ; she will idolize you . 
If , after that , you can love her , do so ; if not , make her useful . 
I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes , but I will never receive her here in the morning . 
I will bow to her when I see her , and that will be quite sufficient . 
You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud 's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot 's name . 
Yes , my good friend , you may call at her house twenty times , and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home . 
The servants have their orders , and will not admit you . 
Very well , then , now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister 's house for you . 
The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle . 
As soon as she singles you out , other women will begin to lose their heads about you , and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her . 
There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him ; like the city madams , poor things , who copy our millinery , and hope thereby to acquire our manners . 
You will have a success , and in Paris success is everything ; it is the key of power . 
If the women credit you with wit and talent , the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself . 
There will be nothing you may not aspire to ; you will go everywhere , and you will find out what the world is -- an assemblage of fools and knaves . 
But you must be neither the one nor the other . 
I am giving you my name like Ariadne 's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth ; make no unworthy use of it , '' she said , with a queenly glance and curve of her throat ; `` give it back to me unsullied . 
And now , go ; leave me . 
We women also have our battles to fight . '' 
`` And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you -- '' `` Well ? '' 
she asked . 
He tapped his heart , smiled in answer to his cousin 's smile , and went . 
It was five o'clock , and Eugene was hungry ; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner , a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris . 
This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him . 
A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage ; he shakes his fist at society , and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken . 
Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words , `` You have shut the Countess ' door against you . '' 
`` I shall call ! '' 
he said to himself , `` and if Mme. de Beauseant is right , if I never find her at home -- I. . . 
well , Mme. de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris . 
I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice , and kill that Maxime of hers ! '' 
`` And money ? '' 
cried an inward monitor . 
`` How about money , where is that to come from ? '' 
And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud 's drawing-room rose before his eyes . 
That was the luxury which Goriot 's daughter had loved too well , the gilding , the ostentatious splendor , the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu , the riotous extravagance of a courtesan . 
Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant . 
As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris , innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart ; his ideas widened , and his conscience grew more elastic . 
He saw the world as it is ; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion , and found in success the ultima ratio mundi . 
`` Vautrin is right , success is virtue ! '' 
he said to himself . 
Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman , and went in to dinner . 
He glanced round the squalid room , saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls , and the sight filled him with loathing . 
The transition was too sudden , and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant ; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds . 
On the one hand , he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms , of quick-pulsed youth , of fair , impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry , framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art ; and , on the other hand , he saw a sombre picture , the miry verge beyond these faces , in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism . 
Mme. de Beauseant 's counsels , the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady , her petulant offer , came to his mind , and poverty was a ready expositor . 
Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success ; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion . 
Clearly he was still a child ! 
Those two lines are asymptotes , and will never meet . 
`` You are very dull , my lord Marquis , '' said Vautrin , with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind . 
`` I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ` my lord Marquis , ' '' answered Eugene . 
`` A marquis here in Paris , if he is not the veriest sham , ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least ; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune 's favorite . '' 
Vautrin 's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal , half-contemptuous . 
`` Puppy ! '' 
it seemed to say ; `` I should make one mouthful of him ! '' 
Then he answered : `` You are in a bad humor ; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success . '' 
`` She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table , '' cried Rastignac . 
Glances were exchanged all round the room ; Father Goriot looked down . 
`` You have sent some snuff into my eye , '' he said to his neighbor , turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face . 
`` Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me , '' said Eugene , looking at the old man 's neighbor ; `` he is worth all the rest of us put together . 
-- I am not speaking of the ladies , '' he added , turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer . 
Eugene 's remarks produced a sensation , and his tone silenced the dinner-table . 
Vautrin alone spoke . 
`` If you are going to champion Father Goriot , and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain , you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils , '' he said , banteringly . 
`` So I intend , '' said Eugene . 
`` Then you are taking the field to-day ? '' 
`` Perhaps , '' Rastignac answered . 
`` But I owe no account of myself to any one , especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night . '' 
Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac . 
`` If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets , my boy , you must go behind and see the whole show , and not peep through holes in the curtain . 
That is enough , '' he added , seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion . 
`` We can have a little talk whenever you like . '' 
There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint . 
Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student 's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers , nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution . 
`` Then , M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess , '' said Mme. Vauquer in a low voice . 
`` And of a baroness , '' answered Rastignac . 
`` That is about all he is capable of , '' said Bianchon to Rastignac ; `` I have taken a look at his head ; there is only one bump -- the bump of Paternity ; he must be an eternal father . '' 
Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon 's joke . 
He determined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant 's counsels , and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money . 
He grew grave . 
The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes ; all things lay before him , nothing was his . 
Dinner came to an end , the others went , and he was left in the dining-room . 
`` So you have seen my daughter ? '' 
Goriot spoke tremulously , and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugene 's dreams . 
The young man took the elder 's hand , and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes . 
`` You are a good and noble man , '' he said . 
`` We will have some talk about your daughters by and by . '' 
He rose without waiting for Goriot 's answer , and went to his room . 
There he wrote the following letter to his mother : -- `` My Dear Mother , -- Can you nourish your child from your breast again ? 
I am in a position to make a rapid fortune , but I want twelve hundred francs -- I must have them at all costs . 
Say nothing about this to my father ; perhaps he might make objections , and unless I have the money , I may be led to put an end to myself , and so escape the clutches of despair . 
I will tell you everything when I see you . 
I will not begin to try to describe my present situation ; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully . 
I have not been gambling , my kind mother , I owe no one a penny ; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me , you must send me the sum I mention . 
As a matter of fact , I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauseant ; she is using her influence for me ; I am obliged to go into society , and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves . 
I can manage to exist on bread and water , or go without food , if need be , but I can not do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country . 
I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way , or stick in the mire for the rest of my days . 
I know that all your hopes are set on me , and I want to realize them quickly . 
Sell some of your old jewelry , my kind mother ; I will give you other jewels very soon . 
I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means , and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it ; I should be a monster if I could . 
You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity . 
Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign , for life in Paris is one continual battle . 
If you can not otherwise procure the whole of the money , and are forced to sell our aunt 's lace , tell her that I will send her some still handsomer , '' and so forth . 
He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings -- would they despoil themselves for him , and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family ? 
To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly , and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures . 
Yet when he had written the letters , he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition ; his heart beat fast , and he trembled . 
He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house ; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters , and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris . 
Visions rose before his eyes ; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store , devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito , essaying , for the first time in their lives , a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness . 
`` A sister 's heart is a diamond for purity , a deep sea of tenderness ! '' 
he said to himself . 
He felt ashamed of those letters . 
What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts ; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer ! 
What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice ! 
What a pang for his mother 's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for ! 
And this noble affection , these sacrifices made at such terrible cost , were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen . 
A few tears , like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth , fell from his eyes . 
He walked up and down , and despair mingled with his emotion . 
Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door . 
`` What is the matter , sir ? '' 
he asked from the threshold . 
`` Ah ! 
my good neighbor , I am as much a son and brother as you are a father . 
You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie ; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles , who will be her ruin . '' 
Father Goriot withdrew , stammering some words , but Eugene failed to catch their meaning . 
The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters . 
Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted , but he ended by flinging them into the box . 
`` I shall succeed ! '' 
he said to himself . 
So says the gambler ; so says the great captain ; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few , have been the ruin of many more . 
A few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud 's house ; she was not at home . 
Three times he tried the experiment , and three times he found her doors closed against him , though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there . 
The Vicomtesse was right . 
The student studied no longer . 
He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name , and after thus attesting his presence , departed forthwith . 
He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students . 
He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations ; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years ' work into the third year , when he meant to begin to work in earnest , and to complete his studies in law with one great effort . 
In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris , to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune . 
Twice during that week he saw Mme. de Beauseant ; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d'Ajuda drive away . 
Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady , the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; and the marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed . 
The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before , but the end was only so much the nearer . 
The Marquis d'Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing ; Mme. de Beauseant -LRB- so they hoped -RRB- would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage , and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d'Ajuda 's morning visits to the exigencies of a man 's career , exigencies which she must have foreseen . 
In spite of the most solemn promises , daily renewed , M. d'Ajuda was playing a part , and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived . 
`` Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window , she is falling headlong down the staircase , '' said her most intimate friend , the Duchesse de Langeais . 
Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin . 
She had a half-superstitious affection for him . 
Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity , no real comfort in any eyes ; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries , it is because he has an interested motive . 
Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot 's previous history ; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen . 
The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows : -- In the days before the Revolution , Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker . 
He was a skilful , thrifty workman , sufficiently enterprising to buy his master 's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789 . 
Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne , close to the Corn Exchange . 
His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section , so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch . 
This prudent step had led to success ; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity -LRB- real or artificial -RRB- , when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris . 
People used to fight for bread at the bakers ' doors ; while other persons went to the grocers ' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it . 
It was during this year that Goriot made the money , which , at a later time , was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer ; he had , moreover , the usual luck of average ability ; his mediocrity was the salvation of him . 
He excited no one 's envy , it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over , and all his intelligence was concentrated , not on political , but on commercial speculations . 
Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn , flour , and `` middlings '' ; and the production , storage , and quality of grain . 
He could estimate the yield of the harvest , and foresee market prices ; he bought his cereals in Sicily , and imported Russian wheat . 
Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain , who had seen his grasp of the subject , his clear insight into the principles involved , his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked , would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made . 
Patient , active , and persevering , energetic and prompt in action , he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye . 
Nothing there took him by surprise ; he foresaw all things , knew all that was happening , and kept his own counsel ; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation ; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march . 
But beyond this business horizon he could not see . 
He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop , leaning against the framework of the door . 
Take him from his dark little counting-house , and he became once more the rough , slow-witted workman , a man who can not understand a piece of reasoning , who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures , and falls asleep at the play , a Parisian Dolibom in short , against whose stupidity other minds are powerless . 
Natures of this kind are nearly all alike ; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection . 
Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker 's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling ; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature , as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade . 
He had regarded his wife , the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie , with a devout admiration ; his love for her had been boundless . 
Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature , which , in its delicate strength , was the very opposite of his own . 
Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection , a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature ? 
Join love thereto , the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures , and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature . 
After seven years of unclouded happiness , Goriot lost his wife . 
It was very unfortunate for him . 
She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways ; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation , she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts . 
But when she was dead , the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania . 
All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters , and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them . 
More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time ; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again ; but he determined to remain a widower . 
His father-in-law , the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship , gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife 's memory . 
The frequenters of the Corn Exchange , who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly , joked about it among themselves , and found a ridiculous nickname for him . 
One of them ventured -LRB- after a glass over a bargain -RRB- to call him by it , and a blow from the vermicelli maker 's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin . 
He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned ; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious ; and this was so well known , that one day a competitor , who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself , told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab . 
The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale , left the Exchange at once , and did not return for several days afterwards ; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm . 
This time , however , the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder ; at a critical moment in the man 's affairs , Goriot drove him into bankruptcy , and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange . 
As might have been expected , the two girls were spoiled . 
With an income of sixty thousand francs , Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself , and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls . 
The best masters were engaged , that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education . 
They had a chaperon -- luckily for them , she was a woman who had good sense and good taste ; -- they learned to ride ; they had a carriage for their use ; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live ; they had only to express a wish , their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires , and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss . 
Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels ; and , quite naturally , he himself was left beneath them . 
Poor man ! 
he loved them even for the pain that they gave him . 
When the girls were old enough to be married , they were left free to choose for themselves . 
Each had half her father 's fortune as her dowry ; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty , her social aspirations led her to leave her father 's house for a more exalted sphere . 
Delphine wished for money ; she married Nucingen , a banker of German extraction , who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire . 
Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before . 
His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur ; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade , though his whole life was bound up with his business . 
For five years he stood out against their entreaties , then he yielded , and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years . 
It was this capital that Mme. Vauquer , in the early days of his residence with her , had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year . 
He had taken refuge in her lodging-house , driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses , but even to see him no more except in private . 
This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot 's business , information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais ' suppositions , and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end . 
Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two letters -- one from his mother , and one from his eldest sister . 
His heart beat fast , half with happiness , half with fear , at the sight of the familiar handwriting . 
Those two little scraps of paper contained life or death for his hopes . 
But while he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered their dire poverty at home , he knew their love for him so well that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood . 
His mother 's letter ran as follows : -- `` MY DEAR CHILD , -- I am sending you the money that you asked for . 
Make a good use of it . 
Even to save your life I could not raise so large a sum a second time without your father 's knowledge , and there would be trouble about it . 
We should be obliged to mortgage the land . 
It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of which I am ignorant ; but what sort of schemes can they be , that you should fear to tell me about them ? 
Volumes of explanation would not have been needed ; we mothers can understand at a word , and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty . 
I do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter has made upon me , my dear son . 
What can you have felt when you were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart ? 
It must have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so much pain as I read it . 
To what courses are you committed ? 
You are going to appear to be something that you are not , and your whole life and success depends upon this ? 
You are about to see a society into which you can not enter without rushing into expense that you can not afford , without losing precious time that is needed for your studies . 
Ah ! 
my dear Eugene , believe your mother , crooked ways can not lead to great ends . 
Patience and endurance are the two qualities most needed in your position . 
I am not scolding you ; I do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering . 
I am only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her foresight for you . 
You know the steps that you must take , and I , for my part , know the purity of heart , and how good your intentions are ; so I can say to you without a doubt , ` Go forward , beloved ! ' 
If I tremble , it is because I am a mother , but my prayers and blessings will be with you at every step . 
Be very careful , dear boy . 
You must have a man 's prudence , for it lies with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to you , and must look to you . 
Yes , our fortunes depend upon you , and your success is ours . 
We all pray to God to be with you in all that you do . 
Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond words in this matter ; she saw at once how it was , even down to your gloves .
