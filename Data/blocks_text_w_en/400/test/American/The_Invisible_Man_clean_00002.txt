Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police . 
This idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey . 
No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred . 
Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould , the probationary assistant in the National School , this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise , preparing explosives , and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted . 
These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met , or in asking people who had never seen the stranger , leading questions about him . 
But he detected nothing . 
Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside , and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it ; as , for instance , Silas Durgan , who was heard to assert that `` if he chooses to show enself at fairs he 'd make his fortune in no time , '' and being a bit of a theologian , compared the stranger to the man with the one talent . 
Yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic . 
That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away . 
Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers . 
Sussex folk have few superstitions , and it was only after the events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village . 
Even then it was only credited among the women folk . 
But whatever they thought of him , people in Iping , on the whole , agreed in disliking him . 
His irritability , though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker , was an amazing thing to these quiet Sussex villagers . 
The frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then , the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners , the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity , the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors , the pulling down of blinds , the extinction of candles and lamps -- who could agree with such goings on ? 
They drew aside as he passed down the village , and when he had gone by , young humourists would up with coat-collars and down with hat-brims , and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing . 
There was a song popular at that time called `` The Bogey Man '' . 
Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert -LRB- in aid of the church lamps -RRB- , and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared , a bar or so of this tune , more or less sharp or flat , was whistled in the midst of them . 
Also belated little children would call `` Bogey Man ! '' 
after him , and make off tremulously elated . 
Cuss , the general practitioner , was devoured by curiosity . 
The bandages excited his professional interest , the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard . 
All through April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger , and at last , towards Whitsuntide , he could stand it no longer , but hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse . 
He was surprised to find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest 's name . 
`` He give a name , '' said Mrs. Hall -- an assertion which was quite unfounded -- `` but I did n't rightly hear it . '' 
She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man 's name . 
Cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered . 
There was a fairly audible imprecation from within . 
`` Pardon my intrusion , '' said Cuss , and then the door closed and cut Mrs. Hall off from the rest of the conversation . 
She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes , then a cry of surprise , a stirring of feet , a chair flung aside , a bark of laughter , quick steps to the door , and Cuss appeared , his face white , his eyes staring over his shoulder . 
He left the door open behind him , and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps , and she heard his feet hurrying along the road . 
He carried his hat in his hand . 
She stood behind the door , looking at the open door of the parlour . 
Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly , and then his footsteps came across the room . 
She could not see his face where she stood . 
The parlour door slammed , and the place was silent again . 
Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar . 
`` Am I mad ? '' 
Cuss began abruptly , as he entered the shabby little study . 
`` Do I look like an insane person ? '' 
`` What 's happened ? '' 
said the vicar , putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon . 
`` That chap at the inn -- '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Give me something to drink , '' said Cuss , and he sat down . 
When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry -- the only drink the good vicar had available -- he told him of the interview he had just had . 
`` Went in , '' he gasped , `` and began to demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund . 
He 'd stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in , and he sat down lumpily in his chair . 
Sniffed . 
I told him I 'd heard he took an interest in scientific things . 
He said yes . 
Sniffed again . 
Kept on sniffing all the time ; evidently recently caught an infernal cold . 
No wonder , wrapped up like that ! 
I developed the nurse idea , and all the while kept my eyes open . 
Bottles -- chemicals -- everywhere . 
Balance , test-tubes in stands , and a smell of -- evening primrose . 
Would he subscribe ? 
Said he 'd consider it . 
Asked him , point-blank , was he researching . 
Said he was . 
A long research ? 
Got quite cross . ' 
A damnable long research , ' said he , blowing the cork out , so to speak . 
` Oh , ' said I. And out came the grievance . 
The man was just on the boil , and my question boiled him over . 
He had been given a prescription , most valuable prescription -- what for he would n't say . 
Was it medical ? 
` Damn you ! 
What are you fishing after ? ' 
I apologised . 
Dignified sniff and cough . 
He resumed . 
He 'd read it . 
Five ingredients . 
Put it down ; turned his head . 
Draught of air from window lifted the paper . 
Swish , rustle . 
He was working in a room with an open fireplace , he said . 
Saw a flicker , and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward . 
Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney . 
So ! 
Just at that point , to illustrate his story , out came his arm . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` No hand -- just an empty sleeve . 
Lord ! 
I thought , that 's a deformity ! 
Got a cork arm , I suppose , and has taken it off . 
Then , I thought , there 's something odd in that . 
What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open , if there 's nothing in it ? 
There was nothing in it , I tell you . 
Nothing down it , right down to the joint . 
I could see right down it to the elbow , and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth . 
` Good God ! ' 
I said . 
Then he stopped . 
Stared at me with those black goggles of his , and then at his sleeve . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` That 's all . 
He never said a word ; just glared , and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly . ' 
I was saying , ' said he , ` that there was the prescription burning , was n't I ? ' 
Interrogative cough . 
` How the devil , ' said I , ` can you move an empty sleeve like that ? ' 
'Em pty sleeve ? ' 
` Yes , ' said I , ` an empty sleeve . ' '' 
` It 's an empty sleeve , is it ? 
You saw it was an empty sleeve ? ' 
He stood up right away . 
I stood up too . 
He came towards me in three very slow steps , and stood quite close . 
Sniffed venomously . 
I did n't flinch , though I 'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his , and those blinkers , are n't enough to unnerve any one , coming quietly up to you . '' 
` You said it was an empty sleeve ? ' 
he said . 
` Certainly , ' I said . 
At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man , unspectacled , starts scratch . 
Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again , and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again . 
He did it very , very slowly . 
I looked at it . 
Seemed an age . 
` Well ? ' 
said I , clearing my throat , ` there 's nothing in it . ' 
`` Had to say something . 
I was beginning to feel frightened . 
I could see right down it . 
He extended it straight towards me , slowly , slowly -- just like that -- until the cuff was six inches from my face . 
Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that ! 
And then -- '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Something -- exactly like a finger and thumb it felt -- nipped my nose . '' 
Bunting began to laugh . 
`` There was n't anything there ! '' 
said Cuss , his voice running up into a shriek at the `` there . '' 
`` It 's all very well for you to laugh , but I tell you I was so startled , I hit his cuff hard , and turned around , and cut out of the room -- I left him -- '' Cuss stopped . 
There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic . 
He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar 's very inferior sherry . 
`` When I hit his cuff , '' said Cuss , `` I tell you , it felt exactly like hitting an arm . 
And there was n't an arm ! 
There was n't the ghost of an arm ! '' 
Mr. Bunting thought it over . 
He looked suspiciously at Cuss . 
`` It 's a most remarkable story , '' he said . 
He looked very wise and grave indeed . 
`` It 's really , '' said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis , `` a most remarkable story . '' 
The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife . 
It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday , the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities . 
Mrs. Bunting , it seems , woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn , with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed . 
She did not arouse her husband at first , but sat up in bed listening . 
She then distinctly heard the pad , pad , pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the staircase . 
As soon as she felt assured of this , she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible . 
He did not strike a light , but putting on his spectacles , her dressing-gown and his bath slippers , he went out on the landing to listen . 
He heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs , and then a violent sneeze . 
At that he returned to his bedroom , armed himself with the most obvious weapon , the poker , and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible . 
Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing . 
The hour was about four , and the ultimate darkness of the night was past . 
There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall , but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black . 
Everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting 's tread , and the slight movements in the study . 
Then something snapped , the drawer was opened , and there was a rustle of papers . 
Then came an imprecation , and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light . 
Mr. Bunting was now in the hall , and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk . 
But the robber he could not see . 
He stood there in the hall undecided what to do , and Mrs. Bunting , her face white and intent , crept slowly downstairs after him . 
One thing kept Mr. Bunting 's courage ; the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village . 
They heard the chink of money , and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of gold -- two pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether . 
At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action . 
Gripping the poker firmly , he rushed into the room , closely followed by Mrs. Bunting . 
`` Surrender ! '' 
cried Mr. Bunting , fiercely , and then stooped amazed . 
Apparently the room was perfectly empty . 
Yet their conviction that they had , that very moment , heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty . 
For half a minute , perhaps , they stood gaping , then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen , while Mr. Bunting , by a kindred impulse , peered under the desk . 
Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the window-curtains , and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker . 
Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle . 
Then they came to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other . 
`` I could have sworn -- '' said Mr. Bunting . 
`` The candle ! '' 
said Mr. Bunting . 
`` Who lit the candle ? '' 
`` The drawer ! '' 
said Mrs. Bunting . 
`` And the money 's gone ! '' 
She went hastily to the doorway . 
`` Of all the strange occurrences -- '' There was a violent sneeze in the passage . 
They rushed out , and as they did so the kitchen door slammed . 
`` Bring the candle , '' said Mr. Bunting , and led the way . 
They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back . 
As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening , and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond . 
He is certain that nothing went out of the door . 
It opened , stood open for a moment , and then closed with a slam . 
As it did so , the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared . 
It was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen . 
The place was empty . 
They refastened the back door , examined the kitchen , pantry , and scullery thoroughly , and at last went down into the cellar . 
There was not a soul to be found in the house , search as they would . 
Daylight found the vicar and his wife , a quaintly-costumed little couple , still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle . 
Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday , before Millie was hunted out for the day , Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar . 
Their business there was of a private nature , and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer . 
They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room . 
As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair , Hall very properly went upstairs for it . 
On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger 's door was ajar . 
He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed . 
But returning with the bottle , he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back , that the door was in fact simply on the latch . 
And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger 's room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey . 
He distinctly remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts overnight . 
At the sight he stopped , gaping , then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again . 
He rapped at the stranger 's door . 
There was no answer . 
He rapped again ; then pushed the door wide open and entered . 
It was as he expected . 
The bed , the room also , was empty . 
And what was stranger , even to his heavy intelligence , on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments , the only garments so far as he knew , and the bandages of their guest . 
His big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post . 
As Hall stood there he heard his wife 's voice coming out of the depth of the cellar , with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note , by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience . 
`` George ! 
You gart whad a wand ? '' 
At that he turned and hurried down to her . 
`` Janny , '' he said , over the rail of the cellar steps , '' ` tas the truth what Henfrey sez . 
` E 's not in uz room , ' e e n't . 
And the front door 's onbolted . '' 
At first Mrs. Hall did not understand , and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself . 
Hall , still holding the bottle , went first . 
`` If ' e e n't there , '' he said , '' ` is close are . 
And what 's ' e doin ' ` ithout ` is close , then ? 
` Tas a most curious business . '' 
As they came up the cellar steps they both , it was afterwards ascertained , fancied they heard the front door open and shut , but seeing it closed and nothing there , neither said a word to the other about it at the time . 
Mrs. Hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs . 
Someone sneezed on the staircase . 
Hall , following six steps behind , thought that he heard her sneeze . 
She , going on first , was under the impression that Hall was sneezing . 
She flung open the door and stood regarding the room . 
`` Of all the curious ! '' 
she said . 
She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed , and turning , was surprised to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair . 
But in another moment he was beside her . 
She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes . 
`` Cold , '' she said . 
`` He 's been up this hour or more . '' 
As she did so , a most extraordinary thing happened . 
The bed-clothes gathered themselves together , leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak , and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail . 
It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside . 
Immediately after , the stranger 's hat hopped off the bed-post , described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle , and then dashed straight at Mrs. Hall 's face . 
Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand ; and then the chair , flinging the stranger 's coat and trousers carelessly aside , and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger 's , turned itself up with its four legs at Mrs. Hall , seemed to take aim at her for a moment , and charged at her . 
She screamed and turned , and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and Hall out of the room . 
The door slammed violently and was locked . 
The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment , and then abruptly everything was still . 
Mrs. Hall was left almost in a fainting condition in Mr. Hall 's arms on the landing . 
It was with the greatest difficulty that Mr. Hall and Millie , who had been roused by her scream of alarm , succeeded in getting her downstairs , and applying the restoratives customary in such cases . '' 
` Tas sperits , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` I know ` tas sperits . 
I 've read in papers of en . 
Tables and chairs leaping and dancing ... '' `` Take a drop more , Janny , '' said Hall . '' 
` Twill steady ye . '' 
`` Lock him out , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Do n't let him come in again . 
I half guessed -- I might ha ' known . 
With them goggling eyes and bandaged head , and never going to church of a Sunday . 
And all they bottles -- more 'n it 's right for any one to have . 
He 's put the sperits into the furniture ... . 
My good old furniture ! 
'T was in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl . 
To think it should rise up against me now ! '' 
`` Just a drop more , Janny , '' said Hall . 
`` Your nerves is all upset . '' 
They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o'clock sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers , the blacksmith . 
Mr. Hall 's compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary . 
Would Mr. Wadgers come round ? 
He was a knowing man , was Mr. Wadgers , and very resourceful . 
He took quite a grave view of the case . 
`` Arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft , '' was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers . 
`` You warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he . '' 
He came round greatly concerned . 
They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room , but he did n't seem to be in any hurry . 
He preferred to talk in the passage . 
Over the way Huxter 's apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window . 
He was called over to join the discussion . 
Mr. Huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes . 
The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself ; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action . 
`` Let 's have the facts first , '' insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers . 
`` Let 's be sure we 'd be acting perfectly right in bustin ' that there door open . 
A door onbust is always open to bustin ' , but ye ca n't onbust a door once you 've busted en . '' 
And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord , and as they looked up in amazement , they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his . 
He came down stiffly and slowly , staring all the time ; he walked across the passage staring , then stopped . 
`` Look there ! '' 
he said , and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door . 
Then he entered the parlour , and suddenly , swiftly , viciously , slammed the door in their faces . 
Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away . 
They stared at one another . 
`` Well , if that do n't lick everything ! '' 
said Mr. Wadgers , and left the alternative unsaid . 
`` I 'd go in and ask 'n ` bout it , '' said Wadgers , to Mr. Hall . 
`` I 'd d'mand an explanation . '' 
It took some time to bring the landlady 's husband up to that pitch . 
At last he rapped , opened the door , and got as far as , `` Excuse me -- '' `` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the stranger in a tremendous voice , and `` Shut that door after you . '' 
So that brief interview terminated . 
The stranger went into the little parlour of the `` Coach and Horses '' about half-past five in the morning , and there he remained until near midday , the blinds down , the door shut , and none , after Hall 's repulse , venturing near him . 
All that time he must have fasted . 
Thrice he rang his bell , the third time furiously and continuously , but no one answered him . 
`` Him and his ` go to the devil ' indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
Presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage , and two and two were put together . 
Hall , assisted by Wadgers , went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth , the magistrate , and take his advice . 
No one ventured upstairs . 
How the stranger occupied himself is unknown . 
Now and then he would stride violently up and down , and twice came an outburst of curses , a tearing of paper , and a violent smashing of bottles . 
The little group of scared but curious people increased . 
Mrs. Huxter came over ; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties -- for it was Whit Monday -- joined the group with confused interrogations . 
Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds . 
He could see nothing , but gave reason for supposing that he did , and others of the Iping youth presently joined him . 
It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays , and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths , a shooting gallery , and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy . 
The gentlemen wore blue jerseys , the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes . 
Wodger , of the `` Purple Fawn , '' and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns -LRB- which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee -RRB- across the road . 
And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . 
In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . 
So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room . 
About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar . 
`` Mrs. Hall , '' he said . 
Somebody went sheepishly and called for Mrs. Hall . 
Mrs. Hall appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that . 
Hall was still out . 
She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it . 
`` Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? '' 
she said . 
`` Why was n't my breakfast laid ? 
Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? 
Do you think I live without eating ? '' 
`` Why is n't my bill paid ? '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` That 's what I want to know . '' 
`` I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance -- '' `` I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . 
You ca n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? '' 
The stranger swore briefly but vividly . 
`` Nar , nar ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . 
It was universally felt in the bar that Mrs. Hall had the better of him . 
His next words showed as much . 
`` Look here , my good woman -- '' he began . 
`` Do n't ` good woman ' me , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` I 've told you my remittance has n't come . '' 
`` Remittance indeed ! '' 
said Mrs. Hall . 
`` Still , I daresay in my pocket -- '' `` You told me three days ago that you had n't anything but a sovereign 's worth of silver upon you . '' 
`` Well , I 've found some more -- '' '' ` Ul-lo ! '' 
from the bar . 
`` I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
That seemed to annoy the stranger very much . 
He stamped his foot . 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
he said . 
`` That I wonder where you found it , '' said Mrs. Hall . 
`` And before I take any bills or get any breakfasts , or do any such things whatsoever , you got to tell me one or two things I do n't understand , and what nobody do n't understand , and what everybody is very anxious to understand . 
I want to know what you been doing t ` my chair upstairs , and I want to know how 't is your room was empty , and how you got in again . 
Them as stops in this house comes in by the doors -- that 's the rule of the house , and that you did n't do , and what I want to know is how you did come in . 
And I want to know -- '' Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched , stamped his foot , and said , `` Stop ! '' 
with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly . 
`` You do n't understand , '' he said , `` who I am or what I am . 
I 'll show you . 
By Heaven ! 
I 'll show you . '' 
Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it . 
The centre of his face became a black cavity . 
`` Here , '' he said . 
He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she , staring at his metamorphosed face , accepted automatically . 
Then , when she saw what it was , she screamed loudly , dropped it , and staggered back . 
The nose -- it was the stranger 's nose ! 
pink and shining -- rolled on the floor . 
Then he removed his spectacles , and everyone in the bar gasped . 
He took off his hat , and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages . 
For a moment they resisted him . 
A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar . 
`` Oh , my Gard ! '' 
said some one . 
Then off they came . 
It was worse than anything . 
Mrs. Hall , standing open-mouthed and horror-struck , shrieked at what she saw , and made for the door of the house . 
Everyone began to move . 
They were prepared for scars , disfigurements , tangible horrors , but nothing ! 
The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar , making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them . 
Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps . 
For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation , was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him , and then -- nothingness , no visible thing at all ! 
People down the village heard shouts and shrieks , and looking up the street saw the `` Coach and Horses '' violently firing out its humanity . 
They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her , and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie , who , emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult , had come upon the headless stranger from behind . 
These increased suddenly . 
Forthwith everyone all down the street , the sweetstuff seller , cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant , the swing man , little boys and girls , rustic dandies , smart wenches , smocked elders and aproned gipsies -- began running towards the inn , and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people , and rapidly increasing , swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested , in front of Mrs. Hall 's establishment . 
Everyone seemed eager to talk at once , and the result was Babel . 
A small group supported Mrs. Hall , who was picked up in a state of collapse . 
There was a conference , and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness . 
`` O Bogey ! '' 
`` What 's he been doin ' , then ? '' 
`` Ai n't hurt the girl , ` as ` e ? '' 
`` Run at en with a knife , I believe . '' 
`` No ` ed , I tell ye . 
I do n't mean no manner of speaking . 
I mean marn ` ithout a ` ed ! '' 
`` Narnsense ! 
't is some conjuring trick . '' 
`` Fetched off ` is wrapping , ' e did -- '' In its struggles to see in through the open door , the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge , with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn . 
`` He stood for a moment , I heerd the gal scream , and he turned . 
I saw her skirts whisk , and he went after her . 
Did n't take ten seconds .
