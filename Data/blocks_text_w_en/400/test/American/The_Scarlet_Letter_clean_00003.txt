I will die first ! '' 
`` My poor woman , '' said the not unkind old minister , `` the child shall be well cared for -- far better than thou canst do for it . '' 
`` God gave her into my keeping ! '' 
repeated Hester Prynne , raising her voice almost to a shriek . 
`` I will not give her up ! '' 
And here by a sudden impulse , she turned to the young clergyman , Mr. Dimmesdale , at whom , up to this moment , she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyes . 
`` Speak thou for me ! '' 
cried she . 
`` Thou wast my pastor , and hadst charge of my soul , and knowest me better than these men can . 
I will not lose the child ! 
Speak for me ! 
Thou knowest -- for thou hast sympathies which these men lack -- thou knowest what is in my heart , and what are a mother 's rights , and how much the stronger they are when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter ! 
Look thou to it ! 
I will not lose the child ! 
Look to it ! '' 
At this wild and singular appeal , which indicated that Hester Prynne 's situation had provoked her to little less than madness , the young minister at once came forward , pale , and holding his hand over his heart , as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation . 
He looked now more careworn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of Hester 's public ignominy ; and whether it were his failing health , or whatever the cause might be , his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth . 
`` There is truth in what she says , '' began the minister , with a voice sweet , tremulous , but powerful , insomuch that the hall re-echoed and the hollow armour rang with it -- `` truth in what Hester says , and in the feeling which inspires her ! 
God gave her the child , and gave her , too , an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirements -- both seemingly so peculiar -- which no other mortal being can possess . 
And , moreover , is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child ? '' 
`` Ay -- how is that , good Master Dimmesdale ? '' 
interrupted the Governor . 
`` Make that plain , I pray you ! '' 
`` It must be even so , '' resumed the minister . 
`` For , if we deem it otherwise , do we not thereby say that the Heavenly Father , the creator of all flesh , hath lightly recognised a deed of sin , and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love ? 
This child of its father 's guilt and its mother 's shame has come from the hand of God , to work in many ways upon her heart , who pleads so earnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her . 
It was meant for a blessing -- for the one blessing of her life ! 
It was meant , doubtless , the mother herself hath told us , for a retribution , too ; a torture to be felt at many an unthought-of moment ; a pang , a sting , an ever-recurring agony , in the midst of a troubled joy ! 
Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child , so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom ? '' 
`` Well said again ! '' 
cried good Mr. Wilson . 
`` I feared the woman had no better thought than to make a mountebank of her child ! '' 
`` Oh , not so ! 
-- not so ! '' 
continued Mr. Dimmesdale . 
`` She recognises , believe me , the solemn miracle which God hath wrought in the existence of that child . 
And may she feel , too -- what , methinks , is the very truth -- that this boon was meant , above all things else , to keep the mother 's soul alive , and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which Satan might else have sought to plunge her ! 
Therefore it is good for this poor , sinful woman , that she hath an infant immortality , a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow , confided to her care -- to be trained up by her to righteousness , to remind her , at every moment , of her fall , but yet to teach her , as if it were by the Creator 's sacred pledge , that , if she bring the child to heaven , the child also will bring its parents thither ! 
Herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father . 
For Hester Prynne 's sake , then , and no less for the poor child 's sake , let us leave them as Providence hath seen fit to place them ! '' 
`` You speak , my friend , with a strange earnestness , '' said old Roger Chillingworth , smiling at him . 
`` And there is a weighty import in what my young brother hath spoken , '' added the Rev. Mr. Wilson . 
`` What say you , worshipful Master Bellingham ? 
Hath he not pleaded well for the poor woman ? '' 
`` Indeed hath he , '' answered the magistrate ; `` and hath adduced such arguments , that we will even leave the matter as it now stands ; so long , at least , as there shall be no further scandal in the woman . 
Care must be had nevertheless , to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism , at thy hands or Master Dimmesdale 's . 
Moreover , at a proper season , the tithing-men must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting . '' 
The young minister , on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from the group , and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the window-curtain ; while the shadow of his figure , which the sunlight cast upon the floor , was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal . 
Pearl , that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards him , and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own , laid her cheek against it ; a caress so tender , and withal so unobtrusive , that her mother , who was looking on , asked herself -- `` Is that my Pearl ? '' 
Yet she knew that there was love in the child 's heart , although it mostly revealed itself in passion , and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now . 
The minister -- for , save the long-sought regards of woman , nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference , accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct , and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be loved -- the minister looked round , laid his hand on the child 's head , hesitated an instant , and then kissed her brow . 
Little Pearl 's unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer ; she laughed , and went capering down the hall so airily , that old Mr. Wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor . 
`` The little baggage hath witchcraft in her , I profess , '' said he to Mr. Dimmesdale . 
`` She needs no old woman 's broomstick to fly withal ! '' 
`` A strange child ! '' 
remarked old Roger Chillingworth . 
`` It is easy to see the mother 's part in her . 
Would it be beyond a philosopher 's research , think ye , gentlemen , to analyse that child 's nature , and , from it make a mould , to give a shrewd guess at the father ? '' 
`` Nay ; it would be sinful , in such a question , to follow the clue of profane philosophy , '' said Mr. Wilson . 
`` Better to fast and pray upon it ; and still better , it may be , to leave the mystery as we find it , unless Providence reveal it of its own accord . 
Thereby , every good Christian man hath a title to show a father 's kindness towards the poor , deserted babe . '' 
The affair being so satisfactorily concluded , Hester Prynne , with Pearl , departed from the house . 
As they descended the steps , it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was thrown open , and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of Mistress Hibbins , Governor Bellingham 's bitter-tempered sister , and the same who , a few years later , was executed as a witch . 
`` Hist , hist ! '' 
said she , while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house . 
`` Wilt thou go with us to-night ? 
There will be a merry company in the forest ; and I well-nigh promised the Black Man that comely Hester Prynne should make one . '' 
`` Make my excuse to him , so please you ! '' 
answered Hester , with a triumphant smile . 
`` I must tarry at home , and keep watch over my little Pearl . 
Had they taken her from me , I would willingly have gone with thee into the forest , and signed my name in the Black Man 's book too , and that with mine own blood ! '' 
`` We shall have thee there anon ! '' 
said the witch-lady , frowning , as she drew back her head . 
But here -- if we suppose this interview betwixt Mistress Hibbins and Hester Prynne to be authentic , and not a parable -- was already an illustration of the young minister 's argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty . 
Even thus early had the child saved her from Satan 's snare . 
Under the appellation of Roger Chillingworth , the reader will remember , was hidden another name , which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken . 
It has been related , how , in the crowd that witnessed Hester Prynne 's ignominious exposure , stood a man , elderly , travel-worn , who , just emerging from the perilous wilderness , beheld the woman , in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home , set up as a type of sin before the people . 
Her matronly fame was trodden under all men 's feet . 
Infamy was babbling around her in the public market-place . 
For her kindred , should the tidings ever reach them , and for the companions of her unspotted life , there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour ; which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship . 
Then why -- since the choice was with himself -- should the individual , whose connexion with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all , come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable ? 
He resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame . 
Unknown to all but Hester Prynne , and possessing the lock and key of her silence , he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind , and , as regarded his former ties and interest , to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean , whither rumour had long ago consigned him . 
This purpose once effected , new interests would immediately spring up , and likewise a new purpose ; dark , it is true , if not guilty , but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties . 
In pursuance of this resolve , he took up his residence in the Puritan town as Roger Chillingworth , without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure . 
As his studies , at a previous period of his life , had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day , it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received . 
Skilful men , of the medical and chirurgical profession , were of rare occurrence in the colony . 
They seldom , it would appear , partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic . 
In their researches into the human frame , it may be that the higher and more subtle faculties of such men were materialised , and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism , which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself . 
At all events , the health of the good town of Boston , so far as medicine had aught to do with it , had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary , whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favour than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma . 
The only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor . 
To such a professional body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition . 
He soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic ; in which every remedy contained a multitude of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients , as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life . 
In his Indian captivity , moreover , he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots ; nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple medicines , Nature 's boon to the untutored savage , had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the European Pharmacopoeia , which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating . 
This learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward forms of a religious life ; and early after his arrival , had chosen for his spiritual guide the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale . 
The young divine , whose scholar-like renown still lived in Oxford , was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a heavenly ordained apostle , destined , should he live and labour for the ordinary term of life , to do as great deeds , for the now feeble New England Church , as the early Fathers had achieved for the infancy of the Christian faith . 
About this period , however , the health of Mr. Dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail . 
By those best acquainted with his habits , the paleness of the young minister 's cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study , his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty , and more than all , to the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice , in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp . 
Some declared , that if Mr. Dimmesdale were really going to die , it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet . 
He himself , on the other hand , with characteristic humility , avowed his belief that if Providence should see fit to remove him , it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth . 
With all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline , there could be no question of the fact . 
His form grew emaciated ; his voice , though still rich and sweet , had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it ; he was often observed , on any slight alarm or other sudden accident , to put his hand over his heart with first a flush and then a paleness , indicative of pain . 
Such was the young clergyman 's condition , and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished , all untimely , when Roger Chillingworth made his advent to the town . 
His first entry on the scene , few people could tell whence , dropping down as it were out of the sky or starting from the nether earth , had an aspect of mystery , which was easily heightened to the miraculous . 
He was now known to be a man of skill ; it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms of wild-flowers , and dug up roots and plucked off twigs from the forest-trees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes . 
He was heard to speak of Sir Kenelm Digby and other famous men -- whose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernatural -- as having been his correspondents or associates . 
Why , with such rank in the learned world , had he come hither ? 
What , could he , whose sphere was in great cities , be seeking in the wilderness ? 
In answer to this query , a rumour gained ground -- and however absurd , was entertained by some very sensible people -- that Heaven had wrought an absolute miracle , by transporting an eminent Doctor of Physic from a German university bodily through the air and setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale 's study ! 
Individuals of wiser faith , indeed , who knew that Heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage-effect of what is called miraculous interposition , were inclined to see a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth 's so opportune arrival . 
This idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman ; he attached himself to him as a parishioner , and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility . 
He expressed great alarm at his pastor 's state of health , but was anxious to attempt the cure , and , if early undertaken , seemed not despondent of a favourable result . 
The elders , the deacons , the motherly dames , and the young and fair maidens of Mr. Dimmesdale 's flock , were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physician 's frankly offered skill . 
Mr. Dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties . 
`` I need no medicine , '' said he . 
But how could the young minister say so , when , with every successive Sabbath , his cheek was paler and thinner , and his voice more tremulous than before -- when it had now become a constant habit , rather than a casual gesture , to press his hand over his heart ? 
Was he weary of his labours ? 
Did he wish to die ? 
These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston , and the deacons of his church , who , to use their own phrase , `` dealt with him , '' on the sin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out . 
He listened in silence , and finally promised to confer with the physician . 
`` Were it God 's will , '' said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale , when , in fulfilment of this pledge , he requested old Roger Chillingworth 's professional advice , `` I could be well content that my labours , and my sorrows , and my sins , and my pains , should shortly end with me , and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave , and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state , rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf . '' 
`` Ah , '' replied Roger Chillingworth , with that quietness , which , whether imposed or natural , marked all his deportment , `` it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak . 
Youthful men , not having taken a deep root , give up their hold of life so easily ! 
And saintly men , who walk with God on earth , would fain be away , to walk with him on the golden pavements of the New Jerusalem . '' 
`` Nay , '' rejoined the young minister , putting his hand to his heart , with a flush of pain flitting over his brow , `` were I worthier to walk there , I could be better content to toil here . '' 
`` Good men ever interpret themselves too meanly , '' said the physician . 
In this manner , the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale . 
As not only the disease interested the physician , but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient , these two men , so different in age , came gradually to spend much time together . 
For the sake of the minister 's health , and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them , they took long walks on the sea-shore , or in the forest ; mingling various walks with the splash and murmur of the waves , and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops . 
Often , likewise , one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement . 
There was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science , in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope ; together with a range and freedom of ideas , that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession . 
In truth , he was startled , if not shocked , to find this attribute in the physician . 
Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest , a true religionist , with the reverential sentiment largely developed , and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed , and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time . 
In no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views ; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him , supporting , while it confined him within its iron framework . 
Not the less , however , though with a tremulous enjoyment , did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse . 
It was as if a window were thrown open , admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study , where his life was wasting itself away , amid lamp-light , or obstructed day-beams , and the musty fragrance , be it sensual or moral , that exhales from books . 
But the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort . 
So the minister , and the physician with him , withdrew again within the limits of what their Church defined as orthodox . 
Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully , both as he saw him in his ordinary life , keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him , and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery , the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character . 
He deemed it essential , it would seem , to know the man , before attempting to do him good . 
Wherever there is a heart and an intellect , the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these . 
In Arthur Dimmesdale , thought and imagination were so active , and sensibility so intense , that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there . 
So Roger Chillingworth -- the man of skill , the kind and friendly physician -- strove to go deep into his patient 's bosom , delving among his principles , prying into his recollections , and probing everything with a cautious touch , like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern . 
Few secrets can escape an investigator , who has opportunity and licence to undertake such a quest , and skill to follow it up . 
A man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician . 
If the latter possess native sagacity , and a nameless something more , -- let us call it intuition ; if he show no intrusive egotism , nor disagreeable prominent characteristics of his own ; if he have the power , which must be born with him , to bring his mind into such affinity with his patient 's , that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought ; if such revelations be received without tumult , and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence , an inarticulate breath , and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood ; if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognised character as a physician ; -- then , at some inevitable moment , will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved , and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream , bringing all its mysteries into the daylight . 
Roger Chillingworth possessed all , or most , of the attributes above enumerated . 
Nevertheless , time went on ; a kind of intimacy , as we have said , grew up between these two cultivated minds , which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon ; they discussed every topic of ethics and religion , of public affairs , and private character ; they talked much , on both sides , of matters that seemed personal to themselves ; and yet no secret , such as the physician fancied must exist there , ever stole out of the minister 's consciousness into his companion 's ear . 
The latter had his suspicions , indeed , that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale 's bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him . 
It was a strange reserve ! 
After a time , at a hint from Roger Chillingworth , the friends of Mr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house ; so that every ebb and flow of the minister 's life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician . 
There was much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was attained . 
It was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergyman 's welfare ; unless , indeed , as often urged by such as felt authorised to do so , he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels , spiritually devoted to him , to become his devoted wife . 
This latter step , however , there was no present prospect that Arthur Dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take ; he rejected all suggestions of the kind , as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of Church discipline . 
Doomed by his own choice , therefore , as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was , to eat his unsavoury morsel always at another 's board , and endure the life-long chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at another 's fireside , it truly seemed that this sagacious , experienced , benevolent old physician , with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor , was the very man , of all mankind , to be constantly within reach of his voice . 
The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow , of good social rank , who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of King 's Chapel has since been built . 
It had the graveyard , originally Isaac Johnson 's home-field , on one side , and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections , suited to their respective employments , in both minister and man of physic . 
The motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment , with a sunny exposure , and heavy window-curtains , to create a noontide shadow when desirable . 
The walls were hung round with tapestry , said to be from the Gobelin looms , and , at all events , representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba , and Nathan the Prophet , in colours still unfaded , but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer . 
Here the pale clergyman piled up his library , rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers , and the lore of Rabbis , and monkish erudition , of which the Protestant divines , even while they vilified and decried that class of writers , were yet constrained often to avail themselves . 
On the other side of the house , old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory : not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete , but provided with a distilling apparatus and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals , which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose . 
With such commodiousness of situation , these two learned persons sat themselves down , each in his own domain , yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other , and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another 's business . 
And the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale 's best discerning friends , as we have intimated , very reasonably imagined that the hand of Providence had done all this for the purpose -- besought in so many public and domestic and secret prayers -- of restoring the young minister to health . 
But , it must now be said , another portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt Mr. Dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician . 
When an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes , it is exceedingly apt to be deceived . 
When , however , it forms its judgment , as it usually does , on the intuitions of its great and warm heart , the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring as to possess the character of truth supernaturally revealed . 
The people , in the case of which we speak , could justify its prejudice against Roger Chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation . 
There was an aged handicraftsman , it is true , who had been a citizen of London at the period of Sir Thomas Overbury 's murder , now some thirty years agone ; he testified to having seen the physician , under some other name , which the narrator of the story had now forgotten , in company with Dr. Forman , the famous old conjurer , who was implicated in the affair of Overbury . 
Two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill , during his Indian captivity , had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests , who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters , often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art . 
A large number -- and many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable in other matters -- affirmed that Roger Chillingworth 's aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town , and especially since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale . 
At first , his expression had been calm , meditative , scholar-like . 
Now there was something ugly and evil in his face , which they had not previously noticed , and which grew still the more obvious to sight the oftener they looked upon him . 
According to the vulgar idea , the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions , and was fed with infernal fuel ; and so , as might be expected , his visage was getting sooty with the smoke . 
To sum up the matter , it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale , like many other personages of special sanctity , in all ages of the Christian world , was haunted either by Satan himself or Satan 's emissary , in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth . 
This diabolical agent had the Divine permission , for a season , to burrow into the clergyman 's intimacy , and plot against his soul . 
No sensible man , it was confessed , could doubt on which side the victory would turn . 
The people looked , with an unshaken hope , to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win . 
Meanwhile , nevertheless , it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph . 
Alas ! 
to judge from the gloom and terror in the depth of the poor minister 's eyes , the battle was a sore one , and the victory anything but secure . 
Old Roger Chillingworth , throughout life , had been calm in temperament , kindly , though not of warm affections , but ever , and in all his relations with the world , a pure and upright man . 
He had begun an investigation , as he imagined , with the severe and equal integrity of a judge , desirous only of truth , even as if the question involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem , instead of human passions , and wrongs inflicted on himself . 
But , as he proceeded , a terrible fascination , a kind of fierce , though still calm , necessity , seized the old man within its gripe , and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding . 
He now dug into the poor clergyman 's heart , like a miner searching for gold ; or , rather , like a sexton delving into a grave , possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead man 's bosom , but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption . 
Alas , for his own soul , if these were what he sought ! 
Sometimes a light glimmered out of the physician 's eyes , burning blue and ominous , like the reflection of a furnace , or , let us say , like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan 's awful doorway in the hillside , and quivered on the pilgrim 's face . 
The soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him . 
`` This man , '' said he , at one such moment , to himself , `` pure as they deem him -- all spiritual as he seems -- hath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother . 
Let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein ! '' 
Then after long search into the minister 's dim interior , and turning over many precious materials , in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race , warm love of souls , pure sentiments , natural piety , strengthened by thought and study , and illuminated by revelation -- all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker -- he would turn back , discouraged , and begin his quest towards another point . 
He groped along as stealthily , with as cautious a tread , and as wary an outlook , as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleep -- or , it may be , broad awake -- with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye . 
In spite of his premeditated carefulness , the floor would now and then creak ; his garments would rustle ; the shadow of his presence , in a forbidden proximity , would be thrown across his victim . 
In other words , Mr. Dimmesdale , whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition , would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him . 
But Old Roger Chillingworth , too , had perceptions that were almost intuitive ; and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him , there the physician sat ; his kind , watchful , sympathising , but never intrusive friend . 
Yet Mr. Dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individual 's character more perfectly , if a certain morbidness , to which sick hearts are liable , had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind . 
Trusting no man as his friend , he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared . 
He therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him , daily receiving the old physician in his study , or visiting the laboratory , and , for recreation 's sake , watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency . 
One day , leaning his forehead on his hand , and his elbow on the sill of the open window , that looked towards the grave-yard , he talked with Roger Chillingworth , while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants . 
`` Where , '' asked he , with a look askance at them -- for it was the clergyman 's peculiarity that he seldom , now-a-days , looked straight forth at any object , whether human or inanimate , `` where , my kind doctor , did you gather those herbs , with such a dark , flabby leaf ? '' 
`` Even in the graveyard here at hand , '' answered the physician , continuing his employment . 
`` They are new to me . 
I found them growing on a grave , which bore no tombstone , no other memorial of the dead man , save these ugly weeds , that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance . 
They grew out of his heart , and typify , it may be , some hideous secret that was buried with him , and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime . '' 
`` Perchance , '' said Mr. Dimmesdale , `` he earnestly desired it , but could not . '' 
`` And wherefore ? '' 
rejoined the physician . 
`` Wherefore not ; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin , that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart , to make manifest , an outspoken crime ? '' 
`` That , good sir , is but a phantasy of yours , '' replied the minister . 
`` There can be , if I forbode aright , no power , short of the Divine mercy , to disclose , whether by uttered words , or by type or emblem , the secrets that may be buried in the human heart . 
The heart , making itself guilty of such secrets , must perforce hold them , until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed . 
Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ , as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds , then to be made , is intended as a part of the retribution . 
That , surely , were a shallow view of it . 
No ; these revelations , unless I greatly err , are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings , who will stand waiting , on that day , to see the dark problem of this life made plain . 
A knowledge of men 's hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem . 
And , I conceive moreover , that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of , will yield them up , at that last day , not with reluctance , but with a joy unutterable . '' 
`` Then why not reveal it here ? '' 
asked Roger Chillingworth , glancing quietly aside at the minister . 
`` Why should not the guilty ones sooner avail themselves of this unutterable solace ? '' 
`` They mostly do , '' said the clergyman , griping hard at his breast , as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain . 
`` Many , many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me , not only on the death-bed , but while strong in life , and fair in reputation . 
And ever , after such an outpouring , oh , what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful brethren ! 
even as in one who at last draws free air , after a long stifling with his own polluted breath . 
How can it be otherwise ? 
Why should a wretched man -- guilty , we will say , of murder -- prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart , rather than fling it forth at once , and let the universe take care of it ! '' 
`` Yet some men bury their secrets thus , '' observed the calm physician . 
`` True ; there are such men , '' answered Mr. Dimmesdale . 
`` But not to suggest more obvious reasons , it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature . 
Or -- can we not suppose it ? 
-- guilty as they may be , retaining , nevertheless , a zeal for God 's glory and man 's welfare , they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men ; because , thenceforward , no good can be achieved by them ; no evil of the past be redeemed by better service . 
So , to their own unutterable torment , they go about among their fellow-creatures , looking pure as new-fallen snow , while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they can not rid themselves . '' 
`` These men deceive themselves , '' said Roger Chillingworth , with somewhat more emphasis than usual , and making a slight gesture with his forefinger . 
`` They fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them . 
Their love for man , their zeal for God 's service -- these holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door , and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them . 
But , if they seek to glorify God , let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands ! 
If they would serve their fellowmen , let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience , in constraining them to penitential self-abasement ! 
Would thou have me to believe , O wise and pious friend , that a false show can be better -- can be more for God 's glory , or man ' welfare -- than God 's own truth ? 
Trust me , such men deceive themselves ! '' 
`` It may be so , '' said the young clergyman , indifferently , as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable . 
He had a ready faculty , indeed , of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament . 
-- `` But , now , I would ask of my well-skilled physician , whether , in good sooth , he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine ? '' 
Before Roger Chillingworth could answer , they heard the clear , wild laughter of a young child 's voice , proceeding from the adjacent burial-ground . 
Looking instinctively from the open window -- for it was summer-time -- the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure . 
Pearl looked as beautiful as the day , but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which , whenever they occurred , seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact . 
She now skipped irreverently from one grave to another ; until coming to the broad , flat , armorial tombstone of a departed worthy -- perhaps of Isaac Johnson himself -- she began to dance upon it . 
In reply to her mother 's command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously , little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb . 
Taking a handful of these , she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom , to which the burrs , as their nature was , tenaciously adhered . 
Hester did not pluck them off . 
Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window and smiled grimly down . 
`` There is no law , nor reverence for authority , no regard for human ordinances or opinions , right or wrong , mixed up with that child 's composition , '' remarked he , as much to himself as to his companion . 
`` I saw her , the other day , bespatter the Governor himself with water at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane . 
What , in heaven 's name , is she ? 
Is the imp altogether evil ? 
Hath she affections ? 
Hath she any discoverable principle of being ? '' 
`` None , save the freedom of a broken law , '' answered Mr. Dimmesdale , in a quiet way , as if he had been discussing the point within himself , `` Whether capable of good , I know not . '' 
The child probably overheard their voices , for , looking up to the window with a bright , but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence , she threw one of the prickly burrs at the Rev. Mr. Dimmesdale . 
The sensitive clergyman shrank , with nervous dread , from the light missile . 
Detecting his emotion , Pearl clapped her little hands in the most extravagant ecstacy . 
Hester Prynne , likewise , had involuntarily looked up , and all these four persons , old and young , regarded one another in silence , till the child laughed aloud , and shouted -- `` Come away , mother ! 
Come away , or yonder old black man will catch you ! 
He hath got hold of the minister already . 
Come away , mother or he will catch you ! 
But he can not catch little Pearl ! '' 
So she drew her mother away , skipping , dancing , and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people , like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation , nor owned herself akin to it . 
It was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements , and must perforce be permitted to live her own life , and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime . 
`` There goes a woman , '' resumed Roger Chillingworth , after a pause , `` who , be her demerits what they may , hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne . 
Is Hester Prynne the less miserable , think you , for that scarlet letter on her breast ? '' 
`` I do verily believe it , '' answered the clergyman . 
`` Nevertheless , I can not answer for her . 
There was a look of pain in her face which I would gladly have been spared the sight of . 
But still , methinks , it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain , as this poor woman Hester is , than to cover it up in his heart . '' 
There was another pause , and the physician began anew to examine and arrange the plants which he had gathered . 
`` You inquired of me , a little time agone , '' said he , at length , `` my judgment as touching your health . '' 
`` I did , '' answered the clergyman , `` and would gladly learn it . 
Speak frankly , I pray you , be it for life or death . '' 
`` Freely then , and plainly , '' said the physician , still busy with his plants , but keeping a wary eye on Mr. Dimmesdale , `` the disorder is a strange one ; not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifested , -- in so far , at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation . 
Looking daily at you , my good sir , and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by , I should deem you a man sore sick , it may be , yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you . 
But I know not what to say , the disease is what I seem to know , yet know it not . '' 
`` You speak in riddles , learned sir , '' said the pale minister , glancing aside out of the window . 
`` Then , to speak more plainly , '' continued the physician , `` and I crave pardon , sir , should it seem to require pardon , for this needful plainness of my speech . 
Let me ask as your friend , as one having charge , under Providence , of your life and physical well being , hath all the operations of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me ? '' 
`` How can you question it ? '' 
asked the minister . 
`` Surely it were child 's play to call in a physician and then hide the sore ! '' 
`` You would tell me , then , that I know all ? '' 
said Roger Chillingworth , deliberately , and fixing an eye , bright with intense and concentrated intelligence , on the minister 's face . 
`` Be it so ! 
But again ! 
He to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open , knoweth , oftentimes , but half the evil which he is called upon to cure . 
A bodily disease , which we look upon as whole and entire within itself , may , after all , be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part . 
Your pardon once again , good sir , if my speech give the shadow of offence . 
You , sir , of all men whom I have known , are he whose body is the closest conjoined , and imbued , and identified , so to speak , with the spirit whereof it is the instrument . '' 
`` Then I need ask no further , '' said the clergyman , somewhat hastily rising from his chair . 
`` You deal not , I take it , in medicine for the soul ! '' 
`` Thus , a sickness , '' continued Roger Chillingworth , going on , in an unaltered tone , without heeding the interruption , but standing up and confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister , with his low , dark , and misshapen figure , -- `` a sickness , a sore place , if we may so call it , in your spirit hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame . 
Would you , therefore , that your physician heal the bodily evil ? 
How may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul ? '' 
`` No , not to thee ! 
not to an earthly physician ! '' 
cried Mr. Dimmesdale , passionately , and turning his eyes , full and bright , and with a kind of fierceness , on old Roger Chillingworth . 
`` Not to thee ! 
But , if it be the soul 's disease , then do I commit myself to the one Physician of the soul ! 
He , if it stand with His good pleasure , can cure , or he can kill . 
Let Him do with me as , in His justice and wisdom , He shall see good . 
But who art thou , that meddlest in this matter ? 
that dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his God ? '' 
With a frantic gesture he rushed out of the room . 
`` It is as well to have made this step , '' said Roger Chillingworth to himself , looking after the minister , with a grave smile . 
`` There is nothing lost . 
We shall be friends again anon . 
But see , now , how passion takes hold upon this man , and hurrieth him out of himself ! 
As with one passion so with another . 
He hath done a wild thing ere now , this pious Master Dimmesdale , in the hot passion of his heart . '' 
It proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two companions , on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore . 
The young clergyman , after a few hours of privacy , was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper , which there had been nothing in the physician 's words to excuse or palliate . 
He marvelled , indeed , at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man , when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow , and which the minister himself had expressly sought . 
With these remorseful feelings , he lost no time in making the amplest apologies , and besought his friend still to continue the care which , if not successful in restoring him to health , had , in all probability , been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour . 
Roger Chillingworth readily assented , and went on with his medical supervision of the minister ; doing his best for him , in all good faith , but always quitting the patient 's apartment , at the close of the professional interview , with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips . 
This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale 's presence , but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold . 
`` A rare case , '' he muttered . 
`` I must needs look deeper into it . 
A strange sympathy betwixt soul and body ! 
Were it only for the art 's sake , I must search this matter to the bottom . '' 
It came to pass , not long after the scene above recorded , that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale , noon-day , and entirely unawares , fell into a deep , deep slumber , sitting in his chair , with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table . 
It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature . 
The profound depth of the minister 's repose was the more remarkable , inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful , and as easily scared away , as a small bird hopping on a twig . 
To such an unwonted remoteness , however , had his spirit now withdrawn into itself that he stirred not in his chair when old Roger Chillingworth , without any extraordinary precaution , came into the room . 
The physician advanced directly in front of his patient , laid his hand upon his bosom , and thrust aside the vestment , that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye . 
Then , indeed , Mr. Dimmesdale shuddered , and slightly stirred . 
After a brief pause , the physician turned away . 
But with what a wild look of wonder , joy , and horror ! 
With what a ghastly rapture , as it were , too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features , and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure , and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling , and stamped his foot upon the floor ! 
Had a man seen old Roger Chillingworth , at that moment of his ecstasy , he would have had no need to ask how Satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven , and won into his kingdom . 
But what distinguished the physician 's ecstasy from Satan 's was the trait of wonder in it ! 
After the incident last described , the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician , though externally the same , was really of another character than it had previously been . 
The intellect of Roger Chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it . 
It was not , indeed , precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread . 
Calm , gentle , passionless , as he appeared , there was yet , we fear , a quiet depth of malice , hitherto latent , but active now , in this unfortunate old man , which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy . 
To make himself the one trusted friend , to whom should be confided all the fear , the remorse , the agony , the ineffectual repentance , the backward rush of sinful thoughts , expelled in vain ! 
All that guilty sorrow , hidden from the world , whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven , to be revealed to him , the Pitiless -- to him , the Unforgiving ! 
All that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man , to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance ! 
The clergyman 's shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme . 
Roger Chillingworth , however , was inclined to be hardly , if at all , less satisfied with the aspect of affairs , which Providence -- using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes , and , perchance , pardoning , where it seemed most to punish -- had substituted for his black devices . 
A revelation , he could almost say , had been granted to him . 
It mattered little for his object , whether celestial or from what other region . 
By its aid , in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr. Dimmesdale , not merely the external presence , but the very inmost soul of the latter , seemed to be brought out before his eyes , so that he could see and comprehend its every movement . 
He became , thenceforth , not a spectator only , but a chief actor in the poor minister 's interior world . 
He could play upon him as he chose . 
Would he arouse him with a throb of agony ? 
The victim was for ever on the rack ; it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engine : and the physician knew it well . 
Would he startle him with sudden fear ? 
As at the waving of a magician 's wand , up rose a grisly phantom -- up rose a thousand phantoms -- in many shapes , of death , or more awful shame , all flocking round about the clergyman , and pointing with their fingers at his breast ! 
All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect , that the minister , though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him , could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature . 
True , he looked doubtfully , fearfully -- even , at times , with horror and the bitterness of hatred -- at the deformed figure of the old physician . 
His gestures , his gait , his grizzled beard , his slightest and most indifferent acts , the very fashion of his garments , were odious in the clergyman 's sight ; a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself . 
For , as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence , so Mr. Dimmesdale , conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his heart 's entire substance , attributed all his presentiments to no other cause . 
He took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to Roger Chillingworth , disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them , and did his best to root them out . 
Unable to accomplish this , he nevertheless , as a matter of principle , continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man , and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to which -- poor forlorn creature that he was , and more wretched than his victim -- the avenger had devoted himself . 
While thus suffering under bodily disease , and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul , and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy , the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office . 
He won it indeed , in great part , by his sorrows . 
His intellectual gifts , his moral perceptions , his power of experiencing and communicating emotion , were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life . 
His fame , though still on its upward slope , already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellow-clergymen , eminent as several of them were . 
There are scholars among them , who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore , connected with the divine profession , than Mr. Dimmesdale had lived ; and who might well , therefore , be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother . 
There were men , too , of a sturdier texture of mind than his , and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd , hard iron , or granite understanding ; which , duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient , constitutes a highly respectable , efficacious , and unamiable variety of the clerical species . 
There were others again , true saintly fathers , whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books , and by patient thought , and etherealised , moreover , by spiritual communications with the better world , into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages , with their garments of mortality still clinging to them . 
All that they lacked was , the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at Pentecost , in tongues of flame ; symbolising , it would seem , not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages , but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the heart 's native language . 
These fathers , otherwise so apostolic , lacked Heaven 's last and rarest attestation of their office , the Tongue of Flame . 
They would have vainly sought -- had they ever dreamed of seeking -- to express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images . 
Their voices came down , afar and indistinctly , from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt . 
Not improbably , it was to this latter class of men that Mr. Dimmesdale , by many of his traits of character , naturally belonged . 
To the high mountain peaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed , had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden , whatever it might be , of crime or anguish , beneath which it was his doom to totter . 
It kept him down on a level with the lowest ; him , the man of ethereal attributes , whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered ! 
But this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind ; so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs , and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts , in gushes of sad , persuasive eloquence . 
Oftenest persuasive , but sometimes terrible ! 
The people knew not the power that moved them thus . 
They deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness . 
They fancied him the mouth-piece of Heaven 's messages of wisdom , and rebuke , and love . 
In their eyes , the very ground on which he trod was sanctified . 
The virgins of his church grew pale around him , victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment , that they imagined it to be all religion , and brought it openly , in their white bosoms , as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar . 
The aged members of his flock , beholding Mr. Dimmesdale 's frame so feeble , while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity , believed that he would go heavenward before them , and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastor 's holy grave . 
And all this time , perchance , when poor Mr. Dimmesdale was thinking of his grave , he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it , because an accursed thing must there be buried ! 
It is inconceivable , the agony with which this public veneration tortured him . 
It was his genuine impulse to adore the truth , and to reckon all things shadow-like , and utterly devoid of weight or value , that had not its divine essence as the life within their life . 
Then what was he ? 
-- a substance ? 
-- or the dimmest of all shadows ? 
He longed to speak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice , and tell the people what he was . 
`` I , whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood -- I , who ascend the sacred desk , and turn my pale face heavenward , taking upon myself to hold communion in your behalf with the Most High Omniscience -- I , in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch -- I , whose footsteps , as you suppose , leave a gleam along my earthly track , whereby the Pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest -- I , who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children -- I , who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends , to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted -- I , your pastor , whom you so reverence and trust , am utterly a pollution and a lie ! '' 
More than once , Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit , with a purpose never to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the above . 
More than once he had cleared his throat , and drawn in the long , deep , and tremulous breath , which , when sent forth again , would come burdened with the black secret of his soul . 
More than once -- nay , more than a hundred times -- he had actually spoken ! 
Spoken ! 
But how ? 
He had told his hearers that he was altogether vile , a viler companion of the vilest , the worst of sinners , an abomination , a thing of unimaginable iniquity , and that the only wonder was that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes by the burning wrath of the Almighty ! 
Could there be plainer speech than this ? 
Would not the people start up in their seats , by a simultaneous impulse , and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled ? 
Not so , indeed ! 
They heard it all , and did but reverence him the more . 
They little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those self-condemning words . 
`` The godly youth ! ''
