Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her , with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast -- at her , the child of honourable parents -- at her , the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a woman -- at her , who had once been innocent -- as the figure , the body , the reality of sin . 
And over her grave , the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument . 
It may seem marvellous that , with the world before her -- kept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the Puritan settlement , so remote and so obscure -- free to return to her birth-place , or to any other European land , and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior , as completely as if emerging into another state of being -- and having also the passes of the dark , inscrutable forest open to her , where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned her -- it may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home , where , and where only , she must needs be the type of shame . 
But there is a fatality , a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom , which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt , ghost-like , the spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to their lifetime ; and , still the more irresistibly , the darker the tinge that saddens it . 
Her sin , her ignominy , were the roots which she had struck into the soil . 
It was as if a new birth , with stronger assimilations than the first , had converted the forest-land , still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer , into Hester Prynne 's wild and dreary , but life-long home . 
All other scenes of earth -- even that village of rural England , where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother 's keeping , like garments put off long ago -- were foreign to her , in comparison . 
The chain that bound her here was of iron links , and galling to her inmost soul , but could never be broken . 
It might be , too -- doubtless it was so , although she hid the secret from herself , and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart , like a serpent from its hole -- it might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal . 
There dwelt , there trode , the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union that , unrecognised on earth , would bring them together before the bar of final judgment , and make that their marriage-altar , for a joint futurity of endless retribution . 
Over and over again , the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon Hester 's contemplation , and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized , and then strove to cast it from her . 
She barely looked the idea in the face , and hastened to bar it in its dungeon . 
What she compelled herself to believe -- what , finally , she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of New England -- was half a truth , and half a self-delusion . 
Here , she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt , and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment ; and so , perchance , the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul , and work out another purity than that which she had lost : more saint-like , because the result of martyrdom . 
Hester Prynne , therefore , did not flee . 
On the outskirts of the town , within the verge of the peninsula , but not in close vicinity to any other habitation , there was a small thatched cottage . 
It had been built by an earlier settler , and abandoned , because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation , while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants . 
It stood on the shore , looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills , towards the west . 
A clump of scrubby trees , such as alone grew on the peninsula , did not so much conceal the cottage from view , as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been , or at least ought to be , concealed . 
In this little lonesome dwelling , with some slender means that she possessed , and by the licence of the magistrates , who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her , Hester established herself , with her infant child . 
A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot . 
Children , too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities , would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window , or standing in the doorway , or labouring in her little garden , or coming forth along the pathway that led townward , and , discerning the scarlet letter on her breast , would scamper off with a strange contagious fear . 
Lonely as was Hester 's situation , and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself , she , however , incurred no risk of want . 
She possessed an art that sufficed , even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise , to supply food for her thriving infant and herself . 
It was the art , then , as now , almost the only one within a woman 's grasp -- of needle-work . 
She bore on her breast , in the curiously embroidered letter , a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill , of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves , to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold . 
Here , indeed , in the sable simplicity that generally characterised the Puritanic modes of dress , there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork . 
Yet the taste of the age , demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind , did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors , who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with . 
Public ceremonies , such as ordinations , the installation of magistrates , and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people , were , as a matter of policy , marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial , and a sombre , but yet a studied magnificence . 
Deep ruffs , painfully wrought bands , and gorgeously embroidered gloves , were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power , and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth , even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order . 
In the array of funerals , too -- whether for the apparel of the dead body , or to typify , by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn , the sorrow of the survivors -- there was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labour as Hester Prynne could supply . 
Baby-linen -- for babies then wore robes of state -- afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument . 
By degrees , not very slowly , her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion . 
Whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny ; or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things ; or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then , as now , sufficient to bestow , on some persons , what others might seek in vain ; or because Hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant ; it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle . 
Vanity , it may be , chose to mortify itself , by putting on , for ceremonials of pomp and state , the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands . 
Her needle-work was seen on the ruff of the Governor ; military men wore it on their scarfs , and the minister on his band ; it decked the baby 's little cap ; it was shut up , to be mildewed and moulder away , in the coffins of the dead . 
But it is not recorded that , in a single instance , her skill was called in to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride . 
The exception indicated the ever relentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin . 
Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence , of the plainest and most ascetic description , for herself , and a simple abundance for her child . 
Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue , with only that one ornament -- the scarlet letter -- which it was her doom to wear . 
The child 's attire , on the other hand , was distinguished by a fanciful , or , we may rather say , a fantastic ingenuity , which served , indeed , to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl , but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning . 
We may speak further of it hereafter . 
Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant , Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity , on wretches less miserable than herself , and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them . 
Much of the time , which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art , she employed in making coarse garments for the poor . 
It is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation , and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork . 
She had in her nature a rich , voluptuous , Oriental characteristic -- a taste for the gorgeously beautiful , which , save in the exquisite productions of her needle , found nothing else , in all the possibilities of her life , to exercise itself upon . 
Women derive a pleasure , incomprehensible to the other sex , from the delicate toil of the needle . 
To Hester Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing , and therefore soothing , the passion of her life . 
Like all other joys , she rejected it as sin . 
This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened , it is to be feared , no genuine and steadfast penitence , but something doubtful , something that might be deeply wrong beneath . 
In this manner , Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world . 
With her native energy of character and rare capacity , it could not entirely cast her off , although it had set a mark upon her , more intolerable to a woman 's heart than that which branded the brow of Cain . 
In all her intercourse with society , however , there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it . 
Every gesture , every word , and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact , implied , and often expressed , that she was banished , and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere , or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind . 
She stood apart from mortal interests , yet close beside them , like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside , and can no longer make itself seen or felt ; no more smile with the household joy , nor mourn with the kindred sorrow ; or , should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy , awakening only terror and horrible repugnance . 
These emotions , in fact , and its bitterest scorn besides , seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart . 
It was not an age of delicacy ; and her position , although she understood it well , and was in little danger of forgetting it , was often brought before her vivid self-perception , like a new anguish , by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot . 
The poor , as we have already said , whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty , often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour them . 
Dames of elevated rank , likewise , whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation , were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart ; sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice , by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles ; and sometimes , also , by a coarser expression , that fell upon the sufferer 's defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound . 
Hester had schooled herself long and well ; and she never responded to these attacks , save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek , and again subsided into the depths of her bosom . 
She was patient -- a martyr , indeed but she forebore to pray for enemies , lest , in spite of her forgiving aspirations , the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse . 
Continually , and in a thousand other ways , did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying , the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal . 
Clergymen paused in the streets , to address words of exhortation , that brought a crowd , with its mingled grin and frown , around the poor , sinful woman . 
If she entered a church , trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the Universal Father , it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse . 
She grew to have a dread of children ; for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman gliding silently through the town , with never any companion but one only child . 
Therefore , first allowing her to pass , they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries , and the utterances of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds , but was none the less terrible to her , as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously . 
It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame , that all nature knew of it ; it could have caused her no deeper pang had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves -- had the summer breeze murmured about it -- had the wintry blast shrieked it aloud ! 
Another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye . 
When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter and none ever failed to do so -- they branded it afresh in Hester 's soul ; so that , oftentimes , she could scarcely refrain , yet always did refrain , from covering the symbol with her hand . 
But then , again , an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict . 
Its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable . 
From first to last , in short , Hester Prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token ; the spot never grew callous ; it seemed , on the contrary , to grow more sensitive with daily torture . 
But sometimes , once in many days , or perchance in many months , she felt an eye -- a human eye -- upon the ignominious brand , that seemed to give a momentary relief , as if half of her agony were shared . 
The next instant , back it all rushed again , with still a deeper throb of pain ; for , in that brief interval , she had sinned anew . 
-LRB- Had Hester sinned alone ? -RRB- 
Her imagination was somewhat affected , and , had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so , by the strange and solitary anguish of her life . 
Walking to and fro , with those lonely footsteps , in the little world with which she was outwardly connected , it now and then appeared to Hester -- if altogether fancy , it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted -- she felt or fancied , then , that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense . 
She shuddered to believe , yet could not help believing , that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts . 
She was terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus made . 
What were they ? 
Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel , who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman , as yet only half his victim , that the outward guise of purity was but a lie , and that , if truth were everywhere to be shown , a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne 's ? 
Or , must she receive those intimations -- so obscure , yet so distinct -- as truth ? 
In all her miserable experience , there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense . 
It perplexed , as well as shocked her , by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action . 
Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb , as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate , the model of piety and justice , to whom that age of antique reverence looked up , as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels . 
`` What evil thing is at hand ? '' 
would Hester say to herself . 
Lifting her reluctant eyes , there would be nothing human within the scope of view , save the form of this earthly saint ! 
Again a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself , as she met the sanctified frown of some matron , who , according to the rumour of all tongues , had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life . 
That unsunned snow in the matron 's bosom , and the burning shame on Hester Prynne 's -- what had the two in common ? 
Or , once more , the electric thrill would give her warning -- `` Behold Hester , here is a companion ! '' 
and , looking up , she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter , shyly and aside , and quickly averted , with a faint , chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance . 
O Fiend , whose talisman was that fatal symbol , wouldst thou leave nothing , whether in youth or age , for this poor sinner to revere ? 
-- such loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin . 
Be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty , and man 's hard law , that Hester Prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself . 
The vulgar , who , in those dreary old times , were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations , had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend . 
They averred that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth , tinged in an earthly dye-pot , but was red-hot with infernal fire , and could be seen glowing all alight whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time . 
And we must needs say it seared Hester 's bosom so deeply , that perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit . 
We have as yet hardly spoken of the infant ; that little creature , whose innocent life had sprung , by the inscrutable decree of Providence , a lovely and immortal flower , out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion . 
How strange it seemed to the sad woman , as she watched the growth , and the beauty that became every day more brilliant , and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child ! 
Her Pearl -- for so had Hester called her ; not as a name expressive of her aspect , which had nothing of the calm , white , unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison . 
But she named the infant `` Pearl , '' as being of great price -- purchased with all she had -- her mother 's only treasure ! 
How strange , indeed ! 
Man had marked this woman 's sin by a scarlet letter , which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her , save it were sinful like herself . 
God , as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished , had given her a lovely child , whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom , to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals , and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven ! 
Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension . 
She knew that her deed had been evil ; she could have no faith , therefore , that its result would be good . 
Day after day she looked fearfully into the child 's expanding nature , ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being . 
Certainly there was no physical defect . 
By its perfect shape , its vigour , and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs , the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden : worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the world 's first parents were driven out . 
The child had a native grace which does not invariably co-exist with faultless beauty ; its attire , however simple , always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best . 
But little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds . 
Her mother , with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter , had bought the richest tissues that could be procured , and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before the public eye . 
So magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed , and such was the splendour of Pearl 's own proper beauty , shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness , that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her on the darksome cottage floor . 
And yet a russet gown , torn and soiled with the child 's rude play , made a picture of her just as perfect . 
Pearl 's aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety ; in this one child there were many children , comprehending the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby , and the pomp , in little , of an infant princess . 
Throughout all , however , there was a trait of passion , a certain depth of hue , which she never lost ; and if in any of her changes , she had grown fainter or paler , she would have ceased to be herself -- it would have been no longer Pearl ! 
This outward mutability indicated , and did not more than fairly express , the various properties of her inner life . 
Her nature appeared to possess depth , too , as well as variety ; but -- or else Hester 's fears deceived her -- it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born . 
The child could not be made amenable to rules . 
In giving her existence a great law had been broken ; and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant , but all in disorder , or with an order peculiar to themselves , amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered . 
Hester could only account for the child 's character -- and even then most vaguely and imperfectly -- by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while Pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world , and her bodily frame from its material of earth . 
The mother 's impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life ; and , however white and clear originally , they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold , the fiery lustre , the black shadow , and the untempered light of the intervening substance . 
Above all , the warfare of Hester 's spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in Pearl . 
She could recognize her wild , desperate , defiant mood , the flightiness of her temper , and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart . 
They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child 's disposition , but , later in the day of earthly existence , might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind . 
The discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind than now . 
The frown , the harsh rebuke , the frequent application of the rod , enjoined by Scriptural authority , were used , not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences , but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues . 
Hester Prynne , nevertheless , the loving mother of this one child , ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity . 
Mindful , however , of her own errors and misfortunes , she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge . 
But the task was beyond her skill . 
After testing both smiles and frowns , and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence , Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses . 
Physical compulsion or restraint was effectual , of course , while it lasted . 
As to any other kind of discipline , whether addressed to her mind or heart , little Pearl might or might not be within its reach , in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment . 
Her mother , while Pearl was yet an infant , grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look , that warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist , persuade or plead . 
It was a look so intelligent , yet inexplicable , perverse , sometimes so malicious , but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits , that Hester could not help questioning at such moments whether Pearl was a human child . 
She seemed rather an airy sprite , which , after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor , would flit away with a mocking smile . 
Whenever that look appeared in her wild , bright , deeply black eyes , it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility : it was as if she were hovering in the air , and might vanish , like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither . 
Beholding it , Hester was constrained to rush towards the child -- to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began -- to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses -- not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood , and not utterly delusive . 
But Pearl 's laugh , when she was caught , though full of merriment and music , made her mother more doubtful than before . 
Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell , that so often came between herself and her sole treasure , whom she had bought so dear , and who was all her world , Hester sometimes burst into passionate tears . 
Then , perhaps -- for there was no foreseeing how it might affect her -- Pearl would frown , and clench her little fist , and harden her small features into a stern , unsympathising look of discontent . 
Not seldom she would laugh anew , and louder than before , like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow . 
Or -- but this more rarely happened -- she would be convulsed with rage of grief and sob out her love for her mother in broken words , and seem intent on proving that she had a heart by breaking it . 
Yet Hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness : it passed as suddenly as it came . 
Brooding over all these matters , the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit , but , by some irregularity in the process of conjuration , has failed to win the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence . 
Her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep . 
Then she was sure of her , and tasted hours of quiet , sad , delicious happiness ; until -- perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lids -- little Pearl awoke ! 
How soon -- with what strange rapidity , indeed did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse beyond the mother 's ever-ready smile and nonsense-words ! 
And then what a happiness would it have been could Hester Prynne have heard her clear , bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices , and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling 's tones , amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children . 
But this could never be . 
Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world . 
An imp of evil , emblem and product of sin , she had no right among christened infants . 
Nothing was more remarkable than the instinct , as it seemed , with which the child comprehended her loneliness : the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her : the whole peculiarity , in short , of her position in respect to other children . 
Never since her release from prison had Hester met the public gaze without her . 
In all her walks about the town , Pearl , too , was there : first as the babe in arms , and afterwards as the little girl , small companion of her mother , holding a forefinger with her whole grasp , and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Hester 's . 
She saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street , or at the domestic thresholds , disporting themselves in such grim fashions as the Puritanic nurture would permit ; playing at going to church , perchance , or at scourging Quakers ; or taking scalps in a sham fight with the Indians , or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft . 
Pearl saw , and gazed intently , but never sought to make acquaintance . 
If spoken to , she would not speak again . 
If the children gathered about her , as they sometimes did , Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath , snatching up stones to fling at them , with shrill , incoherent exclamations , that made her mother tremble , because they had so much the sound of a witch 's anathemas in some unknown tongue . 
The truth was , that the little Puritans , being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived , had got a vague idea of something outlandish , unearthly , or at variance with ordinary fashions , in the mother and child , and therefore scorned them in their hearts , and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues . 
Pearl felt the sentiment , and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom . 
These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value , and even comfort for the mother ; because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood , instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child 's manifestations . 
It appalled her , nevertheless , to discern here , again , a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself . 
All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited , by inalienable right , out of Hester 's heart . 
Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society ; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before Pearl 's birth , but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity . 
At home , within and around her mother 's cottage , Pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance . 
The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit , and communicated itself to a thousand objects , as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied . 
The unlikeliest materials -- a stick , a bunch of rags , a flower -- were the puppets of Pearl 's witchcraft , and , without undergoing any outward change , became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world . 
Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary personages , old and young , to talk withal . 
The pine-trees , aged , black , and solemn , and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze , needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders ; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children , whom Pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully . 
It was wonderful , the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect , with no continuity , indeed , but darting up and dancing , always in a state of preternatural activity -- soon sinking down , as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life -- and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy . 
It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights . 
In the mere exercise of the fancy , however , and the sportiveness of a growing mind , there might be a little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties ; except as Pearl , in the dearth of human playmates , was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created . 
The singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offsprings of her own heart and mind . 
She never created a friend , but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon 's teeth , whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies , against whom she rushed to battle . 
It was inexpressibly sad -- then what depth of sorrow to a mother , who felt in her own heart the cause -- to observe , in one so young , this constant recognition of an adverse world , and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that must ensue . 
Gazing at Pearl , Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon her knees , and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden , but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groan -- `` O Father in Heaven -- if Thou art still my Father -- what is this being which I have brought into the world ? '' 
And Pearl , overhearing the ejaculation , or aware through some more subtile channel , of those throbs of anguish , would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother , smile with sprite-like intelligence , and resume her play . 
One peculiarity of the child 's deportment remains yet to be told . 
The very first thing which she had noticed in her life , was -- what ? 
-- not the mother 's smile , responding to it , as other babies do , by that faint , embryo smile of the little mouth , remembered so doubtfully afterwards , and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile . 
By no means ! 
But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was -- shall we say it ? 
-- the scarlet letter on Hester 's bosom ! 
One day , as her mother stooped over the cradle , the infant 's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter ; and putting up her little hand she grasped at it , smiling , not doubtfully , but with a decided gleam , that gave her face the look of a much older child . 
Then , gasping for breath , did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token , instinctively endeavouring to tear it away , so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl 's baby-hand . 
Again , as if her mother 's agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her , did little Pearl look into her eyes , and smile . 
From that epoch , except when the child was asleep , Hester had never felt a moment 's safety : not a moment 's calm enjoyment of her . 
Weeks , it is true , would sometimes elapse , during which Pearl 's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter ; but then , again , it would come at unawares , like the stroke of sudden death , and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes . 
Once this freakish , elvish cast came into the child 's eyes while Hester was looking at her own image in them , as mothers are fond of doing ; and suddenly for women in solitude , and with troubled hearts , are pestered with unaccountable delusions she fancied that she beheld , not her own miniature portrait , but another face in the small black mirror of Pearl 's eye . 
It was a face , fiend-like , full of smiling malice , yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well , though seldom with a smile , and never with malice in them . 
It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child , and had just then peeped forth in mockery . 
Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured , though less vividly , by the same illusion . 
In the afternoon of a certain summer 's day , after Pearl grew big enough to run about , she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers , and flinging them , one by one , at her mother 's bosom ; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter . 
Hester 's first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands . 
But whether from pride or resignation , or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain , she resisted the impulse , and sat erect , pale as death , looking sadly into little Pearl 's wild eyes . 
Still came the battery of flowers , almost invariably hitting the mark , and covering the mother 's breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world , nor knew how to seek it in another . 
At last , her shot being all expended , the child stood still and gazed at Hester , with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out -- or , whether it peeped or no , her mother so imagined it -- from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes . 
`` Child , what art thou ? '' 
cried the mother . 
`` Oh , I am your little Pearl ! '' 
answered the child . 
But while she said it , Pearl laughed , and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp , whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney . 
`` Art thou my child , in very truth ? '' 
asked Hester . 
Nor did she put the question altogether idly , but , for the moment , with a portion of genuine earnestness ; for , such was Pearl 's wonderful intelligence , that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence , and might not now reveal herself . 
`` Yes ; I am little Pearl ! '' 
repeated the child , continuing her antics . 
`` Thou art not my child ! 
Thou art no Pearl of mine ! '' 
said the mother half playfully ; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering . 
`` Tell me , then , what thou art , and who sent thee hither ? '' 
`` Tell me , mother ! '' 
said the child , seriously , coming up to Hester , and pressing herself close to her knees . 
`` Do thou tell me ! '' 
`` Thy Heavenly Father sent thee ! '' 
answered Hester Prynne . 
But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child . 
Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness , or because an evil spirit prompted her , she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter . 
`` He did not send me ! '' 
cried she , positively . 
`` I have no Heavenly Father ! '' 
`` Hush , Pearl , hush ! 
Thou must not talk so ! '' 
answered the mother , suppressing a groan . 
`` He sent us all into the world . 
He sent even me , thy mother . 
Then , much more thee ! 
Or , if not , thou strange and elfish child , whence didst thou come ? '' 
`` Tell me ! 
Tell me ! '' 
repeated Pearl , no longer seriously , but laughing and capering about the floor . 
`` It is thou that must tell me ! '' 
But Hester could not resolve the query , being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt . 
She remembered -- betwixt a smile and a shudder -- the talk of the neighbouring townspeople , who , seeking vainly elsewhere for the child 's paternity , and observing some of her odd attributes , had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring : such as , ever since old Catholic times , had occasionally been seen on earth , through the agency of their mother 's sin , and to promote some foul and wicked purpose . 
Luther , according to the scandal of his monkish enemies , was a brat of that hellish breed ; nor was Pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the New England Puritans . 
Hester Prynne went one day to the mansion of Governor Bellingham , with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order , and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state ; for , though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank , he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy . 
Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves , impelled Hester , at this time , to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement . 
It had reached her ears that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants , cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government , to deprive her of her child . 
On the supposition that Pearl , as already hinted , was of demon origin , these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother 's soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from her path . 
If the child , on the other hand , were really capable of moral and religious growth , and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation , then , surely , it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than Hester Prynne 's . 
Among those who promoted the design , Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy . 
It may appear singular , and , indeed , not a little ludicrous , that an affair of this kind , which in later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the select men of the town , should then have been a question publicly discussed , and on which statesmen of eminence took sides . 
At that epoch of pristine simplicity , however , matters of even slighter public interest , and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of Hester and her child , were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state . 
The period was hardly , if at all , earlier than that of our story , when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony , but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature . 
Full of concern , therefore -- but so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on the one side , and a lonely woman , backed by the sympathies of nature , on the other -- Hester Prynne set forth from her solitary cottage . 
Little Pearl , of course , was her companion . 
She was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother 's side , and , constantly in motion from morn till sunset , could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her . 
Often , nevertheless , more from caprice than necessity , she demanded to be taken up in arms ; but was soon as imperious to be let down again , and frisked onward before Hester on the grassy pathway , with many a harmless trip and tumble . 
We have spoken of Pearl 's rich and luxuriant beauty -- a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints , a bright complexion , eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow , and hair already of a deep , glossy brown , and which , in after years , would be nearly akin to black . 
There was fire in her and throughout her : she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment . 
Her mother , in contriving the child 's garb , had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play , arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut , abundantly embroidered in fantasies and flourishes of gold thread . 
So much strength of colouring , which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom , was admirably adapted to Pearl 's beauty , and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth . 
But it was a remarkable attribute of this garb , and indeed , of the child 's whole appearance , that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Hester Prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom . 
It was the scarlet letter in another form : the scarlet letter endowed with life ! 
The mother herself -- as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form -- had carefully wrought out the similitude , lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture . 
But , in truth , Pearl was the one as well as the other ; and only in consequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance . 
As the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town , the children of the Puritans looked up from their play , -- or what passed for play with those sombre little urchins -- and spoke gravely one to another . 
`` Behold , verily , there is the woman of the scarlet letter : and of a truth , moreover , there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side ! 
Come , therefore , and let us fling mud at them ! '' 
But Pearl , who was a dauntless child , after frowning , stamping her foot , and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures , suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies , and put them all to flight . 
She resembled , in her fierce pursuit of them , an infant pestilence -- the scarlet fever , or some such half-fledged angel of judgment -- whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation . 
She screamed and shouted , too , with a terrific volume of sound , which , doubtless , caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them . 
The victory accomplished , Pearl returned quietly to her mother , and looked up , smiling , into her face . 
Without further adventure , they reached the dwelling of Governor Bellingham . 
This was a large wooden house , built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns now moss-grown , crumbling to decay , and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences , remembered or forgotten , that have happened and passed away within their dusky chambers . 
Then , however , there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior , and the cheerfulness , gleaming forth from the sunny windows , of a human habitation , into which death had never entered . 
It had , indeed , a very cheery aspect , the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco , in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed ; so that , when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice , it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful . 
The brilliancy might have be fitted Aladdin 's palace rather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler . 
It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams , suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco , when newly laid on , and had now grown hard and durable , for the admiration of after times . 
Pearl , looking at this bright wonder of a house began to caper and dance , and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front , and given her to play with . 
`` No , my little Pearl ! '' 
said her mother ; `` thou must gather thine own sunshine . 
I have none to give thee ! '' 
They approached the door , which was of an arched form , and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice , in both of which were lattice-windows , the wooden shutters to close over them at need . 
Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal , Hester Prynne gave a summons , which was answered by one of the Governor 's bond servant -- a free-born Englishman , but now a seven years ' slave . 
During that term he was to be the property of his master , and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox , or a joint-stool . 
The serf wore the customary garb of serving-men at that period , and long before , in the old hereditary halls of England . 
`` Is the worshipful Governor Bellingham within ? '' 
inquired Hester . 
`` Yea , forsooth , '' replied the bond-servant , staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter , which , being a new-comer in the country , he had never before seen . 
`` Yea , his honourable worship is within . 
But he hath a godly minister or two with him , and likewise a leech . 
Ye may not see his worship now . '' 
`` Nevertheless , I will enter , '' answered Hester Prynne ; and the bond-servant , perhaps judging from the decision of her air , and the glittering symbol in her bosom , that she was a great lady in the land , offered no opposition . 
So the mother and little Pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance . 
With many variations , suggested by the nature of his building materials , diversity of climate , and a different mode of social life , Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land . 
Here , then , was a wide and reasonably lofty hall , extending through the whole depth of the house , and forming a medium of general communication , more or less directly , with all the other apartments . 
At one extremity , this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers , which formed a small recess on either side of the portal . 
At the other end , though partly muffled by a curtain , it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall windows which we read of in old books , and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat . 
Here , on the cushion , lay a folio tome , probably of the Chronicles of England , or other such substantial literature ; even as , in our own days , we scatter gilded volumes on the centre table , to be turned over by the casual guest . 
The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs , the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers ; and likewise a table in the same taste , the whole being of the Elizabethan age , or perhaps earlier , and heirlooms , transferred hither from the Governor 's paternal home . 
On the table -- in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind -- stood a large pewter tankard , at the bottom of which , had Hester or Pearl peeped into it , they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale . 
On the wall hung a row of portraits , representing the forefathers of the Bellingham lineage , some with armour on their breasts , and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace . 
All were characterised by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on , as if they were the ghosts , rather than the pictures , of departed worthies , and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men . 
At about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was suspended a suit of mail , not , like the pictures , an ancestral relic , but of the most modern date ; for it had been manufactured by a skilful armourer in London , the same year in which Governor Bellingham came over to New England . 
There was a steel head-piece , a cuirass , a gorget and greaves , with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath ; all , and especially the helmet and breastplate , so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance , and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor . 
This bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show , but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training field , and had glittered , moreover , at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war . 
For , though bred a lawyer , and accustomed to speak of Bacon , Coke , Noye , and Finch , as his professional associates , the exigencies of this new country had transformed Governor Bellingham into a soldier , as well as a statesman and ruler . 
Little Pearl , who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house , spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate . 
`` Mother , '' cried she , `` I see you here . 
Look ! 
Look ! '' 
Hester looked by way of humouring the child ; and she saw that , owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror , the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions , so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance . 
In truth , she seemed absolutely hidden behind it . 
Pearl pointed upwards also , at a similar picture in the head-piece ; smiling at her mother , with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy . 
That look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror , with so much breadth and intensity of effect , that it made Hester Prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child , but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into Pearl 's shape . 
`` Come along , Pearl , '' said she , drawing her away , `` Come and look into this fair garden . 
It may be we shall see flowers there ; more beautiful ones than we find in the woods . '' 
Pearl accordingly ran to the bow-window , at the further end of the hall , and looked along the vista of a garden walk , carpeted with closely-shaven grass , and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery . 
But the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless , the effort to perpetuate on this side of the Atlantic , in a hard soil , and amid the close struggle for subsistence , the native English taste for ornamental gardening . 
Cabbages grew in plain sight ; and a pumpkin-vine , rooted at some distance , had run across the intervening space , and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hall window , as if to warn the Governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as New England earth would offer him . 
There were a few rose-bushes , however , and a number of apple-trees , probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone , the first settler of the peninsula ; that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals , seated on the back of a bull . 
Pearl , seeing the rose-bushes , began to cry for a red rose , and would not be pacified . 
`` Hush , child -- hush ! '' 
said her mother , earnestly . 
`` Do not cry , dear little Pearl ! 
I hear voices in the garden . 
The Governor is coming , and gentlemen along with him . '' 
In fact , adown the vista of the garden avenue , a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house . 
Pearl , in utter scorn of her mother 's attempt to quiet her , gave an eldritch scream , and then became silent , not from any notion of obedience , but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of those new personages . 
Governor Bellingham , in a loose gown and easy cap -- such as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with , in their domestic privacy -- walked foremost , and appeared to be showing off his estate , and expatiating on his projected improvements . 
The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff , beneath his grey beard , in the antiquated fashion of King James 's reign , caused his head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist in a charger . 
The impression made by his aspect , so rigid and severe , and frost-bitten with more than autumnal age , was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself . 
But it is an error to suppose that our great forefathers -- though accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare , and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of duty -- made it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort , or even luxury , as lay fairly within their grasp . 
This creed was never taught , for instance , by the venerable pastor , John Wilson , whose beard , white as a snow-drift , was seen over Governor Bellingham 's shoulders , while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalised in the New England climate , and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to flourish against the sunny garden-wall . 
The old clergyman , nurtured at the rich bosom of the English Church , had a long established and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things , and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit , or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of Hester Prynne , still , the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries . 
Behind the Governor and Mr. Wilson came two other guests -- one , the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale , whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester Prynne 's disgrace ; and , in close companionship with him , old Roger Chillingworth , a person of great skill in physic , who for two or three years past had been settled in the town . 
It was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister , whose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved self-sacrifice to the labours and duties of the pastoral relation . 
The Governor , in advance of his visitors , ascended one or two steps , and , throwing open the leaves of the great hall window , found himself close to little Pearl . 
The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne , and partially concealed her . 
`` What have we here ? '' 
said Governor Bellingham , looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him . 
`` I profess , I have never seen the like since my days of vanity , in old King James 's time , when I was wont to esteem it a high favour to be admitted to a court mask ! 
There used to be a swarm of these small apparitions in holiday time , and we called them children of the Lord of Misrule . 
But how gat such a guest into my hall ? '' 
`` Ay , indeed ! '' 
cried good old Mr. Wilson . 
`` What little bird of scarlet plumage may this be ? 
Methinks I have seen just such figures when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window , and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor . 
But that was in the old land . 
Prithee , young one , who art thou , and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion ? 
Art thou a Christian child -- ha ? 
Dost know thy catechism ? 
Or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom we thought to have left behind us , with other relics of Papistry , in merry old England ? '' 
`` I am mother 's child , '' answered the scarlet vision , `` and my name is Pearl ! '' 
`` Pearl ? 
-- Ruby , rather -- or Coral ! 
-- or Red Rose , at the very least , judging from thy hue ! '' 
responded the old minister , putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little Pearl on the cheek . 
`` But where is this mother of thine ? 
Ah ! 
I see , '' he added ; and , turning to Governor Bellingham , whispered , `` This is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together ; and behold here the unhappy woman , Hester Prynne , her mother ! '' 
`` Sayest thou so ? '' 
cried the Governor . 
`` Nay , we might have judged that such a child 's mother must needs be a scarlet woman , and a worthy type of her of Babylon ! 
But she comes at a good time , and we will look into this matter forthwith . '' 
Governor Bellingham stepped through the window into the hall , followed by his three guests . 
`` Hester Prynne , '' said he , fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter , `` there hath been much question concerning thee of late . 
The point hath been weightily discussed , whether we , that are of authority and influence , do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul , such as there is in yonder child , to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this world . 
Speak thou , the child 's own mother ! 
Were it not , thinkest thou , for thy little one 's temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge , and clad soberly , and disciplined strictly , and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth ? 
What canst thou do for the child in this kind ? '' 
`` I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this ! '' 
answered Hester Prynne , laying her finger on the red token . 
`` Woman , it is thy badge of shame ! '' 
replied the stern magistrate . 
`` It is because of the stain which that letter indicates that we would transfer thy child to other hands . '' 
`` Nevertheless , '' said the mother , calmly , though growing more pale , `` this badge hath taught me -- it daily teaches me -- it is teaching me at this moment -- lessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better , albeit they can profit nothing to myself . '' 
`` We will judge warily , '' said Bellingham , `` and look well what we are about to do . 
Good Master Wilson , I pray you , examine this Pearl -- since that is her name -- and see whether she hath had such Christian nurture as befits a child of her age . '' 
The old minister seated himself in an arm-chair and made an effort to draw Pearl betwixt his knees . 
But the child , unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother , escaped through the open window , and stood on the upper step , looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage , ready to take flight into the upper air . 
Mr. Wilson , not a little astonished at this outbreak -- for he was a grandfatherly sort of personage , and usually a vast favourite with children -- essayed , however , to proceed with the examination . 
`` Pearl , '' said he , with great solemnity , `` thou must take heed to instruction , that so , in due season , thou mayest wear in thy bosom the pearl of great price . 
Canst thou tell me , my child , who made thee ? '' 
Now Pearl knew well enough who made her , for Hester Prynne , the daughter of a pious home , very soon after her talk with the child about her Heavenly Father , had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit , at whatever stage of immaturity , imbibes with such eager interest . 
Pearl , therefore -- so large were the attainments of her three years ' lifetime -- could have borne a fair examination in the New England Primer , or the first column of the Westminster Catechisms , although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works . 
But that perversity , which all children have more or less of , and of which little Pearl had a tenfold portion , now , at the most inopportune moment , took thorough possession of her , and closed her lips , or impelled her to speak words amiss . 
After putting her finger in her mouth , with many ungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson 's question , the child finally announced that she had not been made at all , but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prison-door . 
This phantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the Governor 's red roses , as Pearl stood outside of the window , together with her recollection of the prison rose-bush , which she had passed in coming hither . 
Old Roger Chillingworth , with a smile on his face , whispered something in the young clergyman 's ear . 
Hester Prynne looked at the man of skill , and even then , with her fate hanging in the balance , was startled to perceive what a change had come over his features -- how much uglier they were , how his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier , and his figure more misshapen -- since the days when she had familiarly known him . 
She met his eyes for an instant , but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward . 
`` This is awful ! '' 
cried the Governor , slowly recovering from the astonishment into which Pearl 's response had thrown him . 
`` Here is a child of three years old , and she can not tell who made her ! 
Without question , she is equally in the dark as to her soul , its present depravity , and future destiny ! 
Methinks , gentlemen , we need inquire no further . '' 
Hester caught hold of Pearl , and drew her forcibly into her arms , confronting the old Puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression . 
Alone in the world , cast off by it , and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive , she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world , and was ready to defend them to the death . 
`` God gave me the child ! '' 
cried she . 
`` He gave her in requital of all things else which ye had taken from me . 
She is my happiness -- she is my torture , none the less ! 
Pearl keeps me here in life ! 
Pearl punishes me , too ! 
See ye not , she is the scarlet letter , only capable of being loved , and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin ? 
Ye shall not take her !
