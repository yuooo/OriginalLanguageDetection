Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf ; stood just as if he was staring . 
Not a moment ago . 
Went in that there door . 
I tell ` e , ' e ai n't gart no ` ed at all . 
You just missed en -- '' There was a disturbance behind , and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house ; first Mr. Hall , very red and determined , then Mr. Bobby Jaffers , the village constable , and then the wary Mr. Wadgers . 
They had come now armed with a warrant . 
People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances . '' 
` Ed or no ` ed , '' said Jaffers , `` I got to ` rest en , and ` rest en I will . '' 
Mr. Hall marched up the steps , marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open . 
`` Constable , '' he said , `` do your duty . '' 
Jaffers marched in . 
Hall next , Wadgers last . 
They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them , with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other . 
`` That 's him ! '' 
said Hall . 
`` What the devil 's this ? '' 
came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure . 
`` You 're a damned rum customer , mister , '' said Mr. Jaffers . 
`` But ` ed or no ` ed , the warrant says ` body , ' and duty 's duty -- '' `` Keep off ! '' 
said the figure , starting back . 
Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese , and Mr. Hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it . 
Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in Jaffers ' face . 
In another moment Jaffers , cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . 
He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . 
Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . 
A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together . 
`` Get the feet , '' said Jaffers between his teeth . 
Mr. Hall , endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and Mr. Wadgers , seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers , retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order . 
At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room . 
`` I 'll surrender , '' cried the stranger , though he had Jaffers down , and in another moment he stood up panting , a strange figure , headless and handless -- for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left . 
`` It 's no good , '' he said , as if sobbing for breath . 
It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space , but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun . 
Jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs . 
Then he stared . 
`` I say ! '' 
said Jaffers , brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business , `` Darn it ! 
Ca n't use 'em as I can see . '' 
The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone . 
Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down . 
He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks . 
`` Why ! '' 
said Huxter , suddenly , `` that 's not a man at all . 
It 's just empty clothes . 
Look ! 
You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes . 
I could put my arm -- '' He extended his hand ; it seemed to meet something in mid-air , and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation . 
`` I wish you 'd keep your fingers out of my eye , '' said the aerial voice , in a tone of savage expostulation . 
`` The fact is , I 'm all here -- head , hands , legs , and all the rest of it , but it happens I 'm invisible . 
It 's a confounded nuisance , but I am . 
That 's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping , is it ? '' 
The suit of clothes , now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports , stood up , arms akimbo . 
Several other of the men folks had now entered the room , so that it was closely crowded . 
`` Invisible , eh ? '' 
said Huxter , ignoring the stranger 's abuse . 
`` Who ever heard the likes of that ? '' 
`` It 's strange , perhaps , but it 's not a crime . 
Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that 's a different matter , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light , but I got a warrant and it 's all correct . 
What I 'm after ai n't no invisibility , -- it 's burglary . 
There 's a house been broke into and money took . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` And circumstances certainly point -- '' `` Stuff and nonsense ! '' 
said the Invisible Man . 
`` I hope so , sir ; but I 've got my instructions . '' 
`` Well , '' said the stranger , `` I 'll come . 
I 'll come . 
But no handcuffs . '' 
`` It 's the regular thing , '' said Jaffers . 
`` No handcuffs , '' stipulated the stranger . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Jaffers . 
Abruptly the figure sat down , and before any one could realise was was being done , the slippers , socks , and trousers had been kicked off under the table . 
Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat . 
`` Here , stop that , '' said Jaffers , suddenly realising what was happening . 
He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limp and empty in his hand . 
`` Hold him ! '' 
said Jaffers , loudly . 
`` Once he gets the things off -- '' `` Hold him ! '' 
cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger . 
The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in Hall 's face that stopped his open-armed advance , and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton , and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms , even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man 's head . 
Jaffers clutched at it , and only helped to pull it off ; he was struck in the mouth out of the air , and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote Teddy Henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head . 
`` Look out ! '' 
said everybody , fencing at random and hitting at nothing . 
`` Hold him ! 
Shut the door ! 
Do n't let him loose ! 
I got something ! 
Here he is ! '' 
A perfect Babel of noises they made . 
Everybody , it seemed , was being hit all at once , and Sandy Wadgers , knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose , reopened the door and led the rout . 
The others , following incontinently , were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway . 
The hitting continued . 
Phipps , the Unitarian , had a front tooth broken , and Henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear . 
Jaffers was struck under the jaw , and , turning , caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the melee , and prevented their coming together . 
He felt a muscular chest , and in another moment the whole mass of struggling , excited men shot out into the crowded hall . 
`` I got him ! '' 
shouted Jaffers , choking and reeling through them all , and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy . 
Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door , and went spinning down the half-dozen steps of the inn . 
Jaffers cried in a strangled voice -- holding tight , nevertheless , and making play with his knee -- spun around , and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel . 
Only then did his fingers relax . 
There were excited cries of `` Hold him ! '' 
`` Invisible ! '' 
and so forth , and a young fellow , a stranger in the place whose name did not come to light , rushed in at once , caught something , missed his hold , and fell over the constable 's prostrate body . 
Half-way across the road a woman screamed as something pushed by her ; a dog , kicked apparently , yelped and ran howling into Huxter 's yard , and with that the transit of the Invisible Man was accomplished . 
For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating , and then came panic , and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves . 
But Jaffers lay quite still , face upward and knees bent , at the foot of the steps of the inn . 
The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief , and relates that Gibbons , the amateur naturalist of the district , while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him , as he thought , and almost dozing , heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing , sneezing , and then swearing savagely to himself ; and looking , beheld nothing . 
Yet the voice was indisputable . 
It continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man . 
It grew to a climax , diminished again , and died away in the distance , going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean . 
It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended . 
Gibbons had heard nothing of the morning 's occurrences , but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished ; he got up hastily , and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village , as fast as he could go . 
You must picture Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious , flexible visage , a nose of cylindrical protrusion , a liquorish , ample , fluctuating mouth , and a beard of bristling eccentricity . 
His figure inclined to embonpoint ; his short limbs accentuated this inclination . 
He wore a furry silk hat , and the frequent substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons , apparent at critical points of his costume , marked a man essentially bachelor . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards Adderdean , about a mile and a half out of Iping . 
His feet , save for socks of irregular open-work , were bare , his big toes were broad , and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog . 
In a leisurely manner -- he did everything in a leisurely manner -- he was contemplating trying on a pair of boots . 
They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time , but too large for him ; whereas the ones he had were , in dry weather , a very comfortable fit , but too thin-soled for damp . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel hated roomy shoes , but then he hated damp . 
He had never properly thought out which he hated most , and it was a pleasant day , and there was nothing better to do . 
So he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them . 
And seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony , it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see . 
He was not at all startled by a voice behind him . 
`` They 're boots , anyhow , '' said the Voice . 
`` They are -- charity boots , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , with his head on one side regarding them distastefully ; `` and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe , I 'm darned if I know ! '' 
`` H 'm , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 've worn worse -- in fact , I 've worn none . 
But none so owdacious ugly -- if you 'll allow the expression . 
I 've been cadging boots -- in particular -- for days . 
Because I was sick of them . 
They 're sound enough , of course . 
But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots . 
And if you 'll believe me , I 've raised nothing in the whole blessed country , try as I would , but them . 
Look at 'em ! 
And a good country for boots , too , in a general way . 
But it 's just my promiscuous luck . 
I 've got my boots in this country ten years or more . 
And then they treat you like this . '' 
`` It 's a beast of a country , '' said the Voice . 
`` And pigs for people . '' 
`` Ai n't it ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Lord ! 
But them boots ! 
It beats it . '' 
He turned his head over his shoulder to the right , to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons , and lo ! 
where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots . 
He was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement . 
`` Where are yer ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours . 
He saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote green-pointed furze bushes . 
`` Am I drunk ? '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Have I had visions ? 
Was I talking to myself ? 
What the -- '' `` Do n't be alarmed , '' said a Voice . 
`` None of your ventriloquising me , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rising sharply to his feet . 
`` Where are yer ? 
Alarmed , indeed ! '' 
`` Do n't be alarmed , '' repeated the Voice . '' 
You 'll be alarmed in a minute , you silly fool , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Where are yer ? 
Lem me get my mark on yer ... `` Are yer buried ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , after an interval . 
There was no answer . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed , his jacket nearly thrown off . 
`` Peewit , '' said a peewit , very remote . 
`` Peewit , indeed ! '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` This ai n't no time for foolery . '' 
The down was desolate , east and west , north and south ; the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes , ran smooth and empty north and south , and , save for that peewit , the blue sky was empty too . 
`` So help me , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again . 
`` It 's the drink ! 
I might ha ' known . '' 
`` It 's not the drink , '' said the Voice . 
`` You keep your nerves steady . '' 
`` Ow ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel , and his face grew white amidst its patches . 
`` It 's the drink ! '' 
his lips repeated noiselessly . 
He remained staring about him , rotating slowly backwards . 
`` I could have swore I heard a voice , '' he whispered . 
`` Of course you did . '' 
`` It 's there again , '' said Mr. Marvel , closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture . 
He was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently , and left more dazed than ever . 
`` Do n't be a fool , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm -- off -- my -- blooming -- chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` It 's no good . 
It 's fretting about them blarsted boots . 
I 'm off my blessed blooming chump . 
Or it 's spirits . '' 
`` Neither one thing nor the other , '' said the Voice . 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` Chump , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` One minute , '' said the Voice , penetratingly , tremulous with self-control . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger . 
`` You think I 'm just imagination ? 
Just imagination ? '' 
`` What else can you be ? '' 
said Mr. Thomas Marvel , rubbing the back of his neck . 
`` Very well , '' said the Voice , in a tone of relief . 
`` Then I 'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently . '' 
`` But where are yer ? '' 
The Voice made no answer . 
Whizz came a flint , apparently out of the air , and missed Mr. Marvel 's shoulder by a hair 's - breadth . 
Mr. Marvel , turning , saw a flint jerk up into the air , trace a complicated path , hang for a moment , and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity . 
He was too amazed to dodge . 
Whizz it came , and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch . 
Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud . 
Then he started to run , tripped over an unseen obstacle , and came head over heels into a sitting position . '' 
Now , '' said the Voice , as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp . 
`` Am I imagination ? '' 
Mr. Marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet , and was immediately rolled over again . 
He lay quiet for a moment . 
`` If you struggle any more , '' said the Voice , `` I shall throw the flint at your head . '' 
`` It 's a fair do , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel , sitting up , taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile . 
`` I do n't understand it . 
Stones flinging themselves . 
Stones talking . 
Put yourself down . 
Rot away . 
I 'm done . '' 
The third flint fell . 
`` It 's very simple , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm an invisible man . '' 
`` Tell us something I do n't know , '' said Mr. Marvel , gasping with pain . 
`` Where you 've hid -- how you do it -- I do n't know . 
I 'm beat . '' 
`` That 's all , '' said the Voice . 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's what I want you to understand . '' 
`` Anyone could see that . 
There is no need for you to be so confounded impatient , mister . 
Now then . 
Give us a notion . 
How are you hid ? '' 
`` I 'm invisible . 
That 's the great point . 
And what I want you to understand is this -- '' `` But whereabouts ? '' 
interrupted Mr. Marvel . 
`` Here ! 
Six yards in front of you . '' 
`` Oh , come ! 
I ai n't blind . 
You 'll be telling me next you 're just thin air . 
I 'm not one of your ignorant tramps -- '' `` Yes , I am -- thin air . 
You 're looking through me . '' 
`` What ! 
Ai n't there any stuff to you . 
Vox et -- what is it ? 
-- jabber . 
Is it that ? '' 
`` I am just a human being -- solid , needing food and drink , needing covering too -- But I 'm invisible . 
You see ? 
Invisible . 
Simple idea . 
Invisible . '' 
`` What , real like ? '' 
`` Yes , real . '' 
`` Let 's have a hand of you , '' said Marvel , `` if you are real . 
It wo n't be so darn out-of-the-way like , then -- Lord ! '' 
he said , `` how you made me jump ! 
-- gripping me like that ! '' 
He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers , and his fingers went timorously up the arm , patted a muscular chest , and explored a bearded face . 
Marvel 's face was astonishment . 
`` I 'm dashed ! '' 
he said . 
`` If this do n't beat cock-fighting ! 
Most remarkable ! 
-- And there I can see a rabbit clean through you , ` arf a mile away ! 
Not a bit of you visible -- except -- '' He scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly . 
`` You ` ave n't been eatin ' bread and cheese ? '' 
he asked , holding the invisible arm . 
`` You 're quite right , and it 's not quite assimilated into the system . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` Sort of ghostly , though . '' 
`` Of course , all this is n't half so wonderful as you think . '' 
`` It 's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants , '' said Mr. Thomas Marvel . 
`` Howjer manage it ! 
How the dooce is it done ? '' 
`` It 's too long a story . 
And besides -- '' `` I tell you , the whole business fairly beats me , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` What I want to say at present is this : I need help . 
I have come to that -- I came upon you suddenly . 
I was wandering , mad with rage , naked , impotent . 
I could have murdered . 
And I saw you -- '' '' Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I came up behind you -- hesitated -- went on -- '' Mr. Marvel 's expression was eloquent . '' 
-- then stopped . 
` Here , ' I said , ` is an outcast like myself . 
This is the man for me . ' 
So I turned back and came to you -- you . 
And -- '' '' Lord ! '' 
said Mr. Marvel . 
`` But I 'm all in a tizzy . 
May I ask -- How is it ? 
And what you may be requiring in the way of help ? 
-- Invisible ! '' 
`` I want you to help me get clothes -- and shelter -- and then , with other things . 
I 've left them long enough . 
If you wo n't -- well ! 
But you will -- must . '' 
`` Look here , '' said Mr. Marvel . 
`` I 'm too flabbergasted . 
Do n't knock me about any more . 
And leave me go . 
I must get steady a bit . 
And you 've pretty near broken my toe . 
It 's all so unreasonable . 
Empty downs , empty sky . 
Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature . 
And then comes a voice . 
A voice out of heaven ! 
And stones ! 
And a fist -- Lord ! '' 
`` Pull yourself together , '' said the Voice , `` for you have to do the job I 've chosen for you . '' 
Mr. Marvel blew out his cheeks , and his eyes were round . 
`` I 've chosen you , '' said the Voice . 
`` You are the only man except some of those fools down there , who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man . 
You have to be my helper . 
Help me -- and I will do great things for you . 
An invisible man is a man of power . '' 
He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently . 
`` But if you betray me , '' he said , `` if you fail to do as I direct you -- '' He paused and tapped Mr. Marvel 's shoulder smartly . 
Mr. Marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch . 
`` I do n't want to betray you , '' said Mr. Marvel , edging away from the direction of the fingers . 
`` Do n't you go a-thinking that , whatever you do . 
All I want to do is to help you -- just tell me what I got to do . 
-LRB- Lord ! -RRB- 
Whatever you want done , that I 'm most willing to do . '' 
After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative . 
Scepticism suddenly reared its head -- rather nervous scepticism , not at all assured of its back , but scepticism nevertheless . 
It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man ; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air , or felt the strength of his arm , could be counted on the fingers of two hands . 
And of these witnesses Mr. Wadgers was presently missing , having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house , and Jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller , more tangible considerations . 
Iping was gay with bunting , and everybody was in gala dress . 
Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or more . 
By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion , on the supposition that he had quite gone away , and with the sceptics he was already a jest . 
But people , sceptics and believers alike , were remarkably sociable all that day . 
Haysman 's meadow was gay with a tent , in which Mrs. Bunting and other ladies were preparing tea , while , without , the Sunday-school children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses Cuss and Sackbut . 
No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air , but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced . 
On the village green an inclined strong -LSB- rope ? -RSB- 
, down which , clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle , one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end , came in for considerable favour among the adolescents , as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies . 
There was also promenading , and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music . 
Members of the club , who had attended church in the morning , were splendid in badges of pink and green , and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon . 
Old Fletcher , whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe , was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door -LRB- whichever way you chose to look -RRB- , poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs , and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room . 
About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs . 
He was a short , stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat , and he appeared to be very much out of breath . 
His cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed . 
His mottled face was apprehensive , and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity . 
He turned the corner of the church , and directed his way to the `` Coach and Horses . '' 
Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him , and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him . 
This stranger , to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , appeared to be talking to himself , and Mr. Huxter remarked the same thing . 
He stopped at the foot of the `` Coach and Horses '' steps , and , according to Mr. Huxter , appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house . 
Finally he marched up the steps , and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour . 
Mr. Huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error . 
`` That room 's private ! '' 
said Hall , and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar . 
In the course of a few minutes he reappeared , wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed Mr. Huxter as assumed . 
He stood looking about him for some moments , and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard , upon which the parlour window opened . 
The stranger , after some hesitation , leant against one of the gate-posts , produced a short clay pipe , and prepared to fill it . 
His fingers trembled while doing so . 
He lit it clumsily , and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude , an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied . 
All this Mr. Huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window , and the singularity of the man 's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation . 
Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket . 
Then he vanished into the yard . 
Forthwith Mr. Huxter , conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny , leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief . 
As he did so , Mr. Marvel reappeared , his hat askew , a big bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand , and three books tied together -- as it proved afterwards with the Vicar 's braces -- in the other . 
Directly he saw Huxter he gave a sort of gasp , and turning sharply to the left , began to run . 
`` Stop , thief ! '' 
cried Huxter , and set off after him . 
Mr. Huxter 's sensations were vivid but brief . 
He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road . 
He saw the village flags and festivities beyond , and a face or so turned towards him . 
He bawled , `` Stop ! '' 
again . 
He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion , and he was no longer running , but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air . 
He saw the ground suddenly close to his face . 
The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light , and subsequent proceedings interested him no more . 
Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn , it is necessary to go back to the moment when Mr. Marvel first came into view of Mr. Huxter 's window . 
At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour . 
They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning , and were , with Mr. Hall 's permission , making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man 's belongings . 
Jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends . 
The stranger 's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up . 
And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work , Cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled `` Diary . '' 
`` Diary ! '' 
said Cuss , putting the three books on the table . 
`` Now , at any rate , we shall learn something . '' 
The Vicar stood with his hands on the table . 
`` Diary , '' repeated Cuss , sitting down , putting two volumes to support the third , and opening it . 
`` H 'm -- no name on the fly-leaf . 
Bother ! 
-- cypher . 
And figures . '' 
The vicar came round to look over his shoulder .
