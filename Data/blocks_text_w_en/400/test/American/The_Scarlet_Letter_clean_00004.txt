said they among themselves . 
`` The saint on earth ! 
Alas ! 
if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul , what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine ! '' 
The minister well knew -- subtle , but remorseful hypocrite that he was ! 
-- the light in which his vague confession would be viewed . 
He had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience , but had gained only one other sin , and a self-acknowledged shame , without the momentary relief of being self-deceived . 
He had spoken the very truth , and transformed it into the veriest falsehood . 
And yet , by the constitution of his nature , he loved the truth , and loathed the lie , as few men ever did . 
Therefore , above all things else , he loathed his miserable self ! 
His inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old , corrupted faith of Rome than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred . 
In Mr. Dimmesdale 's secret closet , under lock and key , there was a bloody scourge . 
Oftentimes , this Protestant and Puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders , laughing bitterly at himself the while , and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh . 
It was his custom , too , as it has been that of many other pious Puritans , to fast -- not however , like them , in order to purify the body , and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination -- but rigorously , and until his knees trembled beneath him , as an act of penance . 
He kept vigils , likewise , night after night , sometimes in utter darkness , sometimes with a glimmering lamp , and sometimes , viewing his own face in a looking-glass , by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it . 
He thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured , but could not purify himself . 
In these lengthened vigils , his brain often reeled , and visions seemed to flit before him ; perhaps seen doubtfully , and by a faint light of their own , in the remote dimness of the chamber , or more vividly and close beside him , within the looking-glass . 
Now it was a herd of diabolic shapes , that grinned and mocked at the pale minister , and beckoned him away with them ; now a group of shining angels , who flew upward heavily , as sorrow-laden , but grew more ethereal as they rose . 
Now came the dead friends of his youth , and his white-bearded father , with a saint-like frown , and his mother turning her face away as she passed by . 
Ghost of a mother -- thinnest fantasy of a mother -- methinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son ! 
And now , through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly , glided Hester Prynne leading along little Pearl , in her scarlet garb , and pointing her forefinger , first at the scarlet letter on her bosom , and then at the clergyman 's own breast . 
None of these visions ever quite deluded him . 
At any moment , by an effort of his will , he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance , and convince himself that they were not solid in their nature , like yonder table of carved oak , or that big , square , leather-bound and brazen-clasped volume of divinity . 
But , for all that , they were , in one sense , the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with . 
It is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his , that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us , and which were meant by Heaven to be the spirit 's joy and nutriment . 
To the untrue man , the whole universe is false -- it is impalpable -- it shrinks to nothing within his grasp . 
And he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light , becomes a shadow , or , indeed , ceases to exist . 
The only truth that continued to give Mr. Dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul , and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect . 
Had he once found power to smile , and wear a face of gaiety , there would have been no such man ! 
On one of those ugly nights , which we have faintly hinted at , but forborne to picture forth , the minister started from his chair . 
A new thought had struck him . 
There might be a moment 's peace in it . 
Attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship , and precisely in the same manner , he stole softly down the staircase , undid the door , and issued forth . 
Walking in the shadow of a dream , as it were , and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism , Mr. Dimmesdale reached the spot where , now so long since , Hester Prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy . 
The same platform or scaffold , black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years , and foot-worn , too , with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it , remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house . 
The minister went up the steps . 
It was an obscure night in early May . 
An unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon . 
If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth , they would have discerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human shape , in the dark grey of the midnight . 
But the town was all asleep . 
There was no peril of discovery . 
The minister might stand there , if it so pleased him , until morning should redden in the east , without other risk than that the dank and chill night air would creep into his frame , and stiffen his joints with rheumatism , and clog his throat with catarrh and cough ; thereby defrauding the expectant audience of to-morrow 's prayer and sermon . 
No eye could see him , save that ever-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet , wielding the bloody scourge . 
Why , then , had he come hither ? 
Was it but the mockery of penitence ? 
A mockery , indeed , but in which his soul trifled with itself ! 
A mockery at which angels blushed and wept , while fiends rejoiced with jeering laughter ! 
He had been driven hither by the impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere , and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which invariably drew him back , with her tremulous gripe , just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure . 
Poor , miserable man ! 
what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime ? 
Crime is for the iron-nerved , who have their choice either to endure it , or , if it press too hard , to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose , and fling it off at once ! 
This feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither , yet continually did one thing or another , which intertwined , in the same inextricable knot , the agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance . 
And thus , while standing on the scaffold , in this vain show of expiation , Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind , as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast , right over his heart . 
On that spot , in very truth , there was , and there had long been , the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain . 
Without any effort of his will , or power to restrain himself , he shrieked aloud : an outcry that went pealing through the night , and was beaten back from one house to another , and reverberated from the hills in the background ; as if a company of devils , detecting so much misery and terror in it , had made a plaything of the sound , and were bandying it to and fro . 
`` It is done ! '' 
muttered the minister , covering his face with his hands . 
`` The whole town will awake and hurry forth , and find me here ! '' 
But it was not so . 
The shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power , to his own startled ears , than it actually possessed . 
The town did not awake ; or , if it did , the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream , or for the noise of witches , whose voices , at that period , were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages , as they rode with Satan through the air . 
The clergyman , therefore , hearing no symptoms of disturbance , uncovered his eyes and looked about him . 
At one of the chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham 's mansion , which stood at some distance , on the line of another street , he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand a white night-cap on his head , and a long white gown enveloping his figure . 
He looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the grave . 
The cry had evidently startled him . 
At another window of the same house , moreover appeared old Mistress Hibbins , the Governor 's sister , also with a lamp , which even thus far off revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face . 
She thrust forth her head from the lattice , and looked anxiously upward . 
Beyond the shadow of a doubt , this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr. Dimmesdale 's outcry , and interpreted it , with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations , as the clamour of the fiends and night-hags , with whom she was well known to make excursions in the forest . 
Detecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham 's lamp , the old lady quickly extinguished her own , and vanished . 
Possibly , she went up among the clouds . 
The minister saw nothing further of her motions . 
The magistrate , after a wary observation of the darkness -- into which , nevertheless , he could see but little further than he might into a mill-stone -- retired from the window . 
The minister grew comparatively calm . 
His eyes , however , were soon greeted by a little glimmering light , which , at first a long way off was approaching up the street . 
It threw a gleam of recognition , on here a post , and there a garden fence , and here a latticed window-pane , and there a pump , with its full trough of water , and here again an arched door of oak , with an iron knocker , and a rough log for the door-step . 
The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars , even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward , in the footsteps which he now heard ; and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more , and reveal his long-hidden secret . 
As the light drew nearer , he beheld , within its illuminated circle , his brother clergyman -- or , to speak more accurately , his professional father , as well as highly valued friend -- the Reverend Mr. Wilson , who , as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured , had been praying at the bedside of some dying man . 
And so he had . 
The good old minister came freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop , who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour . 
And now surrounded , like the saint-like personage of olden times , with a radiant halo , that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sin -- as if the departed Governor had left him an inheritance of his glory , or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city , while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates -- now , in short , good Father Wilson was moving homeward , aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern ! 
The glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale , who smiled -- nay , almost laughed at them -- and then wondered if he was going mad . 
As the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold , closely muffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm , and holding the lantern before his breast with the other , the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking -- `` A good evening to you , venerable Father Wilson . 
Come up hither , I pray you , and pass a pleasant hour with me ! '' 
Good Heavens ! 
Had Mr. Dimmesdale actually spoken ? 
For one instant he believed that these words had passed his lips . 
But they were uttered only within his imagination . 
The venerable Father Wilson continued to step slowly onward , looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet , and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform . 
When the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away , the minister discovered , by the faintness which came over him , that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety , although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness . 
Shortly afterwards , the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought . 
He felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night , and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold . 
Morning would break and find him there . 
The neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself . 
The earliest riser , coming forth in the dim twilight , would perceive a vaguely-defined figure aloft on the place of shame ; and half-crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity , would go knocking from door to door , summoning all the people to behold the ghost -- as he needs must think it -- of some defunct transgressor . 
A dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another . 
Then -- the morning light still waxing stronger -- old patriarchs would rise up in great haste , each in his flannel gown , and matronly dames , without pausing to put off their night-gear . 
The whole tribe of decorous personages , who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry , would start into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects . 
Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth , with his King James ' ruff fastened askew , and Mistress Hibbins , with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts , and looking sourer than ever , as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride ; and good Father Wilson too , after spending half the night at a death-bed , and liking ill to be disturbed , thus early , out of his dreams about the glorified saints . 
Hither , likewise , would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale 's church , and the young virgins who so idolized their minister , and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms , which now , by-the-bye , in their hurry and confusion , they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs . 
All people , in a word , would come stumbling over their thresholds , and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold . 
Whom would they discern there , with the red eastern light upon his brow ? 
Whom , but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale , half-frozen to death , overwhelmed with shame , and standing where Hester Prynne had stood ! 
Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture , the minister , unawares , and to his own infinite alarm , burst into a great peal of laughter . 
It was immediately responded to by a light , airy , childish laugh , in which , with a thrill of the heart -- but he knew not whether of exquisite pain , or pleasure as acute -- he recognised the tones of little Pearl . 
`` Pearl ! 
Little Pearl ! '' 
cried he , after a moment 's pause ; then , suppressing his voice -- `` Hester ! 
Hester Prynne ! 
Are you there ? '' 
`` Yes ; it is Hester Prynne ! '' 
she replied , in a tone of surprise ; and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the side-walk , along which she had been passing . 
`` It is I , and my little Pearl . '' 
`` Whence come you , Hester ? '' 
asked the minister . 
`` What sent you hither ? '' 
`` I have been watching at a death-bed , '' answered Hester Prynne `` at Governor Winthrop 's death-bed , and have taken his measure for a robe , and am now going homeward to my dwelling . '' 
`` Come up hither , Hester , thou and little Pearl , '' said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale . 
`` Ye have both been here before , but I was not with you . 
Come up hither once again , and we will stand all three together . '' 
She silently ascended the steps , and stood on the platform , holding little Pearl by the hand . 
The minister felt for the child 's other hand , and took it . 
The moment that he did so , there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life , other life than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart , and hurrying through all his veins , as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system . 
The three formed an electric chain . 
`` Minister ! '' 
whispered little Pearl . 
`` What wouldst thou say , child ? '' 
asked Mr. Dimmesdale . 
`` Wilt thou stand here with mother and me , to-morrow noontide ? '' 
inquired Pearl . 
`` Nay ; not so , my little Pearl , '' answered the minister ; for , with the new energy of the moment , all the dread of public exposure , that had so long been the anguish of his life , had returned upon him ; and he was already trembling at the conjunction in which -- with a strange joy , nevertheless -- he now found himself -- `` not so , my child . 
I shall , indeed , stand with thy mother and thee one other day , but not to-morrow . '' 
Pearl laughed , and attempted to pull away her hand . 
But the minister held it fast . 
`` A moment longer , my child ! '' 
said he . 
`` But wilt thou promise , '' asked Pearl , `` to take my hand , and mother 's hand , to-morrow noontide ? '' 
`` Not then , Pearl , '' said the minister ; `` but another time . '' 
`` And what other time ? '' 
persisted the child . 
`` At the great judgment day , '' whispered the minister ; and , strangely enough , the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so . 
`` Then , and there , before the judgment-seat , thy mother , and thou , and I must stand together . 
But the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting ! '' 
Pearl laughed again . 
But before Mr. Dimmesdale had done speaking , a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky . 
It was doubtless caused by one of those meteors , which the night-watcher may so often observe burning out to waste , in the vacant regions of the atmosphere . 
So powerful was its radiance , that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth . 
The great vault brightened , like the dome of an immense lamp . 
It showed the familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of mid-day , but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light . 
The wooden houses , with their jutting storeys and quaint gable-peaks ; the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them ; the garden-plots , black with freshly-turned earth ; the wheel-track , little worn , and even in the market-place margined with green on either side -- all were visible , but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before . 
And there stood the minister , with his hand over his heart ; and Hester Prynne , with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom ; and little Pearl , herself a symbol , and the connecting link between those two . 
They stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendour , as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets , and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another . 
There was witchcraft in little Pearl 's eyes ; and her face , as she glanced upward at the minister , wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish . 
She withdrew her hand from Mr. Dimmesdale 's , and pointed across the street . 
But he clasped both his hands over his breast , and cast his eyes towards the zenith . 
Nothing was more common , in those days , than to interpret all meteoric appearances , and other natural phenomena that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon , as so many revelations from a supernatural source . 
Thus , a blazing spear , a sword of flame , a bow , or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky , prefigured Indian warfare . 
Pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light . 
We doubt whether any marked event , for good or evil , ever befell New England , from its settlement down to revolutionary times , of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of its nature . 
Not seldom , it had been seen by multitudes . 
Oftener , however , its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eye-witness , who beheld the wonder through the coloured , magnifying , and distorted medium of his imagination , and shaped it more distinctly in his after-thought . 
It was , indeed , a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed , in these awful hieroglyphics , on the cope of heaven . 
A scroll so wide might not be deemed too expensive for Providence to write a people 's doom upon . 
The belief was a favourite one with our forefathers , as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness . 
But what shall we say , when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone , on the same vast sheet of record . 
In such a case , it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state , when a man , rendered morbidly self-contemplative by long , intense , and secret pain , had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature , until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his soul 's history and fate . 
We impute it , therefore , solely to the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister , looking upward to the zenith , beheld there the appearance of an immense letter -- the letter A -- marked out in lines of dull red light . 
Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point , burning duskily through a veil of cloud , but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it , or , at least , with so little definiteness , that another 's guilt might have seen another symbol in it . 
There was a singular circumstance that characterised Mr. Dimmesdale 's psychological state at this moment . 
All the time that he gazed upward to the zenith , he was , nevertheless , perfectly aware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth , who stood at no great distance from the scaffold . 
The minister appeared to see him , with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter . 
To his feature as to all other objects , the meteoric light imparted a new expression ; or it might well be that the physician was not careful then , as at all other times , to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim . 
Certainly , if the meteor kindled up the sky , and disclosed the earth , with an awfulness that admonished Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment , then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend , standing there with a smile and scowl , to claim his own . 
So vivid was the expression , or so intense the minister 's perception of it , that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished , with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated . 
`` Who is that man , Hester ? '' 
gasped Mr. Dimmesdale , overcome with terror . 
`` I shiver at him ! 
Dost thou know the man ? 
I hate him , Hester ! '' 
She remembered her oath , and was silent . 
`` I tell thee , my soul shivers at him ! '' 
muttered the minister again . 
`` Who is he ? 
Who is he ? 
Canst thou do nothing for me ? 
I have a nameless horror of the man ! '' 
`` Minister , '' said little Pearl , `` I can tell thee who he is ! '' 
`` Quickly , then , child ! '' 
said the minister , bending his ear close to her lips . 
`` Quickly , and as low as thou canst whisper . '' 
Pearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded , indeed , like human language , but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with by the hour together . 
At all events , if it involved any secret information in regard to old Roger Chillingworth , it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman , and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind . 
The elvish child then laughed aloud . 
`` Dost thou mock me now ? '' 
said the minister . 
`` Thou wast not bold ! 
-- thou wast not true ! '' 
answered the child . 
`` Thou wouldst not promise to take my hand , and mother 's hand , to-morrow noon-tide ! '' 
`` Worthy sir , '' answered the physician , who had now advanced to the foot of the platform -- `` pious Master Dimmesdale ! 
can this be you ? 
Well , well , indeed ! 
We men of study , whose heads are in our books , have need to be straitly looked after ! 
We dream in our waking moments , and walk in our sleep . 
Come , good sir , and my dear friend , I pray you let me lead you home ! '' 
`` How knewest thou that I was here ? '' 
asked the minister , fearfully . 
`` Verily , and in good faith , '' answered Roger Chillingworth , `` I knew nothing of the matter . 
I had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop , doing what my poor skill might to give him ease . 
He , going home to a better world , I , likewise , was on my way homeward , when this light shone out . 
Come with me , I beseech you , Reverend sir , else you will be poorly able to do Sabbath duty to-morrow . 
Aha ! 
see now how they trouble the brain -- these books ! 
-- these books ! 
You should study less , good sir , and take a little pastime , or these night whimsies will grow upon you . '' 
`` I will go home with you , '' said Mr. Dimmesdale . 
With a chill despondency , like one awakening , all nerveless , from an ugly dream , he yielded himself to the physician , and was led away . 
The next day , however , being the Sabbath , he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful , and the most replete with heavenly influences , that had ever proceeded from his lips . 
Souls , it is said , more souls than one , were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon , and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter . 
But as he came down the pulpit steps , the grey-bearded sexton met him , holding up a black glove , which the minister recognised as his own . 
`` It was found , '' said the Sexton , `` this morning on the scaffold where evil-doers are set up to public shame . 
Satan dropped it there , I take it , intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence . 
But , indeed , he was blind and foolish , as he ever and always is . 
A pure hand needs no glove to cover it ! '' 
`` Thank you , my good friend , '' said the minister , gravely , but startled at heart ; for so confused was his remembrance , that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary . 
`` Yes , it seems to be my glove , indeed ! '' 
`` And , since Satan saw fit to steal it , your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward , '' remarked the old sexton , grimly smiling . 
`` But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night ? 
a great red letter in the sky -- the letter A , which we interpret to stand for Angel . 
For , as our good Governor Winthrop was made an angel this past night , it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof ! '' 
`` No , '' answered the minister ; `` I had not heard of it . '' 
In her late singular interview with Mr. Dimmesdale , Hester Prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced . 
His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed . 
His moral force was abased into more than childish weakness . 
It grovelled helpless on the ground , even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength , or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy , which disease only could have given them . 
With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others , she could readily infer that , besides the legitimate action of his own conscience , a terrible machinery had been brought to bear , and was still operating , on Mr. Dimmesdale 's well-being and repose . 
Knowing what this poor fallen man had once been , her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to her -- the outcast woman -- for support against his instinctively discovered enemy . 
She decided , moreover , that he had a right to her utmost aid . 
Little accustomed , in her long seclusion from society , to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself , Hester saw -- or seemed to see -- that there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman , which she owned to no other , nor to the whole world besides . 
The links that united her to the rest of humankind -- links of flowers , or silk , or gold , or whatever the material -- had all been broken . 
Here was the iron link of mutual crime , which neither he nor she could break . 
Like all other ties , it brought along with it its obligations . 
Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy . 
Years had come and gone . 
Pearl was now seven years old . 
Her mother , with the scarlet letter on her breast , glittering in its fantastic embroidery , had long been a familiar object to the townspeople . 
As is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community , and , at the same time , interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience , a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to Hester Prynne . 
It is to the credit of human nature that , except where its selfishness is brought into play , it loves more readily than it hates . 
Hatred , by a gradual and quiet process , will even be transformed to love , unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility . 
In this matter of Hester Prynne there was neither irritation nor irksomeness . 
She never battled with the public , but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage ; she made no claim upon it in requital for what she suffered ; she did not weigh upon its sympathies . 
Then , also , the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favour . 
With nothing now to lose , in the sight of mankind , and with no hope , and seemingly no wish , of gaining anything , it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths . 
It was perceived , too , that while Hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the world 's privileges -- further than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the faithful labour of her hands -- she was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred . 
None so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty , even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door , or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch 's robe . 
None so self-devoted as Hester when pestilence stalked through the town . 
In all seasons of calamity , indeed , whether general or of individuals , the outcast of society at once found her place . 
She came , not as a guest , but as a rightful inmate , into the household that was darkened by trouble , as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creature . 
There glimmered the embroidered letter , with comfort in its unearthly ray . 
Elsewhere the token of sin , it was the taper of the sick chamber . 
It had even thrown its gleam , in the sufferer 's bard extremity , across the verge of time . 
It had shown him where to set his foot , while the light of earth was fast becoming dim , and ere the light of futurity could reach him . 
In such emergencies Hester 's nature showed itself warm and rich -- a well-spring of human tenderness , unfailing to every real demand , and inexhaustible by the largest . 
Her breast , with its badge of shame , was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one . 
She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy , or , we may rather say , the world 's heavy hand had so ordained her , when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result . 
The letter was the symbol of her calling . 
Such helpfulness was found in her -- so much power to do , and power to sympathise -- that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification . 
They said that it meant Abel , so strong was Hester Prynne , with a woman 's strength . 
It was only the darkened house that could contain her . 
When sunshine came again , she was not there . 
Her shadow had faded across the threshold . 
The helpful inmate had departed , without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude , if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously . 
Meeting them in the street , she never raised her head to receive their greeting . 
If they were resolute to accost her , she laid her finger on the scarlet letter , and passed on . 
This might be pride , but was so like humility , that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind . 
The public is despotic in its temper ; it is capable of denying common justice when too strenuously demanded as a right ; but quite as frequently it awards more than justice , when the appeal is made , as despots love to have it made , entirely to its generosity . 
Interpreting Hester Prynne 's deportment as an appeal of this nature , society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favoured with , or , perchance , than she deserved . 
The rulers , and the wise and learned men of the community , were longer in acknowledging the influence of Hester 's good qualities than the people . 
The prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron frame-work of reasoning , that made it a far tougher labour to expel them . 
Day by day , nevertheless , their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which , in the due course of years , might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence . 
Thus it was with the men of rank , on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals . 
Individuals in private life , meanwhile , had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her frailty ; nay , more , they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token , not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance , but of her many good deeds since . 
`` Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge ? '' 
they would say to strangers . 
`` It is our Hester -- the town 's own Hester -- who is so kind to the poor , so helpful to the sick , so comfortable to the afflicted ! '' 
Then , it is true , the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself , when embodied in the person of another , would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years . 
It was none the less a fact , however , that in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus , the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nun 's bosom . 
It imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness , which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril . 
Had she fallen among thieves , it would have kept her safe . 
It was reported , and believed by many , that an Indian had drawn his arrow against the badge , and that the missile struck it , and fell harmless to the ground . 
The effect of the symbol -- or rather , of the position in respect to society that was indicated by it -- on the mind of Hester Prynne herself was powerful and peculiar . 
All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand , and had long ago fallen away , leaving a bare and harsh outline , which might have been repulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it . 
Even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change . 
It might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress , and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners . 
It was a sad transformation , too , that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off , or was so completely hidden by a cap , that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine . 
It was due in part to all these causes , but still more to something else , that there seemed to be no longer anything in Hester 's face for Love to dwell upon ; nothing in Hester 's form , though majestic and statue like , that Passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace ; nothing in Hester 's bosom to make it ever again the pillow of Affection . 
Some attribute had departed from her , the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman . 
Such is frequently the fate , and such the stern development , of the feminine character and person , when the woman has encountered , and lived through , an experience of peculiar severity . 
If she be all tenderness , she will die . 
If she survive , the tenderness will either be crushed out of her , or -- and the outward semblance is the same -- crushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more . 
The latter is perhaps the truest theory . 
She who has once been a woman , and ceased to be so , might at any moment become a woman again , if there were only the magic touch to effect the transformation . 
We shall see whether Hester Prynne were ever afterwards so touched and so transfigured . 
Much of the marble coldness of Hester 's impression was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned , in a great measure , from passion and feeling to thought . 
Standing alone in the world -- alone , as to any dependence on society , and with little Pearl to be guided and protected -- alone , and hopeless of retrieving her position , even had she not scorned to consider it desirable -- she cast away the fragment of a broken chain . 
The world 's law was no law for her mind . 
It was an age in which the human intellect , newly emancipated , had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before . 
Men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings . 
Men bolder than these had overthrown and rearranged -- not actually , but within the sphere of theory , which was their most real abode -- the whole system of ancient prejudice , wherewith was linked much of ancient principle . 
Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit . 
She assumed a freedom of speculation , then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic , but which our forefathers , had they known it , would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatised by the scarlet letter . 
In her lonesome cottage , by the seashore , thoughts visited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in New England ; shadowy guests , that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer , could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door . 
It is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society . 
The thought suffices them , without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action . 
So it seemed to be with Hester . 
Yet , had little Pearl never come to her from the spiritual world , it might have been far otherwise . 
Then she might have come down to us in history , hand in hand with Ann Hutchinson , as the foundress of a religious sect . 
She might , in one of her phases , have been a prophetess . 
She might , and not improbably would , have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period , for attempting to undermine the foundations of the Puritan establishment . 
But , in the education of her child , the mother 's enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon . 
Providence , in the person of this little girl , had assigned to Hester 's charge , the germ and blossom of womanhood , to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties . 
Everything was against her . 
The world was hostile . 
The child 's own nature had something wrong in it which continually betokened that she had been born amiss -- the effluence of her mother 's lawless passion -- and often impelled Hester to ask , in bitterness of heart , whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all . 
Indeed , the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood . 
Was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them ? 
As concerned her own individual existence , she had long ago decided in the negative , and dismissed the point as settled . 
A tendency to speculation , though it may keep women quiet , as it does man , yet makes her sad . 
She discerns , it may be , such a hopeless task before her . 
As a first step , the whole system of society is to be torn down and built up anew . 
Then the very nature of the opposite sex , or its long hereditary habit , which has become like nature , is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position . 
Finally , all other difficulties being obviated , woman can not take advantage of these preliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change , in which , perhaps , the ethereal essence , wherein she has her truest life , will be found to have evaporated . 
A woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought . 
They are not to be solved , or only in one way . 
If her heart chance to come uppermost , they vanish . 
Thus Hester Prynne , whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb , wandered without a clue in the dark labyrinth of mind ; now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice ; now starting back from a deep chasm . 
There was wild and ghastly scenery all around her , and a home and comfort nowhere . 
At times a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul , whether it were not better to send Pearl at once to Heaven , and go herself to such futurity as Eternal Justice should provide . 
The scarlet letter had not done its office . 
Now , however , her interview with the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale , on the night of his vigil , had given her a new theme of reflection , and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment . 
She had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled , or , to speak more accurately , had ceased to struggle . 
She saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy , if he had not already stepped across it . 
It was impossible to doubt that , whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse , a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief . 
A secret enemy had been continually by his side , under the semblance of a friend and helper , and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of Mr. Dimmesdale 's nature . 
Hester could not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a defect of truth , courage , and loyalty on her own part , in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped . 
Her only justification lay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by acquiescing in Roger Chillingworth 's scheme of disguise . 
Under that impulse she had made her choice , and had chosen , as it now appeared , the more wretched alternative of the two . 
She determined to redeem her error so far as it might yet be possible . 
Strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial , she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with Roger Chillingworth as on that night , abased by sin and half-maddened by the ignominy that was still new , when they had talked together in the prison-chamber . 
She had climbed her way since then to a higher point . 
The old man , on the other hand , had brought himself nearer to her level , or , perhaps , below it , by the revenge which he had stooped for . 
In fine , Hester Prynne resolved to meet her former husband , and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe . 
The occasion was not long to seek . 
One afternoon , walking with Pearl in a retired part of the peninsula , she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand , stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicine withal . 
Hester bade little Pearl run down to the margin of the water , and play with the shells and tangled sea-weed , until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs . 
So the child flew away like a bird , and , making bare her small white feet went pattering along the moist margin of the sea . 
Here and there she came to a full stop , and peeped curiously into a pool , left by the retiring tide as a mirror for Pearl to see her face in . 
Forth peeped at her , out of the pool , with dark , glistening curls around her head , and an elf-smile in her eyes , the image of a little maid whom Pearl , having no other playmate , invited to take her hand and run a race with her . 
But the visionary little maid on her part , beckoned likewise , as if to say -- `` This is a better place ; come thou into the pool . '' 
And Pearl , stepping in mid-leg deep , beheld her own white feet at the bottom ; while , out of a still lower depth , came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile , floating to and fro in the agitated water . 
Meanwhile her mother had accosted the physician . 
`` I would speak a word with you , '' said she -- `` a word that concerns us much . '' 
`` Aha ! 
and is it Mistress Hester that has a word for old Roger Chillingworth ? '' 
answered he , raising himself from his stooping posture . 
`` With all my heart ! 
Why , mistress , I hear good tidings of you on all hands ! 
No longer ago than yester-eve , a magistrate , a wise and godly man , was discoursing of your affairs , Mistress Hester , and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council . 
It was debated whether or no , with safety to the commonweal , yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom . 
On my life , Hester , I made my intreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith . '' 
`` It lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off the badge , '' calmly replied Hester . 
`` Were I worthy to be quit of it , it would fall away of its own nature , or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport . '' 
`` Nay , then , wear it , if it suit you better , '' rejoined he , `` A woman must needs follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person . 
The letter is gaily embroidered , and shows right bravely on your bosom ! '' 
All this while Hester had been looking steadily at the old man , and was shocked , as well as wonder-smitten , to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years . 
It was not so much that he had grown older ; for though the traces of advancing life were visible he bore his age well , and seemed to retain a wiry vigour and alertness . 
But the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man , calm and quiet , which was what she best remembered in him , had altogether vanished , and been succeeded by an eager , searching , almost fierce , yet carefully guarded look . 
It seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile , but the latter played him false , and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it . 
Ever and anon , too , there came a glare of red light out of his eyes , as if the old man 's soul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast , until by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary flame . 
This he repressed as speedily as possible , and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened . 
In a word , old Roger Chillingworth was a striking evidence of man 's faculty of transforming himself into a devil , if he will only , for a reasonable space of time , undertake a devil 's office . 
This unhappy person had effected such a transformation by devoting himself for seven years to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture , and deriving his enjoyment thence , and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analysed and gloated over . 
The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne 's bosom . 
Here was another ruin , the responsibility of which came partly home to her . 
`` What see you in my face , '' asked the physician , `` that you look at it so earnestly ? '' 
`` Something that would make me weep , if there were any tears bitter enough for it , '' answered she . 
`` But let it pass ! 
It is of yonder miserable man that I would speak . '' 
`` And what of him ? '' 
cried Roger Chillingworth , eagerly , as if he loved the topic , and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant . 
`` Not to hide the truth , Mistress Hester , my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the gentleman . 
So speak freely and I will make answer . '' 
`` When we last spake together , '' said Hester , `` now seven years ago , it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me . 
As the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands there seemed no choice to me , save to be silent in accordance with your behest . 
Yet it was not without heavy misgivings that I thus bound myself , for , having cast off all duty towards other human beings , there remained a duty towards him , and something whispered me that I was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your counsel . 
Since that day no man is so near to him as you . 
You tread behind his every footstep . 
You are beside him , sleeping and waking . 
You search his thoughts . 
You burrow and rankle in his heart ! 
Your clutch is on his life , and you cause him to die daily a living death , and still he knows you not .
