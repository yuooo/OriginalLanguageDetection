`` How ? '' 
`` By means of a coin dated 1610 , which bears the effigy of Henry IV. ; and another of 1612 , bearing that of Louis XIII . 
So I presumed that , there being only two years between the two dates , Louis was Henry 's successor . '' 
`` Then , '' said Aramis , `` you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis XIII . ? '' 
`` I do , '' answered the youth , slightly reddening . 
`` Well , he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects , always , alas ! 
deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that his minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of France . 
The king himself was of a feeble character , and died young and unhappy . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` He had been long anxious about having a heir ; a care which weighs heavily on princes , who desire to leave behind them more than one pledge that their best thoughts and works will be continued . '' 
`` Did the king , then , die childless ? '' 
asked the prisoner , smiling . 
`` No , but he was long without one , and for a long while thought he should be the last of his race . 
This idea had reduced him to the depths of despair , when suddenly , his wife , Anne of Austria -- '' The prisoner trembled . 
`` Did you know , '' said Aramis , `` that Louis XIII . 
's wife was called Anne of Austria ? '' 
`` Continue , '' said the young man , without replying to the question . 
`` When suddenly , '' resumed Aramis , `` the queen announced an interesting event . 
There was great joy at the intelligence , and all prayed for her happy delivery . 
On the 5th of September , 1638 , she gave birth to a son . '' 
Here Aramis looked at his companion , and thought he observed him turning pale . 
`` You are about to hear , '' said Aramis , `` an account which few indeed could now avouch ; for it refers to a secret which they imagined buried with the dead , entombed in the abyss of the confessional . '' 
`` And you will tell me this secret ? '' 
broke in the youth . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Aramis , with unmistakable emphasis , `` I do not know that I ought to risk this secret by intrusting it to one who has no desire to quit the Bastile . '' 
`` I hear you , monsieur . '' 
`` The queen , then , gave birth to a son . 
But while the court was rejoicing over the event , when the king had shown the new-born child to the nobility and people , and was sitting gayly down to table , to celebrate the event , the queen , who was alone in her room , was again taken ill and gave birth to a second son . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the prisoner , betraying a better acquaintance with affairs than he had owned to , `` I thought that Monsieur was only born in -- '' Aramis raised his finger ; `` Permit me to continue , '' he said . 
The prisoner sighed impatiently , and paused . 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , `` the queen had a second son , whom Dame Perronnette , the midwife , received in her arms . '' 
`` Dame Perronnette ! '' 
murmured the young man . 
`` They ran at once to the banqueting-room , and whispered to the king what had happened ; he rose and quitted the table . 
But this time it was no longer happiness that his face expressed , but something akin to terror . 
The birth of twins changed into bitterness the joy to which that of an only son had given rise , seeing that in France -LRB- a fact you are assuredly ignorant of -RRB- it is the oldest of the king 's sons who succeeds his father . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` And that the doctors and jurists assert that there is ground for doubting whether the son that first makes his appearance is the elder by the law of heaven and of nature . '' 
The prisoner uttered a smothered cry , and became whiter than the coverlet under which he hid himself . 
`` Now you understand , '' pursued Aramis , `` that the king , who with so much pleasure saw himself repeated in one , was in despair about two ; fearing that the second might dispute the first 's claim to seniority , which had been recognized only two hours before ; and so this second son , relying on party interests and caprices , might one day sow discord and engender civil war throughout the kingdom ; by these means destroying the very dynasty he should have strengthened . '' 
`` Oh , I understand ! 
-- I understand ! '' 
murmured the young man . 
`` Well , '' continued Aramis ; `` this is what they relate , what they declare ; this is why one of the queen 's two sons , shamefully parted from his brother , shamefully sequestered , is buried in profound obscurity ; this is why that second son has disappeared , and so completely , that not a soul in France , save his mother , is aware of his existence . '' 
`` Yes ! 
his mother , who has cast him off , '' cried the prisoner in a tone of despair . 
`` Except , also , '' Aramis went on , `` the lady in the black dress ; and , finally , excepting -- '' `` Excepting yourself -- is it not ? 
You who come and relate all this ; you , who rouse in my soul curiosity , hatred , ambition , and , perhaps , even the thirst of vengeance ; except you , monsieur , who , if you are the man to whom I expect , whom the note I have received applies to , whom , in short , Heaven ought to send me , must possess about you -- '' `` What ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` A portrait of the king , Louis XIV. , who at this moment reigns upon the throne of France . '' 
`` Here is the portrait , '' replied the bishop , handing the prisoner a miniature in enamel , on which Louis was depicted life-like , with a handsome , lofty mien . 
The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait , and gazed at it with devouring eyes . 
`` And now , monseigneur , '' said Aramis , `` here is a mirror . '' 
Aramis left the prisoner time to recover his ideas . 
`` So high ! 
-- so high ! '' 
murmured the young man , eagerly comparing the likeness of Louis with his own countenance reflected in the glass . 
`` What do you think of it ? '' 
at length said Aramis . 
`` I think that I am lost , '' replied the captive ; `` the king will never set me free . '' 
`` And I -- I demand to know , '' added the bishop , fixing his piercing eyes significantly upon the prisoner , `` I demand to know which of these two is king ; the one this miniature portrays , or whom the glass reflects ? '' 
`` The king , monsieur , '' sadly replied the young man , `` is he who is on the throne , who is not in prison ; and who , on the other hand , can cause others to be entombed there . 
Royalty means power ; and you behold how powerless I am . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' answered Aramis , with a respect he had not yet manifested , `` the king , mark me , will , if you desire it , be the one that , quitting his dungeon , shall maintain himself upon the throne , on which his friends will place him . '' 
`` Tempt me not , monsieur , '' broke in the prisoner bitterly . 
`` Be not weak , monseigneur , '' persisted Aramis ; `` I have brought you all the proofs of your birth ; consult them ; satisfy yourself that you are a king 's son ; it is for us to act . '' 
`` No , no ; it is impossible . '' 
`` Unless , indeed , '' resumed the bishop ironically , `` it be the destiny of your race , that the brothers excluded from the throne should be always princes void of courage and honesty , as was your uncle , M. Gaston d'Orleans , who ten times conspired against his brother Louis XIII . '' 
`` What ! '' 
cried the prince , astonished ; `` my uncle Gaston ` conspired against his brother ' ; conspired to dethrone him ? '' 
`` Exactly , monseigneur ; for no other reason . 
I tell you the truth . '' 
`` And he had friends -- devoted friends ? '' 
`` As much so as I am to you . '' 
`` And , after all , what did he do ? 
-- Failed ! '' 
`` He failed , I admit ; but always through his own fault ; and , for the sake of purchasing -- not his life -- for the life of the king 's brother is sacred and inviolable -- but his liberty , he sacrificed the lives of all his friends , one after another . 
And so , at this day , he is a very blot on history , the detestation of a hundred noble families in this kingdom . '' 
`` I understand , monsieur ; either by weakness or treachery , my uncle slew his friends . '' 
`` By weakness ; which , in princes , is always treachery . '' 
`` And can not a man fail , then , from incapacity and ignorance ? 
Do you really believe it possible that a poor captive such as I , brought up , not only at a distance from the court , but even from the world -- do you believe it possible that such a one could assist those of his friends who should attempt to serve him ? '' 
And as Aramis was about to reply , the young man suddenly cried out , with a violence which betrayed the temper of his blood , `` We are speaking of friends ; but how can I have any friends -- I , whom no one knows ; and have neither liberty , money , nor influence , to gain any ? '' 
`` I fancy I had the honor to offer myself to your royal highness . '' 
`` Oh , do not style me so , monsieur ; 't is either treachery or cruelty . 
Bid me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls , which so grimly confine me ; let me again love , or , at least , submit to my slavery and my obscurity . '' 
`` Monseigneur , monseigneur ; if you again utter these desperate words -- if , after having received proof of your high birth , you still remain poor-spirited in body and soul , I will comply with your desire , I will depart , and renounce forever the service of a master , to whom so eagerly I came to devote my assistance and my life ! '' 
`` Monsieur , '' cried the prince , `` would it not have been better for you to have reflected , before telling me all that you have done , that you have broken my heart forever ? '' 
`` And so I desire to do , monseigneur . '' 
`` To talk to me about power , grandeur , eye , and to prate of thrones ! 
Is a prison the fit place ? 
You wish to make me believe in splendor , and we are lying lost in night ; you boast of glory , and we are smothering our words in the curtains of this miserable bed ; you give me glimpses of power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer in the corridor -- that step which , after all , makes you tremble more than it does me . 
To render me somewhat less incredulous , free me from the Bastile ; let me breathe the fresh air ; give me my spurs and trusty sword , then we shall begin to understand each other . '' 
`` It is precisely my intention to give you all this , monseigneur , and more ; only , do you desire it ? '' 
`` A word more , '' said the prince . 
`` I know there are guards in every gallery , bolts to every door , cannon and soldiery at every barrier . 
How will you overcome the sentries -- spike the guns ? 
How will you break through the bolts and bars ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , -- how did you get the note which announced my arrival to you ? '' 
`` You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note . '' 
`` If we can corrupt one turnkey , we can corrupt ten . '' 
`` Well ; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile ; possible so to conceal him that the king 's people shall not again ensnare him ; possible , in some unknown retreat , to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
said Aramis , smiling . 
`` I admit that , whoever would do this much for me , would seem more than mortal in my eyes ; but as you tell me I am a prince , brother of the king , how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of ? 
And as , to effect this , I must pass a life of war and hatred , how can you cause me to prevail in those combats -- render me invulnerable by my enemies ? 
Ah ! 
monsieur , reflect on all this ; place me , to-morrow , in some dark cavern at a mountain 's base ; yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river , plain and valley , of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens , or the stormy sky , and it is enough . 
Promise me no more than this , for , indeed , more you can not give , and it would be a crime to deceive me , since you call yourself my friend . '' 
Aramis waited in silence . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , after a moment 's reflection , `` I admire the firm , sound sense which dictates your words ; I am happy to have discovered my monarch 's mind . '' 
`` Again , again ! 
oh , God ! 
for mercy 's sake , '' cried the prince , pressing his icy hands upon his clammy brow , `` do not play with me ! 
I have no need to be a king to be the happiest of men . '' 
`` But I , monseigneur , wish you to be a king for the good of humanity . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the prince , with fresh distrust inspired by the word ; `` ah ! 
with what , then , has humanity to reproach my brother ? '' 
`` I forgot to say , monseigneur , that if you would allow me to guide you , and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom , you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause , and these friends are numerous . '' 
`` Numerous ? '' 
`` Less numerous than powerful , monseigneur . '' 
`` Explain yourself . '' 
`` It is impossible ; I will explain , I swear before Heaven , on that day that I see you sitting on the throne of France . '' 
`` But my brother ? '' 
`` You shall decree his fate . 
Do you pity him ? '' 
`` Him , who leaves me to perish in a dungeon ? 
No , no . 
For him I have no pity ! '' 
`` So much the better . '' 
`` He might have himself come to this prison , have taken me by the hand , and have said , ` My brother , Heaven created us to love , not to contend with one another . 
I come to you . 
A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity , far from mankind , deprived of every joy . 
I will make you sit down beside me ; I will buckle round your waist our father 's sword . 
Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me ? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood ? ' 
` Oh ! 
never , ' I would have replied to him , ' I look on you as my preserver , I will respect you as my master . 
You give me far more than Heaven bestowed ; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world . ' '' 
`` And you would have kept your word , monseigneur ? '' 
`` On my life ! 
While now -- now that I have guilty ones to punish -- '' `` In what manner , monseigneur ? '' 
`` What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother ? '' 
`` I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded ; I say that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike , of her own flesh , and I conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium . '' 
`` By which you mean -- '' `` That if I restore you to your place on your brother 's throne , he shall take yours in prison . '' 
`` Alas ! 
there 's such infinity of suffering in prison , especially it would be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment . '' 
`` Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire ; and if it seems good to you , after punishment , you will have it in your power to pardon . '' 
`` Good . 
And now , are you aware of one thing , monsieur ? '' 
`` Tell me , my prince . '' 
`` It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the Bastile . '' 
`` I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the pleasure of seeing you once again . '' 
`` And when ? '' 
`` The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how will you give me notice of it ? '' 
`` By myself coming to fetch you . '' 
`` Yourself ? '' 
`` My prince , do not leave this chamber save with me , or if in my absence you are compelled to do so , remember that I am not concerned in it . '' 
`` And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever , save to you ? '' 
`` Save only to me . '' 
Aramis bowed very low . 
The prince offered his hand . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , in a tone that issued from his heart , `` one word more , my last . 
If you have sought me for my destruction ; if you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies ; if from our conference , in which you have sounded the depths of my mind , anything worse than captivity result , that is to say , if death befall me , still receive my blessing , for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long , weary years . '' 
`` Monseigneur , wait the results ere you judge me , '' said Aramis . 
`` I say that , in such a case , I bless and forgive you . 
If , on the other hand , you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven ; if by your means I am enabled to live in the memory of man , and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor , or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people ; if , from my present depths of sorrow , aided by your generous hand , I raise myself to the very height of honor , then to you , whom I thank with blessings , to you will I offer half my power and my glory : though you would still be but partly recompensed , and your share must always remain incomplete , since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands . '' 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied Aramis , moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man , `` the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration . 
It is not you who will have to thank me , but rather the nation whom you will render happy , the posterity whose name you will make glorious . 
Yes ; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than life , I shall have given you immortality . '' 
The prince offered his hand to Aramis , who sank upon his knee and kissed it . 
`` It is the first act of homage paid to our future king , '' said he . 
`` When I see you again , I shall say , ` Good day , sire . ' '' 
`` Till then , '' said the young man , pressing his wan and wasted fingers over his heart , -- `` till then , no more dreams , no more strain on my life -- my heart would break ! 
Oh , monsieur , how small is my prison -- how low the window -- how narrow are the doors ! 
To think that so much pride , splendor , and happiness , should be able to enter in and to remain here ! '' 
`` Your royal highness makes me proud , '' said Aramis , `` since you infer it is I who brought all this . '' 
And he rapped immediately on the door . 
The jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux , who , devoured by fear and uneasiness , was beginning , in spite of himself , to listen at the door . 
Happily , neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice , even in the most passionate outbreaks . 
`` What a confessor ! '' 
said the governor , forcing a laugh ; `` who would believe that a compulsory recluse , a man as though in the very jaws of death , could have committed crimes so numerous , and so long to tell of ? '' 
Aramis made no reply . 
He was eager to leave the Bastile , where the secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls . 
As soon as they reached Baisemeaux 's quarters , `` Let us proceed to business , my dear governor , '' said Aramis . 
`` Alas ! '' 
replied Baisemeaux . 
`` You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres , '' said the bishop . 
`` And to pay over the first third of the sum , '' added the poor governor , with a sigh , taking three steps towards his iron strong-box . 
`` Here is the receipt , '' said Aramis . 
`` And here is the money , '' returned Baisemeaux , with a threefold sigh . 
`` The order instructed me only to give a receipt ; it said nothing about receiving the money , '' rejoined Aramis . 
`` Adieu , monsieur le governeur ! '' 
And he departed , leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile . 
Thereof , and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy Gentleman . 
Since the departure of Athos for Blois , Porthos and D'Artagnan were seldom together . 
One was occupied with harassing duties for the king , the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended to forward to his estate , and by aid of which he hoped to establish in his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty 's society . 
D'Artagnan , ever faithful , one morning during an interval of service thought about Porthos , and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a fortnight , directed his steps towards his hotel , and pounced upon him just as he was getting up . 
The worthy baron had a pensive -- nay , more than pensive -- melancholy air . 
He was sitting on his bed , only half-dressed , and with legs dangling over the edge , contemplating a host of garments , which with their fringes , lace , embroidery , and slashes of ill-assorted hues , were strewed all over the floor . 
Porthos , sad and reflective as La Fontaine 's hare , did not observe D'Artagnan 's entrance , which was , moreover , screened at this moment by M. Mouston , whose personal corpulency , quite enough at any time to hide one man from another , was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant was holding up for his master 's inspection , by the sleeves , that he might the better see it all over . 
D'Artagnan stopped at the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then , as the sight of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman , D'Artagnan thought it time to put an end to these dismal reflections , and coughed by way of announcing himself . 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos , whose countenance brightened with joy ; `` ah ! 
ah ! 
Here is D'Artagnan . 
I shall then get hold of an idea ! '' 
At these words Mouston , doubting what was going on behind him , got out of the way , smiling kindly at the friend of his master , who thus found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching D'Artagnan . 
Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in rising , and crossing the room in two strides , found himself face to face with his friend , whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed to increase with every day . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he repeated , `` you are always welcome , dear friend ; but just now you are more welcome than ever . '' 
`` But you seem to have the megrims here ! '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
Porthos replied by a look expressive of dejection . 
`` Well , then , tell me all about it , Porthos , my friend , unless it is a secret . '' 
`` In the first place , '' returned Porthos , `` you know I have no secrets from you . 
This , then , is what saddens me . '' 
`` Wait a minute , Porthos ; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin and velvet ! '' 
`` Oh , never mind , '' said Porthos , contemptuously ; `` it is all trash . '' 
`` Trash , Porthos ! 
Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell ! 
gorgeous satin ! 
regal velvet ! '' 
`` Then you think these clothes are -- '' `` Splendid , Porthos , splendid ! 
I 'll wager that you alone in France have so many ; and suppose you never had any more made , and were to live to be a hundred years of age , which would n't astonish me in the very least , you could still wear a new dress the day of your death , without being obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then . '' 
Porthos shook his head . 
`` Come , my friend , '' said D'Artagnan , `` this unnatural melancholy in you frightens me . 
My dear Porthos , pray get it out , then . 
And the sooner the better . '' 
`` Yes , my friend , so I will : if , indeed , it is possible . '' 
`` Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux ? '' 
`` No : they have felled the wood , and it has yielded a third more than the estimate . '' 
`` Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds ? '' 
`` No , my friend : they have been fished , and there is enough left to stock all the pools in the neighborhood . '' 
`` Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake ? '' 
`` No , my friend ; on the contrary , the ground was struck with lightning a hundred paces from the chateau , and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute of water . '' 
`` What in the world is the matter , then ? '' 
`` The fact is , I have received an invitation for the fete at Vaux , '' said Porthos , with a lugubrious expression . 
`` Well ! 
do you complain of that ? 
The king has caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations . 
And so , my dear friend , you are really going to Vaux ? '' 
`` Indeed I am ! '' 
`` You will see a magnificent sight . '' 
`` Alas ! 
I doubt it , though . '' 
`` Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Porthos , tearing out a lock of hair in his despair . 
`` Eh ! 
good heavens , are you ill ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf ! 
It is n't that . '' 
`` But what is it , then ? '' '' 
'T is that I have no clothes ! '' 
D'Artagnan stood petrified . 
`` No clothes ! 
Porthos , no clothes ! '' 
he cried , `` when I see at least fifty suits on the floor . '' 
`` Fifty , truly ; but not one which fits me ! '' 
`` What ? 
not one that fits you ? 
But are you not measured , then , when you give an order ? '' 
`` To be sure he is , '' answered Mouston ; `` but unfortunately I have gotten stouter ! '' 
`` What ! 
you stouter ! '' 
`` So much so that I am now bigger than the baron . 
Would you believe it , monsieur ? '' '' 
Parbleu ! 
it seems to me that is quite evident . '' 
`` Do you see , stupid ? '' 
said Porthos , `` that is quite evident ! '' 
`` Be still , my dear Porthos , '' resumed D'Artagnan , becoming slightly impatient , `` I do n't understand why your clothes should not fit you , because Mouston has grown stouter . '' 
`` I am going to explain it , '' said Porthos . 
`` You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony , who had always seven wild boars kept roasting , each cooked up to a different point ; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it . 
Well , then , I resolved , as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week , I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion . '' 
`` Capitally reasoned , Porthos -- only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims . 
Without counting the time lost in being measured , the fashions are always changing . '' 
`` That is exactly the point , '' said Porthos , `` in regard to which I flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device . '' 
`` Tell me what it is ; for I do n't doubt your genius . '' 
`` You remember what Mouston once was , then ? '' 
`` Yes ; when he used to call himself Mousqueton . '' 
`` And you remember , too , the period when he began to grow fatter ? '' 
`` No , not exactly . 
I beg your pardon , my good Mouston . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not in fault , monsieur , '' said Mouston , graciously . 
`` You were in Paris , and as for us , we were at Pierrefonds . '' 
`` Well , well , my dear Porthos ; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat . 
Is that what you wished to say ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend ; and I greatly rejoice over the period . '' 
`` Indeed , I believe you do , '' exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` You understand , '' continued Porthos , `` what a world of trouble it spared for me . '' 
`` No , I do n't -- by any means . '' 
`` Look here , my friend . 
In the first place , as you have said , to be measured is a loss of time , even though it occur only once a fortnight . 
And then , one may be travelling ; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you . 
In short , I have a horror of letting any one take my measure . 
Confound it ! 
either one is a nobleman or not . 
To be scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you , by inch and line -- 't is degrading ! 
Here , they find you too hollow ; there , too prominent . 
They recognize your strong and weak points . 
See , now , when we leave the measurer 's hands , we are like those strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy . '' 
`` In truth , my dear Porthos , you possess ideas entirely original . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you see when a man is an engineer -- '' `` And has fortified Belle-Isle -- 't is natural , my friend . '' 
`` Well , I had an idea , which would doubtless have proved a good one , but for Mouston 's carelessness . '' 
D'Artagnan glanced at Mouston , who replied by a slight movement of his body , as if to say , `` You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this . '' 
`` I congratulated myself , then , '' resumed Porthos , `` at seeing Mouston get fat ; and I did all I could , by means of substantial feeding , to make him stout -- always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth , and could then be measured in my stead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I see -- that spared you both time and humiliation . '' 
`` Consider my joy when , after a year and a half 's judicious feeding -- for I used to feed him up myself -- the fellow -- '' `` Oh ! 
I lent a good hand myself , monsieur , '' said Mouston , humbly . 
`` That 's true . 
Consider my joy when , one morning , I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in , as I once did myself , to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon , in the chateau of Pierrefonds . 
And , by the way , about that door , my friend , I should like to ask you , who know everything , why these wretches of architects , who ought to have the compasses run into them , just to remind them , came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can pass ? '' 
`` Oh , those doors , '' answered D'Artagnan , `` were meant for gallants , and they have generally slight and slender figures . '' 
`` Madame du Vallon had no gallant ! '' 
answered Porthos , majestically . 
`` Perfectly true , my friend , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` but the architects were probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of your marrying again . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is possible , '' said Porthos . 
`` And now I have received an explanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow , let us return to the subject of Mouston 's fatness . 
But see how the two things apply to each other . 
I have always noticed that people 's ideas run parallel . 
And so , observe this phenomenon , D'Artagnan . 
I was talking to you of Mouston , who is fat , and it led us on to Madame du Vallon -- '' `` Who was thin ? '' 
`` Hum ! 
Is it not marvelous ? '' 
`` My dear friend , a savant of my acquaintance , M. Costar , has made the same observation as you have , and he calls the process by some Greek name which I forget . '' 
`` What ! 
my remark is not then original ? '' 
cried Porthos , astounded . 
`` I thought I was the discoverer . '' 
`` My friend , the fact was known before Aristotle 's days -- that is to say , nearly two thousand years ago . '' 
`` Well , well , 't is no less true , '' said Porthos , delighted at the idea of having jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest sages of antiquity . 
`` Wonderfully -- but suppose we return to Mouston . 
It seems to me , we have left him fattening under our very eyes . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` Well , '' said Porthos , `` Mouston fattened so well , that he gratified all my hopes , by reaching my standard ; a fact of which I was well able to convince myself , by seeing the rascal , one day , in a waistcoat of mine , which he had turned into a coat -- a waistcoat , the mere embroidery of which was worth a hundred pistoles . '' '' 
'T was only to try it on , monsieur , '' said Mouston . 
`` From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors , and to have him measured instead of myself . '' 
`` A capital idea , Porthos ; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you . '' 
`` Exactly ! 
They measured him down to the ground , and the end of the skirt came just below my knee . '' 
`` What a marvelous man you are , Porthos ! 
Such a thing could happen only to you . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes ; pay your compliments ; you have ample grounds to go upon . 
It was exactly at that time -- that is to say , nearly two years and a half ago -- that I set out for Belle-Isle , instructing Mouston -LRB- so as always to have , in every event , a pattern of every fashion -RRB- to have a coat made for himself every month . '' 
`` And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions ? 
Ah ! 
that was anything but right , Mouston . '' 
`` No , monsieur , quite the contrary ; quite the contrary ! '' 
`` No , he never forgot to have his coats made ; but he forgot to inform me that he had got stouter ! '' 
`` But it was not my fault , monsieur ! 
your tailor never told me . '' 
`` And this to such an extent , monsieur , '' continued Porthos , `` that the fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth , and so my last dozen coats are all too large , from a foot to a foot and a half . '' 
`` But the rest ; those which were made when you were of the same size ? '' 
`` They are no longer the fashion , my dear friend . 
Were I to put them on , I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam ; and as though I had been two years away from court . '' 
`` I understand your difficulty . 
You have how many new suits ? 
nine ? 
thirty-six ? 
and yet not one to wear . 
Well , you must have a thirty-seventh made , and give the thirty-six to Mouston . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
said Mouston , with a gratified air . 
`` The truth is , that monsieur has always been very generous to me . '' 
`` Do you mean to insinuate that I had n't that idea , or that I was deterred by the expense ? 
But it wants only two days to the fete ; I received the invitation yesterday ; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe , and only this morning discovered my misfortune ; and from now till the day after to-morrow , there is n't a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit . '' 
`` That is to say , one covered all over with gold , is n't it ? '' 
`` I wish it so ! 
undoubtedly , all over . '' 
`` Oh , we shall manage it . 
You wo n't leave for three days . 
The invitations are for Wednesday , and this is only Sunday morning . '' '' 
'T is true ; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours beforehand . '' 
`` How , Aramis ? '' 
`` Yes , it was Aramis who brought me the invitation . '' 
`` Ah ! 
to be sure , I see . 
You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` By no means ! 
by the king , dear friend . 
The letter bears the following as large as life : 'M . 
le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list -- ' '' `` Very good ; but you leave with M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` And when I think , '' cried Porthos , stamping on the floor , `` when I think I shall have no clothes , I am ready to burst with rage ! 
I should like to strangle somebody or smash something ! '' 
`` Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything , Porthos ; I will manage it all ; put on one of your thirty-six suits , and come with me to a tailor . ''
