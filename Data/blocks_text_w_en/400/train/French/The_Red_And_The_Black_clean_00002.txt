he added with a sigh , `` the last syllable of his name is the same as mine , '' and he crumpled up the paper . 
As he left , Julien thought he saw blood near the Host , it was holy water which the priests had been sprinkling on it , the reflection of the red curtains which covered the windows made it look like blood . 
Finally , Julien felt ashamed of his secret terror . 
`` Am I going to play the coward , '' he said to himself : '' To Arms ! '' 
This phrase , repeated so often in the old Surgeon-Major 's battle stories , symbolized heroism to Julien . 
He got up rapidly and walked to M. de Rênal 's house . 
As soon as he saw it twenty yards in front of him he was seized , in spite of his fine resolution , with an overwhelming timidity . 
The iron grill was open . 
He thought it was magnificent . 
He had to go inside . 
Julien was not the only person whose heart was troubled by his arrival in the house . 
The extreme timidity of Madame de Rênal was fluttered when she thought of this stranger whose functions would necessitate his coming between her and her children . 
She was accustomed to seeing her sons sleep in her own room . 
She had shed many tears that morning , when she had seen their beds carried into the apartment intended for the tutor . 
It was in vain that she asked her husband to have the bed of Stanislas-Xavier , the youngest , carried back into her room . 
Womanly delicacy was carried in Madame de Rênal to the point of excess . 
She conjured up in her imagination the most disagreeable personage , who was coarse , badly groomed and encharged with the duty of scolding her children simply because he happened to know Latin , and only too ready to flog her sons for their ignorance of that barbarous language .

Madame de Rênal was going out of the salon by the folding window which opened on to the garden with that vivacity and grace which was natural to her when she was free from human observation , when she noticed a young peasant near the entrance gate . 
He was still almost a child , extremely pale , and looked as though he had been crying . 
He was in a white shirt and had under his arm a perfectly new suit of violet frieze . 
The little peasant 's complexion was so white and his eyes were so soft , that Madame de Rênal 's somewhat romantic spirit thought at first that it might be a young girl in disguise , who had come to ask some favour of the M. the Mayor . 
She took pity on this poor creature , who had stopped at the entrance of the door , and who apparently did not dare to raise its hand to the bell . 
Madame de Rênal approached , forgetting for the moment the bitter chagrin occasioned by the tutor 's arrival . 
Julien , who was turned towards the gate , did not see her advance . 
He trembled when a soft voice said quite close to his ear : `` What do you want here , my child . '' 
Julien turned round sharply and was so struck by Madame de Rênal 's look , full of graciousness as it was , that up to a certain point he forgot to be nervous . 
Overcome by her beauty he soon forgot everything , even what he had come for . 
Madame de Rênal repeated her question . 
`` I have come here to be tutor , Madame , '' he said at last , quite ashamed of his tears which he was drying as best as he could . 
Madame de Rênal remained silent . 
They had a view of each other at close range . 
Julien had never seen a human being so well-dressed , and above all he had never seen a woman with so dazzling a complexion speak to him at all softly . 
Madame de Rênal observed the big tears which had lingered on the cheeks of the young peasant , those cheeks which had been so pale and were now so pink . 
Soon she began to laugh with all the mad gaiety of a young girl , she made fun of herself , and was unable to realise the extent of her happiness . 
So this was that tutor whom she had imagined a dirty , badly dressed priest , who was coming to scold and flog her children . 
`` What ! 
Monsieur , '' she said to him at last , `` you know Latin ? '' 
The word `` Monsieur '' astonished Julien so much that he reflected for a moment . 
`` Yes , Madame , '' he said timidly . 
Madame de Rênal was so happy that she plucked up the courage to say to Julien , `` You will not scold the poor children too much ? '' 
`` I scold them ! '' 
said Julien in astonishment ; `` why should I ? '' 
`` You wo n't , will you , Monsieur , '' she added after a little silence , in a soft voice whose emotion became more and more intense . 
`` You will be nice to them , you promise me ? '' 
To hear himself called `` Monsieur '' again in all seriousness by so well dressed a lady was beyond all Julien 's expectations . 
He had always said to himself in all the castles of Spain that he had built in his youth , that no real lady would ever condescend to talk to him except when he had a fine uniform . 
Madame de Rênal , on her side , was completely taken in by Julien 's beautiful complexion , his big black eyes , and his pretty hair , which was more than usually curly , because he had just plunged his head into the basin of the public fountain in order to refresh himself . 
She was over-joyed to find that this sinister tutor , whom she had feared to find so harsh and severe to her children , had , as a matter of fact , the timid manner of a girl . 
The contrast between her fears and what she now saw , proved a great event for Madame de Rênal 's peaceful temperament . 
Finally , she recovered from her surprise . 
She was astonished to find herself at the gate of her own house talking in this way and at such close quarters to this young and somewhat scantily dressed man . 
`` Let us go in , Monsieur , '' she said to him with a certain air of embarrassment . 
During Madame de Rênal 's whole life she had never been so deeply moved by such a sense of pure pleasure . 
Never had so gracious a vision followed in the wake of her disconcerting fears . 
So these pretty children of whom she took such care were not after all to fall into the hands of a dirty grumbling priest . 
She had scarcely entered the vestibule when she turned round towards Julien , who was following her trembling . 
His astonishment at the sight of so fine a house proved but an additional charm in Madame de Rênal 's eyes . 
She could not believe her own eyes . 
It seemed to her , above all , that the tutor ought to have a black suit . 
`` But is it true , Monsieur , '' she said to him , stopping once again , and in mortal fear that she had made a mistake , so happy had her discovery made her . 
`` Is it true that you know Latin ? '' 
These words offended Julien 's pride , and dissipated the charming atmosphere which he had been enjoying for the last quarter of an hour . 
`` Yes , Madame , '' he said , trying to assume an air of coldness , `` I know Latin as well as the curé , who has been good enough to say sometimes that I know it even better . '' 
Madame de Rênal thought that Julien looked extremely wicked . 
He had stopped two paces from her . 
She approached and said to him in a whisper : `` You wo n't beat my children the first few days , will you , even if they do not know their lessons ? '' 
The softness and almost supplication of so beautiful a lady made Julien suddenly forget what he owed to his reputation as a Latinist . 
Madame de Rênal 's face was close to his own . 
He smelt the perfume of a woman 's summer clothing , a quite astonishing experience for a poor peasant . 
Julien blushed extremely , and said with a sigh in a faltering voice : `` Fear nothing , Madame , I will obey you in everything . '' 
It was only now , when her anxiety about her children had been relieved once and for all , that Madame de Rênal was struck by Julien 's extreme beauty . 
The comparative effeminancy of his features and his air of extreme embarrassment did not seem in any way ridiculous to a woman who was herself extremely timid . 
The male air , which is usually considered essential to a man 's beauty , would have terrified her . 
`` How old are you , sir , '' she said to Julien . 
`` Nearly nineteen . '' 
`` My elder son is eleven , '' went on Madame de Rênal , who had completely recovered her confidence . 
`` He will be almost a chum for you . 
You will talk sensibly to him . 
His father started beating him once . 
The child was ill for a whole week , and yet it was only a little tap . '' 
What a difference between him and me , thought Julien . 
Why , it was only yesterday that my father beat me . 
How happy these rich people are . 
Madame de Rênal , who had already begun to observe the fine nuances of the workings in the tutor 's mind , took this fit of sadness for timidity and tried to encourage him . 
`` What is your name , Monsieur ? '' 
she said to him , with an accent and a graciousness whose charm Julien appreciated without being able to explain . 
`` I am called Julien Sorel , Madame . 
I feel nervous of entering a strange house for the first time in my life . 
I have need of your protection and I want you to make many allowances for me during the first few days . 
I have never been to the college , I was too poor . 
I have never spoken to anyone else except my cousin who was Surgeon-Major , Member of the Legion of Honour , and M. the curé Chélan . 
He will give you a good account of me . 
My brothers always used to beat me , and you must not believe them if they speak badly of me to you . 
You must forgive my faults , Madame . 
I shall always mean everything for the best . '' 
Julien had regained his confidence during this long speech . 
He was examining Madame de Rênal . 
Perfect grace works wonders when it is natural to the character , and above all , when the person whom it adorns never thinks of trying to affect it . 
Julien , who was quite a connoisseur in feminine beauty , would have sworn at this particular moment that she was not more than twenty . 
The rash idea of kissing her hand immediately occurred to him . 
He soon became frightened of his idea . 
A minute later he said to himself , it will be an act of cowardice if I do not carry out an action which may be useful to me , and lessen the contempt which this fine lady probably has for a poor workman just taken away from the saw-mill . 
Possibly Julien was a little encouraged through having heard some young girls repeat on Sundays during the last six months the words `` pretty boy . '' 
During this internal debate , Madame de Rênal was giving him two or three hints on the way to commence handling the children . 
The strain Julien was putting on himself made him once more very pale . 
He said with an air of constraint . 
`` I will never beat your children , Madame . 
I swear it before God . '' 
In saying this , he dared to take Madame de Rênal 's hand and carry it to his lips . 
She was astonished at this act , and after reflecting , became shocked . 
As the weather was very warm , her arm was quite bare underneath the shawl , and Julien 's movement in carrying her hand to his lips entirely uncovered it . 
After a few moments she scolded herself . 
It seemed to her that her anger had not been quick enough . 
M. de Rênal , who had heard voices , came out of his study , and assuming the same air of paternal majesty with which he celebrated marriages at the mayoral office , said to Julien : `` It is essential for me to have a few words with you before my children see you . '' 
He made Julien enter a room and insisted on his wife being present , although she wished to leave them alone . 
Having closed the door M. Rênal sat down . 
`` M. the curé has told me that you are a worthy person , and everybody here will treat you with respect . 
If I am satisfied with you I will later on help you in having a little establishment of your own . 
I do not wish you to see either anything more of your relatives or your friends . 
Their tone is bound to be prejudicial to my children . 
Here are thirty-six francs for the first month , but I insist on your word not to give a sou of this money to your father . '' 
M. de Rênal was piqued against the old man for having proved the shrewder bargainer . 
`` Now , Monsieur , for I have given orders for everybody here to call you Monsieur , and you will appreciate the advantage of having entered the house of real gentle folk , now , Monsieur , it is not becoming for the children to see you in a jacket . '' 
`` Have the servants seen him ? '' 
said M. de Rênal to his wife . 
`` No , my dear , '' she answered , with an air of deep pensiveness . 
`` All the better . 
Put this on , '' he said to the surprised young man , giving him a frock-coat of his own . 
`` Let us now go to M. Durand 's the draper . '' 
When M. de Rênal came back with the new tutor in his black suit more than an hour later , he found his wife still seated in the same place . 
She felt calmed by Julien 's presence . 
When she examined him she forgot to be frightened of him . 
Julien was not thinking about her at all . 
In spite of all his distrust of destiny and mankind , his soul at this moment was as simple as that of a child . 
It seemed as though he had lived through years since the moment , three hours ago , when he had been all atremble in the church . 
He noticed Madame de Rênal 's frigid manner and realised that she was very angry , because he had dared to kiss her hand . 
But the proud consciousness which was given to him by the feel of clothes so different from those which he usually wore , transported him so violently and he had so great a desire to conceal his exultation , that all his movements were marked by a certain spasmodic irresponsibility . 
Madame de Rênal looked at him with astonishment . 
`` Monsieur , '' said M. de Rênal to him , `` dignity above all is necessary if you wish to be respected by my children . '' 
`` Sir , '' answered Julien , `` I feel awkward in my new clothes . 
I am a poor peasant and have never wore anything but jackets . 
If you allow it , I will retire to my room . '' 
`` What do you think of this ` acquisition ? ' '' 
said M. de Rênal to his wife . 
Madame de Rênal concealed the truth from her husband , obeying an almost instinctive impulse which she certainly did not own to herself . 
`` I am not as fascinated as you are by this little peasant . 
Your favours will result in his not being able to keep his place , and you will have to send him back before the month is out . '' 
`` Oh , well ! 
we 'll send him back then , he can not run me into more than a hundred francs , and Verrières will have got used to seeing M. de Rênal 's children with a tutor . 
That result would not have been achieved if I had allowed Julien to wear a workman 's clothes . 
If I do send him back , I shall of course keep the complete black suit which I have just ordered at the draper 's . 
All he will keep is the ready-made suit which I have just put him into at the the tailor 's . '' 
The hour that Julien spent in his room seemed only a minute to Madame de Rênal . 
The children who had been told about their new tutor began to overwhelm their mother with questions . 
Eventually Julien appeared . 
He was quite another man . 
It would be incorrect to say that he was grave -- he was the very incarnation of gravity . 
He was introduced to the children and spoke to them in a manner that astonished M. de Rênal himself . 
`` I am here , gentlemen , he said , as he finished his speech , to teach you Latin . 
You know what it means to recite a lesson . 
Here is the Holy Bible , he said , showing them a small volume in thirty-two mo. , bound in black . 
It deals especially with the history of our Lord Jesus Christ and is the part which is called the New Testament . 
I shall often make you recite your lesson , but do you make me now recite mine . '' 
Adolphe , the eldest of the children , had taken up the book . 
`` Open it anywhere you like , '' went on Julien and tell me the first word of any verse , `` I will then recite by heart that sacred book which governs our conduct towards the whole world , until you stop me . '' 
Adolphe opened the book and read a word , and Julien recited the whole of the page as easily as though he had been talking French . 
M. de Rênal looked at his wife with an air of triumph The children , seeing the astonishment of their parents , opened their eyes wide . 
A servant came to the door of the drawing-room ; Julien went on talking Latin . 
The servant first remained motionless , and then disappeared . 
Soon Madame 's house-maid , together with the cook , arrived at the door . 
Adolphe had already opened the book at eight different places , while Julien went on reciting all the time with the same facility . 
`` Great heavens ! '' 
said the cook , a good and devout girl , quite aloud , `` what a pretty little priest ! '' 
M. de Rênal 's self-esteem became uneasy . 
Instead of thinking of examining the tutor , his mind was concentrated in racking his memory for some other Latin words . 
Eventually he managed to spout a phrase of Horace . 
Julien knew no other Latin except his Bible . 
He answered with a frown . 
`` The holy ministry to which I destine myself has forbidden me to read so profane a poet . '' 
M. de Rênal quoted quite a large number of alleged verses from Horace . 
He explained to his children who Horace was , but the admiring children , scarcely attended to what he was saying : they were looking at Julien . 
The servants were still at the door . 
Julien thought that he ought to prolong the test -- `` M. Stanislas-Xavier also , '' he said to the youngest of the children , `` must give me a passage from the holy book . '' 
Little Stanislas , who was quite flattered , read indifferently the first word of a verse , and Julien said the whole page . 
To put the finishing touch on M. de Rênal 's triumph , M. Valenod , the owner of the fine Norman horses , and M. Charcot de Maugiron , the sub-prefect of the district came in when Julien was reciting . 
This scene earned for Julien the title of Monsieur ; even the servants did not dare to refuse it to him . 
That evening all Verrières flocked to M. de Rênal 's to see the prodigy . 
Julien answered everybody in a gloomy manner and kept his own distance . 
His fame spread so rapidly in the town that a few hours afterwards M. de Rênal , fearing that he would be taken away by somebody else , proposed to that he should sign an engagement for two years . 
`` No , Monsieur , '' Julien answered coldly , `` if you wished to dismiss me , I should have to go . 
An engagement which binds me without involving you in any obligation is not an equal one and I refuse it . '' 
Julien played his cards so well , that in less than a month of his arrival at the house , M. de Rênal himself respected him . 
As the curé had quarrelled with both M. de Rênal and M. Valenod , there was no one who could betray Julien 's old passion for Napoleon . 
He always spoke of Napoleon with abhorrence . 
They only manage to touch the heart by wounding it . 
-- A Modern . 
The children adored him , but he did not like them in the least . 
His thoughts were elsewhere . 
But nothing which the little brats ever did made him lose his patience . 
Cold , just and impassive , and none the less liked , inasmuch his arrival had more or less driven ennui out of the house , he was a good tutor . 
As for himself , he felt nothing but hate and abhorrence for that good society into which he had been admitted ; admitted , it is true at the bottom of the table , a circumstance which perhaps explained his hate and his abhorrence . 
There were certain ` full-dress ' dinners at which he was scarcely able to control his hate for everything that surrounded him . 
One St. Louis feast day in particular , when M. Valenod was monopolizing the conversation of M. de Rênal , Julien was on the point of betraying himself . 
He escaped into the garden on the pretext of finding the children . 
`` What praise of honesty , '' he exclaimed . 
`` One would say that was the only virtue , and yet think how they respect and grovel before a man who has almost doubled and trebled his fortune since he has administered the poor fund . 
I would bet anything that he makes a profit even out of the monies which are intended for the foundlings of these poor creatures whose misery is even more sacred than that of others . 
Oh , Monsters ! 
Monsters ! 
And I too , am a kind of foundling , hated as I am by my father , my brothers , and all my family . '' 
Some days before the feast of St. Louis , when Julien was taking a solitary walk and reciting his breviary in the little wood called the Belvedere , which dominates the Cours de la Fidélité , he had endeavoured in vain to avoid his two brothers whom he saw coming along in the distance by a lonely path . 
The jealousy of these coarse workmen had been provoked to such a pitch by their brother 's fine black suit , by his air of extreme respectability , and by the sincere contempt which he had for them , that they had beaten him until he had fainted and was bleeding all over . 
Madame de Rênal , who was taking a walk with M. de Rênal and the sub-prefect , happened to arrive in the little wood . 
She saw Julien lying on the ground and thought that he was dead . 
She was so overcome that she made M. Valenod jealous . 
His alarm was premature . 
Julien found Madame de Rênal very pretty , but he hated her on account of her beauty , for that had been the first danger which had almost stopped his career . 
He talked to her as little as possible , in order to make her forget the transport which had induced him to kiss her hand on the first day . 
Madame de Rênal 's housemaid , Elisa , had lost no time in falling in love with the young tutor . 
She often talked about him to her mistress . 
Elisa 's love had earned for Julien the hatred of one of the men-servants . 
One day he heard the man saying to Elisa , `` You have n't a word for me now that this dirty tutor has entered the household . '' 
The insult was undeserved , but Julien with the instinctive vanity of a pretty boy redoubled his care of his personal appearance . 
M. Valenod 's hate also increased . 
He said publicly , that it was not becoming for a young abbé to be such a fop . 
Madame de Rênal observed that Julien talked more frequently than usual to Mademoiselle Elisa . 
She learnt that the reason of these interviews was the poverty of Julien 's extremely small wardrobe . 
He had so little linen that he was obliged to have it very frequently washed outside the house , and it was in these little matters that Elisa was useful to him . 
Madame de Rênal was touched by this extreme poverty which she had never suspected before . 
She was anxious to make him presents , but she did not dare to do so . 
This inner conflict was the first painful emotion that Julien had caused her . 
Till then Julien 's name had been synonymous with a pure and quite intellectual joy . 
Tormented by the idea of Julien 's poverty , Madame de Rênal spoke to her husband about giving him some linen for a present . 
`` What nonsense , '' he answered , `` the very idea of giving presents to a man with whom we are perfectly satisfied and who is a good servant . 
It will only be if he is remiss that we shall have to stimulate his zeal . '' 
Madame de Rênal felt humiliated by this way of looking at things , though she would never have noticed it in the days before Julien 's arrival . 
She never looked at the young abbé 's attire , with its combination of simplicity and absolute cleanliness , without saying to herself , `` The poor boy , how can he manage ? '' 
Little by little , instead of being shocked by all Julien 's deficiencies , she pitied him for them . 
Madame de Rênal was one of those provincial women whom one is apt to take for fools during the first fortnight of acquaintanceship . 
She had no experience of the world and never bothered to keep up the conversation . 
Nature had given her a refined and fastidious soul , while that instinct for happiness which is innate in all human beings caused her , as a rule , to pay no attention to the acts of the coarse persons in whose midst chance had thrown her . 
If she had received the slightest education , she would have been noticeable for the spontaneity and vivacity of her mind , but being an heiress , she had been brought up in a Convent of Nuns , who were passionate devotees of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and animated by a violent hate for the French as being the enemies of the Jesuits . 
Madame de Rênal had had enough sense to forget quickly all the nonsense which she had learned at the convent , but had substituted nothing for it , and in the long run knew nothing . 
The flatteries which had been lavished on her when still a child , by reason of the great fortune of which she was the heiress , and a decided tendency to passionate devotion , had given her quite an inner life of her own . 
In spite of her pose of perfect affability and her elimination of her individual will which was cited as a model example by all the husbands in Verrières and which made M. de Rênal feel very proud , the moods of her mind were usually dictated by a spirit of the most haughty discontent . 
Many a princess who has become a bye-word for pride has given infinitely more attention to what her courtiers have been doing around her than did this apparently gentle and demure woman to anything which her husband either said or did . 
Up to the time of Julien 's arrival she had never really troubled about anything except her children . 
Their little maladies , their troubles , their little joys , occupied all the sensibility of that soul , who , during her whole life , had adored no one but God , when she had been at the Sacred Heart of Besançon . 
A feverish attack of one of her sons would affect her almost as deeply as if the child had died , though she would not deign to confide in anyone . 
A burst of coarse laughter , a shrug of the shoulders , accompanied by some platitude on the folly of women , had been the only welcome her husband had vouchsafed to those confidences about her troubles , which the need of unburdening herself had induced her to make during the first years of their marriage . 
Jokes of this kind , and above all , when they were directed at her children 's ailments , were exquisite torture to Madame de Rênal . 
And these jokes were all she found to take the place of those exaggerated sugary flatteries with which she had been regaled at the Jesuit Convent where she had passed her youth . 
Her education had been given her by suffering . 
Too proud even to talk to her friend , Madame Derville , about troubles of this kind , she imagined that all men were like her husband , M. Valenod , and the sub-prefect , M. Charcot de Maugiron . 
Coarseness , and the most brutal callousness to everything except financial gain , precedence , or orders , together with blind hate of every argument to which they objected , seemed to her as natural to the male sex as wearing boots and felt hats . 
After many years , Madame de Rênal had still failed to acclimatize herself to those monied people in whose society she had to live . 
Hence the success of the little peasant Julien . 
She found in the sympathy of this proud and noble soul a sweet enjoyment which had all the glamour and fascination of novelty . 
Madame de Rênal soon forgave him that extreme ignorance , which constituted but an additional charm , and the roughness of his manner which she succeeded in correcting . 
She thought that he was worth listening to , even when the conversation turned on the most ordinary events , even in fact when it was only a question of a poor dog which had been crushed as he crossed the street by a peasant 's cart going at a trot . 
The sight of the dog 's pain made her husband indulge in his coarse laugh , while she noticed Julien frown , with his fine black eyebrows which were so beautifully arched . 
Little by little , it seemed to her that generosity , nobility of soul and humanity were to be found in nobody else except this young abbé . 
She felt for him all the sympathy and even all the admiration which those virtues excite in well-born souls . 
If the scene had been Paris , Julien 's position towards Madame de Rênal would have been soon simplified . 
But at Paris , love is a creature of novels . 
The young tutor and his timid mistress would soon have found the elucidation of their position in three or four novels , and even in the couplets of the Gymnase Theatre . 
The novels which have traced out for them the part they would play , and showed them the model which they were to imitate , and Julien would sooner or later have been forced by his vanity to follow that model , even though it had given him no pleasure and had perhaps actually gone against the grain . 
If the scene had been laid in a small town in Aveyron or the Pyrenees , the slightest episode would have been rendered crucial by the fiery condition of the atmosphere . 
But under our more gloomy skies , a poor young man who is only ambitious because his natural refinement makes him feel the necessity of some of those joys which only money can give , can see every day a woman of thirty who is sincerely virtuous , is absorbed in her children , and never goes to novels for her examples of conduct . 
Everything goes slowly , everything happens gradually , in the provinces where there is far more naturalness . 
Madame de Rênal was often overcome to the point of tears when she thought of the young tutor 's poverty . 
Julien surprised her one day actually crying . 
`` Oh Madame ! 
has any misfortune happened to you ? '' 
`` No , my friend , '' she answered , `` call the children , let us go for a walk . '' 
She took his arm and leant on it in a manner that struck Julien as singular . 
It was the first time she had called Julien `` My friend . '' 
Towards the end of the walk , Julien noticed that she was blushing violently . 
She slackened her pace . 
`` You have no doubt heard , '' she said , without looking at him , `` that I am the only heiress of a very rich aunt who lives at Besançon . 
She loads me with presents ... . 
My sons are getting on so wonderfully that I should like to ask you to accept a small present as a token of my gratitude . 
It is only a matter of a few louis to enable you to get some linen . 
But -- '' she added , blushing still more , and she left off speaking -- `` But what , Madame ? '' 
said Julien . 
`` It is unnecessary , '' she went on lowering her head , `` to mention this to my husband . '' 
`` I may not be big , Madame , but I am not mean , '' answered Julien , stopping , and drawing himself up to his full height , with his eyes shining with rage , `` and this is what you have not realised sufficiently . 
I should be lower than a menial if I were to put myself in the position of concealing from M de . 
Rênal anything at all having to do with my money . '' 
Madame de Rênal was thunderstruck . 
`` The Mayor , '' went on Julien , `` has given me on five occasions sums of thirty-six francs since I have been living in his house . 
I am ready to show any account-book to M. de Rênal and anyone else , even to M. Valenod who hates me . '' 
As the result of this outburst , Madame de Rênal remained pale and nervous , and the walk ended without either one or the other finding any pretext for renewing the conversation . 
Julien 's proud heart had found it more and more impossible to love Madame de Rênal . 
As for her , she respected him , she admired him , and she had been scolded by him . 
Under the pretext of making up for the involuntary humiliation which she had caused him , she indulged in acts of the most tender solicitude . 
The novelty of these attentions made Madame de Rênal happy for eight days . 
Their effect was to appease to some extent Julien 's anger . 
He was far from seeing anything in them in the nature of a fancy for himself personally . 
`` That is just what rich people are , '' he said to himself -- `` they snub you and then they think they can make up for everything by a few monkey tricks . '' 
Madame de Rênal 's heart was too full , and at the same time too innocent , for her not too tell her husband , in spite of her resolutions not to do so , about the offer she had made to Julien , and the manner in which she had been rebuffed . 
`` How on earth , '' answered M. de Rênal , keenly piqued , `` could you put up with a refusal on the part of a servant , '' -- and , when Madame de Rênal protested against the word `` Servant , '' `` I am using , madam , the words of the late Prince of Condé , when he presented his Chamberlains to his new wife . 
` All these people ' he said ` are servants . ' 
I have also read you this passage from the Memoirs of Besenval , a book which is indispensable on all questions of etiquette . 
` Every person , not a gentleman , who lives in your house and receives a salary is your servant . ' 
I 'll go and say a few words to M. Julien and give him a hundred francs . '' 
`` Oh , my dear , '' said Madame De Rênal trembling , `` I hope you wo n't do it before the servants ! '' 
`` Yes , they might be jealous and rightly so , '' said her husband as he took his leave , thinking of the greatness of the sum . 
Madame de Rênal fell on a chair almost fainting in her anguish . 
He is going to humiliate Julien , and it is my fault ! 
She felt an abhorrence for her husband and hid her face in her hands . 
She resolved that henceforth she would never make any more confidences . 
When she saw Julien again she was trembling all over . 
Her chest was so cramped that she could not succeed in pronouncing a single word . 
In her embarrassment she took his hands and pressed them . 
`` Well , my friend , '' she said to him at last , `` are you satisfied with my husband ? '' 
`` How could I be otherwise , '' answered Julien , with a bitter smile , `` he has given me a hundred francs . '' 
Madame de Rênal looked at him doubtfully . 
`` Give me your arm , '' she said at last , with a courageous intonation that Julien had not heard before . 
She dared to go as far as the shop of the bookseller of Verrières , in spite of his awful reputation for Liberalism . 
In the shop she chose ten louis worth of books for a present for her sons . 
But these books were those which she knew Julien was wanting . 
She insisted on each child writing his name then and there in the bookseller 's shop in those books which fell to his lot . 
While Madame de Rênal was rejoicing over the kind reparation which she had had the courage to make to Julien , the latter was overwhelmed with astonishment at the quantity of books which he saw at the bookseller 's . 
He had never dared to enter so profane a place . 
His heart was palpitating . 
Instead of trying to guess what was passing in Madame de Rênal 's heart he pondered deeply over the means by which a young theological student could procure some of those books . 
Eventually it occurred to him that it would be possible , with tact , to persuade M. de Rênal that one of the proper subjects of his sons ' curriculum would be the history of the celebrated gentlemen who had been born in the province . 
After a month of careful preparation Julien witnessed the success of this idea . 
The success was so great that he actually dared to risk mentioning to M. de Rênal in conversation , a matter which the noble mayor found disagreeable from quite another point of view . 
The suggestion was to contribute to the fortune of a Liberal by taking a subscription at the bookseller 's . 
M. de Rênal agreed that it would be wise to give his elder son a first hand acquaintance with many works which he would hear mentioned in conversation when he went to the Military School . 
But Julien saw that the mayor had determined to go no further . 
He suspected some secret reason but could not guess it . 
`` I was thinking , sir , '' he said to him one day , `` that it would be highly undesirable for the name of so good a gentleman as a Rênal to appear on a bookseller 's dirty ledger . '' 
M. de Rênal 's face cleared . 
`` It would also be a black mark , '' continued Julien in a more humble tone , `` against a poor theology student if it ever leaked out that his name had been on the ledger of a bookseller who let out books . 
The Liberals might go so far as to accuse me of having asked for the most infamous books . 
Who knows if they will not even go so far as to write the titles of those perverse volumes after my name ? '' 
But Julien was getting off the track . 
He noticed that the Mayor 's physiognomy was re-assuming its expression of embarrassment and displeasure . 
Julien was silent . 
`` I have caught my man , '' he said to himself . 
It so happened that a few days afterwards the elder of the children asked Julien , in M. de Rênal 's presence , about a book which had been advertised in the Quotidienne . 
`` In order to prevent the Jacobin Party having the slightest pretext for a score , '' said the young tutor , `` and yet give me the means of answering M. de Adolphe 's question , you can make your most menial servant take out a subscription at the booksellers . '' 
`` That 's not a bad idea , '' said M. de Rênal , who was obviously very delighted . 
`` You will have to stipulate all the same , '' said Julien in that solemn and almost melancholy manner which suits some people so well when they see the realization of matters which they have desired for a long time past , `` you will have to stipulate that the servant should not take out any novels . 
Those dangerous books , once they got into the house , might corrupt Madame de Rênal 's maids , and even the servant himself . '' 
`` You are forgetting the political pamphlets , '' went on M. de Rênal with an important air . 
He was anxious to conceal the admiration with which the cunning `` middle course '' devised by his children 's tutor had filled him . 
In this way Julien 's life was made up of a series of little acts of diplomacy , and their success gave him far more food for thought than the marked manifestation of favouritism which he could have read at any time in Madame de Rênal 's heart , had he so wished . 
The psychological position in which he had found himself all his life was renewed again in the mayor of Verrières ' house . 
Here in the same way as at his father 's saw-mill , he deeply despised the people with whom he lived , and was hated by them . 
He saw every day in the conversation of the sub-perfect , M. Valenod and the other friends of the family , about things which had just taken place under their very eyes , how little ideas corresponded to reality . 
If an action seemed to Julien worthy of admiration , it was precisely that very action which would bring down upon itself the censure of the people with whom he lived . 
His inner mental reply always was , `` What beasts or what fools ! '' 
The joke was that , in spite of all his pride , he often understood absolutely nothing what they were talking about . 
Throughout his whole life he had only spoken sincerely to the old Surgeon-Major . 
The few ideas he had were about Buonaparte 's Italian Campaigns or else surgery . 
His youthful courage revelled in the circumstantial details of the most terrible operations . 
He said to himself . 
`` I should not have flinched . '' 
The first time that Madame de Rênal tried to enter into conversation independently of the children 's education , he began to talk of surgical operations . 
She grew pale and asked him to leave off . 
Julien knew nothing beyond that . 
So it came about that , though he passed his life in Madame de Rênal 's company , the most singular silence would reign between them as soon as they were alone . 
When he was in the salon , she noticed in his eyes , in spite of all the humbleness of his demeanour , an air of intellectual superiority towards everyone who came to visit her . 
If she found herself alone with him for a single moment , she saw that he was palpably embarrassed . 
This made her feel uneasy , for her woman 's instinct caused her to realise that this embarrassment was not inspired by any tenderness . 
Owing to some mysterious idea , derived from some tale of good society , such as the old Surgeon-Major had seen it , Julien felt humiliated whenever the conversation languished on any occasion when he found himself in a woman 's society , as though the particular pause were his own special fault . 
This sensation was a hundred times more painful in tête-à-tête . 
His imagination , full as it was of the most extravagant and most Spanish ideas of what a man ought to say when he is alone with a woman , only suggested to the troubled youth things which were absolutely impossible . 
His soul was in the clouds . 
Nevertheless he was unable to emerge from this most humiliating silence . 
Consequently , during his long walks with Madame de Rênal and the children , the severity of his manner was accentuated by the poignancy of his sufferings . 
He despised himself terribly . 
If , by any luck , he made himself speak , he came out with the most absurd things . 
To put the finishing touch on his misery , he saw his own absurdity and exaggerated its extent , but what he did not see was the expression in his eyes , which were so beautiful and betokened so ardent a soul , that like good actors , they sometimes gave charm to something which is really devoid of it . 
Madame de Rênal noticed that when he was alone with her he never chanced to say a good thing except when he was taken out of himself by some unexpected event , and consequently forgot to try and turn a compliment . 
As the friends of the house did not spoil her by regaling her with new and brilliant ideas , she enjoyed with delight all the flashes of Julien 's intellect . 
After the fall of Napoleon , every appearance of gallantry has been severely exiled from provincial etiquette . 
People are frightened of losing their jobs . 
All rascals look to the religious order for support , and hypocrisy has made firm progress even among the Liberal classes . 
One 's ennui is doubled . 
The only pleasures left are reading and agriculture . 
Madame de Rênal , the rich heiress of a devout aunt , and married at sixteen to a respectable gentleman , had never felt or seen in her whole life anything that had the slightest resemblance in the whole world to love . 
Her confessor , the good curé Chélan , had once mentioned love to her , in discussing the advances of M. de Valenod , and had drawn so loathsome a picture of the passion that the word now stood to her for nothing but the most abject debauchery . 
She had regarded love , such as she had come across it , in the very small number of novels with which chance had made her acquainted , as an exception if not indeed as something absolutely abnormal . 
It was , thanks to this ignorance , that Madame de Rênal , although incessantly absorbed in Julien , was perfectly happy , and never thought of reproaching herself in the slightest . 
`` Then there were sighs , the deeper for suppression , And stolen glances sweeter for the theft , And burning blushes , though for no transgression . '' 
Don Juan , c. I , st. 74 . 
It was only when Madame de Rênal began to think of her maid Elisa that there was some slight change in that angelic sweetness which she owed both to her natural character and her actual happiness . 
The girl had come into a fortune , went to confess herself to the curé Chélan and confessed to him her plan of marrying Julien . 
The curé was truly rejoiced at his friend 's good fortune , but he was extremely surprised when Julien resolutely informed him that Mademoiselle Elisa 's offer could not suit him . 
`` Beware , my friend , of what is passing within your heart , '' said the curé with a frown , `` I congratulate you on your mission , if that is the only reason why you despise a more than ample fortune . 
It is fifty-six years since I was first curé of Verrières , and yet I shall be turned out , according to all appearances . 
I am distressed by it , and yet my income amounts to eight hundred francs .
