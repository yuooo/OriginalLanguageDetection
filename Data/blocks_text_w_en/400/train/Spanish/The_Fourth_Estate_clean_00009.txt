These insinuations to the young girls were sometimes effectual , sometimes not . 
Don Benigno rarely made them in the ears of an elderly person . 
We do not know if he thought that Heaven would rather receive a bride of fifteen than one of thirty , or whether he thought the older people were more obstinate and suspicious than the young girls . 
Anyhow , that spiritual sport induced interesting episodes . 
On one occasion the priest was the victim of an assault made by a youth who had been robbed of his bride-elect by the convent . 
On another occasion , after having obtained a dowry for a young girl , and having provided her with clothes , the bride of Heaven escaped in the night with a tailor 's assistant . 
Don Benigno used to take the brides himself to the abode of the bridegroom . 
When there were difficulties to overcome on the part of the family , he bore himself with the skill and energy of a consummate lady-killer , and he organized and carried out the conquest with an astuteness that many mundane suitors would have envied . 
It was this matter to which Alvaro Peña referred when in a certain paragraph he mentioned a certain priest devoted to `` pigeon-sport . '' 
And as we know Don Benigno 's proclivity in this direction , the shaft went home with diabolical effect . 
The readers also understood the allusion , and laughed not a little at the mischievous joke . 
Seeing himself made fun of like this , the priest , being , like all artists , of susceptible and choleric temperament , grew terrible angry . 
`` Have you read Don Rosendo 's paper ? '' 
he asked Don Segis that evening at Morana 's . 
It must be mentioned that since the first irreverent paragraph Don Benigno never spoke of `` The Light of Sarrio '' by any other term . 
`` Yes , I read it this morning , at Graell 's . '' 
`` And what do you think of that insult ? '' 
`` What insult ? '' 
asked the chaplain calmly . 
`` Why , man , have you not read the infamous remarks made about me ? '' 
Don Segis raised his glass to his eyes , attentively examined the golden liquid , put it to his lips , and slowly drank it . 
After coughing a little , and drying his mouth with a silk handkerchief , he said gravely : `` Tush ! 
There is not a kind spirit about it , as we all say ; but it is best to take such things calmly , it is no good exciting one 's self . '' 
This was a fresh blow to the curate , who had hoped to find his indignation shared by Don Segis , and he was dumb with suppressed rage . 
It was thus that the chaplain of the Augustine convent was able to pay Don Benigno out for his uncalled-for partiality to the rising convent . 
The curate then addressed himself to Señor Anselmo and to Don Juan , `` the Old Salt , '' who both expressed disgust at the paragraph , without , however , showing much interest in the subject , for we know that that would not have been in keeping with the quiet character of the patriarchal gathering . 
But on the following Thursday , Alvaro Peña left Don Benigno , and attacked the chaplain of the nuns , making him the subject of a description in verse , and giving a graceful reference to the mingling of the glasses of gin with the quarterns of white wine . 
It was then Don Segis 's turn to be furious , and Don Benigno 's to be calm . 
But it was evident that this calmness was only put on , merely assumed to pay Don Segis off for his want of sympathy , for , as a matter of fact , he was still bleeding from his wound . 
Therefore it was not long before a reconciliation took place , and they both agreed , with unusual ardor , to skin every one who wrote in Don Rosendo 's paper , beginning with the founder himself , and ending with the owner of the printing press . 
They were quite aware that Alvaro Peña was the author of the insults , but as every one had always known that he was a soulless vampire , capable of sucking the blood of all the clerics of Sarrio , to avoid harping on the same string they soon turned from him and laid all the blame on Sinforoso . 
They considered themselves justified in this course , because the young fellow had been a seminarist , and consequently a traitor . 
Then he came from the same stock , for his father was a Carlist , and his grandfather before him . 
Moreover , Don Rosendo Belinchon , Don Rudesindo , and Alvaro Peña and Don Rufo , all men of certain position in the town , might have some license and do as they liked -- `` but that puppy ! 
that ragamuffin ! '' 
Excited by the murmur of applause , Don Benigno drank a few more quarterns than usual , and the chaplain would not let himself be outdone . 
When the men left the shop in the classic chain , Don Segis noticed that his swelled leg dragged less than usual , and he remarked it to Don Benigno , who congratulated him on the fact . 
Then when , a few steps later , they reached the walls of the Augustine convent , Don Segis said in a loud voice , that as he felt no desire to go to bed that night he would go on with him . 
But the curate whispered in his ear that he would like to speak to him in private , so both remained in front of the convent . 
`` Friend Don Segis , what do you think of going and pulling Perinolo 's son 's nose for him ? '' 
`` Gently ! 
gently ! 
gently ! '' 
`` If we could only give him a hiding , without any scandal , of course . '' 
`` Gently ! 
gently ! '' 
`` At eleven , or half-past , they leave the café . 
We can wait for him about there , and then administer a little corporal punishment . '' 
`` Gently ! 
gently ! 
gently ! '' 
`` Are you a man , or are you not , Don Segis ? '' 
This question , innocent as it was , produced great perturbation in the mind of the chaplain , to judge by the series of faces and agitated gestures which he made before he could find his voice . 
`` Who ? 
I ? 
I would never have believed that a friend and coadjutor could say such a thing to me ! '' 
Then he turned aside in great emotion , and raised his handkerchief to his eyes , which shed some tears . 
`` Well , men should comport themselves as men . 
Come along , and let us chastise this rascal . '' 
`` Come along ! '' 
replied the chaplain in a firm tone , as he turned in the direction of his house . 
`` Not that way , Don Segis . '' 
`` Which way you like . '' 
The two clerics took each other by the arm , and proceeded on their way , not without certain vacillations , in the direction of the Café Marina . 
It must be observed that they both adopted a lay costume in the evening ; they wore black frock coats , with full skirts and tight sleeves , thick boots , and enormous felt hats . 
It was a good quarter of an hour before they finally reached the café . 
Once there , dazzled by the lights , like silly butterflies , they almost collapsed and withdrew . 
`` It will be better to wait for him near his own house . 
There are several people about here still , '' said Don Benigno . 
Don Segis , being in a submissive state of mind , followed his friend 's suggestion . 
In the Calle de Caborana , at the corner of that of Azucar , which leads to the Rua Nueva , they both took up their positions , a stroke of strategy , as the enemy had to pass that way , for his house was situated in the Calle de Caborana . 
Then the two clerics displayed the persistence of the Navarrese in the defile of Roncesvalles , for during the half hour 's waiting , they bore with indomitable heroism exposure to a fine rain , without fear of rheumatism or without any other mundane consideration causing them to budge an inch from their post of occupation . 
Finally , relieved in his mind and satisfied with having maintained a heated discussion in the café , the chief editor of `` The Light '' directed his steps to his house , when he unexpectedly came upon the enraged curate , who said in a shrill voice : `` Listen here , boy ; if you will now repeat the insults which you have written in Don Rosendo 's paper , I shall be very glad to hear them . '' 
Surprise , the sarcastic and threatening tone of the priest , and the sight of the portly form of Don Segis standing motionless as a reserve force a few steps off , filled Sinforoso with such terror that for some time he was speechless ; and it was only when the cleric advanced a step toward him that he managed to say : `` Calm yourself , Don Benigno . 
I did not use your name . '' 
`` Hallo ! '' 
exclaimed the priest with a fierce smile , `` I see you do n't crow so loud now . 
What is the matter with the cock that does not crow ? 
What is wrong with the cock that does not crow , boy ? '' 
Don Benigno took a step forward , and Sinforoso took a step backward . 
Don Segis , the reserve force , also advanced a step to preserve the strategical distance . 
`` Calm yourself , Don Benigno ! '' 
cried Sinforoso in terror . 
`` I am very calm , young fellow ! 
I only want to hear that about the doves again which pleased me so much . '' 
`` I did not write it ! '' 
exclaimed Perinolo 's son in dismay . 
`` You did not write it , boy ? 
Then take this for when you do write it . '' 
And he leveled a blow at the editor 's cheek . 
`` Calm yourself , Don Benigno ! '' 
exclaimed the wretched fellow as he fell backward with his hands outstretched . 
`` Do n't I tell you I am very calm ? 
You braggart . 
Here 's another little dove ! '' 
And he administered another blow . 
`` For God 's sake , Don Benigno , calm yourself ! '' 
`` There goes another little dove ! '' 
another blow followed . 
Let us say now , before going any further , that of all the blows given in Sarrio during the two years subsequent to the appearance of `` The Light '' -LRB- and goodness knows they were innumerable -RRB- , the cheeks of this distinguished youth were the butt of at least one-half of them . 
Being powerless to calm his infuriated assailant by his entreaties , and suspecting the doves would prove to be numerous , the chief editor cried out with all his strength : `` Help ! 
help ! 
They are killing me ! '' 
Then he turned round to take refuge in flight , but the iron fingers of the priest caught him by the arm , and at the same moment Don Segis , thinking that the time had come for him to join in the fray , leveled a heavy blow on his shoulders with his stout stick . 
`` Help ! '' 
cried the wretched fellow again . 
It happened that at that moment Alvaro Peña , the intrepid naval officer , who was proceeding from Graell 's shop , where he generally spent his evenings , to his dwelling in the Calle del Azucar , rushed to the spot , saying : `` What is the matter , Sinforoso ? 
What is the matter ? '' 
`` Help , Don Alvaro ; they are killing me ! '' 
`` Hold on , Sinforoso , help is coming ! '' 
he cried as he rapidly approached . 
The priests , hearing the voice of that hated and terrible enemy of the Church , were much alarmed , but emboldened by the fight , they faced him in battle line with their sticks raised in the air . 
Peña was filled with mingled rage and pleasure as he advanced to the attack . 
`` Windbags ! '' 
he cried , as he wielded his stick , and Don Benigno 's enormous hat flew twenty paces off . 
Don Segis advanced with the purpose of aiming his stick at the head of the officer , but before he could do so a blow caught him at the back of the head , leaving him badly hurt . 
`` It might have been expected . 
Caramba ! 
only nocturnal birds are capable of treacherously lying in wait for a defenseless man , making a street brawl and disturbing the neighbors ' rest . 
We must have done with these bloodsuckers who sap the life of the town and try to keep it in a state of barbarism . 
Call these the ministers of God ! 
The apostles of charity ! 
The eternal disturbers of social peace ! '' 
Even in this critical moment the officer could not drop the anticlerical rhetoric and pompous style that he always adopted . 
Every phrase was accompanied with a blow . 
The priests being powerless to withstand his furious attack , tried to take to their heels . 
The curate soon got out of reach of the stick , but poor Don Segis , with the extraordinary weight of his left leg , was left behind , and had to endure the blows from Peña 's weapon for some time . 
Alvaro 's voice could be heard in the distance , crying out in mocking rebuke : `` Hypocrites ! 
Whited sepulchres ! 
Is this conformity with the spirit of the Gospel , you brawlers ? 
You preach peace and love to mankind , and you are the first to disgrace the sacred doctrine ! 
When shall we shake off your yoke and emancipate ourselves from the slavery in which you have kept us for so long ! '' 
Any one would have thought to hear him that he was making a speech in some democratic club instead of administering corporal punishment . 
Thus ended that encounter . 
The next morning the harbor-master received a visit from the rector of Sarrio , who came to implore him not to make mention of the unfortunate incident in the newspaper , and offering all kinds of apologies to both him and Sinforoso on behalf of the curate and Don Segis . 
Peña declined to accede to this request , for it was an admirable opportunity to open an attack upon the enemies of liberty and progress ; and , in fact , the next number of `` The Light '' contained a circumstantial account , written in a humorous style , of all that had taken place , which greatly exercised the minds of the clergy and the timorous people in the town . 
The weighty and serious matters on Don Rosendo 's mind prevented his giving the painful incident that had disturbed the even tenor of his house the especial attention that he would have accorded it at any other time . 
Nevertheless he was much upset when he learned of Gonzalo 's treachery and his younger daughter 's misconduct , and he held long conversations with his wife on the subject -- irrefutable proof that great men may be full of exalted , grand ideas , and yet not blind to the things of this world , as is usually supposed . 
His first impulse was to send off Gonzalo and shut his daughter up in a convent , but the entreaties of Doña Paula and his own clear-minded conclusions led him to change his purpose . 
At the expiration of some days of indecision -LRB- the burden of the other cares caused their number to be few -RRB- he granted the ill-conducted young people permission to marry ; but not without first having an interview with Cecilia , and hearing from her lips that she willingly forgave her sister , and wished the marriage to take place as soon as possible . 
The consent being given , Gonzalo presented himself one afternoon at Belinchon 's house . 
It was a fortnight since he had been there , and his heart sank at the prospect in spite of his wishes having been so fully and promptly realized . 
He dreaded the first interview , and not without reason . 
Doña Paula received him with marked coldness , and even the servants ' manners were tinged with a hostility which hurt him . 
Then the idea of seeing Cecilia made him tremble . 
But when Venturita came into the room all his fear and all his depression vanished . 
Her sprightly chatter , the bright sparkle of her eyes , and her graceful , mocking coquetry quickly raised his spirits and transported him into the seventh heaven . 
The enchanting enthraldom of her voice and manners had lulled him into an indifference to all else by the time Cecilia entered the room . 
The sight of his victim exercised a strange and sudden effect upon him ; he automatically rose from his seat , and his face changed color . 
`` How do you do , Gonzalo ? '' 
This was said by Cecilia , as if she had seen him the preceding day and nothing particular had happened , only she was a shade paler than usual . 
But the young man was so overwhelmed with confusion that he could not reply to this simple question without stuttering . 
The clear and tranquil glance of Cecilia affected him like an electric current , and he turned to Doña Paula , whose face was overshadowed with a severe and melancholy expression , while Venturita looked out of the window with assumed indifference . 
At last he resumed his seat , trembling violently , and Cecilia , who had come to ask her mother for the keys of the cupboards , gave him a quiet smile of farewell as she left the room . 
The preparations for the marriage began . 
Doña Paula had the delicacy , rare in a low-born woman , not to allow a single article of wearing apparel made for Cecilia to serve for her sister . 
So a fresh trousseau was quickly put in hand . 
To the great surprise of the needlewomen , Cecilia joined in the work . 
Some attributed this concession to kindness , others to want of feeling . 
It is true that , although a little thin , her face expressed the same quiet cheerfulness as ever , and her fingers worked at her sister 's initials with the same dexterity as when she embroidered her own . 
But the cutting of the scissors and the sewing of the needles seemed to say horrible things , ah ! 
very horrible things , instead of those pretty ones which used to make her tremble with joy . 
They remained buried in her heart , however , and the keenest observer would have read nothing in those large , liquid , beautiful eyes but the usual quiet smile . 
`` Did n't I tell you so , girl ? '' 
whispered Teresa in Valentina 's ear as she looked at our young friend . 
`` Yes , Señorita Cecilia is incapable of loving anybody . '' 
Gonzalo avoided the workroom , and when perchance he appeared he was so abashed and confused that the embroideresses winked at each other and smiled . 
Seeing him so embarrassed , and Cecilia so calm and indifferent , you would have thought that the parts played by both in the sad love affair had been reversed . 
In the meantime tongues wagged on the subject in the shops , in the houses , in the streets , and at the Promenade -- there was no end to it . 
The event caused a great sensation in the town . 
While preparations for Cecilia 's marriage had been going on , it had been the general opinion that Gonzalo showed a deplorable want of taste , that he was throwing himself away on the poor girl , who was represented as little less than a monster of ugliness ; and they all wondered why he had not chosen her sister , who was so lovely and so graceful . 
Directly they learned of the change their opinions suddenly veered round . 
`` What a scandal ! 
What a disgraceful proceeding ! 
What parents to consent to such infamy ! 
Where was the shame of some people ? 
Poor girl , so beautiful , so slender , with such lovely eyes ! 
Well , I consider her prettier than her sister . '' 
`` So do I. '' We must not miss the opportunity of saying that this eternal discontent of people with regard to the actions of their fellow-creatures , much as it upsets us , does not argue intentional unkindness , malignity , or envy , as we are apt to think when we are the object of their remarks ; it is nothing but an evident tribute to the imperfection of our planetary existence and the love of the ideal that every one bears within himself without ever seeing it realized . 
After having thus shown ourselves both philosophical and optimistic , we will proceed with our story . 
The day of the marriage arrived . 
It was solemnized early in the morning at Belinchon 's house , in the presence of a few relations and friends ; and after taking chocolate the bride and bridegroom left for Tejada . 
This was an estate about four miles from the town , where Don Rosendo 's genius , aided by money , had had full scope to produce great effects . 
When he bought the place it consisted of several fields and a wood , where cows pastured , and the notes of thrushes , linnets , and blackbirds filled the air . 
Don Rosendo began by doing away with this indigenous colony , and substituting a foreign one for it . 
The breed of cattle of the country was proscribed and replaced by one from Switzerland . 
The same ruthlessness was shown in robbing the trees of their native songsters , and hanging them with cages full of rare , exotic birds that croaked dolefully all the year round at sunset . 
The energetic reformatory spirit of Don Rosendo did not stop at the animal kingdom , for it was brought with equal relentlessness to bear upon the vegetable one , and the character of the place was thus completely transformed . 
By degrees the great shady chestnut trees , with their gnarled trunks ; the gigantic oaks , which had renewed their scalloped foliage more than three hundred times ; the walnut trees , that looked like enormous thistles ; the luxuriant orchard trees , bowed to the ground with the weight of the luscious fruit , and many other trees pertaining to a good landed property in the country , all gradually succumbed to the saw and the ax . 
Washingtonians , araucarias , excelsas , and many other trees of foreign extraction , chiefly of the coniferæ family , were planted in their stead , which made the place look something like a cemetery in the eyes of the vulgar . 
However , when any such remark was made to Don Rosendo he merely replied that coniferæ had the advantage of foliage during the winter , and the vulgar would return that that very fact made it look like a cemetery in the winter , and in the summer too . 
But Don Rosendo did not deign to reply to such a silly remark , and in this he was right . 
As everything that is worth much costs much , the foreigners of both kingdoms absorbed a good deal of Belinchon 's income . 
The birds of the country had fed themselves and dressed their feathers without any extraneous assistance , but those from abroad , shut up in cages and enormous aviaries made for the purpose , required several attendants to feed them and to keep their places clean . 
Then homesickness caused great blanks among them which could only be filled by sending expensive orders to Paris and London . 
The same thing happened with the vegetable kingdom , only of every plant that succeeded by dint of great care and cultivation thirty or forty died , and the constant attention of the gardeners could not prevent this mortality . 
The house was also neither Spanish nor European in style . 
It was built in Chinese style , with little pagodas rising upon every side . 
I do not know what connection these little towers had with Babel , the scene of the confusion of tongues , but I must tell you that in the neighborhood the fantastic building went by the name of `` Don Rosendo 's Babel . '' 
It was magnificently furnished , and wanting in none of the comforts and refinements afforded by modern civilization to the rich . 
It had a splendid room , decorated in Persian style , a bathroom , a large dining-room , fairly well frescoed , and several beautiful little airy apartments , where the light penetrated through colored windows . 
So Gonzalo and Venturita repaired to this nest two hours after their union had been solemnized . 
On their way thither they had talked without embarrassment on different subjects . 
The young man had imprinted several kisses on the cheeks of the girl , as when they were betrothed ; but on arriving at the `` Babel , '' and finding themselves alone in the Persian chamber , he was overwhelmed with confusion and awkwardness . 
He tried to find subjects of conversation , but he failed in the attempt . 
Venturita scarcely answered him , but she looked at him with an expression of mingled passion and coquetry . 
`` Look here , stop -- stop talking that nonsense . 
Leave off and give me a kiss , '' she added laughing , and patting his mouth with her primrose hand . 
Then Gonzalo colored deeply , and kissed her passionately . 
His passion of these first days bordered on madness . 
Venturita , with her singular beauty , the languid , voluptuous expression of her eyes , and her invincible tendency to recline , was a perfect odalisque . 
But unlike one in being merely a beautiful animal , she was full of a mischievous spirit that bubbled forth at every moment in rather equivocal jokes and meaning puns , so that Gonzalo was always roaring with merriment , in ignorance of the danger of that mood between husband and wife . 
The life they led was very sedentary , for Ventura did not like going out ; the sun gave her headache and the cold hurt her throat . 
She spent much time in the adornment of her person , and changed her dresses as often as if she were in Madrid , so that the greater part of the day was spent in her dressing-room . 
This did not displease Gonzalo ; for , on the contrary , when he saw her appear looking lovely and graceful , exhaling a penetrating perfume like a tropical flower , he was transported with delight , and a tremor of passion shook his whole being as he thought that that exquisite work of nature was his -- entirely his . 
Nevertheless , everything was not quite like what he had imagined it would be . 
Sometimes the young bride , half in earnest , half in joke , shut herself up in her room and there spent three or four hours without permitting him to enter , in spite of his affectionate entreaties through the keyhole . 
`` I rob you of the sight of me for some time , '' she would say afterward , laughing , `` to increase your wish to be with me . '' 
And , in fact , these coquetries augmented the young man 's passion to such an extent that it became quite a madness . 
When the beauty felt inclined , they walked in the grounds , but they did not go far . 
On arriving at one of the few shady , cool retreats which had escaped the reforming hand of Don Rosendo , the girl liked to sit down -- but neither upon the grass nor the rustic seats , so Gonzalo had to run and fetch an armchair for her from the house . 
`` Now sit here at my feet . '' 
The young man then prostrated himself at her side and passionately kissed the hands that his beautiful wife gave him . 
`` Samson and Delilah ! '' 
she laughingly exclaimed , putting her snowdrop hands through the ruddy curly beard of her husband . 
`` You are right , '' he replied with a sigh . 
`` A Samson without hair . '' 
`` You no hair ! 
-- and this -- what is this ? '' 
she returned , ruffling his locks and making them stand up like a broom . 
`` I am speaking of my strength . '' 
`` You have not strength , eh ? 
Let 's see -- show me your arms . '' 
Laughing , he took off his jacket , and turning up the sleeves of his shirt he brought to view his enormous gladiatorial arms , on which the powerful muscles stood up like a network of cords . 
`` What strength ! '' 
exclaimed the girl , taking hold of one arm with both hands , which were unable to compass it . 
Then , seized with sudden enthusiasm and admiration , she added : `` How strong , how handsome you are , Gonzalo ! 
Let me bite your arm ? '' 
And bending down she tried to insert her pretty little teeth into the flesh , but the youth had such iron muscles that her teeth only passed over the skin without breaking it . 
Then she grew vexed , and tried again to succeed in piercing the flesh at all costs . 
Finally he relaxed his muscles , and said : `` I will let you bite me , but only on condition that you draw blood . '' 
`` No , not so , '' she replied , while her pleased smile expressed the wish to do it . 
`` Yes , you must draw blood ; if not I wo n't let you do it . '' 
Then the girl proceeded to bite her husband 's arm . 
`` Harder ! '' 
he cried . 
And she bit harder . 
`` Harder ! '' 
he repeated . 
And she bit harder still , while a mischievous smile sparkled in her eyes . 
`` Harder ! 
harder ! '' 
`` Enough , '' she said , rising from her seat ; `` do n't you see I have drawn blood ? 
How cruel , just as if I were a dog ! '' 
And bending down again , she sucked with delight the blood that welled up in the arm . 
Both smiled with repressed passion , and then they looked at the little red circle made by the girl 's teeth . 
`` Do you see ? '' 
she repeated , half ashamed . 
`` Well , it was one of your strange fancies ! '' 
`` Thanks ! 
I should like this mark to remain here forever . 
But no , unfortunately it will soon go . '' 
`` I can renew it every day , '' she mischievously returned . 
`` I should be very pleased . '' 
`` You want to make your wife into a little dog ; well , you had better say so plainly . '' 
And suddenly embracing him , and kissing him passionately on the eyes , cheeks , mouth , and beard , she repeated incessantly : `` Say so plainly ! 
say so plainly , you bear ! 
This mouth is mine , and I kiss it . 
This beard is mine , and I kiss it , too . 
This neck is mine , and I kiss it . 
These arms are mine , mine , and I kiss them too ! '' 
`` Take me altogether ; my life is yours , '' he said , intoxicated with happiness . 
`` I love you ; I love you , Gonzalo , for your good looks and your strength . 
Look , let me put my hand on yours -- what a difference ! 
It looks like an ant . '' 
`` A white ant , '' he returned , taking the little hand between his own great strong ones . 
`` I love you ; I love you , Gonzalo . 
Take me in your arms . 
Could you walk with me like that ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are nothing . '' 
And lifting her like a feather , and putting her on his arm like a child , he began jumping about the garden . 
`` Not so fast ! 
Carry me gently . 
Let us go for a walk . '' 
So he carried her all over the park without feeling any fatigue . 
And from that day that kind of walk pleased the girl so much that whenever they went out she clung to her husband 's neck for him to carry her . 
The servants smiled and shook their heads at the sight . 
But a still better way of amusing her was very soon discovered . 
There was a swing near the house , out of order , but more from time than use . 
It was repaired , and as soon as it was ready it afforded many hours of occupation to Gonzalo . 
`` If you could only know how I enjoy it ! 
Push a little more . '' 
Whereupon the youth 's vigorous push made the swing fly , and the girl 's eyes closed and her nostrils dilated with a feeling of intense delight , and Gonzalo liked seeing her so well amused . 
Thus twenty days went by . 
During that time they received two visits from Pablito and Piscis ; once they came in the tilbury , and once on horseback . 
The chief object on this last occasion was to ride a mare that Pablo had received in exchange for an older one . 
And strange to say , in spite of being so much in love , our young friend received the visits of the two equestrians with inexpressible delight , entered deeply into their interests , and when they had gone he had a feeling of void in his life , for his blood and his muscles were suffering from the extremely sedentary life he was leading . 
One day he proposed to his wife to go shooting , for he was an excellent shot and an indefatigable sportsman . 
Venturita made no objection as long as she could go with him , and so it was arranged . 
Therefore , one morning they went in search of a covey of partridges , the existence of which Gonzalo had been aware of since the day of his arrival at Tejada . 
But before they had gone half a mile from the house Venturita was quite done up , she could not take another step . 
Her husband , therefore , was obliged to carry her back in his arms , and forego his favorite pastime . 
Doña Paula , who had regarded the marriage with great aversion , did not make any allusion to visiting the bride and bridegroom until many days had elapsed . 
She then suggested to Pablito to accompany her , because she feared it would pain Cecilia to do so ; but the girl quietly expressed her intention of also going to Tejada . 
So one afternoon the mother and daughter started off to the place in an open carriage ; but on coming in sight of the well-known little stone towers , Cecilia turned pale -- she felt a pain at her heart and she could hardly see ; so when Doña Paula saw her daughter 's indisposition she gave orders to the coachman to turn back . 
`` Poor girl ! '' 
she said , kissing her . 
`` You see you can not do it . '' 
`` I shall be able -- I shall be able to , '' she returned , covering her eyes with her hand . 
On the following day Doña Paula paid the visit , accompanied by Pablo , and she cordially invited the bride and bridegroom to leave the retired spot and to come to them in town , so this they did the following week . 
Cecilia came down to the street door to receive the couple ; she embraced and kissed her sister warmly , she gave her hand to Gonzalo , and kept it from trembling by a supreme effort of will ; and the young man embraced her with a fraternal affection , thinking himself forgiven . 
The bride and bridegroom were put in possession of the rooms that Doña Paula had destined for her eldest daughter , and , to all appearances , life resumed its peaceful course . 
Nevertheless , Gonzalo was sorry to see that they were not environed with that warm and genial atmosphere which adds so much to the comfort of the domestic hearth . 
Everybody was kind and attentive , from Don Rosendo down to the lowest servant ; but no affection was shown them . 
Ventura did not notice it , or if she noticed it she did not much mind . 
After that grand victory over the clergy , `` The Light of Sarrio '' resumed its successful and prosperous course . 
The boisterous , vehement harbor-master was able to continue his civilizing crusade without fear of any more ambuscades . 
Sinforoso did not give up his post ; however , he never went home without being accompanied by Maza or some other friend , both being well armed . 
But Gabino Maza , who was always captious , knew how to make a malicious use of the rupture with the Church by appealing to the consciences of several of the townsfolk . 
Not that he was a strict Catholic , or cared a rap whether the whole priestcraft were rooted up like parsley , or not , for his ideas had always been somewhat heterodox , and the clergy had long considered him beyond the pale , yet he was the one now to be shocked . 
`` After all , '' he said , `` we have been brought up to respect religion , which is the only curb upon a town , and people can not be allowed to ride rough-shod over the sacred beliefs of our wives , '' etc. . 
These perfidious insinuations caused several people to give up their subscriptions to the paper . 
The editor and the proprietor , who divined the source of the blow , were greatly indignant ; but Gabino Maza , seconded by the no less irrepressible Delaunay , did not relax in his contentious campaign . 
If any of the staff of `` The Light '' were present nothing was said , but directly they left tongues wagged freely and furiously . 
Sometimes seriously and sometimes jokingly they discussed all who were concerned with the paper , more especially , as was only logical , its highest representative -- the eminent Don Rosendo . 
They said -LRB- oh ! 
disgraceful conduct ! -RRB- 
that it was only the desire of seeing himself in print which had inspired him with the philanthropic movement of lighting the torch of progress in Sarrio ; that Don Rufo , the doctor , was an impostor ; Sinforoso , a poor thing -- a broken reed to lean upon ; Alvaro Peña -LRB- here the voices were lowered and furtive looks cast round -RRB- , a blusterer without a spice of justice in him ; Don Feliciano Gomez , a poor devil who had better look after his own not very flourishing affairs ; Don Rudesindo , a great brawler who was only trying to let his storehouse and advertise his cider ; and as to the originator and promoter of the enterprise , Don Rosendo , they said that he had always been a stupid fool , who had thought himself an author when in fact he understood nothing but the rise and fall of the price of codfish . 
Only the imperious duty of acting as faithful and impartial chroniclers obliges us to record such remarks ; for of a truth it is much against the grain -- the pen itself even seeming to revolt in one 's hand against writing down such abominable things . 
The backbiters abstained from speaking against Don Pedro Miranda because they had already asked him to withdraw from the periodical , which he seemed inclined to do after the skirmish with the clergy ; for Don Pedro was an old Christian , and a great friend of the Augustinian chaplain . 
The malignant remarks were successful in setting some of the influential ladies of the town against the paper , among whom was Doña Brigida ; so the foolish and degraded Marin went over to their side at the Club . 
The dissentient side was also increased by the drunken mayor , for a feeling of fellowship with the frequenters of the café , and the vexation caused him by the constant excitement of the press , made him quickly retire from the great reform movement . 
That which finally set him against `` The Light '' and its staff was a paragraph in which the mayor and the corporation were severely censured for the license they allowed the town police and the little they did to render Sarrio a pleasant seaside resort for distinguished scrofulous patients in the summer . 
Although they outwardly behaved as friends , a veiled , silent enmity reigned among the chief frequenters of the Club , and this increased day by day , thanks to the mischief-makers , who never cease on such occasions to air the differences and dislikes . 
Thenceforth they avoided quarrels and disputes because the angry cries and insulting terms which meant nothing in former days were now , thanks to the cordial dislike which existed among them all , fraught with much danger . 
Therefore greater silence and more courtesy reigned in the resort , but it was accompanied with less frankly and cordiality . 
That strange state of feeling could not last long . 
Among people meeting every day and not being very cordial with each other , a quarrel is soon inevitable . 
It happened thus . 
There arrived at the saloon , no one knew how , a copy of a certain Catalonian illustrated paper , where , among other pictures , was one representing the banks of an American river , upon which a dozen crocodiles were disporting themselves . 
Maza had the paper in his hand when Rufo came up behind him and said in a jocular tone : `` A lot of crocodiles , eh ? '' 
`` They are not crocodiles , '' returned Maza in a dry , disdainful tone , without raising his head . 
`` And why are they not ? '' 
asked the doctor , wounded by the tone . 
`` Because they are not . '' 
`` That is no reason . '' 
`` If you do n't know , study ; I am not here to teach you for nothing . '' 
`` Tut ! 
The sage of Greece . 
Stand off , gentlemen ! '' 
`` I am not a sage , but I say these animals are not crocodiles , for there are no crocodiles in the river Maranon . '' 
`` What are they , then ? '' 
`` Alligators . '' 
`` Call them what you like ! 
Alligators and crocodiles are the same . '' 
`` Another atrocity ! 
Where did you learn that ? '' 
`` Why , man , it is a well-known fact that the alligator and crocodile only differ in name . 
Here is Don Lorenzo , who has traveled , and can tell us whether it is not so . '' 
`` The alligator is rather smaller , '' observed Don Lorenzo , with a conciliatory smile . 
`` The size is of little consequence . 
The question is whether it has the same form or not . '' 
Don Lorenzo nodded in sign of assent . 
Maza jumped up in a fury : `` But , gentlemen ! 
But , gentlemen ! 
Are we among cultivated people or among country clowns ? 
Where do you find that crocodiles are the same as alligators ? 
The crocodile is an animal of the Old World , and the alligator of the New . '' 
`` Excuse me , friend Maza , but I have seen crocodiles in the Philippines , '' returned Don Rudesindo . 
`` Well , and what if you have ? '' 
`` Because you say crocodiles do n't belong to the Old World -- '' `` No more they do ! 
Are not the Philippines in the New World ? 
Gentlemen , gentlemen , open your umbrellas , for fooleries are raining down now . '' 
`` What ? 
Do you mean to say that the Philippines are not in the other hemisphere ? '' 
asked Don Rudesindo , his face distorted with rage . 
`` Never mind ; never mind ; go on . '' 
`` The chief difference between the crocodile and the alligator , '' intervened Don Lorenzo in a tone of authority , `` is that the crocodile has three rows of teeth , and the alligator only two . '' 
`` It is not so , sir ; it is not so ! 
Crocodiles have the same rows of teeth as alligators . '' 
Don Lorenzo received this remark with indignation , and Don Rudesindo came to his support ; Maza , seconded by Delaunay , was not less furious in his attack . 
Several members of the Club soon joined in the dispute , which got warmer every minute . 
The voices were deafening . 
If they had had three rows of teeth like the crocodiles , or even two , I do not doubt that they would have devoured each other , seeing the rage and passion with which they showed the one set with which nature had endowed them . 
Maza was so aggressive and so insolent that at last Don Rudesindo , no longer master of himself , gave him a blow on the head with his umbrella . 
The subsequent conflict of sticks and umbrellas made a noise so terrible that it would have struck terror into the bravest heart . 
Several who had no recollection of having given any opinion on the teeth of the reptiles in question received their share of umbrella blows the same as those who had discoursed upon the subject . 
The master and several other people came upstairs , the West Indians left off playing billiards , Don Melchor de las Cuevas , a person of influence in war as well as in peace , mediated between the combatants , and the disturbance was finally quelled , but it was some months before their tempers cooled down . 
The result was , that from that day Gabino Maza , Delaunay , Don Roque , Marin , and three or four other members left the Club . 
Don Pedro Miranda only appeared between long intervals of absence , which made the remaining members and the staff of `` The Light '' see that they could not count upon him , and that it would not be long before he joined the other side , as indeed it came to pass . 
The dissenting party used to meet in the Café de Londres in the Calle de Caborana , but not many months later the news ran through the town that they had taken a storehouse in the Calle de San Florencio in which to hold their meetings ; and so it was . 
They had the floor boarded and carpeted , the walls and ceilings painted , and after furnishing it with several chairs and armchairs , they began going there as regularly as they had formerly gone to the Club . 
As the roof was low , and there was a ledge in the wall on which Marin used to take his afternoon nap , the place soon went by the name of the `` Cabin '' in the town , and the name clung to it . 
The staff of `` The Light '' treated the deserters with scorn as long as they had no roof under which to assemble , but now the matter assumed importance , and the first symptom of fear was evinced in an article , or a screed in blank verse , describing the new meeting-place , and bringing each of the members into notice under the names of different animals : Maza , a fish ; Delaunay , a crowing cock ; Marin , an ass ; Don Roque , a pig , etc. . 
This exasperated the `` Cabin '' party in an inexpressible way . 
Don Rosendo became more and more pushing and active in his press campaign , and he essayed to introduce into `` The Light '' all the forms and customs that he noticed in the national and foreign press , more especially the French . 
He commissioned a clerk in Madrid to send him , every Wednesday , a telegram of twenty words , and moreover to write him political and literary letters . 
He translated all the foreign notices that appeared in periodicals , even those of fashion , courts of justice , and theatres ; but where he distinguished himself was in the market column . 
It is not easy to describe the cleverness with which he treated the subject of cereals , oils , spirituous liquors , rice , etc. .
