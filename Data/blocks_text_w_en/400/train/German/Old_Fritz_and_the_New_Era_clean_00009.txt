She seized Marie with irresistible force , and drew her toward the side door , which was fast . 
Then hurried toward the entrance , dragging her daughter after her , but shook it in vain ; that door was fastened also . 
`` Oh ! 
I could kiss myself , '' murmured Trude , as she patted her old , wrinkled cheeks . 
`` I was as cunning and wise as Solomon . 
There , shriek for Trude , order her to open it . 
Trude is not there , and she has no ears for you ! '' 
`` This is a plot -- a shameful plot ! '' 
cried Frau von Werrig , stamping her feet . 
`` That good-for-nothing creature , Trude , is in it . 
She has locked the doors , and the schoolmaster paid her for it . '' 
Trude shook her fist at her mistress behind the door . 
`` Wait ! 
that good-for-nothing creature will punish you ! 
You shall have something to be angry about with me every day . '' 
`` I swear to you that I do not know who locked the doors , '' replied Moritz , calmly . 
`` But whoever did it , I thank them from the depths of my soul , for it forces you to listen to me , and may love give my words the power to soften your heart . 
General and Frau von Werrig , I conjure you to have compassion upon us . 
Is it possible that you are deaf to the cry of grief of your own child ? '' 
Suddenly assuming a contemptuous calm , Frau von Werrig sank back upon the divan with great dignity . 
`` As I am obliged to listen to you , through a shameful deception , let it be so . 
Try to make ears in my heart , which you say is deaf . 
Let me listen to your wonderful eloquence ! '' 
`` Oh , Philip ! '' 
said Marie , clasping his arms , `` you see it will all be in vain . '' 
`` Let me hope to succeed in awakening a spark of loving mercy , as Moses caused the fountain to gush from the rock . 
-- A year since you turned me insultingly from your door , Frau von Werrig , and you forbade me with scorn and contempt to ever cross your threshold . 
In the rebellious pride of my heart I swore never to do it again , never to speak to those who had so injured me . 
The holy , pure love which binds me to this dear girl has released me from my oath . 
We have tried to live separated from each other a long year , an inconsolable , unhappy year ! 
We hoped to renounce each other , although we could not forget . 
Marie , as an obedient daughter , obeyed your commands , and returned the ring , which I gave her in a moment of affection and holy trust . 
I released her from the oath of constancy , and made her free ! 
But it is in vain ! 
During this year I have striven with sorrow as a man , helpless in a desert , who writhes in the folds of the poisonous serpent . 
I should have gone mad if a consoling word from a great and noble mind had not roused me from my desolation , and if love had not shed a ray of light into my benighted soul . 
I listened no longer to sickening pride and humbled sense of honor . 
Love commanded me to come here , and I came to ask you , Marie , in the presence of your parents , if you will be my wife ; if you will accept my poor , insignificant name , and be contented by my side to lead a quiet , modest existence . 
I can only earn sufficient to assure us a peaceful life . 
I have no splendor , no treasures to offer you , but only my love , my heart , my life , my whole thought and being . 
Will you accept it , Marie ? '' 
`` I do accept it , Moritz , as the greatest happiness of my life . 
I desire only your love , and I can return only my love to you ! 
Here is my hand , Philip , it belongs to you alone ! 
Let us kneel in humility before my parents , and implore their blessing . 
-- Oh , my father and mother , have pity upon us ! 
See this dear man , to whom my whole heart belongs . 
I desire only to live and toil with him . 
There are no riches , no treasures , to compare with his love ! '' 
`` General and Frau von Werrig , grant me the wife of my heart ! '' 
cried Philip Moritz , deeply moved . 
`` It is true , I am not worthy of her , I have no name , no position , to offer her , but I swear to strive to gain it for her . 
I will win by my talents and knowledge a distinguished name , and perhaps one day you will concede to my fame that I am a noble man , though not a nobleman . 
Will you separate two hearts which belong to each other ? 
Take me for your son-in-law , and I swear to be devoted and faithful , to love and honor you for your daughter 's sake . 
I can say no more -- words can not express all that I feel . 
Love causes me to kneel before you , love makes me humble as a child . 
I implore you to give me your daughter in marriage . '' 
`` I also implore you , '' cried Marie , sinking down beside Moritz , `` give to me this man , whom I love and honor , for my husband . '' 
It was a beautiful and impressive scene -- these two young beings pleading for happiness ; their eyes flashing with the inspiration of feeling , conscious that they were one in affection , and ready to combat the whole world for each other . 
But Frau von Werrig was immovable , and the general was too much occupied with his gouty , throbbing leg even to cast a look upon the beautiful group of youth , love , manly determination , and tender resignation . 
Outside the door , Trude knelt imploringly , with folded hands , while the tears ran down her old cheeks in big drops . 
`` O God , I well know that they have no pity ; have mercy Thou , and cause my dear Marie to be happy ! 
Suffer not that that hard-hearted woman should sell her , and marry her to that bad man my Marie despises . 
I well know that I am a poor creature , and not worthy that Thou shouldst listen to me , O Lord ! 
But I love that young girl as if she were my own child , and I would give my heart 's blood for her . 
Oh , my God ! 
I implore Thee to let my Marie be happy ! '' 
Then she continued , as she rose from her knees . 
`` Now , I have spoken , and I commit every thing to God , and He will do what is best . 
She has been obliged to listen to him , and if it can not be otherwise , he must go . '' 
Carefully old Trude unlocked both doors , and then stopped to listen . 
Trude was right , there was no mercy in Frau von Werrig 's heart . 
`` Have you finished ? 
Have you any thing more to say ? '' 
she asked , in her most unsympathizing manner . 
`` Nothing more with our lips , but our hearts still implore you . '' 
`` I do not understand this language , sir , and you have not succeeded in giving me hearing , or ears to hear with . 
In this useless strife I will say a last word , which I hope will be for life . 
You shall never be the husband of my daughter ! 
You can never be united . '' 
Marie and Moritz sprang from their knees , laying their hands in each other 's , and looked what words could not have better expressed -- `` We are inseparable , nothing can disunite us but death ! '' 
`` I desire you not to interrupt me , '' commanded Frau von Werrig ; `` I have listened to you , and now you shall listen to me . 
I promise you to speak with more brevity than you have . 
I will not trouble you with useless phrases and tedious lamentations . 
I will speak to the point . 
Marie is the daughter of General Werrig von Leuthen , whose name would become extinct if the grace and favor of the king had not prevented it , by permitting the husband whom we have chosen for our daughter to take our name , and therewith become our son . 
You may think , in your arrogance of commoner , and the pride you take in having won the love of the daughter of General von Leuthen , that you could be this husband and son-in-law . 
But two things fail you : first , the necessary fortune ; and , secondly , the king 's consent , and that of her father . 
If you were rich , it might be possible that we should be touched by the tender amorousness of our daughter , and conquer our aversion to you for her sake . 
You are of low birth , and take a subordinate position in society . 
It would be extremely laughable for the schoolmaster Moritz to change suddenly into a Herr von Werrig Leuthen . 
Our son-in-law must be a rich man , in order to be able to give his new title consideration ; and , fortunately , the wooer of my daughter 's hand possesses this qualification , and therefore we have given our consent . 
The king has approved our choice , and permits the rich banker Ludwig Ebenstreit to become our son-in-law , and take our name . 
The king has in this communication , which lies upon the table , and which Marie has heard read , given his assurance to ennoble Ebenstreit upon two conditions : first , that the banker should give up his business , and live upon his income ; and , secondly , that the marriage should not take place until the papers of nobility are made out and published , so that the daughter of General von Werrig should not make a misalliance . 
You know all now , and you will at last understand that there is but one thing for you to do -- conquer your foolish presumption , and beg to be excused for your unheard-of boldness in forcing yourself into our house , and then withdraw quickly . 
If my ear does not deceive me , your accomplice has opened the doors . 
I think I heard rightly , if my heart has no ears , my head possesses better . 
We have finished . 
I would again enjoin upon you the duty of begging for pardon , and then I close this unrefreshing scene with the same words with which it opened -- there is the door -- go out ! '' 
`` Yes , there is the door -- go out of it ! 
I want to be quiet -- go ! 
My daughter is the betrothed of the rich banker Herr Ebenstreit ; she will be his wife as soon as the papers are made out and published . 
-- Go ! '' 
cried the general . 
The young couple still stood there , hand in hand , looking at the general , until now their eyes met , beaming with tenderest affection for each other . 
`` Is it true , Marie ? 
Speak , my beloved , is it true , will you be the wife of this rich man whom your parents have chosen for you ? '' 
`` No , Philip , '' she calmly and firmly replied . 
`` No , I will not , for I do not love him , I love only you ; and here , in the presence of God and my parents , I swear to you that I will be constant to death ! 
They can prevent my becoming your wife , but they can not force me to wed another . 
I swear , then , that if I can not be yours , I will never marry ! '' 
`` I receive your oath , and God has heard it also ! '' 
said Moritz , solemnly . 
`` I have also heard it , and I tell you , '' said Frau von Werrig , `` that this romantic heroine will become a perjurer , for I will find means to make her break her silly oath . '' 
`` We will , perhaps , find means to delay the marriage , '' said Moritz proudly , `` or , much more , prevent the marriage ceremony . '' 
`` I am very curious to know the means , '' said Frau von Werrig . 
`` From this hour Marie is the betrothed of Herr Ebenstreit , and the wedding will take place so soon -- '' `` So soon as the title of nobility is published . 
That is it , is the clause to be filled ; and therefore I tell you , beloved , wait and hope ! 
This woman is without pity and without mercy ; but God is in heaven , and Frederick the Great on the earth . 
Wait and hope . 
Be firm in hope , and constant in love . 
Do not lose courage , and let them force you to compliance by threats and anger . 
I have only you to confide in and to love in the world , and you are my hope , my goal , and the happiness of my life . 
If you forsake me , I lose my good angel , and am a lost , miserable man , whom it would be better to hurl into the deepest abyss than let him suffer the torments of hated existence . 
The knowledge of your love gives me strength and courage ; it will inspire me to fight like a hero , to win the dear , beloved wife , to whom I would yield my life in order to receive it anew from her purified and sanctified . 
The knowledge that I had lost you , would ruin me . '' 
Laying both hands upon his shoulder , Marie looked at him with eyes beaming with affection , renewing her vow that she would never love or marry another . 
`` We will be courageous in hope , and brave in constancy . 
Listen to me , my beloved ; listen , my mother -- I betrothed myself to this dear man ! 
You can prevent my becoming his wife now , but in four years I am of age , and then I shall be my own mistress . 
Then , my dear Philip , I will be your wife . 
Let us wait and hope ! '' 
`` Yes , Marie , we will wait and hope . 
-- Farewell ! 
Do not forget that there is a great God in heaven , and a great king upon earth . 
-- Farewell ! '' 
He pressed the hand clasped in his own passionately to his tips , and felt from the pressure of her delicate fingers a renewed vow of constancy . 
Buoyed with this hope in the sad hour of parting , they were happy and joyful . 
Marie accompanied him to the door -- still hand in hand . 
`` Presume not to go a step farther , '' commanded her mother , and Marie , obedient to her wishes , remained near the door , bowed to Moritz , and never ceased to regard him , with love beaming in her eyes , until the door closed . 
Outside stood old Trude , to tell him that she would be at the baker 's at seven o'clock every morning , and wait for his commissions , `` and may be I shall have something to bring you , '' she said . 
`` So do come ! '' 
`` I will , my good Trude ; you are the only person who is friendly to us . 
Watch over my angel , console her with your affection , and when they are too hard upon her , come to me . '' 
`` I surely will , but listen -- they are already quarrelling with my good angel . 
I will go in , to serve as a lightning-rod for dear Marie . 
I often do it , and it pleases me when the lightning strikes , and dashes my hard old head to the ground , but does not hurt me at all -- Farewell , Herr Moritz , the lightning-rod must go in . '' 
Trude entered suddenly and noiselessly the sitting-room , and interrupted the angry reproaches which Frau von Werrig hurled against Marie in a furious stream of words . 
The countess 's rage turned against Trude , who stared as if to challenge her . 
`` What do you want ? 
How dare you enter uncalled ? '' 
`` I thought you were calling deaf old Trude , or why did you scream so ? '' 
replied Trude , tartly . 
`` Perhaps it was the general . 
Ah ! 
there lies the poor , dear old man , groaning and crying , and nobody has any pity for him . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Trude , it is good luck that you are here , '' whined the general . 
`` No one troubles himself about me . 
Quick , bring warm covering for my leg , the pain is fearful ! '' 
`` Poor , dear father , I will take care of you , I will nurse you , '' said Marie , hastening to him . 
Her mother pushed her back violently . 
`` Not a step farther ; you have no right to go near him , you are his murderess . 
On your head will fall the guilt , if these dreadful scenes should cause his death . '' 
`` No , no , the general will not die quite yet , '' said Trude busying herself about his arm-chair . 
`` But , Fraulein , you have got something else to do than stay here . 
They have already sent for the flowers twice , and the French lady is waiting up-stairs to parlez-vous . '' 
Marie looked her friendly thanks , and quietly and quickly left the room . 
`` Now , bold woman , I have a last word to say to you . 
Who locked the door when that creature came ? '' 
`` I , madame , '' answered Trude , who was just bringing a great cushion from the back-room to cover the general 's feet . 
`` You acknowledge that you locked the door intentionally ? '' 
`` Now , my dear , good Frau von Werrig , one does not lock a door by mistake . 
I did not want Herr Moritz to run away with fright , before you had given him your mind , and set his head straight . 
He would certainly have escaped , and only heard the half of your beautiful talk , for he had no idea what a miserable fellow he is . 
So I locked both doors , and he was obliged to listen to you , and has gone away contrite and repentant . 
There , there , my poor , dear general , is your foot high enough ? 
Shall I not bring the foot-warmer ? '' 
`` You shall not bring any thing , nor do any thing more . 
You are a hypocrite , who connives with Moritz . 
Leave my house this very hour ! 
You are dismissed my service . 
Go pack up your things and be off ! '' 
cried Frau von Werrig . 
`` Oh , do not go , Trude , for mercy 's sake , for then I have no one to help me , '' cried the general . 
`` I can not do otherwise , she has given me my dismissal . '' 
Trude approached Frau von Werrig respectfully , saying , `` So I must pack up and go away at once ? '' 
`` Immediately , you deceitful creature ! '' 
`` Immediately ! 
but Frau von Werrig will be so good as to give me my wages . '' 
`` Yes , '' she answered in a slower and more subdued voice . 
`` That shall be done presently . '' 
`` It will not be so very difficult to reckon them , I have been here twenty years ; just as many years as Marie is old , for I came as child 's nurse , and have helped her learn to talk and walk , and played mother to the dear child a bit . 
Then I obtained my wages , for they were good times ; but the pension-time came , and we had no cook or servant but me . 
` The rats run away if the ship springs a leak , ' but the old mole Trude stayed . 
Mankind is in the world to work , I said , and why should not I be the cook and waiting-maid too , that my little Marie should not want any thing ? 
So I became maid-of-all-work and have stayed here ever since . 
Then , you told me you would double my wages , and give me twenty thalers a year , and four thalers at Christmas . 
Is it not so , Frau von Werrig ? '' 
`` I believe that was the agreement . '' 
`` I am quite certain about it , '' cried the general , who began to understand the drift of Trude . 
`` Yes , Trude was to have twenty thalers a year , and we are owing her many years ' wages . 
You know , wife , I have always kept an account-book for the debts , and only a few days ago -- Oh ! 
oh ! 
the pain ! 
Trude , help me cover up the foot warmer ! 
-- we reckoned it up a few days ago , and we owe Trude one hundred and thirty thalers . '' 
`` One hundred and thirty thalers , '' repeated Trude , clapping her hands , astonished . 
`` Is it true ? 
oh , that is splendid . 
I shall be rich , and get a husband yet . 
I pray you give it to me , Frau von Werrig , right away . '' 
`` Not so quickly , '' said she , proudly . 
`` We will reckon together how much you have saved -- because -- '' `` Oh ! '' 
interrupted Trude , `` how good you are to make me keep so much ; you are my savings bank , where I can deposit my money . '' 
`` Because , '' she continued , with emphasis , without noticing the interruption , `` our future son-in-law will pay your wages , the rich banker , Herr Ebenstreit . 
Yes , the wealthy lover of our daughter . 
At the moment I have not so much cash in the house . '' 
`` Your grace will allow me to stay until Herr Ebenstreit is married , and , in your name , pays me my wages ? '' 
`` Yes , Trude , I will allow you to stay , '' she replied , very graciously . 
`` You will be cunning , Trude , if you try to persuade Marie to accept the rich suitor , for when she does I will give you two hundred thalers . '' 
`` I will do all I can to get it . 
Can I remain here until Marie is married ? '' 
`` Yes , you have my permission for that . '' 
`` I thank you , Frau von Werrig . 
Now , general , I will bring you some warm coverings right away . '' 
`` Now tell me , Wolf , '' asked Duke Charles Augustus , stretching himself comfortably on the sofa , puffing clouds of smoke from his pipe -- `` are you not weary of dawdling about in this infamously superb pile of stones , called Berlin ? 
Shall we any longer elegantly scrape to the right and to the left , with abominable sweet speeches and mere flattering phraseology , in this monster of dust and stone , of sand and sun , parades and gaiters ? 
Have you not enough of blustering generals , of affected women ? 
and of running about the streets like one possessed to see here a miserable church , or there a magnificent palace ? 
Are you not weary of crawling about as one of the many , while at home you stride about as the only one of the many ? 
And weary also of seeing your friend and pupil Carl August put off with fair promises and hollow speeches like an insignificant , miserable mortal , without being able to answer with thundering invectives . 
Ah ! 
breath fails me . 
I feel as if I could load a pistol with myself , and with a loud report shoot over to dear Weimar . 
Wolf , do talk , I beg you , I am tired out ; answer me . '' 
`` I reply , I shoot , my dear Carl , '' cried Goethe , laughing . 
`` I was out of breath myself from that long speech . 
Was it original with my dear prince , or did he memorize it from Klinger 's great ` Sturm-und-Drang ' tragedy ? 
It reminded me of it . '' 
`` Do you mean to accuse me of plagiarism , wicked fellow ? 
I grant that you are right , my cunning Wolf , it was a lapsus . 
I did think of Klinger , and I sympathized with his youthful hero Wild , who declared that , among the sweetest pleasures , he would like to be stretched over a drum , or exist in a pistol-barrel , the hand ready to blow him into the air . '' 
Goethe shoved aside the breakfast-table , straightened his delicate form , with his noble head proudly erect , and one foot in advance , extended his right arm , giving one loud hurrah ! 
`` Now , for once , a tumult and noise , that thought may turn about like a weathercock . 
This savage noise has already wrought its own benefit . 
I begin to feel a little better . 
Rage and expand , mad heart , quicken yourself in hurly-burly-burly-burly ! '' 
-LSB- Footnote : From Klinger 's tragedy `` Sturm und Drang . '' -RSB- 
`` Bravo ! 
bravo ! '' 
laughed the duke . 
`` Is that Klinger , or who is it that refreshes himself in hurly-burly ? '' 
`` It is I who am every thing , '' replied Goethe , striding and swaggering up and down . 
`` I was an assistant , in order to be something -- lived upon the Alps , tended the goats , lay under the vault of heaven day and night , refreshed by the cool pastures , and burned with the inward fire . 
No peace , no rest anywhere . 
See , I swell with power and health ! 
I can not waste myself away . 
I would take part in the campaign here ; then can my soul expand , and if they do me the service to shoot me down , well and good ! '' 
-LSB- Footnote : From Klinger 's tragedy `` Sturm und Drang . '' -RSB- 
`` Bravo ! 
Wild , bravo ! '' 
cried the duke . 
`` Hei ! 
that thundered and rolled , and struck fire ! 
It does me good to hear such vigorous words from an able rare genius in the midst of this miserable , starched elegance . 
The powerful Germans are healthy fellows . 
Something of the Promethean fire blazes forth in them . 
They were forced to come , those jolly , uproarious boys , after the affected cue period ; they were the full , luxurious plants , and my Wolfgang , the favorite of my heart , my poet and teacher , is the divine blossom of this plant . 
Let them prevail , these ` Sturmer und Dranger , ' for they are the fathers and brothers of my Wolfgang . 
Do me the sole pleasure not to refine yourself too much , but let this divine fire burst forth in volcanic flames , and leave the thundering crater uncovered . 
Sometimes when I see you so simpering , so modest and ceremonious , I ask myself , with anxiety , if it is the same Wolfgang Goethe , who used to drink ` Smollis ' with me at merry bacchanals out of death-skulls ? 
-- the same with whom I used to practise whip-cracking upon the market-place hours long , to the terror of the good citizens ? 
-- the same who used to dance so nimbly the two-steps , and was inexhaustible in mad pranks . 
Now tell me , Herr Wolfgang , are you yourself , or are you another ? '' 
`` I am myself , and not myself , '' answered Goethe , smiling . 
`` There still remains a good portion of folly in me , and it must sometimes thunder and flash , but I hope the atmosphere of my soul will become clearer , and over the crater a more lovely garden will spread out , in which beautiful , fragrant flowers will bloom , useful and profitable for my friends and myself . 
Sometimes I long for this as for the promised land ; then again it foams and thunders in me like fermenting must , which , defying all covers and hoops , would froth up to heaven in an immense source of mad excitement ! '' 
`` Let it froth and foam , and spring the covers , and burst the old casks , '' cried the duke ; `` I delight in it , and every infernal noise you make , the prouder I am to recognize that from this foaming must will clear itself a marvellous wine , a delicious beverage for gods and men , with which the world will yet refresh itself , when we are long gone to the kingdom of shades -- to the something or nothing . 
You know , Wolf , I love you , and I am proud that I have you ! 
It is true that I possess only a little duchy , but it is large enough to lead an agreeable and comfortable existence -- large enough for a little earthly duke , and the great king of intellects , Johann Wolfgang Goethe . 
Let us return to our dear home , for I acknowledge to you I sigh for Weimar . 
I long for the dear little place , where every one knows me and greets me , and even for my dogs and horses . '' 
`` And I , '' said Goethe , `` I really mourn for my Tusculum , which I owe to the generous , kind duke ; for the balcony of my little cottage , where , canopied by the blue , starry vault of heaven , I dream away the lonely May nights . '' 
`` Is there nothing else you sigh for but the summer-house at Weimar ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
cried Goethe , and an indescribable expression of rapture and delight was manifest in his whole manner . 
`` No , why should I deny it , how could I ? 
It would be treason to the Highest and most Glorious . 
No , I long for my muse , my mistress , my -- '' `` Beloved ! '' 
interrupted the duke . 
`` I pray you not to be so prudish , so reserved . 
Have the courage to snap your fingers at this infamously deceitful moral code , and proud and distinguished as you are , elevate yourself above what these miserable earthworms call morality . 
For the eagle there is a different law than for the pigeon . 
If the eagle soars aloft through the ether to his eyry , bearing a lamb in his powerful claws , has he not a right to it -- the right of superiority and power by God 's grace ? 
Has he not as much right to the lamb as the pigeon to the pea which she finds in the dust ? 
If the pigeon by chance sees the eagle with his lamb , she cries , ` Zeter ! 
mordio ! ' 
with the pea in her own bill , as if she were in a position to judge the eagle . '' 
`` A beautiful picture , '' cried Goethe , joyfully -- `` a picture that would inspire me to indite a poem . '' 
`` Write one , and call it for a souvenir ` The Eagle and the Dove . ' 
Make it a reality , my eagle youth , bear off the white lamb to your eyry , and let the world , with its affected morality , say what it likes . 
How can you bear to see the one you love at the side of another man ? 
Tell me , confess to me , is not the beautiful Charlotte von Stein your beloved ? '' 
`` Not in the sense you mean , duke , not in the vulgar sense of the word . 
I love her , I adore her , with a pure and holy sentiment . 
I would not that Charlotte should have cause to blush before her children on my account . 
She would be desecrated to me if I , in my inmost soul , could imagine the blush of shame upon her cheek , or that her eye could brighten at other than great , beautiful , and noble acts . 
I adore her , and to me she is the ideal of the purest and sweetest womanhood . 
I rejoice that she is as she is , like clear mountain crystal -- transparent and so brightly pure , that one could mirror himself therein . 
She stands above all other women , and to her belong all my thoughts , and would , even if I were wedded to another . 
To me she is the most beautiful of the beautiful , the purest of the pure , the most graceful of the graceful , and all my thoughts are in perfect harmony with hers . 
Now , duke , if it is agreeable to you , knowing my feelings , to call Charlotte von Stein my beloved , she is so in the most elevated sense of the word . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you poets , you poets , '' sighed the duke , smiling . 
`` A streak of madness in you all , though I will grant that it is divine . '' 
`` Say rather that Whit-Sunday comes to us every day , and the divine Spirit descends daily upon us poets , and causes us to speak in unknown tongues . '' 
`` I will say that you are the god Apollo descended from heaven , and with gods one may not dare to dispute . 
They act differently in their sphere than we mortals upon earth . 
I will be contented if our ways cross from time to time , and we can once in a while walk on together a good piece the way of life in friendship and harmony . 
If it would please my Wolf , I propose to turn toward beloved Weimar , the dear place , half village , half city . 
For my part I am finished here , my business with General von Mollendorf is accomplished . 
As I told you previously , I have had made known to the king my refusal to allow recruiting in my duchy . 
I could not consent for the present . 
In short , I have spoken as my secretary Wolfgang Goethe has recorded . 
-LSB- Footnote : This memorial upon recruiting is found . 
`` Correspondence of the Grand Duke Carl August and Goethe , '' part , i. , p. 4 . -RSB- 
General Mollendorf has waived his demand for the present -- and to-day we have had the concluding conference , and if it is agreeable to my secretary , we might set off this afternoon and pass a day at Dessau , and then on to Weimar . '' 
`` Oh , gladly will I do it ; it seems as if a star from heaven had twinkled to me to follow it , for at Weimar is centred all my happiness ! 
I prefer a lowly cabin there to all the splendor and palaces of a city . '' 
`` Then you agree with me , that this magnificently vile Berlin does not enchain you in her magic net ? '' 
`` No , she holds me not , though it has been pleasant to take a peep into it -LRB- like a child into a curiosity-box -RRB- . 
I have seen ` Old Fritz . ' 
His character , his gold , and his silver , his marbles , his apes and parrots , and even his town curtains please me . 
It is pleasant to be at the seat of war at the very moment that it threatens to break forth . 
It has gratified me to witness the splendor of the royal city , the life , order , and abundance , that would be nothing if thousands of men were not ready to be sacrificed ; the medley of men , carriages , horses , artillery , and all the arrangements . 
All are mere pins in the great clock-work , only puppets whose motion is received from the great cylinder , Fredericus Rex , who indicates to each one the melody they must play , according to one of the thousand pins in the rotary beam . '' 
-LSB- Footnote : Goethe 's own words . 
-- See Goethe 's `` Correspondence with Frau von Stein , '' part i. , p. 168 . 
Riemer , `` Communications about Goethe , '' part ii. , p. 60 . -RSB- 
`` You are right to compare the great man to the chief cylinder in the machine of state , '' nodded the duke `` He rules and sets all in motion , and cares not whether the rabble are suited or not . 
It has enraged me sometimes to hear the fellows curse him , and yet I acted as if I heard them not . 
Let us return to Weimar -- mankind seems better there , Wolf . '' 
`` At any rate , more regardful of us than they are here , duke . 
The greater the world the uglier the farce ; no obscenities and fooleries of the buffoon are more disgusting than the characters of the great , mediocre and insignificant , all mingled together . 
I prayed this morning for courage to hold out to the end , and to hasten the consummation . 
I am grateful for the benefit of the journey -- but I pray the gods not to conduct themselves toward us as their image-man , for I should swear to them eternal hatred . ''

`` Then you are ready to depart , Wolf ? '' 
`` Almost , dear Carl , or , if you will it , quite ready . 
A few visits I would make , that the people shall not be too severe upon me and cry out against my pride and arrogance . '' 
`` Because they themselves are proud and supercilious , they are bold enough to suppose Wolfgang Goethe is like them . 
I hope you will not visit the very learned Herr Nicolai , the insipid prosaist , the puffed-up rationalist , who believes that his knowledge permits him to penetrate every thing , and who is a veritable ass . '' 
`` No , I am not going to Nicolai , Rammler , or Engel , or , as they should be named , the wise authors of Berlin . 
I shall visit the artist Chodowiecki , good Karschin , occasional poetess , and the philosopher Mendelssohn . 
Then , if it pleases you , we will set out this afternoon , shaking the sand of Berlin from our feet . '' 
`` I shall prepare whilst you make your visits . 
Will you take my carriage ? 
You know there is one from the royal stables always at my service , which stands at the door . '' 
`` Beware ! 
they would shriek if I should drive to their doors in a royal carriage . 
They would accuse me of throwing aside the poet , and being only secretary of legation . 
I will go on foot ; it amuses me to push my way through the crowd , and listen to the Berlin jargon . '' 
Taking leave of his ducal friend , Goethe betook himself the street , to commence his visits . 
Going first to Chodowiecki , the renowned delineator and engraver , whose fame had already spread throughout Germany . 
When Goethe entered , the artist was busy in his atelier , working upon the figures of the characters in the `` Mimic , '' the latest work of Professor Engel . 
`` Master , '' said he , smilingly , extending him his hand , `` I have come to thank you for many beautiful , happy hours which I owe to you . 
You paint with the chisel and poetize with the brush . 
An artist by God 's grace . '' 
`` If the poet Goethe says that , there must be something in it , '' replied Chodowiecki , with a radiant face . 
`` I have to thank you for the most beautiful and best hours of my life , and I am proud and delighted to have been able in the least to return the pleasure . 
The only blissful tears among many bitter ones that I have wept , were shed over the ` Sorrows of Werther . ' 
` Gotz von Berlichingen ' so inspired me that he appeared to me in my dreams , and left me no peace until I rose in the night to draw Gotz , as he sat talking with brother Martin on the bench in the forest . 
Wait , I will show you the drawing ; you must see it . '' 
Goethe examined it attentively , and expressed his pleasure at the correctness and dramatical conception of the design , and did not remark , or perhaps would not , that the artist was busily occupied with crayon and paper . 
`` How wonderfully you have reproduced my ` German Knight , ' '' cried Goethe , after a long observation of it . 
`` The middle ages entire , proud and full of strength , are mirrored in this figure , and if I had not written ` Gotz von Berlichingen , ' I would have been inspired to it , perhaps , from this drawing . 
Oh ! 
you artists are to be envied . 
We need many thousand words to express what a few lines represent , and a stroke suffices to change a smiling face into a weeping one . 
How feeble is language , and how mighty the pencil ! 
I wish I had the talent to be a painter ! '' 
`` And I , '' cried Chodowiecki , `` would throw all my pencils , brushes , and chisels to the devil , or sell him my soul , if I could cope with the genius and intellect of the poet , Wolfgang Goethe . 
What a man ! 
What a profile the gods have given him ! 
There ! 
look -- have you ever seen a man with such a face ? '' 
He handed Goethe the drawing , which proved to be a speaking profile-portrait of himself , dashed off with a few strokes full of genius . 
Goethe looked at it with the air of a critic . 
`` It is true , '' said he , perfectly serious , `` there are not many such profiles , but I am not of your opinion that the gods fashioned it . 
Those sharp features look as if the joiner had cut them out of oak , and they lead me to infer a very disagreeable character . 
I naturally do not know who the picture represents , but I must tell you , master , that this man could never please me , although I could swear it is a speaking likeness . 
This sharp , bowed nose has something impudent , self-sufficient in it . 
The brow is indeed high , which betokens thought , but the retreating lines prove that the thoughts only commence , and then lose themselves in a maze . 
The mouth , with its pouting lips , has an insupportable expression of stupid good-nature and sentimentality ; and the well-defined , protruding chin might belong to the robber-captain Cartouche . 
The great wide-open eyes , with their affected passionate glances , prove what a puffed-up dandy the man must be , who perhaps imagines all the women in love with his face . 
No , no , I am still of the opinion that the original could never please me , and if the physiognomist Lavater should see it , he would say : ` That is the portrait of a puffed-up , quaint , powerful genius , who imagines himself something important , and who is nothing ! 
The likeness of a bombastic fellow , with an empty head behind the pretentious brow , and meaningless phrases on the thick lips . ' ''
