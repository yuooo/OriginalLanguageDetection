A young man with a blue head-piece , and a red and white scarf about his waist , stepped forward , obliged the travelers to dismount , and with a great display of zeal led them to the chief . 
The merchant still held the reins in his hand , and whispered to Anton that he was on no account to lose sight of the carriage . 
Anton pretended the utmost unconcern , and pressed a coin into the hand of the friendly krakuse , who had crept behind the carriage , that he might go and get the horses a bundle of hay . 
The sentry was in a house whose thatched roof had been dignified by the whitewashing of the walls . 
A few muskets and guns leaned up against it , watched by a youthful volunteer in blue coat and red cap . 
Near at hand sat the commanding officer , whose flat face was surmounted by an immense white plume , and whose person was adorned by an enormous white scarf , and a sword with elaborate hilt . 
This dignitary was considerably excited when he beheld the strangers ; he clapped his hat more firmly on his head , stroked his unkempt beard , and began to give audience . 
After a few preliminary remarks , the travelers told him that they had weighty business to transact with the heads of the government . 
They refused , however , to give any account of its purport . 
This statement wounded the dignity of the authority before them . 
He made harsh allusions to suspicious characters and spies , and called to his guard to stand to their arms . 
Instantly five youths in blue caps rushed out of the house , ranged themselves in order , and were commanded to hold their guns in readiness . 
Involuntarily Anton sprang between them and his principal . 
Meanwhile the man of the giant sword , on seeing that the merchant still stood quietly by the post round which he had fastened the reins , changed his murderous intent , contenting himself with assuring him that he considered him a very dangerous character , and was much inclined to shoot him as a traitor . 
The merchant shrugged his shoulders , and said , with calm politeness , `` You are entirely mistaken as to the object of our journey . 
You can not seriously believe us to be spies , for we have just been brought to you by one of your own people , in order that we might obtain from your kindness a convoy to the capital . 
I must once more request you not to detain us , as our business with the government is of a pressing nature , and I shall be obliged to make you responsible for all unnecessary delay . '' 
This address led to another volley of oaths on the part of the man in authority , who snorted violent defiance against the travelers , drank off a large glass of brandy , and finally came to a decision . 
He called three of his men , and desired them to take their seats in the carriage , and to convey it to the capital . 
A bundle of fresh straw was thrown in , two youths with arms in their hands placed themselves behind the travelers , while a white-frocked peasant sat on the box , took the reins , and indifferently drove the whole cargo , suspicious characters , patriots , and all , at a gallop toward the capital . 
`` Our condition has changed for the worse , '' said Anton . 
`` Five men in this little carriage , and the poor horses tired already . '' 
`` I told you , '' replied the merchant , `` that our journey would have some inconveniences . 
Men are never more troublesome than when they play at being soldiers . 
In other respects , this guard over us does no harm ; at least , with such an escort , we are sure to be admitted into the city . '' 
It was evening when they reached the capital . 
A red glare in the sky showed them their goal while they were still far from it . 
As they approached , they met numerous companies of armed men moving in and out . 
Next came a long detention at the gates -- an interchange of questions and answers -- an examination of the travelers by the aid of lanterns and pine torches , angry looks , and even intelligible threats , and , finally , a long drive through the streets of the old capital . 
Sometimes all around them was still as death ; sometimes a wild cry resounded from the crowd , all the more alarming because the words were not understood . 
At length the driver turned into a square , and stopped before a handsome house . 
The travelers were surrounded and pushed up a broad staircase by a crowd of gay uniforms , laced coats , and clean smock frocks . 
Next they were thrust into a large apartment , and placed before a gentleman wearing white silk gloves , who looked into a written report , and briefly informed them that , according to the report of the commandant at the station , they were suspected of being spies , and were to undergo a court-martial . 
The merchant at once broke out in high displeasure : `` I am sorry that your informant should have told you a great falsehood , for we have undertaken this journey on the highway and in broad daylight , for the express purpose of speaking to your governors . 
The horses and carriage which brought me here are both mine , and it was an uncalled-for act of politeness on the part of your commandant to furnish me with an escort . 
I wish to see the gentleman in command here as soon as possible ; it is to him alone that I mean to impart the motive of my journey ; be so good , therefore , as to hand him my passport . '' 
The official examined the passport , and , looking at Anton , proceeded to inquire , with somewhat more consideration , `` But this gentleman ? 
He has the appearance of an officer in your army . '' 
`` I am a clerk of Mr. Schr√∂ter 's , '' returned Anton , with a bow ; `` and out and out a civilian . '' 
`` Wait a while , '' said the young man , superciliously , going with the passport into a neighboring room . 
As he remained away some time , and no one interfered with the travelers , they sat down on a bench , and tried to appear as unconcerned as possible . 
Anton first cast an anxious glance at his principal , who was looking down gloomily , and then gazed about him in amazement . 
The room in which they were was lofty , and the ceiling much ornamented , but the walls were dirty and smoke-stained ; tables , chairs , and benches stood about in confusion , and seemed as if just brought in from the nearest tavern . 
A few writers bent over their papers , while soldiers sat or lay along the walls , asleep or talking loudly , several of them in French . 
A room like this , dimly lighted , was not calculated to make a cheerful impression upon Anton , who whispered to the merchant , `` If revolutions in general look like this , they are ugly things . '' 
`` They always destroy , and seldom recreate , '' was the reply . 
`` I am afraid that this room is an emblem of the whole town : the painted coat of arms on the ceiling , and the dirty bench on which we are sitting . 
When such contrasts as these are brought into juxtaposition , it is enough to make a sober-minded man cross himself in horror . 
The nobles and the people are bad enough , taken separately , when they each try their hands at government ; but when they unite , they are sure to bring down the house that holds them . '' 
`` The nobles are the most troublesome , '' said Anton . 
`` Commend me to our krakuse ; he was a polite insurgent , and knew the value of a half dollar ; but these gentlemen seem to have no business notions at all . '' 
`` Let us wait a little , '' said the principal . 
A quarter of an hour had passed , when a young man , tall in stature and stately in aspect , followed by the white-gloved gentleman , politely approached the merchant , saying so loudly that even the sleepers could hardly fail to hear , `` I rejoice to see you here , and have indeed been expecting it ; have the goodness to follow me with your companion . '' 
`` By Jove , we are looking up ! '' 
thought Anton . 
They followed their majestic guide into a small corner room , which was evidently the boudoir of the quarters , for it contained an ottoman , easy chairs , and a handsome writing-table . 
Different uniforms and articles of dress were carelessly thrown upon the furniture ; and on the table lay , in the midst of papers , a pair of double-barreled pocket pistols , and a large seal richly set in gold . 
While Anton was noticing that the whole room was very elegant , but , at the same time , very untidy , the young chief turned to the merchant and said , with somewhat more reserve and less amenity , `` You have , through a misunderstanding , been exposed to some rudeness , as is indeed often unavoidable in troubled times . 
Your escort has confirmed your statements . 
I now beg you to impart to me the reason of your visit . '' 
The merchant accordingly briefly but precisely explained the purpose of his journey , named those men in the place with whom he was connected in business , and appealed to them to ratify his statements . 
`` I know both those gentlemen , '' answered the officer , carelessly . 
Then looking fixedly at the merchant , he asked , after a pause , `` Have you nothing further to communicate ? '' 
The principal said he had not ; but the other rapidly continued , `` I quite understand that our peculiar position prevents your government from treating with us directly , and that , in the event of your being charged with a commission , you must proceed with the utmost caution . '' 
Here the merchant hastily interrupted him . 
`` Before you say more , I again assure you , as a man of honor , that I am come merely on my own business , and that my business is only what I have already stated . 
But as I conclude from your words , as well as much that I have heard on my way hither , that you take me for a delegate , I feel constrained to tell you that I never could have been charged with any commission such as you seem to expect , its very existence being an utter impossibility . '' 
The noble looked grave , and said , after a moment 's silence , `` Very well ; you shall not suffer on that account . 
The wish that you express is so singular , that it would be impossible , in the common course of things , to grant it . 
If we are not permitted to consider you a friend , the rules of war command us to deal with you and yours as enemies . 
But the men of my nation have ever possessed , in taking up arms , the rare virtue of trusting to the virtue of others , as well as of acting nobly , even when they could expect no gratitude in return . 
Be assured that I will , as far as in me lies , assist you to recover your property . '' 
So said the nobleman with self-conscious dignity ; and Anton was keenly alive to the true nobility of the words , though too thoroughly a man of business to give himself up to the impression they made , his budding enthusiasm being frostbitten by a very matter-of-fact thought : `` He promises to help us , and yet he is not quite convinced that the property we wish to carry off is of right our own . '' 
`` I am not , alas ! 
so absolute , '' continued the chief , `` as to be able to gratify you at once . 
However , I hope in the morning to furnish you with a pass for your wagons . 
First of all , try to find out where your property now is , and I will send one of my officers with you as a protection . 
The rest to-morrow . '' 
With these words the travelers were courteously dismissed ; and as Anton went out he saw the officer wearily throw himself back into an easy-chair , and with bent head begin to play with the trigger of his pistols . 
A slight youth , with a large scarf , almost a child in years , but of a most noble bearing , accompanied our friends . 
As they left the house , they were politely saluted by several present , and it was plain that the ante-chamber still believed in their diplomatic character . 
The officer inquired whether he should accompany the gentlemen , as it was his duty not to lose sight of them . 
`` Is this by way of protection or surveillance ? '' 
inquired Anton , who now felt in good spirits . 
`` You will give me no occasion , I am sure , to exercise the latter , '' returned the small warrior in exquisite French . 
`` No , '' said the merchant , looking kindly at the youth ; `` but we shall weary you , for we have yet to get through a good deal of uninteresting and commonplace business this evening . '' 
`` I am only doing my duty , '' replied their escort , with some haughtiness , `` in accompanying you wherever you wish . '' 
`` And in order to do ours , we must make all the haste we can , '' said the merchant . 
And so they traversed the streets of the capital . 
Night had set in , and the confusion and bustle seemed sadder still under her cloak . 
Crowds of the lowest of the populace , patrols of military , bands of fugitive peasantry jostled each other , snatching , shrieking , cursing . 
Many windows were illuminated , and their brilliance cast a shadowless , ghostly glare over the streets . 
Thick red clouds rolled above the roofs of the houses , for one of the suburbs was on fire , and the wind blew swarms of golden sparks and burning splinters over the heads of the travelers . 
Meanwhile the bells of the churches kept up a monotonous tolling . 
The strangers hurried silently along , the imperious tones of their escort always making way for them through the most unruly throng . 
At length they reached the house of the agent of their firm . 
It was shut up , and they had to knock long and loud before a window was opened , and a piteous voice heard asking who was there . 
When they entered the agent ran to meet them , wringing his hands , and tearfully falling on the merchant 's neck . 
The presence of the young insurgent prevented him from expressing his feelings . 
He threw open the nearest door , and in lamentable tones apologized for the exceeding disorder in which the room was . 
Chests and coffers were being packed up ; male and female servants were running to and fro , hiding silver candlesticks here , thrusting in silver spoons there . 
Meanwhile the master of the house never left off wringing his hands , lamenting his misfortunes and those of the firm , welcoming , and , in the same breath , regretting the arrival of the principal , and every now and then assuring the young officer , with choking voice , that he too was a patriot , and that it was only owing to an unaccountable mistake on the part of one of the maids that the cockade had been taken off his hat . 
It was plain that the man and his whole family had quite lost their wits . 
The merchant had much trouble before he could get him into a corner and hear some business details . 
It appeared that the wagons had arrived in town on the very day that the insurrection broke out . 
Through the foresight of one of the wagoners , they had been taken into the great court-yard of a remote inn , but as to what had become of them since then the agent knew nothing . 
After some further conversation the merchant said , `` We shall not claim your hospitality to-night ; we shall sleep wherever our wagons are . '' 
All the persuasions of the agent were peremptorily rejected . 
This worthy but weak man seemed really distressed at the new danger into which his friend was determined to run . 
`` I shall call you up early , '' said the merchant , as he left ; `` I propose setting out to-morrow with my wagons , but first I wish to make a few , as you know , necessary visits to our customers , and to have your company during them . '' 
The agent promised to do his best by daylight . 
Again our travelers went forth into the night , accompanied by the Pole , who had scornfully listened to the half-whispered conversation . 
As they went along the street , the principal , angrily throwing away his cigar , said to Anton , `` Our friend will be of little use to us ; he is helpless as a child . 
In the beginning of the disturbance , he neglected to do his duty -- to collect money , and seek for reimbursement . '' 
`` And now , '' said Anton , sorrowfully , `` no one will be inclined to pay or reimburse us . '' 
`` And yet we must bring this about to-morrow , and you shall help me to do so . 
By heaven , these warlike convulsions are in themselves inconvenient enough to trade without this addition , paralyzing as they do all useful activity , which is the only thing that prevents us from becoming mere animals . 
But if a man of business allows himself to be more crushed than is absolutely unavoidable , he does an injury to civilization -- an injury for which there is no compensation . '' 
They had now reached a part of the town where empty streets , and the silence of the grave immediately at hand , only enhanced the horrors of the distant clamor and the red glare in the sky . 
At length they stopped before a low building with a large gateway . 
Entering , they looked into the bar , a dirty room with blackened rafters , in which loud-voiced and brandy-drinking patriots clustered on bench and table . 
The young officer called for the landlord . 
A fat figure with a red face appeared . 
`` In the name of the government , rooms for myself and my companions , '' said the young man . 
The host sullenly took up a bundle of rusty keys and a tallow candle , and led them to an upper floor , where he opened the door of a damp room , and morosely declared that he had no other for them . 
`` Bring us supper and a bottle of your best wine , '' said the merchant ; `` we pay well , and at once . '' 
This announcement occasioned a visible improvement in the mood of the fat landlord , who even made an unsuccessful attempt to be polite . 
The merchant next asked for the wagons and wagoners . 
These questions were evidently unwelcome . 
At first Boniface pretended to know nothing about them , declaring that there were a great many wagons coming and going in his court-yard , and that there were several wagoners too , but that he did not know them . 
It was in vain that the merchant tried to make him understand the object of his coming ; the landlord remained obtuse , and was about to relapse into his former moroseness , when the young Pole came forward , and informed Mr. Schr√∂ter that this was not the way of dealing with such people . 
He then faced the landlord , called him all manner of hard names , and declared that he would arrest and carry him off on the spot unless he at once gave the most exact information . 
The landlord looked timidly at the officer , and begged to be allowed to retire and send up one of the wagoners . 
Soon a lanky figure with a brown felt hat came lumbering up stairs , started at the sight of the merchant , and at last announced , with pretended cheerfulness , that there he was . 
`` Where are the wagons ? 
where are the bills of lading ? '' 
The wagons were in the court-yard . 
The bills were reluctantly produced from the dirty leather purse of the wagoner . 
`` You guarantee me that your load remains complete and undisturbed ? '' 
asked the merchant . 
The felt hat ungraciously replied that he could do nothing of the kind . 
The horses had been unharnessed and hid in a secret stable , that they might not be confiscated by the government ; as to the fate of the wagons , he could neither prevent nor ascertain it , and all responsibility ceased in troublous times like these . 
`` We are in a den of thieves , '' said the merchant to his escort ; `` I must request your assistance in bringing these people to reason . '' 
Now bringing people to reason was just what the young Pole believed to be his speciality ; so , with a smile , he took a pistol in one hand , and said aside to Anton , `` Do as I , and have the goodness to follow me . '' 
Next he seized the wagoner by the throat , and dragged him down the stair . 
`` Where is the landlord ? '' 
cried he , in the most formidable tone he could raise . 
`` The dog of a landlord and a lantern ! '' 
The lantern being brought , he drove the whole pack -- the strangers , the fat landlord , the captured wagoner , and all others assembled by the noise , before him into the court-yard . 
Arrived there , he placed himself and his prisoner in the centre of the circle , bestowed a few more injurious epithets upon the landlord , rapped the wagoner on the head with his pistol , and then courteously observed in French to the merchant , `` This fellow 's skull sounds remarkably hollow ; what next do you require from the boobies ? '' 
`` Have the goodness to summon the wagoners . '' 
`` Good , '' said the Pole ; `` and then ? '' 
`` Then I will examine the freight of the wagons , if it be possible to do so in the dark . '' 
`` Every thing is possible , '' said the Pole , `` if you like to take the trouble to search through the old canvas in the night . 
But I should be inclined to advise a bottle of Sauterne and a few hours ' repose instead . 
In times like these , one should not lose an opportunity of refreshing one 's self . '' 
`` I should prefer to inspect the wagons at once , '' said the merchant , with a smile , `` if you have no objection to it . '' 
`` I am on duty , '' replied the Pole , `` therefore let 's to work at once ; there are plenty of hands here to hold lights for you . 
You confounded rascals , '' continued he , in Polish , again cuffing the wagoner and threatening the landlord , `` I will carry you all off together , and have a court-martial held upon you , if you do not instantly bring all the drivers belonging to this gentleman into my presence . 
How many of them ? '' 
inquired he , in French , from the merchant . 
`` There are fourteen wagons , '' was the reply . 
`` There must be fourteen wagoners , '' thundered the Pole again to the people ; `` the devil shall fly away with you all if you do not instantly produce them . '' 
With the help of an old domestic servant , a dozen of the drivers were at length brought forward ; two , however , were in no way to be recovered , and finally the landlord confessed that they had gone to join the patriots . 
The young Pole did not seem to attach much value to this instance of patriotism . 
Turning to the merchant , he said , `` Here you have the men , now see to the freight ; if a single article be found wanting , I will have the whole of these fellows tried by court-martial . '' 
Then he carelessly sat down on the pole of a carriage , and looked at the points of his polished boots , which had got a good deal bemired . 
A number of lanterns and torches were now brought , and after a few encouraging words from the merchant , the wagoners proceeded to roll away some empty carts , and to open out a passage to their own goods . 
Most of these men had been employed by him before , and knew him and Anton personally ; some of them proved themselves trustworthy and obliging ; and while Mr. Schr√∂ter was cross-questioning the most intelligent of their number , Anton hastened to ascertain , as well as he could , the condition of the freight , which mostly consisted of wool and tallow . 
Some wagons were untouched ; one was entirely unloaded , and many had lost their canvas covering , and been otherwise plundered . 
The merchant had once more recourse to the young Pole . 
`` It is just as we supposed , '' said he ; `` the landlord has persuaded some of the drivers that , now the revolution has set in , their obligations have ceased , and they have begun to unload the wagons . 
Had we been a day later , every thing would have been carried off . 
The landlord and a few of his associates have been the instigators , and some of the wagoners have been frightened into compliance . '' 
At this announcement a new volley of imprecations proceeded from the lips of the small authority , and the landlord , from whose face all ruddiness had vanished , was soon on his knees before the officer , who pulled him by the hair , and treated him very roughly indeed . 
Meanwhile Anton and some of the men laid siege to a locked-up coach-house , broke open the door , and disclosed the bales of wool and the remainder of the stolen goods . 
`` Let these people reload , '' said the merchant ; `` they may well work the night through as a punishment . '' 
After some opposition , the wagoners set to , overpowered by a combination of threats and promises . 
The Pole drove the drunken guests out of the tavern , had the outer door closed , and all the candles and lanterns of the establishment brought into the court-yard . 
Next he dragged the host by the hair of his head to the upper story , and then , by the help of some patriots with great cockades , tied him to a bedpost , and gave him to understand that that was the nearest approach to a night 's rest which he had to expect . 
`` In the event of the freight being found entire , and safely removed from your premises , you shall be forgiven , '' said the Pole ; `` in the opposite case , I shall have you tried at once , and shot . '' 
Meanwhile the uproar in the court was great indeed . 
Anton had the wagons reloaded and the freight properly secured . 
Full of his work , he scarcely looked around , and only realized at odd moments his singular entourage , and the exciting nature of the scene . 
It was a large square court , surrounded by low , ruinous wooden buildings , stables , and coach-houses , and having two entrances , one through the inn itself , and one through a gate opposite . 
It occupied a space of several acres , as is often the case with these hostelries of eastern Europe , stationed on great thoroughfares ; and afforded , as do the caravanseries of Asia , shelter for large transports of goods , as well as for multitudes of the poor and needy . 
All sorts of wagons were now assembled in the square court in question , and it was crowded besides with ladders , poles , wheels , gigantic hampers , gray canvas coverings , bundles of hay and straw , old tar-barrels , and portable racks . 
Besides the stable lanterns and flaming pine torches , there was the red glare in the sky , and the lurid clouds of smoke and sparks rolling still over the heads of the travelers . 
This strange sort of twilight shone here at least upon a peaceful task . 
The wagoners worked hard , shouting loudly the while ; dark forms now vanished in the shadow of the bales , now sprang on the top of them , while their animated gesticulations made them look , in the red light , like a crowd of savages holding some mysterious nocturnal orgies . 
The merchant , meanwhile , walked up and down between the inn and the scene of action . 
It was in vain that Anton implored him to rest for a few hours . 
`` This is no night for us to sleep in , '' said he , gloomily ; and Anton read in his dark glance the resolve of a man who is ready to stake his all upon the accomplishment of his inflexible will . 
It was nearly morning when the last giant bale was firmly secured with ropes and chains on the wagon top . 
Anton , who had himself been lending a hand , now slipped down , and announced to his principal that their work was done . 
`` At last ! '' 
replied the merchant , drawing a long breath ; and then he went up to announce the fact to their friendly escort . 
He , for his part , had contrived to get through the night in his own way ; first , he thoroughly enjoyed the supper and wine brought him by the terrified maids , and found leisure to say a few encouraging words to the prettiest of them . 
Then he contemplated the dirty bed , and at last threw himself , with a French oath , upon it , looking now at the distorted countenance of the roguish host , who sat opposite him on the ground , now at the ceiling ; and , while half asleep himself , complimenting the merchant , who looked in from time to time , upon his capacity of keeping awake a whole night . 
At length the youth fell fast asleep . 
At least the merchant found him in the morning outstretched on the coarse coverlet , his delicate face shaded by his long black hair , his small hands crossed , and a pleasant smile playing around his lips . 
As he lay there he afforded no incorrect type of the aristocracy of his nation : noble child that he was , with the passions , and perhaps the sins of a man ; while over against him crouched the coarse build of the fettered plebeian , who pretended to sleep too , but often cast a malicious glance at the recumbent form before him . 
The aristocrat sprang up when the merchant approached the bed , and , throwing the window open , said , `` Good-day : it is morning , I see ; I have slept admirably . '' 
Next he called to a patrol passing by , briefly informed the leader how things stood , made over to him the landlord and the remainder of the supper , and desired him to stop at once , and keep guard over the house until he should return . 
Then he ordered the wagoners to harness the horses , and led the travelers out into the gray dawn of a comfortless-looking day . 
On their way to the agent the merchant said to Anton , `` We shall divide the most necessary visits between us . 
Tell our customers that we have no kind of intention of oppressing them ; that , on the restoration of some degree of order , they may reckon upon the greatest forbearance and consideration -- nay , under conditions , upon an extension of credit , but that at present we insist upon securities . 
We shall not effect much in this confusion ; but that these gentlemen should be , at a time like this , even reminded of our firm , is worth a good deal . '' 
Then , in a lower tone , he added , `` The town is doomed : we shall do little business here for some time to come ; remember that , and be firm . '' 
And , turning to the Pole , he said , `` I request you to allow my fellow-traveler to pay a few business calls in the company of our agent . '' 
`` If your agent will answer with his person for the gentleman 's return , '' returned the Pole , with some reluctance , `` I consent . '' 
The light of day had exercised its gracious office of giving color to flowers and courage to the faint-hearted , even in favor of the agent . 
He declared himself ready to accompany Anton upon the terms proposed . 
Accordingly , under the protection of the great cockade upon his companion 's hat , Anton hurried from house to house , pale indeed from loss of rest , but with an undaunted heart . 
Every where he was received with amazement not always free from confusion . 
`` How could people think in such a time about winding up matters of business , with the noise of arms all round , and in deadly fear of a horrible future ? '' 
Anton coolly replied , `` Our firm is not accustomed to trouble itself about rumors of war when not absolutely obliged to do so . 
All times are suited for the fulfillment of obligations ; and if this be a fit season for us to come here , it is also a fit season for you to arrange matters with me ; '' through which representations he succeeded here and there in obtaining definite promises , commissions , nay , even reimbursement . 
After a few hours ' hard work , Anton met his principal in the agent 's house . 
When he had made his report , the merchant said , reaching out his hand to him , `` If we can succeed in getting our wagons safely out of the town , we shall have done enough to enable us to bear the unavoidable losses that we must undergo . 
Now , then , to the commandant . '' 
He gave a few further instructions to the agent , whispering to him in parting , `` In a few days our troops will enter ; I take it for granted that you will not leave your house till then . 
We shall thus meet again . '' 
With upraised hands the agent invoked the protection of all the saints in the calendar upon the travelers , locked and bolted the house door behind them , and hid his revolutionary cockade in the stove . 
Our friends now hurried on through the tumult , led by the Pole . 
The streets were full again ; bands of armed men passed by , the populace was in wilder excitement , and the noise greater than on the previous evening . 
The houses were thundered at , and an entrance insisted on . 
Brandy-casks were rolled on to the flags , and surrounded by drunken men and women . 
Every thing denoted that the authorities were not sufficiently strong to enforce street-discipline . 
Even in the house of the commandant there was agitation and restlessness , soldiers were hurrying to and fro , and the messages which they brought were evidently unfavorable , for there was much whispering going on in the great ante-chamber , and anxious suspense was visible on every face . 
As soon as the young Pole entered he was surrounded by his friends and drawn into a corner . 
After some hasty questions , he seized a musket , called off a few soldiers by name , and left the room , without troubling himself any further about the travelers . 
The merchant and Anton were shown into the next room , where the young commander-in-chief received them . 
He too looked pale and dejected , but it was with the bearing of a true nobleman that he addressed Mr. Schr√∂ter : `` I have forwarded your wishes ; here is a passport for you and your wagons . 
I pray you to infer from this that we are anxious to treat the citizens of your state with consideration , possibly even more than the duty of self-preservation would dictate . '' 
The merchant received the important document with shining eyes . 
`` You have shown me a remarkable degree of kindness , '' said he ; `` I feel myself deeply indebted to you , and wish that I may one day be permitted to prove my gratitude . '' 
`` Who knows ? '' 
answered the young commandant , with a melancholy smile ; `` he who stakes all upon a cast may lose all . '' 
`` He may lose much , '' replied the merchant , courteously , `` but not all , if he has striven honorably . '' 
At that moment a hollow sound was heard , a sound like the sweep of a howling wind , or the roaring of a rushing flood . 
The commandant stood motionless and listened . 
Suddenly a discordant scream of many voices resounded close by , and some shots followed . 
Anton , made susceptible by a night of wakefulness and long-continued excitement , started with terror , and remarked that his principal 's hand , in which was the passport , shook violently . 
The door of the cabinet now burst open , and a few stately-looking men rushed in , with garments torn , arms in their hands , the traces of a street combat visible on their excited countenances , and at their head the young escort of the travelers . 
`` Mutiny ! '' 
cried the youth to his commanding officer ; `` they are seeking you . 
Save yourself . 
I will keep them off . '' 
Quick as thought Anton sprang toward his principal , dragged him away , and both flew through the ante-chamber , and down the staircase to the ground floor . 
Here they came upon a band of soldiers who were endeavoring to garrison the house against masses of the populace . 
But , swift as were the movements of the travelers , those of their last night 's escort were quicker still , as , with a loud shout , he rushed to head his friends in their resistance to the invaders . 
His black hair flew wildly around his bare head , and his eyes shone out from his beautiful and now pallid face with the unconquerable energy of a brave man . 
`` Back ! '' 
he cried , with a loud , clear voice , to the raging people , and sprang like a panther in among them , dealing sword-strokes round . 
The masses gave way ; the comrades of the brave youth ranged themselves behind him . 
Again Anton seized his principal 's arm , and dragged him off with such speed as is only possible to men under the influence of strong excitement . 
They had just got behind a projection of the house when they heard a shot fired , and saw with horror the young Pole fall backward bleeding , and heard his last cry , `` The canaille ! '' 
`` To the wagons ! '' 
said the merchant , dashing down a narrow cross-street . 
They still heard in the distance shots and cries of discord ; and breaking through bands of curious and terrified inhabitants , who hindered their progress , they arrived breathless , and fearing the worst , at the door of the inn . 
Here , too , there was mutiny . 
The soldiers left in charge of the house had loosed the landlord , and speedily made their retreat as soon as news of the tumult reached them . 
The court-yard was now a scene of wrangling and confusion . 
The landlord , supported by a number of idlers collected from the street , was disputing violently with the wagoners . 
Some of the wagons were harnessed and ready for departure , but from others the canvas covering had been again dragged off . 
The case was a desperate one . 
The merchant tore away from Anton , who tried to detain him , and , rushing into the midst of the disputants , called out in Polish as loudly as he could , while holding the passport above his head , `` Stop , I say ; here is the order of the commander-in-chief authorizing the departure of our wagons . 
Whoever resists it will be punished . 
We are under the protection of the government . '' 
`` What government , you rogue of a German ? '' 
screamed the landlord , with ominous face ; `` the old government is done away with ; the traitors have had their reward , and their spies shall be hanged as well ; '' and , rushing at the merchant , he brandished an old sword at his head . 
Our Anton shuddered ; but man being in the most critical moments liable to strange associations of idea , which play like meteors across the anguish of his spirit , it chanced that the broad back of the landlord suddenly reminded him of the back of a squat schoolfellow of his at Ostrau , a good-natured baker 's son , upon whom , in many a scuffle , he had often practiced the boyish trick of tripping an adversary from behind . 
Quick as lightning he sprang upon the landlord , and most skillfully threw him . 
The falling sword swerved from its fatal aim , only striking the arm of the merchant , cutting through the coat and into the flesh . 
As the fat fellow lay struggling on his back like a beetle , Anton drew out his trusty pistols , and cried , with the inspiration of despair , `` Back , you rascals , or I shoot him dead ! '' 
This rapid diversion had more effect than could reasonably have been hoped ; the people that the landlord had collected around him , and who , after all , were only working for his interest , fell back , while half a dozen wagoners , with bars of iron and other implements of the kind , crowded round the merchant , and now screamed as loudly as the other party had done a short time before , declaring that no harm should happen to the gentleman and his wagons . 
The merchant cried , `` Drive these strangers out ! '' 
and , taking up the sword that the landlord had dropped , at the head of his adherents stormed the latter 's abettors , and drove them through the house . 
The most stiff-necked of them tried to intrench themselves in the bar , but one after the other was cast out , roaring and cursing the while . 
The door was then locked , and the merchant hastened back to the court-yard , and found Anton still kneeling by the incorrigible landlord to prevent him from rising . 
The rest of the wagoners having timidly got out of the way , the merchant now summoned them all , and ordered them to put the horses to , saying to Anton , `` We must leave this place . 
Better the street pavement than this den of thieves . '' 
`` You bleed ! '' 
cried Anton , in great distress , his eye falling on the merchant 's arm . 
`` It must be a mere scratch ; I can move the arm , '' was the prompt reply . 
`` Open the gate ; out with the wagons . 
Forward , my men ! 
Anton , one of the wagoners will help you to bind the landlord . '' 
`` And where shall we go ? '' 
inquired Anton , in English . 
`` Are we to take these wagons into the bloodshed of the streets ? '' 
`` We have a passport , and will leave the town , '' answered the merchant , doggedly . 
`` They will not respect our passport , '' cried Anton in return , while he held a pistol at the head of the obstreperous landlord . 
`` If the worst come to the worst , there are other inns in this part of the town ; any of them will be a better refuge . '' 
`` But we have not the full complement of drivers , and some of our number are disaffected . '' 
`` I will manage the disaffected , '' answered the merchant , sternly ; `` we have the full number of horses , we only want the men . 
Those to whom the horses belong will remain with them . 
The gate is open -- out with the wagons ! '' 
The gate led to an open space covered with building-stones and d√©bris , and surrounded by a few poor houses . 
The merchant hastened thither to superintend the departure . 
A stout youth came to Anton 's assistance . 
They were anxious moments these . 
Near the house , he and his helper were struggling with the prostrate man , whose ugly wife and her two maid-servants were howling at the house door . 
As the first wagon rolled away , their screams became louder : the landlady called out `` help '' and `` murder ! '' 
and the maids wailed all the louder the more fervently the young wagoner assured them that no harm would befall his worship , the landlord , if he would only lie still , and that , moreover , they would all pay their bills besides . 
Just then loud knocks were heard at the house door ; the women rushed in and unlocked it at once ; and so great had been the hopeless excitement of the last few minutes , that it was almost with a sense of relief that Anton saw a strong body of soldiery defile into the court . 
He rose from the ground , and left the landlord free . 
But the merchant walked slowly , and with uncertain steps , like a broken-down man , to meet the enemies who , at this decisive moment , frustrated his will . 
The leader of the band , one of those whom the young Pole had in the morning summoned to the inn , said to the merchant , `` You are prisoners ; neither you nor your wagons can leave the town . '' 
`` I have a passport , '' eagerly replied Mr. Schr√∂ter , feeling for his pocket-book . 
`` The new government forbids your journey , '' was the curt rejoinder . 
`` I must submit , '' said the merchant , mechanically sitting down on a wagon-pole , and clinging to the body of the vehicle . 
Anton held the half-unconscious man in his arms , and said , in utmost indignation , `` We have been twice robbed in this inn ; we were in danger of being killed ; my companion is wounded , as you see ; if your government is determined to detain us and our wagons , at least protect our lives and our property . 
The wagons can not remain here , and if we are separated from them , it will be still more difficult to prevent their being plundered . '' 
The soldiers now held a consultation , and at length their leader called Anton to share in it . 
After much discussion , it was finally arranged that the wagons should be moved to a neighboring establishment , equal to this in accommodation , but superior in character . 
Anton obtained leave to move to it with his companion , and there remain under surveillance till something further should be decided . 
Meanwhile the merchant sat leaning against the canvas covering , and taking , apparently , no interest in what was going on . 
Anton now rapidly told him the decision arrived at . 
`` We must bear it , '' said the principal , rising slowly and with difficulty . 
`` Ask the landlord for our bill . '' 
`` We will pay the landlord , '' said the soldier in command , roughly pushing the functionary aside . 
`` Think of yourself , '' added he , kindly catching hold of the wounded man 's arm to support him . 
`` Pay for us and for the horses , '' repeated Mr. Schr√∂ter to Anton ; `` we can not remain in these people 's debt . '' 
Anton accordingly took out his pocket-book , called the drivers together , and , in their presence , made over a banknote to the landlord , saying to him , `` I now pay you this sum provisionally , until you shall have made out your account . 
You men are witnesses . '' 
The drivers respectfully bowed , and hurried back to their wagons . 
The procession now set forth . 
First a portion of the armed escort , then the heavy wagons , which slowly and helplessly rumbled along over the stones ; some of them without drivers , but kept in line by their well-trained horses . 
Mr. Schr√∂ter stood at the gate , leaning upon Anton , and counted each wagon as it passed ; and as the last rolled off , he said , `` Done at last , '' and consented to be led away . 
In the very next cross-street the procession turned into the great court-yard of another inn . 
When the last of the wagons had at length had its horses unharnessed , and the soldiers had barred the gate from within , the merchant fell down in a swoon , and was carried into the house . 
He was placed in a small room , a guard stationed at his door , and another in the court . 
Anton remained alone with the sufferer . 
Full of anxiety , he knelt by his bed , unfastened his clothes , and bathed his face with cold water . 
After a time Mr. Schr√∂ter revived , opened his eyes , looked gratefully at Anton , and pointed to the window . 
Anton looked out , and said , joyously , `` It opens upon the court-yard . 
I can overlook and count the wagons . 
I really think that here , although prisoners , we are tolerably safe . 
But , first of all , allow me to look to your wound : your clothes are much stained with blood . '' 
`` My weakness proceeds more from over-excitement than loss of blood , '' replied the merchant , raising himself up . 
Anton opened the door , and begged for a surgeon . 
Their guard was prepared to go for one , and after an anxious hour had passed , he introduced a shabby-looking individual , who hurriedly produced a razor and a dirty pocket-handkerchief , wiping the razor on his sleeve , and bringing the handkerchief into alarming proximity with Anton 's chin . 
It was with some difficulty that the reason of his being sent for was conveyed to him . 
Anton cut away the sleeve of the coat and shirt , and himself examined the wound . 
It was a cut in the upper arm ; not a deep one , indeed , but the arm was stiff , and Mr. Schr√∂ter suffered severely . 
The barber attempted to bandage it , and went off , promising to return on the morrow . 
The merchant fell back , exhausted with the pain of the bandaging , and Anton sat by him the remainder of the day , laying wet cloths around the arm , and watching the feverish slumber of the patient . 
Soon he sank himself into a sort of half sleep , a dull apathy , which made him indifferent to all that was going on without . 
Thus evening wore away , and night came on . 
Anton occasionally dipped his fingers in cold water , and crept from the bed to the window to watch the wagons , or to the door to exchange a whisper with the guard , who showed a friendly interest in the case . 
Meanwhile the fire continued its ravages , and the sound of musketry thundered at the gates . 
Anton looked carelessly at the burning fragments which the wind drove over the unhappy town , and heard , with a faint degree of surprise , that the noise of the firing grew louder and louder , and at last became a deafening crash ; all the sounds that struck his ear from the street appearing to him as unimportant as the ringing of a little early church-bell which he had often heard from his own room in the principal 's house , and which never disturbed any one out of his morning repose . 
The whole night through he kept mechanically wetting and applying cold-water poultices to the patient 's arm , and rising whenever the latter groaned or turned ; but when , toward morning , the merchant fell into a sounder sleep , Anton forgot his task , his head fell heavy upon his hands outstretched on the table , he neither saw nor heard ; and amid the screams of the wounded , and the thundering of cannon which attended the taking of a stoutly-defended town , amid all the horrors of a bloody conflict , he slept like a tired boy over his school-task . 
When he awoke , after the lapse of a few hours , it had long been morning . 
The merchant smiled kindly at him from his bed , and reached out his hand . 
Anton pressed it with all his heart , and hurried to the window . 
`` They are all right , '' said he . 
He then opened the door ; the guard of the previous night had vanished ; and on the street he heard the beat of drums , and the regular tramp of regiments marching in . 
`` We gave you up for lost , '' cried the newly-arrived captain to Mr. Schr√∂ter . 
`` They manage inns wretchedly here , and all my inquiries after you proved fruitless . 
It was a fortunate thing that your letter found me out in this confusion . '' 
`` We have accomplished our purpose , '' said the merchant , `` but not , as you see , without drawbacks ; '' and he pointed , smiling , to his wounded arm . 
`` First and foremost , let me hear your adventures , '' said the captain , sitting down by the bedside . 
`` You have more tokens of the fight to show than I. '' The merchant told his story . 
He dwelt warmly upon Anton 's courage , to which he ascribed his safety , and ended by saying , `` My wound does not prevent my traveling , and my return is imperative . 
I shall go with the wagons as far as the frontier . '' 
`` Early to-morrow morning one of our companies returns to the frontier ; you can send your wagons under its escort ; besides which , the high roads are now safe . 
To-morrow the mails begin to run again . '' 
`` I must still further request your assistance . 
I am anxious to write home by a courier this very day . '' 
`` I will take care , '' promised the captain , `` that your return to-morrow shall meet with no impediments . '' 
As soon as the officer had left the room , Mr. Schr√∂ter said to Anton , `` I have a surprise for you , dear Wohlfart , which will , I fear , be an unwelcome one . 
I wish to leave you here in my place . '' 
Anton drew nearer in amazement . 
`` There is no relying on our agent at a time like this , '' continued the merchant , `` and I have , during the last few days , rejoiced to discover how perfectly I can depend upon you . 
What you have just done to save my head-piece will be unforgotten as long as I live . 
And now draw a writing-table here beside me ; we have still some plans to arrange . '' 
The next morning a post-chaise stood before the inn door , into which Mr. Schr√∂ter was lifted by Anton . 
It was then drawn up to the side of the street till he had seen the wagons pass one by one out of the gateway . 
Then pressing Anton 's hand once more , he said , `` Your stay here may last weeks , nay , months . 
Your work will be very disagreeable , and often fruitless . 
But I repeat it , do not be too anxious ; I trust to your decision as to my own . 
And do not be afraid of incurring contingent loss , if you can only get unsafe debtors to pay up . 
This place is devastated and lost to us for the future . 
Farewell till our happy meeting at home . '' 
Thus Anton remained alone in the strange town , in a position where great trust imposed upon him great responsibility . 
He went back to his room , called the landlord , and at once made arrangements for his further stay there . 
The town was so filled with military that he preferred to remain in the small quarters that he had already occupied , and to put up with their inconveniences , having little expectation of changing for the better . 
It was indeed a devastated town which Anton now explored . 
A few days back , crowds of passionately-excited men had filled the streets , and every kind of daring enterprise was to be read on their wild faces . 
Where was now the haughty defiance , the thirst of battle , that inspired all those thousands ? 
The crowds of peasants , the swarming town populace , the soldiers of the patriot army , had vanished like ghosts scared by the presence of an enchanter . 
The few men to be seen were foreign soldiers . 
But their gay uniforms did not improve the aspect of the town . 
True , the fire was quenched , whose clouds of smoke had darkened the sky . 
But there stood the houses in the pale light , looking as if they had been gutted . 
The doors remained closed ; many of the window-panes were broken ; on the flags lay heaps of mud , dirty straw , and fragments of furniture . 
Here , a car with a broken wheel ; there , a uniform , arms , the carcass of a horse .
