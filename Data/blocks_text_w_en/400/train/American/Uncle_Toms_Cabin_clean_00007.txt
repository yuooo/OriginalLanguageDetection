But you know how the angel commanded Hagar to return to her mistress , and submit herself under the hand ; * and the apostle sent back Onesimus to his master . '' 
** * Gen. 16 . 
The angel bade the pregnant Hagar return to her mistress Sarai , even though Sarai had dealt harshly with her . 
** Phil . 
1:10 . 
Onesimus went back to his master to become no longer a servant but a `` brother beloved . '' 
`` Do n't quote Bible at me that way , Mr. Wilson , '' said George , with a flashing eye , `` do n't ! 
for my wife is a Christian , and I mean to be , if ever I get to where I can ; but to quote Bible to a fellow in my circumstances , is enough to make him give it up altogether . 
I appeal to God Almighty ; -- I 'm willing to go with the case to Him , and ask Him if I do wrong to seek my freedom . '' 
`` These feelings are quite natural , George , '' said the good-natured man , blowing his nose . 
`` Yes , they 're natural , but it is my duty not to encourage 'em in you . 
Yes , my boy , I 'm sorry for you , now ; it 's a bad case -- very bad ; but the apostle says , ` Let everyone abide in the condition in which he is called . ' 
We must all submit to the indications of Providence , George , -- do n't you see ? '' 
George stood with his head drawn back , his arms folded tightly over his broad breast , and a bitter smile curling his lips . 
`` I wonder , Mr. Wilson , if the Indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and children , and want to keep you all your life hoeing corn for them , if you 'd think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called . 
I rather think that you 'd think the first stray horse you could find an indication of Providence -- should n't you ? '' 
The little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of the case ; but , though not much of a reasoner , he had the sense in which some logicians on this particular subject do not excel , -- that of saying nothing , where nothing could be said . 
So , as he stood carefully stroking his umbrella , and folding and patting down all the creases in it , he proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way . 
`` You see , George , you know , now , I always have stood your friend ; and whatever I 've said , I 've said for your good . 
Now , here , it seems to me , you 're running an awful risk . 
You ca n't hope to carry it out . 
If you 're taken , it will be worse with you than ever ; they 'll only abuse you , and half kill you , and sell you down the river . '' 
`` Mr. Wilson , I know all this , '' said George . 
`` I do run a risk , but -- '' he threw open his overcoat , and showed two pistols and a bowie-knife . 
`` There ! '' 
he said , `` I 'm ready for 'em ! 
Down south I never will go . 
No ! 
if it comes to that , I can earn myself at least six feet of free soil , -- the first and last I shall ever own in Kentucky ! '' 
`` Why , George , this state of mind is awful ; it 's getting really desperate George . 
I 'm concerned . 
Going to break the laws of your country ! '' 
`` My country again ! 
Mr. Wilson , you have a country ; but what country have I , or any one like me , born of slave mothers ? 
What laws are there for us ? 
We do n't make them , -- we do n't consent to them , -- we have nothing to do with them ; all they do for us is to crush us , and keep us down . 
Have n't I heard your Fourth-of-July speeches ? 
Do n't you tell us all , once a year , that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed ? 
Ca n't a fellow think , that hears such things ? 
Ca n't he put this and that together , and see what it comes to ? '' 
Mr. Wilson 's mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented by a bale of cotton , -- downy , soft , benevolently fuzzy and confused . 
He really pitied George with all his heart , and had a sort of dim and cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him ; but he deemed it his duty to go on talking good to him , with infinite pertinacity . 
`` George , this is bad . 
I must tell you , you know , as a friend , you 'd better not be meddling with such notions ; they are bad , George , very bad , for boys in your condition , -- very ; '' and Mr. Wilson sat down to a table , and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella . 
`` See here , now , Mr. Wilson , '' said George , coming up and sitting himself determinately down in front of him ; `` look at me , now . 
Do n't I sit before you , every way , just as much a man as you are ? 
Look at my face , -- look at my hands , -- look at my body , '' and the young man drew himself up proudly ; `` why am I not a man , as much as anybody ? 
Well , Mr. Wilson , hear what I can tell you . 
I had a father -- one of your Kentucky gentlemen -- who did n't think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses , to satisfy the estate , when he died . 
I saw my mother put up at sheriff 's sale , with her seven children . 
They were sold before her eyes , one by one , all to different masters ; and I was the youngest . 
She came and kneeled down before old Mas ` r , and begged him to buy her with me , that she might have at least one child with her ; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot . 
I saw him do it ; and the last that I heard was her moans and screams , when I was tied to his horse 's neck , to be carried off to his place . '' 
`` Well , then ? '' 
`` My master traded with one of the men , and bought my oldest sister . 
She was a pious , good girl , -- a member of the Baptist church , -- and as handsome as my poor mother had been . 
She was well brought up , and had good manners . 
At first , I was glad she was bought , for I had one friend near me . 
I was soon sorry for it . 
Sir , I have stood at the door and heard her whipped , when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart , and I could n't do anything to help her ; and she was whipped , sir , for wanting to live a decent Christian life , such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live ; and at last I saw her chained with a trader 's gang , to be sent to market in Orleans , -- sent there for nothing else but that , -- and that 's the last I know of her . 
Well , I grew up , -- long years and years , -- no father , no mother , no sister , not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog ; nothing but whipping , scolding , starving . 
Why , sir , I 've been so hungry that I have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs ; and yet , when I was a little fellow , and laid awake whole nights and cried , it was n't the hunger , it was n't the whipping , I cried for . 
No , sir , it was for my mother and my sisters , -- it was because I had n't a friend to love me on earth . 
I never knew what peace or comfort was . 
I never had a kind word spoken to me till I came to work in your factory . 
Mr. Wilson , you treated me well ; you encouraged me to do well , and to learn to read and write , and to try to make something of myself ; and God knows how grateful I am for it . 
Then , sir , I found my wife ; you 've seen her , -- you know how beautiful she is . 
When I found she loved me , when I married her , I scarcely could believe I was alive , I was so happy ; and , sir , she is as good as she is beautiful . 
But now what ? 
Why , now comes my master , takes me right away from my work , and my friends , and all I like , and grinds me down into the very dirt ! 
And why ? 
Because , he says , I forgot who I was ; he says , to teach me that I am only a nigger ! 
After all , and last of all , he comes between me and my wife , and says I shall give her up , and live with another woman . 
And all this your laws give him power to do , in spite of God or man . 
Mr. Wilson , look at it ! 
There is n't one of all these things , that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister , and my wife and myself , but your laws allow , and give every man power to do , in Kentucky , and none can say to him nay ! 
Do you call these the laws of my country ? 
Sir , I have n't any country , anymore than I have any father . 
But I 'm going to have one . 
I do n't want anything of your country , except to be let alone , -- to go peaceably out of it ; and when I get to Canada , where the laws will own me and protect me , that shall be my country , and its laws I will obey . 
But if any man tries to stop me , let him take care , for I am desperate . 
I 'll fight for my liberty to the last breath I breathe . 
You say your fathers did it ; if it was right for them , it is right for me ! '' 
This speech , delivered partly while sitting at the table , and partly walking up and down the room , -- delivered with tears , and flashing eyes , and despairing gestures , -- was altogether too much for the good-natured old body to whom it was addressed , who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket-handkerchief , and was mopping up his face with great energy . 
`` Blast 'em all ! '' 
he suddenly broke out . 
`` Have n't I always said so -- the infernal old cusses ! 
I hope I a n't swearing , now . 
Well ! 
go ahead , George , go ahead ; but be careful , my boy ; do n't shoot anybody , George , unless -- well -- you 'd better not shoot , I reckon ; at least , I would n't hit anybody , you know . 
Where is your wife , George ? '' 
he added , as he nervously rose , and began walking the room . 
`` Gone , sir gone , with her child in her arms , the Lord only knows where ; -- gone after the north star ; and when we ever meet , or whether we meet at all in this world , no creature can tell . '' 
`` Is it possible ! 
astonishing ! 
from such a kind family ? '' 
`` Kind families get in debt , and the laws of our country allow them to sell the child out of its mother 's bosom to pay its master 's debts , '' said George , bitterly . 
`` Well , well , '' said the honest old man , fumbling in his pocket : `` I s ` pose , perhaps , I a n't following my judgment , -- hang it , I wo n't follow my judgment ! '' 
he added , suddenly ; `` so here , George , '' and , taking out a roll of bills from his pocket-book , he offered them to George . 
`` No , my kind , good sir ! '' 
said George , `` you 've done a great deal for me , and this might get you into trouble . 
I have money enough , I hope , to take me as far as I need it . '' 
`` No ; but you must , George . 
Money is a great help everywhere ; -- ca n't have too much , if you get it honestly . 
Take it , -- do take it , now , -- do , my boy ! '' 
`` On condition , sir , that I may repay it at some future time , I will , '' said George , taking up the money . 
`` And now , George , how long are you going to travel in this way ? 
-- not long or far , I hope . 
It 's well carried on , but too bold . 
And this black fellow , -- who is he ? '' 
`` A true fellow , who went to Canada more than a year ago . 
He heard , after he got there , that his master was so angry at him for going off that he had whipped his poor old mother ; and he has come all the way back to comfort her , and get a chance to get her away . '' 
`` Has he got her ? '' 
`` Not yet ; he has been hanging about the place , and found no chance yet . 
Meanwhile , he is going with me as far as Ohio , to put me among friends that helped him , and then he will come back after her . 
`` Dangerous , very dangerous ! '' 
said the old man . 
George drew himself up , and smiled disdainfully . 
The old gentleman eyed him from head to foot , with a sort of innocent wonder . 
`` George , something has brought you out wonderfully . 
You hold up your head , and speak and move like another man , '' said Mr. Wilson . 
`` Because I 'm a freeman ! '' 
said George , proudly . 
`` Yes , sir ; I 've said Mas ' r for the last time to any man . 
I 'm free ! '' 
`` Take care ! 
You are not sure , -- you may be taken . '' 
`` All men are free and equal in the grave , if it comes to that , Mr. Wilson , '' said George . 
`` I 'm perfectly dumb-founded with your boldness ! '' 
said Mr. Wilson , -- `` to come right here to the nearest tavern ! '' 
`` Mr. Wilson , it is so bold , and this tavern is so near , that they will never think of it ; they will look for me on ahead , and you yourself would n't know me . 
Jim 's master do n't live in this county ; he is n't known in these parts . 
Besides , he is given up ; nobody is looking after him , and nobody will take me up from the advertisement , I think . '' 
`` But the mark in your hand ? '' 
George drew off his glove , and showed a newly-healed scar in his hand . 
`` That is a parting proof of Mr. Harris ' regard , '' he said , scornfully . 
`` A fortnight ago , he took it into his head to give it to me , because he said he believed I should try to get away one of these days . 
Looks interesting , does n't it ? '' 
he said , drawing his glove on again . 
`` I declare , my very blood runs cold when I think of it , -- your condition and your risks ! '' 
said Mr. Wilson . 
`` Mine has run cold a good many years , Mr. Wilson ; at present , it 's about up to the boiling point , '' said George . 
`` Well , my good sir , '' continued George , after a few moments ' silence , `` I saw you knew me ; I thought I 'd just have this talk with you , lest your surprised looks should bring me out . 
I leave early tomorrow morning , before daylight ; by tomorrow night I hope to sleep safe in Ohio . 
I shall travel by daylight , stop at the best hotels , go to the dinner-tables with the lords of the land . 
So , good-by , sir ; if you hear that I 'm taken , you may know that I 'm dead ! '' 
George stood up like a rock , and put out his hand with the air of a prince . 
The friendly little old man shook it heartily , and after a little shower of caution , he took his umbrella , and fumbled his way out of the room . 
George stood thoughtfully looking at the door , as the old man closed it . 
A thought seemed to flash across his mind . 
He hastily stepped to it , and opening it , said , `` Mr. Wilson , one word more . '' 
The old gentleman entered again , and George , as before , locked the door , and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor , irresolutely . 
At last , raising his head with a sudden effort -- `` Mr. Wilson , you have shown yourself a Christian in your treatment of me , -- I want to ask one last deed of Christian kindness of you . '' 
`` Well , George . '' 
`` Well , sir , -- what you said was true . 
I am running a dreadful risk . 
There is n't , on earth , a living soul to care if I die , '' he added , drawing his breath hard , and speaking with a great effort , -- `` I shall be kicked out and buried like a dog , and nobody 'll think of it a day after , -- only my poor wife ! 
Poor soul ! 
she 'll mourn and grieve ; and if you 'd only contrive , Mr. Wilson , to send this little pin to her . 
She gave it to me for a Christmas present , poor child ! 
Give it to her , and tell her I loved her to the last . 
Will you ? 
Will you ? '' 
he added , earnestly . 
`` Yes , certainly -- poor fellow ! '' 
said the old gentleman , taking the pin , with watery eyes , and a melancholy quiver in his voice . 
`` Tell her one thing , '' said George ; `` it 's my last wish , if she can get to Canada , to go there . 
No matter how kind her mistress is , -- no matter how much she loves her home ; beg her not to go back , -- for slavery always ends in misery . 
Tell her to bring up our boy a free man , and then he wo n't suffer as I have . 
Tell her this , Mr. Wilson , will you ? '' 
`` Yes , George . 
I 'll tell her ; but I trust you wo n't die ; take heart , -- you 're a brave fellow . 
Trust in the Lord , George . 
I wish in my heart you were safe through , though , -- that 's what I do . '' '' 
Is there a God to trust in ? '' 
said George , in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman 's words . 
`` O , I 've seen things all my life that have made me feel that there ca n't be a God . 
You Christians do n't know how these things look to us . 
There 's a God for you , but is there any for us ? '' 
`` O , now , do n't -- do n't , my boy ! '' 
said the old man , almost sobbing as he spoke ; `` do n't feel so ! 
There is -- there is ; clouds and darkness are around about him , but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne . 
There 's a God , George , -- believe it ; trust in Him , and I 'm sure He 'll help you . 
Everything will be set right , -- if not in this life , in another . '' 
The real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with a temporary dignity and authority , as he spoke . 
George stopped his distracted walk up and down the room , stood thoughtfully a moment , and then said , quietly , `` Thank you for saying that , my good friend ; I 'll think of that . '' 
`` In Ramah there was a voice heard , -- weeping , and lamentation , and great mourning ; Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted . '' 
* * Jer . 
31:15 . 
Mr. Haley and Tom jogged onward in their wagon , each , for a time , absorbed in his own reflections . 
Now , the reflections of two men sitting side by side are a curious thing , -- seated on the same seat , having the same eyes , ears , hands and organs of all sorts , and having pass before their eyes the same objects , -- it is wonderful what a variety we shall find in these same reflections ! 
As , for example , Mr. Haley : he thought first of Tom 's length , and breadth , and height , and what he would sell for , if he was kept fat and in good case till he got him into market . 
He thought of how he should make out his gang ; he thought of the respective market value of certain supposititious men and women and children who were to compose it , and other kindred topics of the business ; then he thought of himself , and how humane he was , that whereas other men chained their `` niggers '' hand and foot both , he only put fetters on the feet , and left Tom the use of his hands , as long as he behaved well ; and he sighed to think how ungrateful human nature was , so that there was even room to doubt whether Tom appreciated his mercies . 
He had been taken in so by `` niggers '' whom he had favored ; but still he was astonished to consider how good-natured he yet remained ! 
As to Tom , he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book , which kept running through his head , again and again , as follows : `` We have here no continuing city , but we seek one to come ; wherefore God himself is not ashamed to be called our God ; for he hath prepared for us a city . '' 
These words of an ancient volume , got up principally by `` ignorant and unlearned men , '' have , through all time , kept up , somehow , a strange sort of power over the minds of poor , simple fellows , like Tom . 
They stir up the soul from its depths , and rouse , as with trumpet call , courage , energy , and enthusiasm , where before was only the blackness of despair . 
Mr. Haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers , and began looking over their advertisements , with absorbed interest . 
He was not a remarkably fluent reader , and was in the habit of reading in a sort of recitative half-aloud , by way of calling in his ears to verify the deductions of his eyes . 
In this tone he slowly recited the following paragraph : `` EXECUTOR 'S SALE , -- NEGROES ! 
-- Agreeably to order of court , will be sold , on Tuesday , February 20 , before the Court-house door , in the town of Washington , Kentucky , the following negroes : Hagar , aged 60 ; John , aged 30 ; Ben , aged 21 ; Saul , aged 25 ; Albert , aged 14 . 
Sold for the benefit of the creditors and heirs of the estate of Jesse Blutchford , `` SAMUEL MORRIS , THOMAS FLINT , Executors . '' 
`` This yer I must look at , '' said he to Tom , for want of somebody else to talk to . 
`` Ye see , I 'm going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye , Tom ; it 'll make it sociable and pleasant like , -- good company will , ye know . 
We must drive right to Washington first and foremost , and then I 'll clap you into jail , while I does the business . '' 
Tom received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly ; simply wondering , in his own heart , how many of these doomed men had wives and children , and whether they would feel as he did about leaving them . 
It is to be confessed , too , that the naive , off-hand information that he was to be thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright course of life . 
Yes , Tom , we must confess it , was rather proud of his honesty , poor fellow , -- not having very much else to be proud of ; -- if he had belonged to some of the higher walks of society , he , perhaps , would never have been reduced to such straits . 
However , the day wore on , and the evening saw Haley and Tom comfortably accommodated in Washington , -- the one in a tavern , and the other in a jail . 
About eleven o'clock the next day , a mixed throng was gathered around the court-house steps , -- smoking , chewing , spitting , swearing , and conversing , according to their respective tastes and turns , -- waiting for the auction to commence . 
The men and women to be sold sat in a group apart , talking in a low tone to each other . 
The woman who had been advertised by the name of Hagar was a regular African in feature and figure . 
She might have been sixty , but was older than that by hard work and disease , was partially blind , and somewhat crippled with rheumatism . 
By her side stood her only remaining son , Albert , a bright-looking little fellow of fourteen years . 
The boy was the only survivor of a large family , who had been successively sold away from her to a southern market . 
The mother held on to him with both her shaking hands , and eyed with intense trepidation every one who walked up to examine him . 
`` Do n't be feard , Aunt Hagar , '' said the oldest of the men , `` I spoke to Mas ' r Thomas ` bout it , and he thought he might manage to sell you in a lot both together . '' 
`` Dey need n't call me worn out yet , '' said she , lifting her shaking hands . 
`` I can cook yet , and scrub , and scour , -- I 'm wuth a buying , if I do come cheap ; -- tell em dat ar , -- you tell em , '' she added , earnestly . 
Haley here forced his way into the group , walked up to the old man , pulled his mouth open and looked in , felt of his teeth , made him stand and straighten himself , bend his back , and perform various evolutions to show his muscles ; and then passed on to the next , and put him through the same trial . 
Walking up last to the boy , he felt of his arms , straightened his hands , and looked at his fingers , and made him jump , to show his agility . 
`` He a n't gwine to be sold widout me ! '' 
said the old woman , with passionate eagerness ; `` he and I goes in a lot together ; I 's rail strong yet , Mas ' r and can do heaps o ' work , -- heaps on it , Mas ` r. '' `` On plantation ? '' 
said Haley , with a contemptuous glance . 
`` Likely story ! '' 
and , as if satisfied with his examination , he walked out and looked , and stood with his hands in his pocket , his cigar in his mouth , and his hat cocked on one side , ready for action . 
`` What think of 'em ? '' 
said a man who had been following Haley 's examination , as if to make up his own mind from it . 
`` Wal , '' said Haley , spitting , `` I shall put in , I think , for the youngerly ones and the boy . '' 
`` They want to sell the boy and the old woman together , '' said the man . 
`` Find it a tight pull ; -- why , she 's an old rack o ' bones , -- not worth her salt . '' 
`` You would n't then ? '' 
said the man . 
`` Anybody 'd be a fool ' t would . 
She 's half blind , crooked with rheumatis , and foolish to boot . '' 
`` Some buys up these yer old critturs , and ses there 's a sight more wear in 'em than a body 'd think , '' said the man , reflectively . 
`` No go , ' t all , '' said Haley ; `` would n't take her for a present , -- fact , -- I 've seen , now . '' 
`` Wal , ' t is kinder pity , now , not to buy her with her son , -- her heart seems so sot on him , -- s ` pose they fling her in cheap . '' 
`` Them that 's got money to spend that ar way , it 's all well enough . 
I shall bid off on that ar boy for a plantation-hand ; -- would n't be bothered with her , no way , not if they 'd give her to me , '' said Haley . 
`` She 'll take on desp ` t , '' said the man . 
`` Nat ` lly , she will , '' said the trader , coolly . 
The conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience ; and the auctioneer , a short , bustling , important fellow , elbowed his way into the crowd . 
The old woman drew in her breath , and caught instinctively at her son . 
`` Keep close to yer mammy , Albert , -- close , -- dey 'll put us up togedder , '' she said . 
`` O , mammy , I 'm feard they wo n't , '' said the boy . 
`` Dey must , child ; I ca n't live , no ways , if they do n't '' said the old creature , vehemently . 
The stentorian tones of the auctioneer , calling out to clear the way , now announced that the sale was about to commence . 
A place was cleared , and the bidding began . 
The different men on the list were soon knocked off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market ; two of them fell to Haley . 
`` Come , now , young un , '' said the auctioneer , giving the boy a touch with his hammer , `` be up and show your springs , now . '' 
`` Put us two up togedder , togedder , -- do please , Mas ` r , '' said the old woman , holding fast to her boy . 
`` Be off , '' said the man , gruffly , pushing her hands away ; `` you come last . 
Now , darkey , spring ; '' and , with the word , he pushed the boy toward the block , while a deep , heavy groan rose behind him . 
The boy paused , and looked back ; but there was no time to stay , and , dashing the tears from his large , bright eyes , he was up in a moment . 
His fine figure , alert limbs , and bright face , raised an instant competition , and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the auctioneer . 
Anxious , half-frightened , he looked from side to side , as he heard the clatter of contending bids , -- now here , now there , -- till the hammer fell . 
Haley had got him . 
He was pushed from the block toward his new master , but stopped one moment , and looked back , when his poor old mother , trembling in every limb , held out her shaking hands toward him . 
`` Buy me too , Mas ` r , for de dear Lord 's sake ! 
-- buy me , -- I shall die if you do n't ! '' 
`` You 'll die if I do , that 's the kink of it , '' said Haley , -- `` no ! '' 
And he turned on his heel . 
The bidding for the poor old creature was summary . 
The man who had addressed Haley , and who seemed not destitute of compassion , bought her for a trifle , and the spectators began to disperse . 
The poor victims of the sale , who had been brought up in one place together for years , gathered round the despairing old mother , whose agony was pitiful to see . 
`` Could n't dey leave me one ? 
Mas ' r allers said I should have one , -- he did , '' she repeated over and over , in heart-broken tones . 
`` Trust in the Lord , Aunt Hagar , '' said the oldest of the men , sorrowfully . 
`` What good will it do ? '' 
said she , sobbing passionately . 
`` Mother , mother , -- do n't ! 
do n't ! '' 
said the boy . 
`` They say you 's got a good master . '' 
`` I do n't care , -- I do n't care . 
O , Albert ! 
oh , my boy ! 
you 's my last baby . 
Lord , how ken I ? '' 
`` Come , take her off , ca n't some of ye ? '' 
said Haley , dryly ; `` do n't do no good for her to go on that ar way . '' 
The old men of the company , partly by persuasion and partly by force , loosed the poor creature 's last despairing hold , and , as they led her off to her new master 's wagon , strove to comfort her . 
`` Now ! '' 
said Haley , pushing his three purchases together , and producing a bundle of handcuffs , which he proceeded to put on their wrists ; and fastening each handcuff to a long chain , he drove them before him to the jail . 
A few days saw Haley , with his possessions , safely deposited on one of the Ohio boats . 
It was the commencement of his gang , to be augmented , as the boat moved on , by various other merchandise of the same kind , which he , or his agent , had stored for him in various points along shore . 
The La Belle Riviere , as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the waters of her namesake river , was floating gayly down the stream , under a brilliant sky , the stripes and stars of free America waving and fluttering over head ; the guards crowded with well-dressed ladies and gentlemen walking and enjoying the delightful day . 
All was full of life , buoyant and rejoicing ; -- all but Haley 's gang , who were stored , with other freight , on the lower deck , and who , somehow , did not seem to appreciate their various privileges , as they sat in a knot , talking to each other in low tones . 
`` Boys , '' said Haley , coming up , briskly , `` I hope you keep up good heart , and are cheerful . 
Now , no sulks , ye see ; keep stiff upper lip , boys ; do well by me , and I 'll do well by you . '' 
The boys addressed responded the invariable `` Yes , Mas ` r , '' for ages the watchword of poor Africa ; but it 's to be owned they did not look particularly cheerful ; they had their various little prejudices in favor of wives , mothers , sisters , and children , seen for the last time , -- and though `` they that wasted them required of them mirth , '' it was not instantly forthcoming . 
`` I 've got a wife , '' spoke out the article enumerated as `` John , aged thirty , '' and he laid his chained hand on Tom 's knee , -- `` and she do n't know a word about this , poor girl ! '' 
`` Where does she live ? '' 
said Tom . 
`` In a tavern a piece down here , '' said John ; `` I wish , now , I could see her once more in this world , '' he added . 
Poor John ! 
It was rather natural ; and the tears that fell , as he spoke , came as naturally as if he had been a white man . 
Tom drew a long breath from a sore heart , and tried , in his poor way , to comfort him . 
And over head , in the cabin , sat fathers and mothers , husbands and wives ; and merry , dancing children moved round among them , like so many little butterflies , and everything was going on quite easy and comfortable . 
`` O , mamma , '' said a boy , who had just come up from below , `` there 's a negro trader on board , and he 's brought four or five slaves down there . '' 
`` Poor creatures ! '' 
said the mother , in a tone between grief and indignation . 
`` What 's that ? '' 
said another lady . 
`` Some poor slaves below , '' said the mother . 
`` And they 've got chains on , '' said the boy . 
`` What a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen ! '' 
said another lady . 
`` O , there 's a great deal to be said on both sides of the subject , '' said a genteel woman , who sat at her state-room door sewing , while her little girl and boy were playing round her . 
`` I 've been south , and I must say I think the negroes are better off than they would be to be free . '' 
`` In some respects , some of them are well off , I grant , '' said the lady to whose remark she had answered . 
`` The most dreadful part of slavery , to my mind , is its outrages on the feelings and affections , -- the separating of families , for example . '' 
`` That is a bad thing , certainly , '' said the other lady , holding up a baby 's dress she had just completed , and looking intently on its trimmings ; `` but then , I fancy , it do n't occur often . '' 
`` O , it does , '' said the first lady , eagerly ; `` I 've lived many years in Kentucky and Virginia both , and I 've seen enough to make any one 's heart sick . 
Suppose , ma'am , your two children , there , should be taken from you , and sold ? '' 
`` We ca n't reason from our feelings to those of this class of persons , '' said the other lady , sorting out some worsteds on her lap . 
`` Indeed , ma'am , you can know nothing of them , if you say so , '' answered the first lady , warmly . 
`` I was born and brought up among them . 
I know they do feel , just as keenly , -- even more so , perhaps , -- as we do . '' 
The lady said `` Indeed ! '' 
yawned , and looked out the cabin window , and finally repeated , for a finale , the remark with which she had begun , -- `` After all , I think they are better off than they would be to be free . '' 
`` It 's undoubtedly the intention of Providence that the African race should be servants , -- kept in a low condition , '' said a grave-looking gentleman in black , a clergyman , seated by the cabin door . '' 
` Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be , ' the scripture says . '' 
* * Gen. 9:25 . 
This is what Noah says when he wakes out of drunkenness and realizes that his youngest son , Ham , father of Canaan , has seen him naked . 
`` I say , stranger , is that ar what that text means ? '' 
said a tall man , standing by . 
`` Undoubtedly . 
It pleased Providence , for some inscrutable reason , to doom the race to bondage , ages ago ; and we must not set up our opinion against that . '' 
`` Well , then , we 'll all go ahead and buy up niggers , '' said the man , `` if that 's the way of Providence , -- wo n't we , Squire ? '' 
said he , turning to Haley , who had been standing , with his hands in his pockets , by the stove and intently listening to the conversation . 
`` Yes , '' continued the tall man , `` we must all be resigned to the decrees of Providence . 
Niggers must be sold , and trucked round , and kept under ; it 's what they 's made for . 
` Pears like this yer view 's quite refreshing , a n't it , stranger ? '' 
said he to Haley . 
`` I never thought on ` t , '' said Haley , `` I could n't have said as much , myself ; I ha ` nt no larning . 
I took up the trade just to make a living ; if ` ta n't right , I calculated to ` pent on ' t in time , ye know . '' 
`` And now you 'll save yerself the trouble , wo n't ye ? '' 
said the tall man . 
`` See what ' t is , now , to know scripture . 
If ye 'd only studied yer Bible , like this yer good man , ye might have know 'd it before , and saved ye a heap o ' trouble . 
Ye could jist have said , ` Cussed be ' -- what 's his name ? 
-- ` and ' t would all have come right . ' '' 
And the stranger , who was no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers in the Kentucky tavern , sat down , and began smoking , with a curious smile on his long , dry face . 
A tall , slender young man , with a face expressive of great feeling and intelligence , here broke in , and repeated the words , '' ` All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , do ye even so unto them . ' 
I suppose , '' he added , '' that is scripture , as much as ` Cursed be Canaan . ' '' 
`` Wal , it seems quite as plain a text , stranger , '' said John the drover , `` to poor fellows like us , now ; '' and John smoked on like a volcano . 
The young man paused , looked as if he was going to say more , when suddenly the boat stopped , and the company made the usual steamboat rush , to see where they were landing . 
`` Both them ar chaps parsons ? '' 
said John to one of the men , as they were going out . 
The man nodded . 
As the boat stopped , a black woman came running wildly up the plank , darted into the crowd , flew up to where the slave gang sat , and threw her arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before enumerate -- `` John , aged thirty , '' and with sobs and tears bemoaned him as her husband . 
But what needs tell the story , told too oft , -- every day told , -- of heart-strings rent and broken , -- the weak broken and torn for the profit and convenience of the strong ! 
It needs not to be told ; -- every day is telling it , -- telling it , too , in the ear of One who is not deaf , though he be long silent . 
The young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and God before stood with folded arms , looking on this scene . 
He turned , and Haley was standing at his side . 
`` My friend , '' he said , speaking with thick utterance , `` how can you , how dare you , carry on a trade like this ? 
Look at those poor creatures ! 
Here I am , rejoicing in my heart that I am going home to my wife and child ; and the same bell which is a signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife forever . 
Depend upon it , God will bring you into judgment for this . '' 
The trader turned away in silence . 
`` I say , now , '' said the drover , touching his elbow , `` there 's differences in parsons , a n't there ? 
` Cussed be Canaan ' do n't seem to go down with this ` un , does it ? '' 
Haley gave an uneasy growl . 
`` And that ar a n't the worst on ` t , '' said John ; `` mabbee it wo n't go down with the Lord , neither , when ye come to settle with Him , one o ' these days , as all on us must , I reckon . '' 
Haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat . 
`` If I make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs , '' he thought , `` I reckon I 'll stop off this yer ; it 's really getting dangerous . '' 
And he took out his pocket-book , and began adding over his accounts , -- a process which many gentlemen besides Mr. Haley have found a specific for an uneasy conscience . 
The boat swept proudly away from the shore , and all went on merrily , as before . 
Men talked , and loafed , and read , and smoked . 
Women sewed , and children played , and the boat passed on her way . 
One day , when she lay to for a while at a small town in Kentucky , Haley went up into the place on a little matter of business . 
Tom , whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit , had drawn near the side of the boat , and stood listlessly gazing over the railing . 
After a time , he saw the trader returning , with an alert step , in company with a colored woman , bearing in her arms a young child . 
She was dressed quite respectably , and a colored man followed her , bringing along a small trunk . 
The woman came cheerfully onward , talking , as she came , with the man who bore her trunk , and so passed up the plank into the boat . 
The bell rung , the steamer whizzed , the engine groaned and coughed , and away swept the boat down the river . 
The woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck , and , sitting down , busied herself with chirruping to her baby . 
Haley made a turn or two about the boat , and then , coming up , seated himself near her , and began saying something to her in an indifferent undertone . 
Tom soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the woman 's brow ; and that she answered rapidly , and with great vehemence . 
`` I do n't believe it , -- I wo n't believe it ! '' 
he heard her say . 
`` You 're jist a foolin ' with me . '' 
`` If you wo n't believe it , look here ! '' 
said the man , drawing out a paper ; `` this yer 's the bill of sale , and there 's your master 's name to it ; and I paid down good solid cash for it , too , I can tell you , -- so , now ! '' 
`` I do n't believe Mas ' r would cheat me so ; it ca n't be true ! '' 
said the woman , with increasing agitation . 
`` You can ask any of these men here , that can read writing . 
Here ! '' 
he said , to a man that was passing by , `` jist read this yer , wo n't you ! 
This yer gal wo n't believe me , when I tell her what ' t is . '' 
`` Why , it 's a bill of sale , signed by John Fosdick , '' said the man , `` making over to you the girl Lucy and her child . 
It 's all straight enough , for aught I see . '' 
The woman 's passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her , and the trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation . 
`` He told me that I was going down to Louisville , to hire out as cook to the same tavern where my husband works , -- that 's what Mas ' r told me , his own self ; and I ca n't believe he 'd lie to me , '' said the woman . 
`` But he has sold you , my poor woman , there 's no doubt about it , '' said a good-natured looking man , who had been examining the papers ; `` he has done it , and no mistake . '' 
`` Then it 's no account talking , '' said the woman , suddenly growing quite calm ; and , clasping her child tighter in her arms , she sat down on her box , turned her back round , and gazed listlessly into the river . 
`` Going to take it easy , after all ! '' 
said the trader .
