- To the castle , then ! '' 
He returned thither . 
M. de Lyonne was coming out . 
He gave D'Artagnan both hands , but told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening and all night , and that orders had been given that no one should be admitted . 
`` Not even the captain who takes the order ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I think that is rather too strong . '' 
`` Not even he , '' said M. de Lyonne . 
`` Since that is the case , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the heart ; `` since the captain of the musketeers , who has always entered the king 's chamber , is no longer allowed to enter it , his cabinet , or his salle-a - manger , either the king is dead , or his captain is in disgrace . 
Do me the favor , then , M. de Lyonne , who are in favor , to return and tell the king , plainly , I send him my resignation . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , beware of what you are doing ! '' 
`` For friendship 's sake , go ! '' 
and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet . 
`` Well , I will go , '' said Lyonne . 
D'Artagnan waited , walking about the corridor in no enviable mood . 
Lyonne returned . 
`` Well , what did the king say ? '' 
exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` He simply answered , '' Tis well , ' '' replied Lyonne . 
`` That it was well ! '' 
said the captain , with an explosion . 
`` That is to say , that he accepts it ? 
Good ! 
Now , then , I am free ! 
I am only a plain citizen , M. de Lyonne . 
I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye ! 
Farewell , castle , corridor , ante-chamber ! 
a bourgeois , about to breathe at liberty , takes his farewell of you . '' 
And without waiting longer , the captain sprang from the terrace down the staircase , where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville 's letter . 
Five minutes after , he was at the hostelry , where , according to the custom of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle , he had taken what was called his city-chamber . 
But when he arrived there , instead of throwing off his sword and cloak , he took his pistols , put his money into a large leather purse , sent for his horses from the castle - stables , and gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes during the night . 
Everything went on according to his wishes . 
At eight o'clock in the evening , he was putting his foot in the stirrup , when M. de Gesvres appeared , at the head of twelve guards , in front of the hostelry . 
D'Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye ; he could not fail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses . 
But he feigned not to observe anything , and was about to put his horse in motion . 
Gesvres rode up to him . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
said he , aloud . 
`` Ah , Monsieur de Gesvres ! 
good evening ! '' 
`` One would say you were getting on horseback . '' 
`` More than that , - I am mounted , - as you see . '' 
`` It is fortunate I have met with you . '' 
`` Were you looking for me , then ? '' 
`` Mon Dieu ! 
yes . '' 
`` On the part of the king , I will wager ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` As I , three days ago , went in search of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` Nonsense ! 
It is of no use being over-delicate with me ; that is all labor lost . 
Tell me at once you are come to arrest me . '' 
`` To arrest you ? 
- Good heavens ! 
no . '' 
`` Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels , then ? '' 
`` I am making my round . '' 
`` That is n't bad ! 
And so you pick me up in your round , eh ? '' 
`` I do n't pick you up ; I meet with you , and I beg you to come with me . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` To the king . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a bantering air ; `` the king is disengaged . '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , captain , '' said M. de Gesvres , in a low voice to the musketeer , `` do not compromise yourself ! 
these men hear you . '' 
D'Artagnan laughed aloud , and replied : `` March ! 
People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards and the six last . '' 
`` But as I am not arresting you , '' said M. de Gesvres , `` you will march behind , with me , if you please . '' 
`` Well , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is very polite , duke , and you are right in being so ; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your chambre-de - ville , I should have been courteous to you , I assure you , on the word of a gentleman ! 
Now , one favor more ; what does the king want with me ? '' 
`` Oh , the king is furious ! '' 
`` Very well ! 
the king , who has thought it worth while to be angry , may take the trouble to grow calm again ; that is all . 
I sha n't die of that , I will swear . '' 
`` No , but - '' `` But - I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet . 
Mordioux ! 
That is a gallant man , a worthy man ! 
We shall live very sociably together , I will be sworn . '' 
`` Here we are at our place of destination , '' said the duke . 
`` Captain , for Heaven 's sake be calm with the king ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! 
you are playing the brave man with me , duke ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres . 
`` I have been told that you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers . 
This strikes me as a splendid opportunity . '' 
`` I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it , captain . '' 
`` And why not , pray ? '' 
`` Oh , for many reasons - in the first place , for this : if I were to succeed you in the musketeers after having arrested you - '' `` Ah ! 
then you admit you have arrested me ? '' 
`` No , I do n't . '' 
`` Say met me , then . 
So , you were saying if you were to succeed me after having arrested me ? '' 
`` Your musketeers , at the first exercise with ball cartridges , would fire my way , by mistake . '' 
`` Oh , as to that I wo n't say ; for the fellows do love me a little . '' 
Gesvres made D'Artagnan pass in first , and took him straight to the cabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers , and placed himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber . 
The king could be heard distinctly , speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where Colbert might have heard , a few days before , the king speaking aloud with M. d'Artagnan . 
The guards remained as a mounted picket before the principal gate ; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city that monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order of the king . 
Then these men were seen to be in motion , and as in the good old times of Louis XIII . 
and M. de Treville , groups were formed , and staircases were filled ; vague murmurs , issuing from the court below , came rolling to the upper stories , like the distant moaning of the waves . 
M. de Gesvres became uneasy . 
He looked at his guards , who , after being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks , began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence . 
D'Artagnan was certainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres , the captain of the guards . 
As soon as he entered , he seated himself on the ledge of a window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without the least emotion . 
No step of the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him . 
He foresaw the very moment the explosion would take place ; and we know that his previsions were in general correct . 
`` It would be very whimsical , '' thought he , `` if , this evening , my praetorians should make me king of France . 
How I should laugh ! '' 
But , at the height , all was stopped . 
Guards , musketeers , officers , soldiers , murmurs , uneasiness , dispersed , vanished , died away ; there was an end of menace and sedition . 
One word had calmed the waves . 
The king had desired Brienne to say , `` Hush , messieurs ! 
you disturb the king . '' 
D'Artagnan sighed . 
`` All is over ! '' 
said he ; `` the musketeers of the present day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII . 
All is over ! '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king , '' proclaimed an usher . 
: King Louis XIV . 
The king was seated in his cabinet , with his back turned towards the door of entrance . 
In front of him was a mirror , in which , while turning over his papers , he could see at a glance those who came in . 
He did not take any notice of the entrance of D'Artagnan , but spread above his letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate . 
D'Artagnan understood this by-play , and kept in the background ; so that at the end of a minute the king , who heard nothing , and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye , was obliged to cry , `` Is not M. d'Artagnan there ? '' 
`` I am here , sire , '' replied the musketeer , advancing . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said the king , fixing his pellucid eyes on D'Artagnan , `` what have you to say to me ? '' 
`` I , sire ! '' 
replied the latter , who watched the first blow of his adversary to make a good retort ; `` I have nothing to say to your majesty , unless it be that you have caused me to be arrested , and here I am . '' 
The king was going to reply that he had not had D'Artagnan arrested , but any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse , and he was silent . 
D'Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence . 
`` Monsieur , '' at length resumed the king , `` what did I charge you to go and do at Belle-Isle ? 
Tell me , if you please . '' 
The king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain . 
Here D'Artagnan was fortunate ; the king seemed to place the game in his hands . 
`` I believe , '' replied he , `` that your majesty does me the honor to ask what I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Well ! 
sire , I know nothing about it ; it is not of me that question should be asked , but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds , to whom have been given innumerable orders of all kinds , whilst to me , head of the expedition , nothing precise was said or stated in any form whatever . '' 
The king was hurt : he showed it by his reply . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful . '' 
`` And , therefore , I have been astonished , sire , '' retorted the musketeer , `` that a captain like myself , who ranks with a marechal of France , should have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors , good to make spies of , possibly , but not at all fit to conduct a warlike expedition . 
It was upon this subject I came to demand an explanation of your majesty , when I found the door closed against me , which , the final insult offered to a brave man , has led me to quit your majesty 's service . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the king , `` you still believe that you are living in an age when kings were , as you complain of having been , under the orders and at the discretion of their inferiors . 
You seem to forget that a king owes an account of his actions to none but God . '' 
`` I forget nothing , sire , '' said the musketeer , wounded by this lesson . 
`` Besides , I do not see in what an honest man , when he asks of his king how he has ill-served him , offends him . '' 
`` You have ill-served me , monsieur , by siding with my enemies against me . '' 
`` Who are your enemies , sire ? '' 
`` The men I sent you to fight . '' 
`` Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty 's army ! 
That is incredible . '' 
`` You have no power to judge of my will . '' 
`` But I have to judge of my own friendships , sire . '' 
`` He who serves his friends does not serve his master . '' 
`` I so well understand this , sire , that I have respectfully offered your majesty my resignation . '' 
`` And I have accepted it , monsieur , '' said the king . 
`` Before being separated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep my word . '' 
`` Your majesty has kept more than your word , for your majesty has had me arrested , '' said D'Artagnan , with his cold , bantering air ; `` you did not promise me that , sire . '' 
The king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry , and continued , seriously , `` You see , monsieur , to what grave steps your disobedience forces me . '' 
`` My disobedience ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , red with anger . 
`` It is the mildest term that I can find , '' pursued the king . 
`` My idea was to take and punish rebels ; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels were your friends or not ? '' 
`` But I was , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` It was a cruelty on your majesty 's part to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets . '' 
`` It was a trial I had to make , monsieur , of pretended servants , who eat my bread and should defend my person . 
The trial has succeeded ill , Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` For one bad servant your majesty loses , '' said the musketeer , with bitterness , `` there are ten who , on that same day , go through a like ordeal . 
Listen to me , sire ; I am not accustomed to that service . 
Mine is a rebel sword when I am required to do ill . 
It was ill to send me in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet , your majesty 's preserver , implored you to save . 
Still further , these men were my friends . 
They did not attack your majesty , they succumbed to your blind anger . 
Besides , why were they not allowed to escape ? 
What crime had they committed ? 
I admit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct . 
But why suspect me before the action ? 
Why surround me with spies ? 
Why disgrace me before the army ? 
Why me , in whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who for thirty years have been attached to your person , and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion - for it must be said , now that I am accused - why reduce me to see three thousand of the king 's soldiers march in battle against two men ? '' 
`` One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me ! '' 
said the king , in a hollow voice , `` and that it was no merit of theirs I was not lost . '' 
`` Sire , one would imagine you forget that I was there . '' 
`` Enough , Monsieur d'Artagnan , enough of these dominating interests which arise to keep the sun itself from my interests . 
I am founding a state in which there shall be but one master , as I promised you ; the moment is at hand for me to keep my promise . 
You wish to be , according to your tastes or private friendships , free to destroy my plans and save my enemies ? 
I will thwart you or will drop you - seek a more compliant master . 
I know full well that another king would not conduct himself as I do , and would allow himself to be dominated by you , at the risk of sending you some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest ; but I have an excellent memory , and for me , services are sacred titles to gratitude , to impunity . 
You shall only have this lesson , Monsieur d'Artagnan , as the punishment of your want of discipline , and I will not imitate my predecessors in anger , not having imitated them in favor . 
And , then , other reasons make me act mildly towards you ; in the first place , because you are a man of sense , a man of excellent sense , a man of heart , and that you will be a capital servant to him who shall have mastered you ; secondly , because you will cease to have any motives for insubordination . 
Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me . 
These supports on which your capricious mind instinctively relied I have caused to disappear . 
At this moment , my soldiers have taken or killed the rebels of Belle-Isle . '' 
D'Artagnan became pale . 
`` Taken or killed ! '' 
cried he . 
`` Oh ! 
sire , if you thought what you tell , if you were sure you were telling me the truth , I should forget all that is just , all that is magnanimous in your words , to call you a barbarous king , and an unnatural man . 
But I pardon you these words , '' said he , smiling with pride ; `` I pardon them to a young prince who does not know , who can not comprehend what such men as M. d'Herblay , M. du Vallon , and myself are . 
Taken or killed ! 
Ah ! 
Ah ! 
sire ! 
tell me , if the news is true , how much has it cost you in men and money . 
We will then reckon if the game has been worth the stakes . '' 
As he spoke thus , the king went up to him in great anger , and said , `` Monsieur d'Artagnan , your replies are those of a rebel ! 
Tell me , if you please , who is king of France ? 
Do you know any other ? '' 
`` Sire , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , coldly , `` I very well remember that one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many people who did not answer to it , whilst I , on my part , did answer to it . 
If I recognized my king on that day , when the thing was not easy , I think it would be useless to ask the question of me now , when your majesty and I are alone . '' 
At these words Louis cast down his eyes . 
It appeared to him that the shade of the unfortunate Philippe passed between D'Artagnan and himself , to evoke the remembrance of that terrible adventure . 
Almost at the same moment an officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the king , who , in his turn , changed color , while reading it . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` what I learn here you would know later ; it is better I should tell you , and that you should learn it from the mouth of your king . 
A battle has taken place at Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , with a calm air , though his heart was beating fast enough to choke him . 
`` Well , sire ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur - and I have lost a hundred and ten men . '' 
A beam of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D'Artagnan . 
`` And the rebels ? '' 
said he . 
`` The rebels have fled , '' said the king . 
D'Artagnan could not restrain a cry of triumph . 
`` Only , '' added the king , `` I have a fleet which closely blockades Belle-Isle , and I am certain not a bark can escape . '' 
`` So that , '' said the musketeer , brought back to his dismal idea , `` if these two gentlemen are taken - '' `` They will be hanged , '' said the king , quietly . 
`` And do they know it ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan , repressing his trembling . 
`` They know it , because you must have told them yourself ; and all the country knows it . '' 
`` Then , sire , they will never be taken alive , I will answer for that . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the king , negligently , and taking up his letter again . 
`` Very well , they will be dead , then , Monsieur d'Artagnan , and that will come to the same thing , since I should only take them to have them hanged . '' 
D'Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow . 
`` I have told you , '' pursued Louis XIV. , `` that I would one day be an affectionate , generous , and constant master . 
You are now the only man of former times worthy of my anger or my friendship . 
I will not spare you either sentiment , according to your conduct . 
Could you serve a king , Monsieur d'Artagnan , who should have a hundred kings , his equals , in the kingdom ? 
Could I , tell me , do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate ? 
Did you ever see an artist effect great works with an unworthy tool ? 
Far from us , monsieur , the old leaven of feudal abuse ! 
The Fronde , which threatened to ruin monarchy , has emancipated it . 
I am master at home , Captain d'Artagnan , and I shall have servants who , lacking , perhaps , your genius , will carry devotion and obedience to the verge of heroism . 
Of what consequence , I ask you , of what consequence is it that God has given no sense to arms and legs ? 
It is to the head he has given genius , and the head , you know , the rest obey . 
I am the head . '' 
D'Artagnan started . 
Louis XIV . 
continued as if he had seen nothing , although this emotion had not by any means escaped him . 
`` Now , let us conclude between us two the bargain I promised to make with you one day when you found me in a very strange predicament at Blois . 
Do me justice , monsieur , when you admit I do not make any one pay for the tears of shame that I then shed . 
Look around you ; lofty heads have bowed . 
Bow yours , or choose such exile as will suit you . 
Perhaps , when reflecting upon it , you will find your king has a generous heart , who reckons sufficiently upon your loyalty to allow you to leave him dissatisfied , when you possess a great state secret . 
You are a brave man ; I know you to be so . 
Why have you judged me prematurely ? 
Judge me from this day forward , D'Artagnan , and be as severe as you please . '' 
D'Artagnan remained bewildered , mute , undecided for the first time in his life . 
At last he had found an adversary worthy of him . 
This was no longer trick , it was calculation ; no longer violence , but strength ; no longer passion , but will ; no longer boasting , but council . 
This young man who had brought down a Fouquet , and could do without a D'Artagnan , deranged the somewhat headstrong calculations of the musketeer . 
`` Come , let us see what stops you ? '' 
said the king , kindly . 
`` You have given in your resignation ; shall I refuse to accept it ? 
I admit that it may be hard for such an old captain to recover lost good-humor . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied D'Artagnan , in a melancholy tone , `` that is not my most serious care . 
I hesitate to take back my resignation because I am old in comparison with you , and have habits difficult to abandon . 
Henceforward , you must have courtiers who know how to amuse you - madmen who will get themselves killed to carry out what you call your great works . 
Great they will be , I feel - but , if by chance I should not think them so ? 
I have seen war , sire , I have seen peace ; I have served Richelieu and Mazarin ; I have been scorched with your father , at the fire of Rochelle ; riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve , having grown a new skin ten times , as serpents do . 
After affronts and injustices , I have a command which was formerly something , because it gave the bearer the right of speaking as he liked to his king . 
But your captain of the musketeers will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors . 
Truly , sire , if that is to be my employment from this time , seize the opportunity of our being on good terms , to take it from me . 
Do not imagine that I bear malice ; no , you have tamed me , as you say ; but it must be confessed that in taming me you have lowered me ; by bowing me you have convicted me of weakness . 
If you knew how well it suits me to carry my head high , and what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your carpets ! 
Oh ! 
sire , I regret sincerely , and you will regret as I do , the old days when the king of France saw in every vestibule those insolent gentlemen , lean , always swearing - cross-grained mastiffs , who could bite mortally in the hour of danger or of battle . 
These men were the best of courtiers to the hand which fed them - they would lick it ; but for the hand that struck them , oh ! 
the bite that followed ! 
A little gold on the lace of their cloaks , a slender stomach in their hauts-de-chausses , a little sparkling of gray in their dry hair , and you will behold the handsome dukes and peers , the haughty marechaux of France . 
But why should I tell you all this ? 
The king is master ; he wills that I should make verses , he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his ante - chambers with satin shoes . 
Mordioux ! 
that is difficult , but I have got over greater difficulties . 
I will do it . 
Why should I do it ? 
Because I love money ? 
- I have enough . 
Because I am ambitious ? 
- my career is almost at an end . 
Because I love the court ? 
No . 
I will remain here because I have been accustomed for thirty years to go and take the orderly word of the king , and to have said to me ` Good evening , D'Artagnan , ' with a smile I did not beg for . 
That smile I will beg for ! 
Are you content , sire ? '' 
And D'Artagnan bowed his silver head , upon which the smiling king placed his white hand with pride . 
`` Thanks , my old servant , my faithful friend , '' said he . 
`` As , reckoning from this day , I have no longer any enemies in France , it remains with me to send you to a foreign field to gather your marshal 's baton . 
Depend upon me for finding you an opportunity . 
In the meanwhile , eat of my very best bread , and sleep in absolute tranquillity . '' 
`` That is all kind and well ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , much agitated . 
`` But those poor men at Belle-Isle ? 
One of them , in particular - so good ! 
so brave ! 
so true ! '' 
`` Do you ask their pardon of me ? '' 
`` Upon my knees , sire ! '' 
`` Well ! 
then , go and take it to them , if it be still in time . 
But do you answer for them ? '' 
`` With my life , sire . '' 
`` Go , then . 
To-morrow I set out for Paris . 
Return by that time , for I do not wish you to leave me in the future . '' 
`` Be assured of that , sire , '' said D'Artagnan , kissing the royal hand . 
And with a heart swelling with joy , he rushed out of the castle on his way to Belle-Isle . 
: M. Fouquet 's Friends . 
The king had returned to Paris , and with him D'Artagnan , who , in twenty - four hours , having made with greatest care all possible inquiries at Belle-Isle , succeeded in learning nothing of the secret so well kept by the heavy rock of Locmaria , which had fallen on the heroic Porthos . 
The captain of the musketeers only knew what those two valiant men - these two friends , whose defense he had so nobly taken up , whose lives he had so earnestly endeavored to save - aided by three faithful Bretons , had accomplished against a whole army . 
He had seen , spread on the neighboring heath , the human remains which had stained with clouted blood the scattered stones among the flowering broom . 
He learned also that a bark had been seen far out at sea , and that , like a bird of prey , a royal vessel had pursued , overtaken , and devoured the poor little bird that was flying with such palpitating wings . 
But there D'Artagnan 's certainties ended . 
The field of supposition was thrown open . 
Now , what could he conjecture ? 
The vessel had not returned . 
It is true that a brisk wind had prevailed for three days ; but the corvette was known to be a good sailer and solid in its timbers ; it had no need to fear a gale of wind , and it ought , according to the calculation of D'Artagnan , to have either returned to Brest , or come back to the mouth of the Loire . 
Such was the news , ambiguous , it is true , but in some degree reassuring to him personally , which D'Artagnan brought to Louis XIV. , when the king , followed by all the court , returned to Paris . 
Louis , satisfied with his success - Louis , more mild and affable as he felt himself more powerful - had not ceased for an instant to ride beside the carriage door of Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
Everybody was anxious to amuse the two queens , so as to make them forget this abandonment by son and husband . 
Everything breathed the future , the past was nothing to anybody . 
Only that past was like a painful bleeding wound to the hearts of certain tender and devoted spirits . 
Scarcely was the king reinstalled in Paris , when he received a touching proof of this . 
Louis XIV . 
had just risen and taken his first repast when his captain of the musketeers presented himself before him . 
D'Artagnan was pale and looked unhappy . 
The king , at the first glance , perceived the change in a countenance generally so unconcerned . 
`` What is the matter , D'Artagnan ? '' 
said he . 
`` Sire , a great misfortune has happened to me . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
what is that ? '' 
`` Sire , I have lost one of my friends , M. du Vallon , in the affair of Belle-Isle . '' 
And , while speaking these words , D'Artagnan fixed his falcon eye upon Louis XIV. , to catch the first feeling that would show itself . 
`` I knew it , '' replied the king , quietly . 
`` You knew it , and did not tell me ! '' 
cried the musketeer . 
`` To what good ? 
Your grief , my friend , was so well worthy of respect . 
It was my duty to treat it gently . 
To have informed you of this misfortune , which I knew would pain you so greatly , D'Artagnan , would have been , in your eyes , to have triumphed over you . 
Yes , I knew that M. du Vallon had buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria ; I knew that M. d'Herblay had taken one of my vessels with its crew , and had compelled it to convey him to Bayonne . 
But I was willing you should learn these matters in a direct manner , in order that you might be convinced my friends are with me respected and sacred ; that always in me the man will sacrifice himself to subjects , whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men to majesty and power . '' 
`` But , sire , how could you know ? '' 
`` How do you yourself know , D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` By this letter , sire , which M. d'Herblay , free and out of danger , writes me from Bayonne . '' 
`` Look here , '' said the king , drawing from a casket placed upon the table closet to the seat upon which D'Artagnan was leaning , `` here is a letter copied exactly from that of M. d'Herblay . 
Here is the very letter , which Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours . 
I am well served , you may perceive . '' 
`` Yes , sire , '' murmured the musketeer , `` you were the only man whose star was equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two friends . 
You have used your power , sire , you will not abuse it , will you ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan , '' said the king , with a smile beaming with kindness , `` I could have M. d'Herblay carried off from the territories of the king of Spain , and brought here , alive , to inflict justice upon him . 
But , D'Artagnan , be assured I will not yield to this first and natural impulse . 
He is free - let him continue free . '' 
`` Oh , sire ! 
you will not always remain so clement , so noble , so generous as you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d'Herblay ; you will have about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging me to pursue rigorous measures . 
The advice to spare M. d'Herblay comes from Colbert himself . '' 
`` Oh , sire ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , extremely surprised . 
`` As for you , '' continued the king , with a kindness very uncommon to him , `` I have several pieces of good news to announce to you ; but you shall know them , my dear captain , the moment I have made my accounts all straight . 
I have said that I wish to make , and would make , your fortune ; that promise will soon become reality . '' 
`` A thousand times thanks , sire ! 
I can wait . 
But I implore you , whilst I go and practice patience , that your majesty will deign to notice those poor people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber , and come humbly to lay a petition at your feet . '' 
`` Who are they ? '' 
`` Enemies of your majesty . '' 
The king raised his head . 
`` Friends of M. Fouquet , '' added D'Artagnan . 
`` Their names ? '' 
`` M. Gourville , M. Pelisson , and a poet , M. Jean de la Fontaine . '' 
The king took a moment to reflect . 
`` What do they want ? '' 
`` I do not know . '' 
`` How do they appear ? '' 
`` In great affliction . '' 
`` What do they say ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` What do they do ? '' 
`` They weep . '' 
`` Let them come in , '' said the king , with a serious brow . 
D'Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel , raised the tapestry which closed the entrance to the royal chamber , and directing his voice to the adjoining room , cried , `` Enter . '' 
The three men D'Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of the cabinet in which were the king and his captain . 
A profound silence prevailed in their passage . 
The courtiers , at the approach of the friends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances , drew back , as if fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune . 
D'Artagnan , with a quick step , came forward to take by the hand the unhappy men who stood trembling at the door of the cabinet ; he led them in front of the king 's fauteuil , who , having placed himself in the embrasure of a window , awaited the moment of presentation , and was preparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic reception . 
The first of the friends of Fouquet 's to advance was Pelisson . 
He did not weep , but his tears were only restrained that the king might better hear his voice and prayer . 
Gourville bit his lips to check his tears , out of respect for the king . 
La Fontaine buried his face in his handkerchief , and the only signs of life he gave were the convulsive motions of his shoulders , raised by his sobs . 
The king preserved his dignity . 
His countenance was impassible . 
He even maintained the frown which appeared when D'Artagnan announced his enemies . 
He made a gesture which signified , `` Speak ; '' and he remained standing , with his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding men . 
Pelisson bowed to the ground , and La Fontaine knelt as people do in churches . 
This dismal silence , disturbed only by sighs and groans , began to excite in the king , not compassion , but impatience . 
`` Monsieur Pelisson , '' said he , in a sharp , dry tone . 
`` Monsieur Gourville , and you , Monsieur - '' and he did not name La Fontaine , `` I can not , without sensible displeasure , see you come to plead for one of the greatest criminals it is the duty of justice to punish . 
A king does not allow himself to soften save at the tears of the innocent , the remorse of the guilty . 
I have no faith either in the remorse of M. Fouquet or the tears of his friends , because the one is tainted to the very heart , and the others ought to dread offending me in my own palace . 
For these reasons , I beg you , Monsieur Pelisson , Monsieur Gourville , and you , Monsieur - , to say nothing that will not plainly proclaim the respect you have for my will . '' 
`` Sire , '' replied Pelisson , trembling at these words , `` we are come to say nothing to your majesty that is not the most profound expression of the most sincere respect and love that are due to a king from all his subjects . 
Your majesty 's justice is redoubtable ; every one must yield to the sentences it pronounces . 
We respectfully bow before it . 
Far from us the idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend your majesty . 
He who has incurred your displeasure may be a friend of ours , but he is an enemy to the state . 
We abandon him , but with tears , to the severity of the king . '' 
`` Besides , '' interrupted the king , calmed by that supplicating voice , and those persuasive words , `` my parliament will decide . 
I do not strike without first having weighed the crime ; my justice does not wield the sword without employing first a pair of scales . '' 
`` Therefore we have every confidence in that impartiality of the king , and hope to make our feeble voices heard , with the consent of your majesty , when the hour for defending an accused friend strikes . '' 
`` In that case , messieurs , what do you ask of me ? '' 
said the king , with his most imposing air . 
`` Sire , '' continued Pelisson , `` the accused has a wife and family . 
The little property he had was scarcely sufficient to pay his debts , and Madame Fouquet , since her husband 's captivity , is abandoned by everybody . 
The hand of your majesty strikes like the hand of God . 
When the Lord sends the curse of leprosy or pestilence into a family , every one flies and shuns the abode of the leprous or plague-stricken . 
Sometimes , but very rarely , a generous physician alone ventures to approach the ill-reputed threshold , passes it with courage , and risks his life to combat death . 
He is the last resource of the dying , the chosen instrument of heavenly mercy . 
Sire , we supplicate you , with clasped hands and bended knees , as a divinity is supplicated ! 
Madame Fouquet has no longer any friends , no longer any means of support ; she weeps in her deserted home , abandoned by all those who besieged its doors in the hour of prosperity ; she has neither credit nor hope left . 
At least , the unhappy wretch upon whom your anger falls receives from you , however culpable he may be , his daily bread though moistened by his tears . 
As much afflicted , more destitute than her husband , Madame Fouquet - the lady who had the honor to receive your majesty at her table - Madame Fouquet , the wife of the ancient superintendent of your majesty 's finances , Madame Fouquet has no longer bread . '' 
Here the mortal silence which had chained the breath of Pelisson 's two friends was broken by an outburst of sobs ; and D'Artagnan , whose chest heaved at hearing this humble prayer , turned round towards the angle of the cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan . 
The king had preserved his eye dry and his countenance severe ; but the blood had mounted to his cheeks , and the firmness of his look was visibly diminished . 
`` What do you wish ? '' 
said he , in an agitated voice . 
`` We come humbly to ask your majesty , '' replied Pelisson , upon whom emotion was fast gaining , `` to permit us , without incurring the displeasure of your majesty , to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand pistoles collected among the old friends of her husband , in order that the widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life . '' 
At the word widow , pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still alive , the king turned very pale ; - his pride disappeared ; pity rose from his heart to his lips ; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt sobbing at his feet . 
`` God forbid , '' said he , `` that I should confound the innocent with the guilty . 
They know me but ill who doubt my mercy towards the weak . 
I strike none but the arrogant . 
Do , messieurs , do all that your hearts counsel you to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet . 
Go , messieurs - go ! '' 
The three now rose in silence with dry eyes . 
The tears had been scorched away by contact with their burning cheeks and eyelids . 
They had not the strength to address their thanks to the king , who himself cut short their solemn reverences by entrenching himself suddenly behind the fauteuil . 
D'Artagnan remained alone with the king . 
`` Well , '' said he , approaching the young prince , who interrogated him with his look . 
`` Well , my master ! 
If you had not the device which belongs to your sun , I would recommend you one which M. Conrart might translate into eclectic Latin , ` Calm with the lowly ; stormy with the strong . ' '' 
The king smiled , and passed into the next apartment , after having said to D'Artagnan , `` I give you the leave of absence you must want to put the affairs of your friend , the late M. du Vallon , in order . '' 
: Porthos 's Will . 
At Pierrefonds everything was in mourning . 
The courts were deserted - the stables closed - the parterres neglected . 
In the basins , the fountains , formerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy , had stopped of themselves . 
Along the roads around the chateau came a few grave personages mounted on mules or country nags . 
These were rural neighbors , cures and bailiffs of adjacent estates . 
All these people entered the chateau silently , handed their horses to a melancholy-looking groom , and directed their steps , conducted by a huntsman in black , to the great dining-room , where Mousqueton received them at the door . 
Mousqueton had become so thin in two days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill - fitting scabbard in which the sword-blade dances at each motion . 
His face , composed of red and white , like that of the Madonna of Vandyke , was furrowed by two silver rivulets which had dug their beds in his cheeks , as full formerly as they had become flabby since his grief began . 
At each fresh arrival , Mousqueton found fresh tears , and it was pitiful to see him press his throat with his fat hand to keep from bursting into sobs and lamentations . 
All these visits were for the purpose of hearing the reading of Porthos 's will , announced for that day , and at which all the covetous friends of the dead man were anxious to be present , as he had left no relations behind him . 
The visitors took their places as they arrived , and the great room had just been closed when the clock struck twelve , the hour fixed for the reading of the important document . 
Porthos 's procureur - and that was naturally the successor of Master Coquenard - commenced by slowly unfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had traced his sovereign will . 
The seal broken - the spectacles put on - the preliminary cough having sounded - every one pricked up his ears . 
Mousqueton had squatted himself in a corner , the better to weep and the better to hear . 
All at once the folding-doors of the great room , which had been shut , were thrown open as if by magic , and a warlike figure appeared upon the threshold , resplendent in the full light of the sun . 
This was D'Artagnan , who had come alone to the gate , and finding nobody to hold his stirrup , had tied his horse to the knocker and announced himself . 
The splendor of daylight invading the room , the murmur of all present , and , more than all , the instinct of the faithful dog , drew Mousqueton from his reverie ; he raised his head , recognized the old friend of his master , and , screaming with grief , he embraced his knees , watering the floor with his tears . 
D'Artagnan raised the poor intendant , embraced him as if he had been a brother , and , having nobly saluted the assembly , who all bowed as they whispered to each other his name , he went and took his seat at the extremity of the great carved oak hall , still holding by the hand poor Mousqueton , who was suffocating with excess of woe , and sank upon the steps . 
Then the procureur , who , like the rest , was considerably agitated , commenced . 
Porthos , after a profession of faith of the most Christian character , asked pardon of his enemies for all the injuries he might have done them . 
At this paragraph , a ray of inexpressible pride beamed from the eyes of D'Artagnan . 
He recalled to his mind the old soldier ; all those enemies of Porthos brought to earth by his valiant hand ; he reckoned up the numbers of them , and said to himself that Porthos had acted wisely , not to enumerate his enemies or the injuries done to them , or the task would have been too much for the reader . 
Then came the following schedule of his extensive lands : `` I possess at this present time , by the grace of God - `` 1 . 
The domain of Pierrefonds , lands , woods , meadows , waters , and forests , surrounded by good walls . 
`` 2 . 
The domain of Bracieux , chateaux , forests , plowed lands , forming three farms . 
`` 3 . 
The little estate Du Vallon , so named because it is in the valley . '' 
-LRB- Brave Porthos ! -RRB- 
`` 4 . 
Fifty farms in Touraine , amounting to five hundred acres . 
`` 5 . 
Three mills upon the Cher , bringing in six hundred livres each . 
`` 6 . 
Three fish-pools in Berry , producing two hundred livres a year . 
`` As to my personal or movable property , so called because it can be moved , as is so well explained by my learned friend the bishop of Vannes - '' -LRB- D'Artagnan shuddered at the dismal remembrance attached to that name -RRB- - the procureur continued imperturbably - `` they consist - '' `` 1 . 
In goods which I can not detail here for want of room , and which furnish all my chateaux or houses , but of which the list is drawn up by my intendant . '' 
Every one turned his eyes towards Mousqueton , who was still lost in grief . 
`` 2 . 
In twenty horses for saddle and draught , which I have particularly at my chateau of Pierrefonds , and which are called - Bayard , Roland , Charlemagne , Pepin , Dunois , La Hire , Ogier , Samson , Milo , Nimrod , Urganda , Armida , Flastrade , Dalilah , Rebecca , Yolande , Finette , Grisette , Lisette , and Musette . 
`` 3 . 
In sixty dogs , forming six packs , divided as follows : the first , for the stag ; the second , for the wolf ; the third , for the wild boar ; the fourth , for the hare ; and the two others , for setters and protection . 
`` 4 . 
In arms for war and the chase contained in my gallery of arms . 
`` 5 . 
My wines of Anjou , selected for Athos , who liked them formerly ; my wines of Burgundy , Champagne , Bordeaux , and Spain , stocking eight cellars and twelve vaults , in my various houses .
