`` I tell you he will do it . '' 
`` He may ; but I will go and help him . '' 
`` To be sure you will ; I reckoned upon you , and still further believe that when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Athos , shaking his head . 
`` Patience ! 
patience ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , permit us to take our leave . '' 
`` Begone , then , and may my good luck attend you . '' 
`` Adieu ! 
monseigneur ; and may your own good luck attend you likewise . '' 
`` Here is an expedition admirably commenced ! '' 
said Athos to his son . 
`` No provisions - no store flotilla ! 
What can be done , thus ? '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
murmured Raoul ; `` if all are going to do as I am , provisions will not be wanted . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Athos , sternly , `` do not be unjust and senseless in your egotism , or your grief , whichever you please to call it . 
If you set out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein , you stand in need of nobody , and it was scarcely worth while to recommend you to M. de Beaufort . 
But when you have been introduced to the prime commandant - when you have accepted the responsibility of a post in his army , the question is no longer about you , but about all those poor soldiers , who , as well as you , have hearts and bodies , who will weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their condition . 
Remember , Raoul , that officers are ministers as useful to the world as priests , and that they ought to have more charity . '' 
`` Monsieur , I know it and have practiced it ; I would have continued to do so still , but - '' `` You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military glory ; go and die if you like , but do not die without honor and without advantage to France . 
Cheer up , Raoul ! 
do not let my words grieve you ; I love you , and wish to see you perfect . '' 
`` I love your reproaches , monsieur , '' said the young man , mildly ; `` they alone may cure me , because they prove to me that some one loves me still . '' 
`` And now , Raoul , let us be off ; the weather is so fine , the heavens so clear , those heavens which we always find above our heads , which you will see more clear still at Gigelli , and which will speak to you of me there , as they speak to me here of God . '' 
The two gentlemen , after having agreed on this point , talked over the wild freaks of the duke , convinced that France would be served in a very incomplete manner , as regarded both spirit and practice , in the ensuing expedition ; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word vanity , they set forward , in obedience rather to their will than destiny . 
The sacrifice was half accomplished . 
: The Silver Dish . 
The journey passed off pretty well . 
Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon . 
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D'Artagnan . 
His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . 
Athos knew from experience that D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair , whether on his own account or on the service of the king . 
He even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . 
And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the flotilla , and got together the chalands and lighters to send them to Toulon , one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark . 
Athos , believing that this man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish , and so gain more money when all his companions were gone , insisted upon having the details . 
The fisherman informed him that six days previously , a man had come in the night to hire his boat , for the purpose of visiting the island of St. Honnorat . 
The price was agreed upon , but the gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case , which he insisted upon embarking , in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the operation . 
The fisherman wished to retract . 
He had even threatened , but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the gentleman 's cane , which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long . 
Swearing and grumbling , he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes , who administer justice among themselves and protect each other ; but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper , at sight of which the syndic , bowing to the very ground , enjoined obedience from the fisherman , and abused him for having been refractory . 
They then departed with the freight . 
`` But all this does not tell us , '' said Athos , `` how you injured your boat . '' 
`` This is the way . 
I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman desired me ; but he changed his mind , and pretended that I could not pass to the south of the abbey . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
`` Because , monsieur , there is in front of the square tower of the Benedictines , towards the southern point , the bank of the Moines . '' 
`` A rock ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` Level with the water , but below water ; a dangerous passage , yet one I have cleared a thousand times ; the gentleman required me to land him at Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur ! '' 
cried the fisherman , with his Provencal accent , `` a man is a sailor , or he is not ; he knows his course , or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber . 
I was obstinate , and wished to try the channel . 
The gentleman took me by the collar , and told me quietly he would strangle me . 
My mate armed himself with a hatchet , and so did I . 
We had the affront of the night before to pay him out for . 
But the gentleman drew his sword , and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner , that we neither of us could get near him . 
I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head , and I had a right to do so , had n't I , monsieur ? 
for a sailor aboard is master , as a citizen is in his chamber ; I was going , then , in self-defense , to cut the gentleman in two , when , all at once - believe me or not , monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself , I do n't know how , and there came out of it a sort of a phantom , his head covered with a black helmet and a black mask , something terrible to look upon , which came towards me threatening with its fist . '' 
`` And that was - '' said Athos . 
`` That was the devil , monsieur ; for the gentleman , with great glee , cried out , on seeing him : ` Ah ! 
thank you , monseigneur ! ' '' 
`` A most strange story ! '' 
murmured the comte , looking at Raoul . 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
asked the latter of the fisherman . 
`` You must know , monsieur , that two poor men , such as we are , could be no match for two gentlemen ; but when one of them turned out to be the devil , we had no earthly chance ! 
My companion and I did not stop to consult one another ; we made but one jump into the sea , for we were within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore . '' 
`` Well , and then ? '' 
`` Why , and then , monseigneur , as there was a little wind from the southwest , the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Oh ! 
- but the travelers ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
you need not be uneasy about them ! 
It was pretty plain that one was the devil , and protected the other ; for when we recovered the boat , after she got afloat again , instead of finding these two creatures injured by the shock , we found nothing , not even the carriage or the case . '' 
`` Very strange ! 
very strange ! '' 
repeated the comte . 
`` But after that , what did you do , my friend ? '' 
`` I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite 's , who brought my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would have me flogged . '' 
`` What ! 
did the governor himself say so ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; and yet my boat was injured , seriously injured , for the prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite 's , and the carpenter asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it . '' 
`` Very well , '' replied Raoul ; `` you will be exempted from the service . 
Go . '' 
`` We will go to Sainte-Marguerite 's , shall we ? '' 
said the comte to Bragelonne , as the man walked away . 
`` Yes , monsieur , for there is something to be cleared up ; that man does not seem to me to have told the truth . '' 
`` Nor to me either , Raoul . 
The story of the masked man and the carriage having disappeared , may be told to conceal some violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea , to punish him for his persistence in embarking . '' 
`` I formed the same suspicion ; the carriage was more likely to contain property than a man . '' 
`` We shall see to that , Raoul . 
The gentleman very much resembles D'Artagnan ; I recognize his methods of proceeding . 
Alas ! 
we are no longer the young invincibles of former days . 
Who knows whether the hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which the best blades of Europe , balls , and bullets have not been able to do in forty years ? '' 
That same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite 's , on board a chasse - maree come from Toulon under orders . 
The impression they experienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one . 
The island seemed loaded with flowers and fruits . 
In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor . 
Orange , pomegranate , and fig trees bent beneath the weight of their golden or purple fruits . 
All round this garden , in the uncultivated parts , red partridges ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers , and at every step of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the burrow . 
In fact , this fortunate isle was uninhabited . 
Flat , offering nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation , and under the protection of the governor , who went shares with them , smugglers made use of it as a provisional entrepot , at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden . 
With this compromise , the governor was in a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his fortress , in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green . 
The governor was a sort of happy farmer , harvesting wines , figs , oil , and oranges , preserving his citrons and cedrates in the sun of his casemates . 
The fortress , encircled by a deep ditch , its only guardian , arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by terraces covered with moss . 
Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding any one to introduce them to the governor . 
They ended by making their own way into the garden . 
It was at the hottest time of the day . 
Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone . 
The heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises , to envelop all existences ; the rabbit under the broom , the fly under the leaf , slept as the wave did beneath the heavens . 
Athos saw nothing living but a soldier , upon the terrace beneath the second and third court , who was carrying a basket of provisions on his head . 
This man returned almost immediately without his basket , and disappeared in the shade of his sentry-box . 
Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one , and , after having done so , returned to dine himself . 
All at once they heard some one call out , and raising their heads , perceived in the frame of the bars of the window something of a white color , like a hand that was waved backwards and forwards - something shining , like a polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun . 
And before they were able to ascertain what it was , a luminous train , accompanied by a hissing sound in the air , called their attention from the donjon to the ground . 
A second dull noise was heard from the ditch , and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand . 
The hand that had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen , and then disappeared . 
Athos and Raoul , approaching each other , commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate , and they discovered , in characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife , this inscription : `` I am the brother of the king of France - a prisoner to-day - a madman to-morrow . 
French gentlemen and Christians , pray to God for the soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers . '' 
The plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to make out the meaning of these dismal words . 
At the same moment they heard a cry from the top of the donjon . 
Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his head , and forced down that of his father likewise . 
A musket - barrel glittered from the crest of the wall . 
A white smoke floated like a plume from the mouth of the musket , and a ball was flattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen . 
`` Cordieu ! '' 
cried Athos . 
`` What , are people assassinated here ? 
Come down , cowards as you are ! '' 
`` Yes , come down ! '' 
cried Raoul , furiously shaking his fist at the castle . 
One of the assailants - he who was about to fire - replied to these cries by an exclamation of surprise ; and , as his companion , who wished to continue the attack , had re-seized his loaded musket , he who had cried out threw up the weapon , and the ball flew into the air . 
Athos and Raoul , seeing them disappear from the platform , expected they would come down to them , and waited with a firm demeanor . 
Five minutes had not elapsed , when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms , and they showed themselves on the other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand . 
At the head of these men was an officer , whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket . 
The man ordered the soldiers to `` make ready . '' 
`` We are going to be shot ! '' 
cried Raoul ; `` but , sword in hand , at least , let us leap the ditch ! 
We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels , when their muskets are empty . '' 
And , suiting the action to the word , Raoul was springing forward , followed by Athos , when a well-known voice resounded behind them , `` Athos ! 
Raoul ! '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the two gentlemen . 
`` Recover arms ! 
Mordioux ! '' 
cried the captain to the soldiers . 
`` I was sure I could not be mistaken ! '' 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` What ! 
were we to be shot without warning ? '' 
`` It was I who was going to shoot you , and if the governor missed you , I should not have missed you , my dear friends . 
How fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim , instead of firing at the instant I raise my weapon ! 
I thought I recognized you . 
Ah ! 
my dear friends , how fortunate ! '' 
And D'Artagnan wiped his brow , for he had run fast , and emotion with him was not feigned . 
`` How ! '' 
said Athos . 
`` And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress ? '' 
`` In person . '' 
`` And why did he fire at us ? 
What have we done to him ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
You received what the prisoner threw to you ? '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` That plate - the prisoner has written something on it , has he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
I was afraid he had . '' 
And D'Artagnan , with all the marks of mortal disquietude , seized the plate , to read the inscription . 
When he had read it , a fearful pallor spread across his countenance . 
`` Oh ! 
good heavens ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` Silence ! 
- Here is the governor . '' 
`` And what will he do to us ? 
Is it our fault ? '' 
`` It is true , then ? '' 
said Athos , in a subdued voice . 
`` It is true ? '' 
`` Silence ! 
I tell you - silence ! 
If he only believes you can read ; if he only suspects you have understood ; I love you , my dear friends , I would willingly be killed for you , but - '' `` But - '' said Athos and Raoul . 
`` But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from death . 
Silence , then ! 
Silence again ! '' 
The governor came up , having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge . 
`` Well ! '' 
said he to D'Artagnan , `` what stops us ? '' 
`` You are Spaniards - you do not understand a word of French , '' said the captain , eagerly , to his friends in a low voice . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied he , addressing the governor , `` I was right ; these gentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres , last year ; they do n't know a word of French . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , sharply . 
`` And yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan took it out of his hands , effacing the characters with the point of his sword . 
`` How ! '' 
cried the governor , `` what are you doing ? 
I can not read them now ! '' 
`` It is a state secret , '' replied D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and as you know that , according to the king 's orders , it is under the penalty of death any one should penetrate it , I will , if you like , allow you to read it , and have you shot immediately afterwards . '' 
During this apostrophe - half serious , half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the coolest , most unconcerned silence . 
`` But , is it possible , '' said the governor , `` that these gentlemen do not comprehend at least some words ? '' 
`` Suppose they do ! 
If they do understand a few spoken words , it does not follow that they should understand what is written . 
They can not even read Spanish . 
A noble Spaniard , remember , ought never to know how to read . '' 
The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations , but he was still tenacious . 
`` Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress , '' said he . 
`` That I will willingly do . 
I was about to propose it to you . '' 
The fact is , the captain had quite another idea , and would have wished his friends a hundred leagues off . 
But he was obliged to make the best of it . 
He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish , giving them a polite invitation , which they accepted . 
They all turned towards the entrance of the fort , and , the incident being at an end , the eight soldiers returned to their delightful leisure , for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure . 
: Captive and Jailers . 
When they had entered the fort , and whilst the governor was making some preparations for the reception of his guests , `` Come , '' said Athos , `` let us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone . '' 
`` It is simply this , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` I have conducted hither a prisoner , who the king commands shall not be seen . 
You came here , he has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window ; I was at dinner with the governor , I saw the object thrown , and I saw Raoul pick it up . 
It does not take long to understand this . 
I understood it , and I thought you in intelligence with my prisoner . 
And then - '' `` And then - you commanded us to be shot . '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I admit it ; but , if I was the first to seize a musket , fortunately , I was the last to take aim at you . '' 
`` If you had killed me , D'Artagnan , I should have had the good fortune to die for the royal house of France , and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you , its noblest and most loyal defender . '' 
`` What the devil , Athos , do you mean by the royal house ? '' 
stammered D'Artagnan . 
`` You do n't mean that you , a well-informed and sensible man , can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot ? '' 
`` I do believe in it . '' 
`` With so much the more reason , my dear chevalier , from your having orders to kill all those who do believe in it , '' said Raoul . 
`` That is because , '' replied the captain of the musketeers - `` because every calumny , however absurd it may be , has the almost certain chance of becoming popular . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , '' replied Athos , promptly ; `` but because the king is not willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people , and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` Do not talk in such a childish manner , Athos , or I shall begin to think you have lost your senses . 
Besides , explain to me how it is possible Louis XIII . 
should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite . '' 
`` A son whom you have brought hither masked , in a fishing-boat , '' said Athos . 
`` Why not ? '' 
D'Artagnan was brought to a pause . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he ; `` whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ? '' 
`` Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite 's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur . 
Oh ! 
I am acquainted with all that , '' resumed the comte . 
D'Artagnan bit his mustache . 
`` If it were true , '' said he , `` that I had brought hither in a boat and with a carriage a masked prisoner , nothing proves that this prisoner must be a prince - a prince of the house of France . '' 
`` Ask Aramis such riddles , '' replied Athos , coolly . 
`` Aramis , '' cried the musketeer , quite at a stand . 
`` Have you seen Aramis ? '' 
`` After his discomfiture at Vaux , yes ; I have seen Aramis , a fugitive , pursued , bewildered , ruined ; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan 's head sunk on his breast in some confusion . 
`` This is the way , '' said he , `` in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom ! 
A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered fragments ! 
Athos , cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face with me in this affair ! 
for now - '' `` Well , '' said Athos , with his customary mild severity , `` is your secret lost because I know it ? 
Consult your memory , my friend . 
Have I not borne secrets heavier than this ? '' 
`` You have never borne one so dangerous , '' replied D'Artagnan , in a tone of sadness . 
`` I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die , and die unhappily . '' 
`` The will of God be done ! '' 
said Athos , `` but here is your governor . '' 
D'Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . 
The governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards D'Artagnan with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . 
With respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer , and never taking his eye from them . 
Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks , or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage . 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable , if the governor did not believe it to be quite true . 
They rose from the table to repose awhile . 
`` What is this man 's name ? 
I do n't like the looks of him , '' said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish . 
`` De Saint-Mars , '' replied the captain . 
`` He is , then , I suppose , the prince 's jailer ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
how can I tell ? 
I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , not you ! '' 
`` My friend , I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a desert . 
He would like to carry it away , but he can not ; he would like to leave it , but he dares not . 
The king will not dare to recall me , for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do ; he regrets not having me near him , from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person as myself . 
But it will happen as it may please God . '' 
`` But , '' observed Raoul , `` your not being certain proves that your situation here is provisional , and you will return to Paris ? '' 
`` Ask these gentlemen , '' interrupted the governor , `` what was their purpose in coming to Saint-Marguerite ? '' 
`` They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte - Honnorat which is considered curious ; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the island . '' 
`` That is quite at their service , as well as yours , '' replied Saint-Mars . 
D'Artagnan politely thanked him . 
`` When will they depart ? '' 
added the governor . 
`` To-morrow , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds , and left D'Artagnan alone with the pretended Spaniards . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed the musketeer , `` here is a life and a society that suits me very little . 
I command this man , and he bores me , mordioux ! 
Come , let us have a shot or two at the rabbits ; the walk will be beautiful , and not fatiguing . 
The whole island is but a league and a half in length , with the breadth of a league ; a real park . 
Let us try to amuse ourselves . '' 
`` As you please , D'Artagnan ; not for the sake of amusing ourselves , but to gain an opportunity for talking freely . '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign to a soldier , who brought the gentlemen some guns , and then returned to the fort . 
`` And now , '' said the musketeer , `` answer me the question put to you by that black-looking Saint-Mars : what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles ? '' 
`` To bid you farewell . '' 
`` Bid me farewell ! 
What do you mean by that ? 
Is Raoul going anywhere ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` With M. de Beaufort it is , my dear friend . 
You always guess correctly . '' 
`` From habit . '' 
Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation , Raoul , with his head hanging down and his heart oppressed , seated himself on a mossy rock , his gun across his knees , looking at the sea - looking at the heavens , and listening to the voice of his soul ; he allowed the sportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him . 
D'Artagnan remarked his absence . 
`` He has not recovered the blow ? '' 
said he to Athos . 
`` He is struck to death . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your fears exaggerate , I hope . 
Raoul is of a tempered nature . 
Around all hearts as noble as his , there is a second envelope that forms a cuirass . 
The first bleeds , the second resists . '' 
`` No , '' replied Athos , `` Raoul will die of it . '' 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , in a melancholy tone . 
And he did not add a word to this exclamation . 
Then , a minute after , `` Why do you let him go ? '' 
`` Because he insists on going . '' 
`` And why do you not go with him ? '' 
`` Because I could not bear to see him die . '' 
D'Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face . 
`` You know one thing , '' continued the comte , leaning upon the arm of the captain ; `` you know that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things . 
Well ! 
I have an incessant gnawing , insurmountable fear that an hour will come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan ; `` oh ! '' 
`` He will die , I know , I have a perfect conviction of that ; but I would not see him die . '' 
`` How is this , Athos ? 
you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man , you say you have ever seen , of your own D'Artagnan , of that man without an equal , as you formerly called him , and you come and tell him , with your arms folded , that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son , you who have seen all that can be seen in this world ! 
Why have you this fear , Athos ? 
Man upon this earth must expect everything , and ought to face everything . '' 
`` Listen to me , my friend . 
After having worn myself out upon this earth of which you speak , I have preserved but two religions : that of life , friendship , my duty as a father - that of eternity , love , and respect for God . 
Now , I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence -- oh ! 
no , I can not even tell you , D'Artagnan ! '' 
`` Speak , speak , tell me ! '' 
`` I am strong against everything , except against the death of those I love . 
For that only there is no remedy . 
He who dies , gains ; he who sees others die , loses . 
No , this is it - to know that I should no more meet on earth him whom I now behold with joy ; to know that there would nowhere be a D'Artagnan any more , nowhere again be a Raoul , oh ! 
I am old , look you , I have no longer courage ; I pray God to spare me in my weakness ; but if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion , I should curse him . 
A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God , D'Artagnan ; it is enough to once have cursed a king ! '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
sighed D'Artagnan , a little confused by this violent tempest of grief . 
`` Let me speak to him , Athos . 
Who knows ? '' 
`` Try , if you please , but I am convinced you will not succeed . '' 
`` I will not attempt to console him . 
I will serve him . '' 
`` You will ? '' 
`` Doubtless , I will . 
Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity ? 
I will go to him , I tell you . '' 
Athos shook his head , and continued his walk alone , D'Artagnan , cutting across the brambles , rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him . 
`` Well , Raoul ! 
You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I have a kindness to ask of you , '' replied Bragelonne . 
`` Ask it , then . '' 
`` You will some day return to France ? '' 
`` I hope so . '' 
`` Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere ? '' 
`` No , you must not . '' 
`` But I have many things to say to her . '' 
`` Go and say them to her , then . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
`` Pray , what virtue do you attribute to a letter , which your speech might not possess ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . '' 
`` She loves the king , '' said D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and she is an honest girl . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` And you , you whom she abandons , she , perhaps , loves better than she does the king , but after another fashion . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , do you believe she loves the king ? '' 
`` To idolatry . 
Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling . 
You might continue to live near her , and would be her best friend . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a hideous hope . 
`` Will you do so ? '' 
`` It would be base . '' 
`` That is a very absurd word , which would lead me to think slightly of your understanding . 
Please to understand , Raoul , that it is never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force . 
If your heart says to you , ` Go there , or die , ' why go , Raoul . 
Was she base or brave , she whom you loved , in preferring the king to you , the king whom her heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you ? 
No , she was the bravest of women . 
Do , then , as she has done . 
Oblige yourself . 
Do you know one thing of which I am sure , Raoul ? '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Why , that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man - '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Well ! 
you would cease to love her . '' 
`` Then I am decided , my dear D'Artagnan . '' 
`` To set off to see her again ? '' 
`` No ; to set off that I may never see her again . 
I wish to love her forever . '' 
`` Ha ! 
I must confess , '' replied the musketeer , `` that is a conclusion which I was far from expecting . '' 
`` This is what I wish , my friend . 
You will see her again , and you will give her a letter which , if you think proper , will explain to her , as to yourself , what is passing in my heart . 
Read it ; I drew it up last night . 
Something told me I should see you to-day . '' 
He held the letter out , and D'Artagnan read : `` MADEMOISELLE , - You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me . 
You have only been guilty of one fault towards me , that of having left me to believe you loved me . 
This error will cost me my life . 
I pardon you , but I can not pardon myself . 
It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers . 
It will not be so with you , who did not love me , save with anxiety . 
I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love , you would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death , or lessening the esteem I had for you . 
It is much more delightful to me to die , knowing that you are free and satisfied . 
How much , then , will you love me , when you will no longer fear either my presence or reproaches ? 
You will love me , because , however charming a new love may appear to you , God has not made me in anything inferior to him you have chosen , and because my devotedness , my sacrifice , and my painful end will assure me , in your eyes , a certain superiority over him . 
I have allowed to escape , in the candid credulity of my heart , the treasure I possessed . 
Many people tell me that you loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much . 
That idea takes from my mind all bitterness , and leads me only to blame myself . 
You will accept this last farewell , and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished , and where all love endures forever . 
Adieu , mademoiselle . 
If your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood , I would shed that drop . 
I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery ! 
`` RAOUL , VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE . '' 
`` The letter reads very well , '' said the captain . 
`` I have only one fault to find with it . '' 
`` Tell me what that is ! '' 
said Raoul . 
`` Why , it is that it tells everything , except the thing which exhales , like a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart ; except the senseless love which still consumes you . '' 
Raoul grew paler , but remained silent . 
`` Why did you not write simply these words : '' ` MADEMOISELLE , - Instead of cursing you , I love you and I die . ' '' 
`` That is true , '' exclaimed Raoul , with a sinister kind of joy . 
And tearing the letter he had just taken back , he wrote the following words upon a leaf of his tablets : `` To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you , I commit the baseness of writing to you ; and to punish myself for that baseness , I die . '' 
And he signed it . 
`` You will give her these tablets , captain , will you not ? '' 
`` When ? '' 
asked the latter . 
`` On the day , '' said Bragelonne , pointing to the last sentence , `` on the day when you can place a date under these words . '' 
And he sprang away quickly to join Athos , who was returning with slow steps . 
As they re-entered the fort , the sea rose with that rapid , gusty vehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean ; the ill-humor of the element became a tempest . 
Something shapeless , and tossed about violently by the waves , appeared just off the coast . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Athos , - `` a wrecked boat ? '' 
`` No , it is not a boat , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Raoul , `` there is a bark gaining the port rapidly . '' 
`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . '' 
`` Your advice is good , Athos , and I will this night have it carried out , or rather , I will carry it out myself ; but let us go in , for the rain falls heavily , and the lightning is terrific . '' 
As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key , they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by the prisoner . 
Upon a sign from D'Artagnan , they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` You will see . 
Look . 
The prisoner is returning from chapel . '' 
And they saw , by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky , they saw pass gravely , at six paces behind the governor , a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of polished steel , soldered to a helmet of the same nature , which altogether enveloped the whole of his head . 
The fire of the heavens cast red reflections on the polished surface , and these reflections , flying off capriciously , seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate , instead of imprecations . 
In the middle of the gallery , the prisoner stopped for a moment , to contemplate the infinite horizon , to respire the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest , to drink in thirstily the hot rain , and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan . 
`` Come on , monsieur , '' said Saint-Mars , sharply , to the prisoner , for he already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls . 
`` Monsieur , come on ! '' 
`` Say monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , from his corner , with a voice so solemn and terrible , that the governor trembled from head to foot . 
Athos insisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty . 
The prisoner turned round . 
`` Who spoke ? '' 
asked Saint-Mars . 
`` It was I , '' replied D'Artagnan , showing himself promptly . 
`` You know that is the order . '' 
`` Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur , '' said the prisoner in his turn , in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul ; `` call me ACCURSED ! '' 
He passed on , and the iron door croaked after him . 
`` There goes a truly unfortunate man ! '' 
murmured the musketeer in a hollow whisper , pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince . 
: Promises . 
Scarcely had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends , when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him . 
The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea , and which appeared so eager to gain the port , came to Sainte-Marguerite with an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers . 
On opening it , D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king : `` I should think , '' said Louis XIV. , `` you will have completed the execution of my orders , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; return , then , immediately to Paris , and join me at the Louvre . '' 
`` There is the end of my exile ! '' 
cried the musketeer with joy ; `` God be praised , I am no longer a jailer ! '' 
And he showed the letter to Athos . 
`` So , then , you must leave us ? '' 
replied the latter , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Yes , but to meet again , dear friend , seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone with M. de Beaufort , and will prefer his father going back in company with M. d'Artagnan , to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere ; will you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' stammered the latter , with an expression of tender regret . 
`` No , no , my friend , '' interrupted Athos , `` I will never quit Raoul till the day his vessel disappears on the horizon . 
As long as he remains in France he shall not be separated from me . '' 
`` As you please , dear friend ; but we will , at least , leave Sainte - Marguerite together ; take advantage of the bark that will convey me back to Antibes . '' 
`` With all my heart ; we can not too soon be at a distance from this fort , and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now . '' 
The three friends quitted the little isle , after paying their respects to the governor , and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took their farewell of the white walls of the fort . 
D'Artagnan parted from his friend that same night , after having seen fire set to the carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars , according to the advice the captain had given him . 
Before getting on horseback , and after leaving the arms of Athos : `` My friends , '' said he , `` you bear too much resemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post . 
Something warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank . 
Will you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a hundred good muskets ?
