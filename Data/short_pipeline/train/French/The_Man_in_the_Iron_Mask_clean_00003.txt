And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner . 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming , and addressing Moliere , said to him , in an undertone , `` You see before you , my dear monsieur , a man who considers himself disgraced , if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him ; study this type for me , Master Aristophanes , and profit by it . '' 
Moliere had no need of encouragement , and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` if you will come with me , I will make them take your measure without touching you . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos , `` how do you make that out , my friend ? '' 
`` I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your dress . 
It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of quality , who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them . 
We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these - '' `` Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin . 
Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , laughing , `` and do we write no more poems now , either ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
D'Artagnan , '' exclaimed Aramis , `` I have long ago given up all such tomfoolery . '' 
`` True , '' repeated D'Artagnan , only half convinced . 
As for Percerin , he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades . 
`` Do n't you perceive , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` that we are greatly boring this good gentleman , my dear D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
murmured the musketeer , aside ; `` that is , I am boring you , my friend . '' 
Then aloud , `` Well , then , let us leave ; I have no further business here , and if you are as disengaged as I , Aramis - '' `` No , not I - I wished - '' `` Ah ! 
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , - `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before . 
Percerin never moved . 
Aramis roused him violently , by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was engaged . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said he , `` I have , near hand , M. Lebrun , one of M. Fouquet 's painters . '' 
`` Ah , very good , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` but why Lebrun ? '' 
Aramis looked at D'Artagnan , who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark Antony . 
`` And you wish that I should make him a dress , similar to those of the Epicureans ? '' 
answered Percerin . 
And while saying this , in an absent manner , the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade . 
`` An Epicurean 's dress ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , in a tone of inquiry . 
`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . '' 
`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how - do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! '' 
`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the attentive musketeer ; perceiving with his wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now , and that the hour of battle was approaching . 
`` Let us see , '' said Percerin , incredulously . 
`` Why , now , '' continued Aramis , `` does M. Fouquet give the king a fete ? 
- Is it not to please him ? '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said Percerin . 
D'Artagnan nodded assent . 
`` By delicate attentions ? 
by some happy device ? 
by a succession of surprises , like that of which we were talking ? 
- the enrolment of our Epicureans . '' 
`` Admirable . '' 
`` Well , then ; this is the surprise we intend . 
M. Lebrun here is a man who draws most excellently . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Percerin ; `` I have seen his pictures , and observed that his dresses were highly elaborated . 
That is why I at once agreed to make him a costume - whether to agree with those of the Epicureans , or an original one . '' 
`` My dear monsieur , we accept your offer , and shall presently avail ourselves of it ; but just now , M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you will make for himself , but of those you are making for the king . '' 
Percerin made a bound backwards , which D'Artagnan - calmest and most appreciative of men , did not consider overdone , so many strange and startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded . 
`` The king 's dresses ! 
Give the king 's dresses to any mortal whatever ! 
Oh ! 
for once , monseigneur , your grace is mad ! '' 
cried the poor tailor in extremity . 
`` Help me now , D'Artagnan , '' said Aramis , more and more calm and smiling . 
`` Help me now to persuade monsieur , for you understand ; do you not ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! 
- not exactly , I declare . '' 
`` What ! 
you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux ; and that the portrait , which be a striking resemblance , ought to be dressed exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
yes , yes , '' said the musketeer , nearly convinced , so plausible was this reasoning . 
`` Yes , my dear Aramis , you are right ; it is a happy idea . 
I will wager it is one of your own , Aramis . '' 
`` Well , I do n't know , '' replied the bishop ; `` either mine or M. Fouquet 's . '' 
Then scanning Percerin , after noticing D'Artagnan 's hesitation , `` Well , Monsieur Percerin , '' he asked , `` what do you say to this ? '' 
`` I say , that - '' `` That you are , doubtless , free to refuse . 
I know well - and I by no means count upon compelling you , my dear monsieur . 
I will say more , I even understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet 's idea ; you dread appearing to flatter the king . 
A noble spirit , M. Percerin , a noble spirit ! '' 
The tailor stammered . 
`` It would , indeed , be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince , '' continued Aramis ; `` but as the surintendant told me , ` if Percerin refuse , tell him that it will not at all lower him in my opinion , and I shall always esteem him , only - ' '' '' ` Only ? ' '' 
repeated Percerin , rather troubled . '' 
` Only , ' '' continued Aramis , '' ' I shall be compelled to say to the king , ' -- you understand , my dear Monsieur Percerin , that these are M. Fouquet 's words , - ' I shall be constrained to say to the king , `` Sire , I had intended to present your majesty with your portrait , but owing to a feeling of delicacy , slightly exaggerated perhaps , although creditable , M. Percerin opposed the project . '' ' '' 
`` Opposed ! '' 
cried the tailor , terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him ; `` I to oppose the desire , the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to please the king ! 
Oh , what a hateful word you have uttered , monseigneur . 
Oppose ! 
Oh , 't is not I who said it , Heaven have mercy on me . 
I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it ! 
Is it not true , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that I have opposed nothing ? '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral . 
He felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it , whether comedy or tragedy ; he was at his wit 's end at not being able to fathom it , but in the meanwhile wished to keep clear . 
But already Percerin , goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he stood in the way of a pleasant surprise , had offered Lebrun a chair , and proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses , the fifth being still in the workmen 's hands ; and these masterpieces he successively fitted upon four lay figures , which , imported into France in the time of Concini , had been given to Percerin II . 
by Marshal d'Onore , after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their competition . 
The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses . 
But Aramis , who was closely watching all the phases of his toil , suddenly stopped him . 
`` I think you have not quite got it , my dear Lebrun , '' he said ; `` your colors will deceive you , and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance which is absolutely requisite . 
Time is necessary for attentively observing the finer shades . '' 
`` Quite true , '' said Percerin , `` but time is wanting , and on that head , you will agree with me , monseigneur , I can do nothing . '' 
`` Then the affair will fail , '' said Aramis , quietly , `` and that because of a want of precision in the colors . '' 
Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity - a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience . 
`` What in the world , now , is the meaning of this imbroglio ? '' 
the musketeer kept saying to himself . 
`` That will never do , '' said Aramis : `` M. Lebrun , close your box , and roll up your canvas . '' 
`` But , monsieur , '' cried the vexed painter , `` the light is abominable here . '' 
`` An idea , M. Lebrun , an idea ! 
If we had a pattern of the materials , for example , and with time , and a better light - '' `` Oh , then , '' cried Lebrun , `` I would answer for the effect . '' 
`` Good ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing ; they want a pattern of each of the materials . 
Mordioux ! 
Will this Percerin give in now ? '' 
Percerin , beaten from his last retreat , and duped , moreover , by the feigned good-nature of Aramis , cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes . 
`` I like this better . 
That is your opinion , is it not ? '' 
said Aramis to D'Artagnan . 
`` My dear Aramis , '' said D'Artagnan , `` my opinion is that you are always the same . '' 
`` And , consequently , always your friend , '' said the bishop in a charming tone . 
`` Yes , yes , '' said D'Artagnan , aloud ; then , in a low voice , `` If I am your dupe , double Jesuit that you are , I will not be your accomplice ; and to prevent it , 't is time I left this place . 
- Adieu , Aramis , '' he added aloud , `` adieu ; I am going to rejoin Porthos . '' 
`` Then wait for me , '' said Aramis , pocketing the patterns , `` for I have done , and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend . '' 
Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes , Percerin put back the dresses into the closet , Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were secure , - and they all left the study . 
: Where , Probably , Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme . 
D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber ; but no longer an irritated Porthos , or a disappointed Porthos , but Porthos radiant , blooming , fascinating , and chattering with Moliere , who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry , and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater , but not even ever anything so great . 
Aramis went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand , which lost itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend , - an operation which Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness . 
But the friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him , the bishop of Vannes passed over to Moliere . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said he , `` will you come with me to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` I will go anywhere you like , monseigneur , '' answered Moliere . 
`` To Saint-Mande ! '' 
cried Porthos , surprised at seeing the proud bishop of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor . 
`` What , Aramis , are you going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` our work is pressing . '' 
`` And besides , my dear Porthos , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` M. Moliere is not altogether what he seems . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Why , this gentleman is one of M. Percerin 's chief clerks , and is expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the Epicureans . '' '' 
'T is precisely so , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Come , then , my dear M. Moliere , '' said Aramis , `` that is , if you have done with M. du Vallon . '' 
`` We have finished , '' replied Porthos . 
`` And you are satisfied ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Completely so , '' replied Porthos . 
Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony , and grasped the hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him . 
`` Pray , monsieur , '' concluded Porthos , mincingly , `` above all , be exact . '' 
`` You will have your dress the day after to-morrow , monsieur le baron , '' answered Moliere . 
And he left with Aramis . 
Then D'Artagnan , taking Porthos 's arm , `` What has this tailor done for you , my dear Porthos , '' he asked , `` that you are so pleased with him ? '' 
`` What has he done for me , my friend ! 
done for me ! '' 
cried Porthos , enthusiastically . 
`` Yes , I ask you , what has he done for you ? '' 
`` My friend , he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished : he has taken my measure without touching me ! '' 
`` Ah , bah ! 
tell me how he did it . '' 
`` First , then , they went , I do n't know where , for a number of lay figures , of all heights and sizes , hoping there would be one to suit mine , but the largest - that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard - was two inches too short , and a half foot too narrow in the chest . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` It is exactly as I tell you , D'Artagnan ; but he is a great man , or at the very least a great tailor , is this M. Moliere . 
He was not at all put at fault by the circumstance . '' 
`` What did he do , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is a very simple matter . 
I ` faith , 't is an unheard-of thing that people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method from the first . 
What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared me ! '' 
`` Not to mention of the costumes , my dear Porthos . '' 
`` Yes , thirty dresses . '' 
`` Well , my dear Porthos , come , tell me M. Moliere 's plan . '' 
`` Moliere ? 
You call him so , do you ? 
I shall make a point of recollecting his name . '' 
`` Yes ; or Poquelin , if you prefer that . '' 
`` No ; I like Moliere best . 
When I wish to recollect his name , I shall think of voliere -LSB- an aviary -RSB- ; and as I have one at Pierrefonds - '' `` Capital ! '' 
returned D'Artagnan . 
`` And M. Moliere 's plan ? '' '' 
'T is this : instead of pulling me to pieces , as all these rascals do - of making me bend my back , and double my joints - all of them low and dishonorable practices - '' D'Artagnan made a sign of approbation with his head . '' 
` Monsieur , ' he said to me , '' continued Porthos , '' ' a gentleman ought to measure himself . 
Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass ; ' and I drew near the glass . 
I must own I did not exactly understand what this good M. Voliere wanted with me . '' 
`` Moliere ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , Moliere - Moliere . 
And as the fear of being measured still possessed me , ` Take care , ' said I to him , ` what you are going to do with me ; I am very ticklish , I warn you . ' 
But he , with his soft voice -LRB- for he is a courteous fellow , we must admit , my friend -RRB- , he with his soft voice , ` Monsieur , ' said he , ` that your dress may fit you well , it must be made according to your figure . 
Your figure is exactly reflected in this mirror . 
We shall take the measure of this reflection . ' '' 
`` In fact , '' said D'Artagnan , `` you saw yourself in the glass ; but where did they find one in which you could see your whole figure ? '' 
`` My good friend , it is the very glass in which the king is used to look to see himself . '' 
`` Yes ; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are . '' 
`` Ah ! 
well , I know not how that may be ; it is , no doubt , a cunning way of flattering the king ; but the looking-glass was too large for me . 
'T is true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of glass , placed one above another , and its breadth of three similar parallelograms in juxtaposition . '' 
`` Oh , Porthos ! 
what excellent words you have command of . 
Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary ? '' 
`` At Belle-Isle . 
Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic studies and castramentative experiments . '' 
D'Artagnan recoiled , as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked the breath out of his body . 
`` Ah ! 
very good . 
Let us return to the looking-glass , my friend . '' 
`` Then , this good M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Yes - Moliere - you are right . 
You will see now , my dear friend , that I shall recollect his name quite well . 
This excellent M. Moliere set to work tracing out lines on the mirror , with a piece of Spanish chalk , following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders , all the while expounding this maxim , which I thought admirable : ` It is advisable that a dress should not incommode its wearer . ' '' 
`` In reality , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is an excellent maxim , which is , unfortunately , seldom carried out in practice . '' 
`` That is why I found it all the more astonishing , when he expatiated upon it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he expatiated ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
`` Let me hear his theory . '' '' 
` Seeing that , ' he continued , ` one may , in awkward circumstances , or in a troublesome position , have one 's doublet on one 's shoulder , and not desire to take one 's doublet off - ' '' `` True , '' said D'Artagnan . '' 
` And so , ' continued M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Moliere , yes . 
` And so , ' went on M. Moliere , ` you want to draw your sword , monsieur , and you have your doublet on your back . 
What do you do ? ' '' ' 
I take it off , ' I answered . '' 
` Well , no , ' he replied . '' 
` How no ? ' '' ' 
I say that the dress should be so well made , that it will in no way encumber you , even in drawing your sword . ' '' 
` Ah , ah ! ' '' 
` Throw yourself on guard , ' pursued he . 
`` I did it with such wondrous firmness , that two panes of glass burst out of the window . '' '' 
Tis nothing , nothing , ' said he . 
` Keep your position . ' 
`` I raised my left arm in the air , the forearm gracefully bent , the ruffle drooping , and my wrist curved , while my right arm , half extended , securely covered my wrist with the elbow , and my breast with the wrist . '' 
`` Yes , '' said D'Artagnan , '' 't is the true guard - the academic guard . '' 
`` You have said the very word , dear friend . 
In the meanwhile , Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Hold ! 
I should certainly , after all , prefer to call him - what did you say his other name was ? '' 
`` Poquelin . '' 
`` I prefer to call him Poquelin . '' 
`` And how will you remember this name better than the other ? '' 
`` You understand , he calls himself Poquelin , does he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard . '' 
`` Good . '' 
`` And change Coc into Poc , nard into lin ; and instead of Coquenard I shall have Poquelin . '' '' 
'T is wonderful , '' cried D'Artagnan , astounded . 
`` Go on , my friend , I am listening to you with admiration . '' 
`` This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass . '' 
`` I beg your pardon - Poquelin . '' 
`` What did I say , then ? '' 
`` You said Coquelin . '' 
`` Ah ! 
true . 
This Poquelin , then , sketched my arm on the glass ; but he took his time over it ; he kept looking at me a good deal . 
The fact is , that I must have been looking particularly handsome . '' '' 
` Does it weary you ? ' 
he asked . '' ' 
A little , ' I replied , bending a little in my hands , ` but I could hold out for an hour or so longer . ' '' 
` No , no , I will not allow it ; the willing fellows will make it a duty to support your arms , as of old , men supported those of the prophet . ' '' 
` Very good , ' I answered . '' 
` That will not be humiliating to you ? ' '' 
` My friend , ' said I , ` there is , I think , a great difference between being supported and being measured . ' '' 
`` The distinction is full of the soundest sense , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Then , '' continued Porthos , `` he made a sign : two lads approached ; one supported my left arm , while the other , with infinite address , supported my right . '' '' 
` Another , my man , ' cried he . 
A third approached . 
` Support monsieur by the waist , ' said he . 
The garcon complied . '' 
`` So that you were at rest ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Perfectly ; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass . '' 
`` Poquelin , my friend . '' 
`` Poquelin - you are right . 
Stay , decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere . '' 
`` Yes ; and then it was over , was n't it ? '' 
`` During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror . '' '' 
'T was delicate in him . '' 
`` I much like the plan ; it is respectful , and keeps every one in his place . '' 
`` And there it ended ? '' 
`` Without a soul having touched me , my friend . '' 
`` Except the three garcons who supported you . '' 
`` Doubtless ; but I have , I think , already explained to you the difference there is between supporting and measuring . '' '' 
'T is true , '' answered D'Artagnan ; who said afterwards to himself , `` I ` faith , I greatly deceive myself , or I have been the means of a good windfall to that rascal Moliere , and we shall assuredly see the scene hit off to the life in some comedy or other . '' 
Porthos smiled . 
`` What are you laughing at ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Must I confess ? 
Well , I was laughing over my good fortune . '' 
`` Oh , that is true ; I do n't know a happier man than you . 
But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you ? ' 
`` Well , my dear fellow , congratulate me . '' 
`` I desire nothing better . '' 
`` It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that manner . '' 
`` Are you so sure of it ? ' 
`` Nearly so . 
Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere and the other garcons showed me the fact . '' 
`` Well , my friend , that does not surprise me from Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . '' 
`` Wo n't it be of use to him , indeed ? 
I believe you , it will , and that in the highest degree ; - for you see my friend Moliere is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons , comtes , and marquises - according to their measure . '' 
On this observation , neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss , D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin 's house and rejoined their carriages , wherein we will leave them , in order to look after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande . 
: The Bee-Hive , the Bees , and the Honey . 
The bishop of Vannes , much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin 's , returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor . 
Moliere , on the other hand , quite delighted at having made such a capital rough sketch , and at knowing where to find his original again , whenever he should desire to convert his sketch into a picture , Moliere arrived in the merriest of moods . 
All the first story of the left wing was occupied by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris , and those on the freest footing in the house - every one in his compartment , like the bees in their cells , employed in producing the honey intended for that royal cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV . 
during the fete at Vaux . 
Pelisson , his head leaning on his hand , was engaged in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the `` Facheux , '' a comedy in three acts , which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere , as D'Artagnan called him , or Coquelin de Voliere , as Porthos styled him . 
Loret , with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer , - the gazetteers of all ages have always been so artless ! 
- Loret was composing an account of the fetes at Vaux , before those fetes had taken place . 
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other , a peripatetic , absent - minded , boring , unbearable dreamer , who kept buzzing and humming at everybody 's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions . 
He so often disturbed Pelisson , that the latter , raising his head , crossly said , `` At least , La Fontaine , supply me with a rhyme , since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus . '' 
`` What rhyme do you want ? '' 
asked the Fabler as Madame de Sevigne used to call him . 
`` I want a rhyme to lumiere . '' 
`` Orniere , '' answered La Fontaine . 
`` Ah , but , my good friend , one can not talk of wheel-ruts when celebrating the delights of Vaux , '' said Loret . 
`` Besides , it does n't rhyme , '' answered Pelisson . 
`` What ! 
does n't rhyme ! '' 
cried La Fontaine , in surprise . 
`` Yes ; you have an abominable habit , my friend , - a habit which will ever prevent your becoming a poet of the first order . 
You rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , oh , you think so , do you , Pelisson ? '' 
`` Yes , I do , indeed . 
Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one can find a better . '' 
`` Then I will never write anything again save in prose , '' said La Fontaine , who had taken up Pelisson 's reproach in earnest . 
`` Ah ! 
I often suspected I was nothing but a rascally poet ! 
Yes , 't is the very truth . '' 
`` Do not say so ; your remark is too sweeping , and there is much that is good in your ` Fables . ' '' 
`` And to begin , '' continued La Fontaine , following up his idea , `` I will go and burn a hundred verses I have just made . '' 
`` Where are your verses ? '' 
`` In my head . '' 
`` Well , if they are in your head you can not burn them . '' 
`` True , '' said La Fontaine ; `` but if I do not burn them - '' `` Well , what will happen if you do not burn them ? '' 
`` They will remain in my mind , and I shall never forget them ! '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
cried Loret ; `` what a dangerous thing ! 
One would go mad with it ! '' 
`` The deuce ! 
the deuce ! '' 
repeated La Fontaine ; `` what can I do ? '' 
`` I have discovered the way , '' said Moliere , who had entered just at this point of the conversation . 
`` What way ? '' 
`` Write them first and burn them afterwards . '' 
`` How simple ! 
Well , I should never have discovered that . 
What a mind that devil of a Moliere has ! '' 
said La Fontaine . 
Then , striking his forehead , `` Oh , thou wilt never be aught but an ass , Jean La Fontaine ! '' 
he added . 
`` What are you saying there , my friend ? '' 
broke in Moliere , approaching the poet , whose aside he had heard . 
`` I say I shall never be aught but an ass , '' answered La Fontaine , with a heavy sigh and swimming eyes . 
`` Yes , my friend , '' he added , with increasing grief , `` it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , 't is wrong to say so . '' 
`` Nay , I am a poor creature ! '' 
`` Who said so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
't was Pelisson ; did you not , Pelisson ? '' 
Pelisson , again absorbed in his work , took good care not to answer . 
`` But if Pelisson said you were so , '' cried Moliere , `` Pelisson has seriously offended you . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I advise you , as you are a gentleman , not to leave an insult like that unpunished . '' 
`` What ! '' 
exclaimed La Fontaine . 
`` Did you ever fight ? '' 
`` Once only , with a lieutenant in the light horse . '' 
`` What wrong had he done you ? '' 
`` It seems he ran away with my wife . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Moliere , becoming slightly pale ; but as , at La Fontaine 's declaration , the others had turned round , Moliere kept upon his lips the rallying smile which had so nearly died away , and continuing to make La Fontaine speak - `` And what was the result of the duel ? '' 
`` The result was , that on the ground my opponent disarmed me , and then made an apology , promising never again to set foot in my house . '' 
`` And you considered yourself satisfied ? '' 
said Moliere . 
`` Not at all ! 
on the contrary , I picked up my sword . ' 
I beg your pardon , monsieur , ' I said , ' I have not fought you because you were my wife 's friend , but because I was told I ought to fight . 
So , as I have never known any peace save since you made her acquaintance , do me the pleasure to continue your visits as heretofore , or morbleu ! 
let us set to again . ' 
And so , '' continued La Fontaine , `` he was compelled to resume his friendship with madame , and I continue to be the happiest of husbands . '' 
All burst out laughing . 
Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes . 
Why ? 
Perhaps to wipe away a tear , perhaps to smother a sigh . 
Alas ! 
we know that Moliere was a moralist , but he was not a philosopher . '' 
'T is all one , '' he said , returning to the topic of the conversation , `` Pelisson has insulted you . '' 
`` Ah , truly ! 
I had already forgotten it . '' 
`` And I am going to challenge him on your behalf . '' 
`` Well , you can do so , if you think it indispensable . '' 
`` I do think it indispensable , and I am going to - '' `` Stay , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` I want your advice . '' 
`` Upon what ? 
this insult ? '' 
`` No ; tell me really now whether lumiere does not rhyme with orniere . '' 
`` I should make them rhyme . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I knew you would . '' 
`` And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time . '' 
`` A hundred thousand ! '' 
cried La Fontaine . 
`` Four times as many as ` La Pucelle , ' which M. Chaplain is meditating . 
Is it also on this subject , too , that you have composed a hundred thousand verses ? '' 
`` Listen to me , you eternally absent-minded creature , '' said Moliere . 
`` It is certain , '' continued La Fontaine , `` that legume , for instance , rhymes with posthume . '' 
`` In the plural , above all . '' 
`` Yes , above all in the plural , seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters , but with four ; as orniere does with lumiere . '' 
`` But give me ornieres and lumieres in the plural , my dear Pelisson , '' said La Fontaine , clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend , whose insult he had quite forgotten , `` and they will rhyme . '' 
`` Hem ! '' 
coughed Pelisson . 
`` Moliere says so , and Moliere is a judge of such things ; he declares he has himself made a hundred thousand verses . '' 
`` Come , '' said Moliere , laughing , `` he is off now . '' 
`` It is like rivage , which rhymes admirably with herbage . 
I would take my oath of it . '' 
`` But - '' said Moliere . 
`` I tell you all this , '' continued La Fontaine , `` because you are preparing a divertissement for Vaux , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , the ` Facheux . ' '' 
`` Ah , yes , the ` Facheux ; ' yes , I recollect . 
Well , I was thinking a prologue would admirably suit your divertissement . '' 
`` Doubtless it would suit capitally . '' 
`` Ah ! 
you are of my opinion ? '' 
`` So much so , that I have asked you to write this very prologue . '' 
`` You asked me to write it ? '' 
`` Yes , you , and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson , who is engaged upon it at this moment . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is what Pelisson is doing , then ? 
I ` faith , my dear Moliere , you are indeed often right . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` When you call me absent-minded . 
It is a monstrous defect ; I will cure myself of it , and do your prologue for you . '' 
`` But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it ! 
- '' `` Ah , true , miserable rascal that I am ! 
Loret was indeed right in saying I was a poor creature . '' 
`` It was not Loret who said so , my friend . '' 
`` Well , then , whoever said so , 't is the same to me ! 
And so your divertissement is called the ` Facheux ? ' 
Well , can you make heureux rhyme with facheux ? '' 
`` If obliged , yes . '' 
`` And even with capriceux . '' 
`` Oh , no , no . '' 
`` It would be hazardous , and yet why so ? '' 
`` There is too great a difference in the cadences . '' 
`` I was fancying , '' said La Fontaine , leaving Moliere for Loret - `` I was fancying - '' `` What were you fancying ? '' 
said Loret , in the middle of a sentence . 
`` Make haste . '' 
`` You are writing the prologue to the ` Facheux , ' are you not ? '' 
`` No ! 
mordieu ! 
it is Pelisson . '' 
`` Ah , Pelisson , '' cried La Fontaine , going over to him , `` I was fancying , '' he continued , `` that the nymph of Vaux - '' `` Ah , beautiful ! ''
