`` Since you explain yourself with such frankness , it is our duty to be frank , likewise . 
Yes , you are ruined -- yes , you are hastening to your ruin - stop . 
And , in the first place , what money have we left ? '' 
`` Seven hundred thousand livres , '' said the intendant . 
`` Bread , '' murmured Madame Fouquet . 
`` Relays , '' said Pelisson , `` relays , and fly ! '' 
`` Whither ? '' 
`` To Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly ! '' 
`` If monseigneur flies , '' said Madame Belliere , `` it will be said that he was guilty - was afraid . '' 
`` More than that , it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with me . '' 
`` We will draw up memoirs to justify you , '' said La Fontaine . 
`` Fly ! '' 
`` I will remain , '' said Fouquet . 
`` And , besides , does not everything serve me ? '' 
`` You have Belle-Isle , '' cried the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` And I am naturally going there , when going to Nantes , '' replied the superintendent . 
`` Patience , then , patience ! '' 
`` Before arriving at Nantes , what a distance ! '' 
said Madame Fouquet . 
`` Yes , I know that well , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` But what is to be done there ? 
The king summons me to the States . 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me ; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness . '' 
`` Well , I have discovered the means of reconciling everything , '' cried Pelisson . 
`` You are going to set out for Nantes . '' 
Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise . 
`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened . 
In fact , you will carry your money against all chances ; and , whilst flying , you will only have obeyed the king ; then , reaching the sea , when you like , you will embark for Belle-Isle , and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please you , like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its eyrie . '' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband . 
`` Do so , '' said Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do it ! 
do it ! '' 
cried all his friends . 
`` I will do so , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` This very evening ? '' 
`` In an hour ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune , '' said the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` And , if necessary , we will go and discover a new world , '' added La Fontaine , intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm . 
A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope . 
`` A courier from the king , '' said the master of the ceremonies . 
A profound silence immediately ensued , as if the message brought by this courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment before . 
Every one waited to see what the master would do . 
His brow was streaming with perspiration , and he was really suffering from his fever at that instant . 
He passed into his cabinet , to receive the king 's message . 
There prevailed , as we have said , such a silence in the chambers , and throughout the attendance , that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet , saying , `` That is well , monsieur . '' 
This voice was , however , broken by fatigue , and trembled with emotion . 
An instant after , Fouquet called Gourville , who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation . 
At length , he himself re-appeared among his guests ; but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them ; from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . 
A breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out , his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . 
On seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards Fouquet . 
The latter , looking at Pelisson , leaned upon his wife , and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere . 
`` Well , '' said he , in a voice which had nothing human in it . 
`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . '' 
` LOUIS . '' 
` The present letter is to serve as a receipt . ' '' 
A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment . 
`` Well , '' cried Pelisson , in his turn , `` you have received that letter ? '' 
`` Received it , yes ! '' 
`` What will you do , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , since I have received it . '' 
`` But - '' `` If I have received it , Pelisson , I have paid it , '' said the surintendant , with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present . 
`` You have paid it ! '' 
cried Madame Fouquet . 
`` Then we are ruined ! '' 
`` Come , no useless words , '' interrupted Pelisson . 
`` Next to money , life . 
Monseigneur , to horse ! 
to horse ! '' 
`` What , leave us ! '' 
at once cried both the women , wild with grief . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , in saving yourself , you save us all . 
To horse ! '' 
`` But he can not hold himself on . 
Look at him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
if he takes time to reflect - '' said the intrepid Pelisson . 
`` He is right , '' murmured Fouquet . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Gourville , rushing up the stairs , four steps at once . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
`` I escorted , as you desired , the king 's courier with the money . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
when I arrived at the Palais Royal , I saw - '' `` Take breath , my poor friend , take breath ; you are suffocating . '' 
`` What did you see ? '' 
cried the impatient friends . 
`` I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback , '' said Gourville . 
`` There , then ! '' 
cried every voice at once ; `` there , then ! 
is there an instant to be lost ? '' 
Madame Fouquet rushed downstairs , calling for her horses ; Madame de Belliere flew after her , catching her in her arms , and saying : `` Madame , in the name of his safety , do not betray anything , do not manifest alarm . '' 
Pelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages . 
And , in the meantime , Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends were able to throw into it of gold and silver - the last offering , the pious alms made to misery by poverty . 
The surintendant , dragged along by some , carried by others , was shut up in his carriage . 
Gourville took the reins , and mounted the box . 
Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet , who had fainted . 
Madame de Belliere had more strength , and was well paid for it ; she received Fouquet 's last kiss . 
Pelisson easily explained this precipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned the minister to Nantes . 
: In M. Colbert 's Carriage . 
As Gourville had seen , the king 's musketeers were mounting and following their captain . 
The latter , who did not like to be confined in his proceedings , left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant , and set off on post horses , recommending his men to use all diligence . 
However rapidly they might travel , they could not arrive before him . 
He had time , in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs , to see something which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture . 
He saw M. Colbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage , which was stationed before the door . 
In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the hoods of two women , and being rather curious , he wished to know the names of the ladies hid beneath these hoods . 
To get a glimpse at them , for they kept themselves closely covered up , he urged his horse so near the carriage , that he drove him against the step with such force as to shake everything containing and contained . 
The terrified women uttered , the one a faint cry , by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman , the other an imprecation , in which he recognized the vigor and aplomb that half a century bestows . 
The hoods were thrown back : one of the women was Madame Vanel , the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse . 
D'Artagnan 's eyes were quicker than those of the ladies ; he had seen and known them , whilst they did not recognize him ; and as they laughed at their fright , pressing each other 's hands , - `` Humph ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to friendship than formerly . 
She paying her court to the mistress of M. Colbert ! 
Poor M. Fouquet ! 
that presages you nothing good ! '' 
He rode on . 
M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes . 
Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband 's house , and , left alone with M. Colbert , chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her ride . 
She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation , that dear duchesse , and as she always talked for the ill of others , though ever with a view to her own good , her conversation amused her interlocutor , and did not fail to leave a favorable impression . 
She taught Colbert , who , poor man ! 
was ignorant of the fact , how great a minister he was , and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher . 
She promised to rally around him , when he should become surintendant , all the old nobility of the kingdom , and questioned him as to the preponderance it would be proper to allow La Valliere . 
She praised him , she blamed him , she bewildered him . 
She showed him the secret of so many secrets that , for a moment , Colbert thought he was doing business with the devil . 
She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of to - day , as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday ; and as he asked her very simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant : `` Why do you yourself hate him ? '' 
said she . 
`` Madame , in politics , '' replied he , `` the differences of system oft bring about dissentions between men . 
M. Fouquet always appeared to me to practice a system opposed to the true interests of the king . '' 
She interrupted him . 
- `` I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet . 
The journey the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of him . 
M. Fouquet , for me , is a man gone by - and for you also . '' 
Colbert made no reply . 
`` On his return from Nantes , '' continued the duchesse , `` the king , who is only anxious for a pretext , will find that the States have not behaved well - that they have made too few sacrifices . 
The States will say that the imposts are too heavy , and that the surintendant has ruined them . 
The king will lay all the blame on M. Fouquet , and then - '' `` And then ? '' 
said Colbert . 
`` Oh ! 
he will be disgraced . 
Is not that your opinion ? '' 
Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse , which plainly said : `` If M. Fouquet be only disgraced , you will not be the cause of it . '' 
`` Your place , M. Colbert , '' the duchesse hastened to say , `` must be a high place . 
Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself , after the fall of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` I do not understand , '' said he . 
`` You will understand . 
To what does your ambition aspire ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` It was useless , then , to overthrow the superintendent , Monsieur Colbert . 
It was idle . '' 
`` I had the honor to tell you , madame - '' `` Oh ! 
yes , I know , all about the interest of the king - but , if you please , we will speak of your own . '' 
`` Mine ! 
that is to say , the affairs of his majesty . '' 
`` In short , are you , or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet ? 
Answer without evasion . '' 
`` Madame , I ruin nobody . '' 
`` I am endeavoring to comprehend , then , why you purchased from me the letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet . 
Neither can I conceive why you have laid those letters before the king . '' 
Colbert , half stupefied , looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` I can less easily conceive how you , who received the money , can reproach me on that head - '' `` That is , '' said the old duchesse , `` because we must will that which we wish for , unless we are not able to obtain what we wish . '' 
`` Will ! '' 
said Colbert , quite confounded by such coarse logic . 
`` You are not able , hein ! 
Speak . '' 
`` I am not able , I allow , to destroy certain influences near the king . '' 
`` That fight in favor of M. Fouquet ? 
What are they ? 
Stop , let me help you . '' 
`` Do , madame . '' 
`` La Valliere ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
very little influence ; no knowledge of business , and small means . 
M. Fouquet has paid his court to her . '' 
`` To defend him would be to accuse herself , would it not ? '' 
`` I think it would . '' 
`` There is still another influence , what do you say to that ? '' 
`` Is it considerable ? '' 
`` The queen-mother , perhaps ? '' 
`` Her majesty , the queen-mother , has a weakness for M. Fouquet very prejudicial to her son . '' 
`` Never believe that , '' said the old duchesse , smiling . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Colbert , with incredulity , `` I have often experienced it . '' 
`` Formerly ? '' 
`` Very recently , madame , at Vaux . 
It was she who prevented the king from having M. Fouquet arrested . '' 
`` People do not forever entertain the same opinions , my dear monsieur . 
That which the queen may have wished recently , she would not wish , perhaps , to-day . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
said Colbert , astonished . 
`` Oh ! 
the reason is of very little consequence . '' 
`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? '' 
`` Bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` Well ! 
this M. d'Herblay , who also knew the secret , the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` So hotly pursued , that if he were dead , she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head , to satisfy her he would never speak again . '' 
`` And is that the desire of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` An order is given for it . '' 
`` This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for , madame . '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is well known where he is . '' 
Colbert looked at the duchesse . 
`` Say where , madame . '' 
`` He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` He shall be taken . '' 
It was now the duchesse 's turn to smile . 
`` Do not fancy the capture so easy , '' said she ; `` do not promise it so lightly . '' 
`` Why not , madame ? '' 
`` Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and where you please . '' 
`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? '' 
`` I ? 
- I ask you nothing of the kind ! '' 
`` I thought you did , madame . 
But as I have been mistaken , we will leave him alone ; the king has said nothing about him . '' 
The duchesse bit her nails . 
`` Besides , '' continued Colbert , `` what a poor capture would this bishop be ! 
A bishop game for a king ! 
Oh ! 
no , no ; I will not even take the slightest notice of him . '' 
The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself . 
`` Game for a woman ! '' 
said she . 
`` Is not the queen a woman ? 
If she wishes M. d'Herblay arrested , she has her reasons . 
Besides , is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
never mind that , '' said Colbert . 
`` This man shall be spared , if he is not the enemy of the king . 
Is that displeasing to you ? '' 
`` I say nothing . '' 
`` Yes - you wish to see him in prison , in the Bastile , for instance . '' 
`` I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` I will speak to the king about it ; he will clear up the point . '' 
`` And whilst waiting for that enlightenment , Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes will have escaped . 
I would do so . '' 
`` Escaped ! 
he ! 
and whither should he escape ? 
Europe is ours , in will , if not in fact . '' 
`` He will always find an asylum , monsieur . 
It is evident you know nothing of the man you have to do with . 
You do not know D'Herblay ; you do not know Aramis . 
He was one of those four musketeers who , under the late king , made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble , and who , during the regency , gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin . '' 
`` But , madame , what can he do , unless he has a kingdom to back him ? '' 
`` He has one , monsieur . '' 
`` A kingdom , he ! 
what , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I repeat to you , monsieur , that if he wants a kingdom , he either has it or will have it . '' 
`` Well , as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape , madame , I promise you he shall not escape . '' 
`` Belle-Isle is fortified , M. Colbert , and fortified by him . '' 
`` If Belle-Isle were also defended by him , Belle-Isle is not impregnable ; and if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle , well , madame , the place shall be besieged , and he will be taken . '' 
`` You may be very certain , monsieur , that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily , and you will be magnificently rewarded ; but what shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man ? '' 
`` That when once taken , he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape . '' 
`` Very well , Monsieur Colbert , and we may say , that , dating from this instant , we have formed a solid alliance , that is , you and I , and that I am absolutely at your service . '' 
`` It is I , madame , who place myself at yours . 
This Chevalier d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy , is he not ? '' 
`` Much more . '' 
`` A secret ambassador ? '' 
`` Higher still . '' 
`` Stop - King Phillip III . 
of Spain is a bigot . 
He is , perhaps , the confessor of Phillip III . '' 
`` You must go higher even than that . '' 
`` Mordieu ! '' 
cried Colbert , who forgot himself so far as to swear in the presence of this great lady , of this old friend of the queen-mother . 
`` He must then be the general of the Jesuits . '' 
`` I believe you have guessed it at last , '' replied the duchesse . 
`` Ah ! 
then , madame , this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him ; and we must make haste , too . '' 
`` Such was my opinion , monsieur , but I did not dare to give it you . '' 
`` And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne , and not us . '' 
`` But , mark this well , M. Colbert . 
M. d'Herblay is never discouraged ; if he has missed one blow , he will be sure to make another ; he will begin again . 
If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for himself , sooner or later , he will make another , of whom , to a certainty , you will not be prime minister . '' 
Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression . 
`` I feel assured that a prison will settle this affair for us , madame , in a manner satisfactory for both . '' 
The duchesse smiled again . 
`` Oh ! 
if you knew , '' said she , `` how many times Aramis has got out of prison ! '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied Colbert , `` we will take care that he shall not get out this time . '' 
`` But you were not attending to what I said to you just now . 
Do you remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so dreaded ? 
And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and experience . '' 
Colbert bit his lips . 
`` We will renounce the idea of the prison , '' said he , in a lower tone : `` we will find a little retreat from which the invincible can not possibly escape . '' 
`` That was well spoken , our ally ! '' 
replied the duchesse . 
`` But it is getting late ; had we not better return ? '' 
`` The more willingly , madame , from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king . '' 
`` To Paris ! '' 
cried the duchesse to the coachman . 
And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine , after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet , the last defender of Belle-Isle , the former friend of Marie Michon , the new foe of the old duchesse . 
: The Two Lighters . 
D'Artagnan had set off ; Fouquet likewise was gone , and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends . 
The first moments of this journey , or better say , this flight , were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive . 
It was not natural , in fact , if Louis XIV . 
was determined to seize this prey , that he should allow it to escape ; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase , and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted . 
But insensibly all fears were dispersed ; the surintendant , by hard traveling , placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors , that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him . 
As to his position , his friends had made it excellent for him . 
Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy . 
The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port . 
You see , besides , that no one is watching you , no one is following . '' 
He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance , behind an elbow formed by the river , the masts of a huge lighter coming down . 
The rowers of Fouquet 's boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` The matter is , monseigneur , '' replied the patron of the bark , `` that it is a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane . '' 
Gourville started , and mounted to the deck , in order to obtain a better view . 
Fouquet did not go up with him , but said to Gourville , with restrained mistrust : `` See what it is , dear friend . '' 
The lighter had just passed the elbow . 
It came on so fast , that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day . 
`` How they go , '' repeated the skipper , `` how they go ! 
They must be well paid ! 
I did not think , '' he added , `` that oars of wood could behave better than ours , but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary . '' 
`` Well they may , '' said one of the rowers , `` they are twelve , and we but eight . '' 
`` Twelve rowers ! '' 
replied Gourville , `` twelve ! 
impossible . '' 
The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded , even for the king . 
This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant , more for the sake of haste than of respect . 
`` What does it mean ? '' 
said Gourville , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent , which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering . 
`` They must be in a hurry , for it is not the king , '' said the patron . 
Fouquet shuddered . 
`` By what sign do you know that it is not the king ? '' 
said Gourville . 
`` In the first place , because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis , which the royal lighter always carries . '' 
`` And then , '' said Fouquet , `` because it is impossible it should be the king , Gourville , as the king was still in Paris yesterday . '' 
Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said : `` You were there yourself yesterday . '' 
`` And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste ? '' 
added he , for the sake of gaining time . 
`` By this , monsieur , '' said the patron ; `` these people must have set out a long while after us , and they have already nearly overtaken us . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Gourville , `` who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even ? '' 
`` We have seen no lighter of that shape , except at Orleans . 
It comes from Orleans , monsieur , and makes great haste . '' 
Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! '' 
`` No , '' said Fouquet , `` on the contrary ; stop short . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
what folly ! '' 
interrupted Gourville , stooping towards his ear . 
`` Pull up ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
The eight oars stopped , and resisting the water , created a retrograde motion . 
It stopped . 
The twelve rowers in the other did not , at first , perceive this maneuver , for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket - shot . 
Fouquet was short-sighted , Gourville was annoyed by the sun , now full in his eyes ; the skipper alone , with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements , perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter . 
`` I can see them ! '' 
cried he ; `` there are two . '' 
`` I can see nothing , '' said Gourville . 
`` You will not be long before you distinguish them ; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us . '' 
But what the patron announced was not realized ; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet , and instead of coming to join its pretended friends , it stopped short in the middle of the river . 
`` I can not comprehend this , '' said the captain . 
`` Nor I , '' cried Gourville . 
`` You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter , '' resumed Fouquet , `` try to describe them to us , before we are too far off . '' 
`` I thought I saw two , '' replied the boatman . 
`` I can only see one now , under the tent . '' 
`` What sort of man is he ? '' 
`` He is a dark man , broad-shouldered , bull-necked . '' 
A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure , darkening the sun . 
Gourville , who was still looking , with one hand over his eyes , became able to see what he sought , and all at once , jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him : `` Colbert ! '' 
said he , in a voice broken by emotion . 
`` Colbert ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` Too strange ! 
but no , it is impossible ! '' 
`` I tell you I recognized him , and he , at the same time , so plainly recognized me , that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop . 
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track . '' 
`` In that case he would join us , instead of lying by . 
What is he doing there ? '' 
`` He is watching us , without a doubt . '' 
`` I do not like uncertainty , '' said Fouquet ; `` let us go straight up to him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , do not do that , the lighter is full of armed men . '' 
`` He wishes to arrest me , then , Gourville ? 
Why does he not come on ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin . '' 
`` But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor ! '' 
`` Nothing yet proves that they are watching you , monseigneur ; be patient ! '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` Do not stop ; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king 's order with zeal . 
Redouble the speed . 
He who lives will see ! '' 
`` That is better . 
Come ! '' 
cried Fouquet ; `` since they remain stock-still yonder , let us go on . '' 
The captain gave the signal , and Fouquet 's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested . 
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ? 
Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! ' 
Well ! 
M. Colbert takes care not to pass me . 
He is a prudent man is M. Colbert . '' 
He was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes , watching each other . 
When the surintendant landed , Gourville hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once , and have the relays prepared . 
But , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first , and Colbert , approaching Fouquet , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect - marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse . 
Fouquet was completely self-possessed ; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself . 
He wished to fall from such a height that his fall should crush some of his enemies . 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert . 
The surintendant , therefore , coming up to him , replied , with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him - `` What ! 
is that you , M. Colbert ? '' 
`` To offer you my respects , monseigneur , '' said the latter . 
`` Were you in that lighter ? '' 
- pointing to the one with twelve rowers . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Of twelve rowers ? '' 
said Fouquet ; `` what luxury , M. Colbert . 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
- and Colbert blushed . 
`` This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear , Monsieur l'Intendant ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` But you have , happily , arrived ! 
-- You see , however , '' added he , a moment after , `` that I , who had but eight rowers , arrived before you . '' 
And he turned his back towards him , leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first . 
At least he did not give him the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened . 
Colbert , so annoyingly attacked , did not give way . 
`` I have not been quick , monseigneur , '' he replied , `` because I followed your example whenever you stopped . '' 
`` And why did you do that , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
cried Fouquet , irritated by the base audacity ; `` as you had a superior crew to mine , why did you not either join me or pass me ? '' 
`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . '' 
`` Bon jour ! 
monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer ; `` how did you get through the journey ? '' 
`` Tolerably well , thank you . '' 
`` And the fever ? '' 
`` But poorly . 
I drink , as you perceive . 
I am scarcely arrived , and I have already levied a contribution of tisane upon Nantes . '' 
`` You should sleep first , monseigneur . '' 
`` Eh ! 
corbleu !
