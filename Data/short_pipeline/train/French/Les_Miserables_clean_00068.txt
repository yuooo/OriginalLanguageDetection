Here , he became dismayed , he did not wish to dig down , he did not wish to penetrate deeply ; he did not wish to sound himself . 
He had promised , he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise ; Jean Valjean held his promise ; one must keep one 's word even to a convict , above all to a convict . 
Still , his first duty was to Cosette . 
In short , he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him . 
Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind , passing from one to the other , and moved by all of them . 
Hence arose a profound trouble . 
It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette , but love is a talent , and Marius succeeded in doing it . 
However , without any apparent object , he questioned Cosette , who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing ; he talked of her childhood and her youth , and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good , paternal and respectable that a man can be towards Cosette . 
All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real . 
That sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily . 
THE LOWER CHAMBER On the following day , at nightfall , Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the Gillenormand house . 
It was Basque who received him . 
Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour , as though he had received his orders . 
It sometimes happens that one says to a servant : `` You will watch for Mr. So and So , when he arrives . '' 
Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him : `` Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below ? '' 
`` I will remain below , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
Basque , who was perfectly respectful , opened the door of the waiting-room and said : `` I will go and inform Madame . '' 
The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp , vaulted room on the ground floor , which served as a cellar on occasion , which opened on the street , was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window . 
This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather-duster , the pope 's head brush , and the broom . 
The dust rested tranquilly there . 
Persecution of the spiders was not organized there . 
A fine web , which spread far and wide , and was very black and ornamented with dead flies , formed a wheel on one of the window-panes . 
The room , which was small and low-ceiled , was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner . 
The wall , which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash , was scaling off in large flakes . 
At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf . 
A fire was burning there ; which indicated that Jean Valjean 's reply : `` I will remain below , '' had been foreseen . 
Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace . 
Between the chairs an old bedside rug , which displayed more foundation thread than wool , had been spread by way of a carpet . 
The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window . 
Jean Valjean was fatigued . 
For days he had neither eaten nor slept . 
He threw himself into one of the arm-chairs . 
Basque returned , set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired . 
Jean Valjean , his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast , perceived neither Basque nor the candle . 
All at once , he drew himself up with a start . 
Cosette was standing beside him . 
He had not seen her enter , but he had felt that she was there . 
He turned round . 
He gazed at her . 
She was adorably lovely . 
But what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul . 
`` Well , '' exclaimed Cosette , `` father , I knew that you were peculiar , but I never should have expected this . 
What an idea ! 
Marius told me that you wish me to receive you here . '' 
`` Yes , it is my wish . '' 
`` I expected that reply . 
Good . 
I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you . 
Let us begin at the beginning . 
Embrace me , father . '' 
And she offered him her cheek . 
Jean Valjean remained motionless . 
`` You do not stir . 
I take note of it . 
Attitude of guilt . 
But never mind , I pardon you . 
Jesus Christ said : Offer the other cheek . 
Here it is . '' 
And she presented her other cheek . 
Jean Valjean did not move . 
It seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement . 
`` This is becoming serious , '' said Cosette . 
`` What have I done to you ? 
I declare that I am perplexed . 
You owe me reparation . 
You will dine with us . '' 
`` I have dined . '' 
`` That is not true . 
I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you . 
Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers . 
Come . 
Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room . 
Immediately . '' 
`` Impossible . '' 
Here Cosette lost ground a little . 
She ceased to command and passed to questioning . 
`` But why ? 
and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me . 
It 's horrible here . '' 
`` Thou knowest ... '' Jean Valjean caught himself up . 
`` You know , madame , that I am peculiar , I have my freaks . '' 
Cosette struck her tiny hands together . 
`` Madame ! 
... You know ! 
... more novelties ! 
What is the meaning of this ? '' 
Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse : `` You wished to be Madame . 
You are so . '' 
`` Not for you , father . '' 
`` Do not call me father . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Call me ` Monsieur Jean . ' 
` Jean , ' if you like . '' 
`` You are no longer my father ? 
I am no longer Cosette ? 
` Monsieur Jean ' ? 
What does this mean ? 
why , these are revolutions , are n't they ? 
what has taken place ? 
come , look me in the face . 
And you wo n't live with us ! 
And you wo n't have my chamber ! 
What have I done to you ? 
Has anything happened ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Well then ? '' 
`` Everything is as usual . '' 
`` Why do you change your name ? '' 
`` You have changed yours , surely . '' 
He smiled again with the same smile as before and added : `` Since you are Madame Pontmercy , I certainly can be Monsieur Jean . '' 
`` I do n't understand anything about it . 
All this is idiotic . 
I shall ask permission of my husband for you to be ` Monsieur Jean . ' 
I hope that he will not consent to it . 
You cause me a great deal of pain . 
One does have freaks , but one does not cause one 's little Cosette grief . 
That is wrong . 
You have no right to be wicked , you who are so good . '' 
He made no reply . 
She seized his hands with vivacity , and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement , she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin , which is a gesture of profound tenderness . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she said to him , `` be good ! '' 
And she went on : `` This is what I call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father . '' 
He loosed her hands . 
`` You no longer need a father , you have a husband . '' 
Cosette became angry . 
`` I no longer need a father ! 
One really does not know what to say to things like that , which are not common sense ! '' 
`` If Toussaint were here , '' resumed Jean Valjean , like a person who is driven to seek authorities , and who clutches at every branch , `` she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own . 
There is nothing new in this . 
I always have loved my black corner . '' 
`` But it is cold here . 
One can not see distinctly . 
It is abominable , that it is , to wish to be Monsieur Jean ! 
I will not have you say ` you ' to me . 
`` Just now , as I was coming hither , '' replied Jean Valjean , `` I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis . 
It was at a cabinet-maker 's . 
If I were a pretty woman , I would treat myself to that bit of furniture . 
A very neat toilet table in the reigning style . 
What you call rosewood , I think . 
It is inlaid . 
The mirror is quite large . 
There are drawers . 
It is pretty . '' 
`` Hou ! 
the villainous bear ! '' 
replied Cosette . 
And with supreme grace , setting her teeth and drawing back her lips , she blew at Jean Valjean . 
She was a Grace copying a cat . 
`` I am furious , '' she resumed . 
`` Ever since yesterday , you have made me rage , all of you . 
I am greatly vexed . 
I do n't understand . 
You do not defend me against Marius . 
Marius will not uphold me against you . 
I am all alone . 
I arrange a chamber prettily . 
If I could have put the good God there I would have done it . 
My chamber is left on my hands . 
My lodger sends me into bankruptcy . 
I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette . 
We will have nothing to do with your dinner , Madame . 
And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him ` Monsieur Jean , ' and to receive him in a frightful , old , ugly cellar , where the walls have beards , and where the crystal consists of empty bottles , and the curtains are of spiders ' webs ! 
You are singular , I admit , that is your style , but people who get married are granted a truce . 
You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly . 
So you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme . 
I was very desperate indeed there , that I was . 
What have you against me ? 
You cause me a great deal of grief . 
Fi ! '' 
And , becoming suddenly serious , she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and added : `` Are you angry with me because I am happy ? '' 
Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep . 
This question , which was simple for Cosette , was profound for Jean Valjean . 
Cosette had meant to scratch , and she lacerated . 
Jean Valjean turned pale . 
He remained for a moment without replying , then , with an inexpressible intonation , and speaking to himself , he murmured : `` Her happiness was the object of my life . 
Now God may sign my dismissal . 
Cosette , thou art happy ; my day is over . '' 
`` Ah , you have said thou to me ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette . 
And she sprang to his neck . 
Jean Valjean , in bewilderment , strained her wildly to his breast . 
It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back . 
`` Thanks , father ! '' 
said Cosette . 
This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean Valjean . 
He gently removed Cosette 's arms , and took his hat . 
`` Well ? '' 
said Cosette . 
`` I leave you , Madame , they are waiting for you . '' 
And , from the threshold , he added : `` I have said thou to you . 
Tell your husband that this shall not happen again . 
Pardon me . '' 
Jean Valjean quitted the room , leaving Cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell . 
ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS On the following day , at the same hour , Jean Valjean came . 
Cosette asked him no questions , was no longer astonished , no longer exclaimed that she was cold , no longer spoke of the drawing-room , she avoided saying either `` father '' or `` Monsieur Jean . '' 
She allowed herself to be addressed as you . 
She allowed herself to be called Madame . 
Only , her joy had undergone a certain diminution . 
She would have been sad , if sadness had been possible to her . 
It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases , explains nothing , and satisfies the beloved woman . 
The curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love . 
The lower room had made a little toilet . 
Basque had suppressed the bottles , and Nicolette the spiders . 
All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour . 
He came every day , because he had not the strength to take Marius ' words otherwise than literally . 
Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when Jean Valjean came . 
The house grew accustomed to the novel ways of M. Fauchelevent . 
Toussaint helped in this direction : `` Monsieur has always been like that , '' she repeated . 
The grandfather issued this decree : -- `` He 's an original . '' 
And all was said . 
Moreover , at the age of ninety-six , no bond is any longer possible , all is merely juxtaposition ; a newcomer is in the way . 
There is no longer any room ; all habits are acquired . 
M. Fauchelevent , M. Tranchelevent , Father Gillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from `` that gentleman . '' 
He added : -- `` Nothing is more common than those originals . 
They do all sorts of queer things . 
They have no reason . 
The Marquis de Canaples was still worse . 
He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret . 
These are fantastic appearances that people affect . '' 
No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation . 
And moreover , who could have guessed such a thing ? 
There are marshes of this description in India . 
The water seems extraordinary , inexplicable , rippling though there is no wind , and agitated where it should be calm . 
One gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions ; one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom . 
Many men have a secret monster in this same manner , a dragon which gnaws them , a despair which inhabits their night . 
Such a man resembles other men , he goes and comes . 
No one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth , which lives within the unhappy man , and of which he is dying . 
No one knows that this man is a gulf . 
He is stagnant but deep . 
From time to time , a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface . 
A mysterious wrinkle is formed , then vanishes , then re-appears ; an air-bubble rises and bursts . 
It is the breathing of the unknown beast . 
Certain strange habits : arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave , keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves , preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall-colored mantle , seeking the solitary walk , preferring the deserted street , avoiding any share in conversation , avoiding crowds and festivals , seeming at one 's ease and living poorly , having one 's key in one 's pocket , and one 's candle at the porter 's lodge , however rich one may be , entering by the side door , ascending the private staircase , -- all these insignificant singularities , fugitive folds on the surface , often proceed from a formidable foundation . 
Many weeks passed in this manner . 
A new life gradually took possession of Cosette : the relations which marriage creates , visits , the care of the house , pleasures , great matters . 
Cosette 's pleasures were not costly , they consisted in one thing : being with Marius . 
The great occupation of her life was to go out with him , to remain with him . 
It was for them a joy that was always fresh , to go out arm in arm , in the face of the sun , in the open street , without hiding themselves , before the whole world , both of them completely alone . 
Cosette had one vexation . 
Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette , the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible , and she went away . 
The grandfather was well ; Marius argued a case here and there ; Aunt Gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her , beside the new household . 
Jean Valjean came every day . 
The address as thou disappeared , the you , the `` Madame , '' the `` Monsieur Jean , '' rendered him another person to Cosette . 
The care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding . 
She became more and more gay and less and less tender . 
Yet she still loved him sincerely , and he felt it . 
One day she said to him suddenly : `` You used to be my father , you are no longer my father , you were my uncle , you are no longer my uncle , you were Monsieur Fauchelevent , you are Jean . 
Who are you then ? 
I do n't like all this . 
If I did not know how good you are , I should be afraid of you . '' 
He still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme , because he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt . 
At first , he only remained a few minutes with Cosette , and then went away . 
Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief . 
One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the days which were lengthening , he arrived earlier and departed later . 
One day Cosette chanced to say `` father '' to him . 
A flash of joy illuminated Jean Valjean 's melancholy old countenance . 
He caught her up : `` Say Jean . '' 
-- `` Ah ! 
truly , '' she replied with a burst of laughter , `` Monsieur Jean . '' 
-- `` That is right , '' said he . 
And he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes . 
THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET This was the last time . 
After that last flash of light , complete extinction ensued . 
No more familiarity , no more good-morning with a kiss , never more that word so profoundly sweet : `` My father ! '' 
He was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other ; and he had this sorrow , that after having lost Cosette wholly in one day , he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail . 
The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar . 
In short , it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day . 
His whole life was concentrated in that one hour . 
He seated himself close to her , he gazed at her in silence , or he talked to her of years gone by , of her childhood , of the convent , of her little friends of those bygone days . 
One afternoon , -- it was on one of those early days in April , already warm and fresh , the moment of the sun 's great gayety , the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking , the hawthorn was on the point of budding , a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls , snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones , amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies , and buttercups , the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance , the wind , that minstrel of the eternal wedding , was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand , auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide , -- Marius said to Cosette : -- `` We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet . 
Let us go thither . 
We must not be ungrateful . '' 
-- And away they flitted , like two swallows towards the spring . 
This garden of the Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn . 
They already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love . 
The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease , still belonged to Cosette . 
They went to that garden and that house . 
There they found themselves again , there they forgot themselves . 
That evening , at the usual hour , Jean Valjean came to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire . 
-- `` Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet returned , '' Basque said to him . 
He seated himself in silence , and waited an hour . 
Cosette did not return . 
He departed with drooping head . 
Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to `` their garden , '' and so joyous at having `` lived a whole day in her past , '' that she talked of nothing else on the morrow . 
She did not notice that she had not seen Jean Valjean . 
`` In what way did you go thither ? '' 
Jean Valjean asked her . '' 
`` On foot . '' 
`` And how did you return ? '' 
`` In a hackney carriage . '' 
For some time , Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people . 
He was troubled by it . 
Marius ' economy was severe , and that word had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean . 
He hazarded a query : `` Why do you not have a carriage of your own ? 
A pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month . 
You are rich . '' 
`` I do n't know , '' replied Cosette . 
`` It is like Toussaint , '' resumed Jean Valjean . 
`` She is gone . 
You have not replaced her . 
Why ? '' 
`` Nicolette suffices . '' 
`` But you ought to have a maid . '' 
`` Have I not Marius ? '' 
`` You ought to have a house of your own , your own servants , a carriage , a box at the theatre . 
There is nothing too fine for you . 
Why not profit by your riches ? 
Wealth adds to happiness . '' 
Cosette made no reply . 
Jean Valjean 's visits were not abridged . 
Far from it . 
When it is the heart which is slipping , one does not halt on the downward slope . 
When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour , he sang the praises of Marius ; he pronounced him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good . 
Cosette outdid him . 
Jean Valjean began again . 
They were never weary . 
Marius -- that word was inexhaustible ; those six letters contained volumes . 
In this manner , Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time . 
It was so sweet to see Cosette , to forget by her side ! 
It alleviated his wounds . 
It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce : `` M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served . '' 
On those days , Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home . 
Was there , then , any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of Marius ? 
Was Jean Valjean really a chrysalis who would persist , and who would come to visit his butterfly ? 
One day he remained still longer than usual . 
On the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth . 
-- `` Hello ! '' 
he thought . 
`` No fire . '' 
-- And he furnished the explanation for himself . 
-- `` It is perfectly simple . 
It is April . 
The cold weather has ceased . '' 
`` Heavens ! 
how cold it is here ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette when she entered . 
`` Why , no , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then ? '' 
`` Yes , since we are now in the month of May . '' 
`` But we have a fire until June . 
One is needed all the year in this cellar . '' 
`` I thought that a fire was unnecessary . '' 
`` That is exactly like one of your ideas ! '' 
retorted Cosette . 
On the following day there was a fire . 
But the two arm-chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door . '' 
-- What is the meaning of this ? '' 
thought Jean Valjean . 
He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth . 
This fire lighted once more encouraged him , however . 
He prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits . 
As he rose to take his leave , Cosette said to him : `` My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday . '' 
`` What was it ? '' 
`` He said to me : ` Cosette , we have an income of thirty thousand livres . 
Twenty-seven that you own , and three that my grandfather gives me . ' 
I replied : ` That makes thirty . ' 
He went on : ` Would you have the courage to live on the three thousand ? ' 
I answered : ` Yes , on nothing . 
Provided that it was with you . ' 
And then I asked : ` Why do you say that to me ? ' 
He replied : ` I wanted to know . ' '' 
Jean Valjean found not a word to answer . 
Cosette probably expected some explanation from him ; he listened in gloomy silence . 
He went back to the Rue de l'Homme Arme ; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house , he entered the adjoining dwelling . 
It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again . 
His mind was swarming with conjectures . 
It was evident that Marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs , that he feared some source that was not pure , who knows ? 
that he had even , perhaps , discovered that the money came from him , Jean Valjean , that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune , and was disinclined to take it as his own , -- preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor , rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean . 
Moreover , Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door . 
On the following day , he underwent something like a shock on entering the ground-floor room . 
The arm-chairs had disappeared . 
There was not a single chair of any sort . 
`` Ah , what 's this ! '' 
exclaimed Cosette as she entered , `` no chairs ! 
Where are the arm-chairs ? '' 
`` They are no longer here , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` This is too much ! '' 
Jean Valjean stammered : `` It was I who told Basque to remove them . '' 
`` And your reason ? '' 
`` I have only a few minutes to stay to-day . '' 
`` A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing . '' 
`` I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` You have company this evening , no doubt . '' 
`` We expect no one . '' 
Jean Valjean had not another word to say . 
Cosette shrugged her shoulders . 
`` To have the chairs carried off ! 
The other day you had the fire put out . 
How odd you are ! '' 
`` Adieu ! '' 
murmured Jean Valjean . 
He did not say : `` Adieu , Cosette . '' 
But he had not the strength to say : `` Adieu , Madame . '' 
He went away utterly overwhelmed . 
This time he had understood . 
On the following day he did not come . 
Cosette only observed the fact in the evening . 
`` Why , '' said she , `` Monsieur Jean has not been here today . '' 
And she felt a slight twinge at her heart , but she hardly perceived it , being immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius . 
On the following day he did not come . 
Cosette paid no heed to this , passed her evening and slept well that night , as usual , and thought of it only when she woke . 
She was so happy ! 
She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean 's house to inquire whether he were ill , and why he had not come on the previous evening . 
Nicolette brought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill . 
He was busy . 
He would come soon . 
As soon as he was able . 
Moreover , he was on the point of taking a little journey . 
Madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time . 
They were not to worry about him . 
They were not to think of him . 
Nicolette on entering M. Jean 's had repeated to him her mistress ' very words . 
That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean bad not come on the preceding evening . '' 
-- It is two days since I have been there , '' said Jean Valjean gently . 
But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette , who did not report it to Cosette . 
ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION During the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833 , the rare passersby in the Marais , the petty shopkeepers , the loungers on thresholds , noticed an old man neatly clad in black , who emerged every day at the same hour , towards nightfall , from the Rue de l'Homme Arme , on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie , passed in front of the Blancs Manteaux , gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine , and , on arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe , turned to the left , and entered the Rue Saint-Louis . 
There he walked at a slow pace , with his head strained forward , seeing nothing , hearing nothing , his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him , which never varied , and which was no other than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire . 
The nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up ; a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora , he had a fascinated and much affected air , his lips indulged in obscure movements , as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see , he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible . 
One would have said that , while desirous of reaching his destination , he feared the moment when he should be close at hand . 
When only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened , to such a degree that , at times , one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all . 
The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole . 
Whatever time he spent on arriving , he was obliged to arrive at last ; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire ; then he halted , he trembled , he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house , and gazed into that street , and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible , and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him . 
Then a tear , which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids , and had become large enough to fall , trickled down his cheek , and sometimes stopped at his mouth . 
The old man tasted its bitter flavor . 
Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone , then he returned by the same road and with the same step , and , in proportion as he retreated , his glance died out . 
Little by little , this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire ; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis ; sometimes a little further off , sometimes a little nearer . 
One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine and looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance . 
Then he shook his head slowly from right to left , as though refusing himself something , and retraced his steps . 
Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis . 
He got as far as the Rue Pavee , shook his head and turned back ; then he went no further than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons ; then he did not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux . 
One would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up , and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether . 
Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour , he undertook the same trip , but he no longer completed it , and , perhaps without himself being aware of the fact , he constantly shortened it . 
His whole countenance expressed this single idea : What is the use ? 
-- His eye was dim ; no more radiance . 
His tears were also exhausted ; they no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid ; that thoughtful eye was dry . 
The old man 's head was still craned forward ; his chin moved at times ; the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold . 
Sometimes , when the weather was bad , he had an umbrella under his arm , but he never opened it . 
The good women of the quarter said : `` He is an innocent . '' 
The children followed him and laughed . 
BOOK NINTH . 
-- SUPREME SHADOW , SUPREME DAWN PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY , BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY It is a terrible thing to be happy ! 
How content one is ! 
How all-sufficient one finds it ! 
How , being in possession of the false object of life , happiness , one forgets the true object , duty ! 
Let us say , however , that the reader would do wrong were he to blame Marius . 
Marius , as we have explained , before his marriage , had put no questions to M. Fauchelevent , and , since that time , he had feared to put any to Jean Valjean . 
He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn . 
He had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair . 
He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him , as much as possible , from Cosette 's mind . 
He had , in a manner , always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean , sure that , in this way , she would not perceive nor think of the latter . 
It was more than effacement , it was an eclipse . 
Marius did what he considered necessary and just . 
He thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen , and others which will be seen later on , for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness , but without weakness . 
Chance having ordained that he should encounter , in a case which he had argued , a former employee of the Laffitte establishment , he had acquired mysterious information , without seeking it , which he had not been able , it is true , to probe , out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard , and out of consideration for Jean Valjean 's perilous position . 
He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform : the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion . 
In the meanwhile , he abstained from touching that money . 
As for Cosette , she had not been initiated into any of these secrets ; but it would be harsh to condemn her also . 
There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism , which caused her to do , instinctively and almost mechanically , what Marius wished . 
She was conscious of Marius ' will in the direction of `` Monsieur Jean , '' she conformed to it . 
Her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her ; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions , and obeyed blindly . 
Her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what Marius forgot . 
She was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this . 
Without her knowing why herself , and without his having any cause to accuse her of it , her soul had become so wholly her husband 's that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius ' mind became overcast in hers . 
Let us not go too far , however ; in what concerns Jean Valjean , this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial . 
She was rather heedless than forgetful . 
At bottom , she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father ; but she loved her husband still more dearly . 
This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart , which leaned to one side only . 
It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed her surprise . 
Then Marius calmed her : `` He is absent , I think . 
Did not he say that he was setting out on a journey ? '' 
-- `` That is true , '' thought Cosette . 
`` He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion . 
But not for so long . '' 
Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Rue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey . 
Jean Valjean caused the answer `` no '' to be given . 
Cosette asked nothing more , since she had but one need on earth , Marius . 
Let us also say that , on their side , Cosette and Marius had also been absent . 
They had been to Vernon . 
Marius had taken Cosette to his father 's grave . 
Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean . 
Cosette allowed it . 
Moreover that which is called , far too harshly in certain cases , the ingratitude of children , is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed . 
It is the ingratitude of nature . 
Nature , as we have elsewhere said , `` looks before her . '' 
Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing . 
Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows , those who are arriving towards the light . 
Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old , and involuntary on the part of the young . 
This breach , at first insensible , increases slowly , like all separations of branches . 
The boughs , without becoming detached from the trunk , grow away from it . 
It is no fault of theirs . 
Youth goes where there is joy , festivals , vivid lights , love . 
Old age goes towards the end . 
They do not lose sight of each other , but there is no longer a close connection . 
Young people feel the cooling off of life ; old people , that of the tomb . 
Let us not blame these poor children . 
LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL One day , Jean Valjean descended his staircase , took three steps in the street , seated himself on a post , on that same stone post where Gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of June ; he remained there a few moments , then went up stairs again . 
This was the last oscillation of the pendulum . 
On the following day he did not leave his apartment .
