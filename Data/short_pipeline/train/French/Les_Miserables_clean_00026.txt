`` No . '' 
`` Did you not hear the bell ? '' 
`` Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` I can hardly distinguish my own signal . '' 
`` She died at daybreak . '' 
`` And then , the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning . '' 
`` It was Mother Crucifixion . 
A blessed woman . '' 
The prioress paused , moved her lips , as though in mental prayer , and resumed : -- `` Three years ago , Madame de Bethune , a Jansenist , turned orthodox , merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , now I hear the knell , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The mothers have taken her to the dead-room , which opens on the church . '' 
`` I know . '' 
`` No other man than you can or must enter that chamber . 
See to that . 
A fine sight it would be , to see a man enter the dead-room ! '' 
`` More often ! '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` More often ! '' 
`` What do you say ? '' 
`` I say more often . '' 
`` More often than what ? '' 
`` Reverend Mother , I did not say more often than what , I said more often . '' 
`` I do n't understand you . 
Why do you say more often ? '' 
`` In order to speak like you , reverend Mother . '' 
`` But I did not say ` more often . ' '' 
At that moment , nine o'clock struck . 
`` At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours , praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar , '' said the prioress . 
`` Amen , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The clock struck opportunely . 
It cut `` more often '' short . 
It is probable , that had it not been for this , the prioress and Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein . 
Fauchelevent mopped his forehead . 
The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur , probably sacred , then raised her voice : -- `` In her lifetime , Mother Crucifixion made converts ; after her death , she will perform miracles . '' 
`` She will ! '' 
replied Father Fauchelevent , falling into step , and striving not to flinch again . 
`` Father Fauvent , the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion . 
No doubt , it is not granted to every one to die , like Cardinal de Berulle , while saying the holy mass , and to breathe forth their souls to God , while pronouncing these words : Hanc igitur oblationem . 
But without attaining to such happiness , Mother Crucifixion 's death was very precious . 
She retained her consciousness to the very last moment . 
She spoke to us , then she spoke to the angels . 
She gave us her last commands . 
If you had a little more faith , and if you could have been in her cell , she would have cured your leg merely by touching it . 
She smiled . 
We felt that she was regaining her life in God . 
There was something of paradise in that death . '' 
Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing . 
`` Amen , '' said he . 
`` Father Fauvent , what the dead wish must be done . '' 
The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet . 
Fauchelevent held his peace . 
She went on : -- `` I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord , who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life , and who bear wonderful fruit . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden . '' 
`` Besides , she is more than a dead woman , she is a saint . '' 
`` Like yourself , reverend Mother . '' 
`` She slept in her coffin for twenty years , by express permission of our Holy Father , Pius VII . 
-- '' `` The one who crowned the Emp -- Buonaparte . '' 
For a clever man like Fauchelevent , this allusion was an awkward one . 
Fortunately , the prioress , completely absorbed in her own thoughts , did not hear it . 
She continued : -- `` Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` Saint Didorus , Archbishop of Cappadocia , desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb : Acarus , which signifies , a worm of the earth ; this was done . 
Is this true ? '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The blessed Mezzocane , Abbot of Aquila , wished to be buried beneath the gallows ; this was done . '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` Saint Terentius , Bishop of Port , where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea , requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides , in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb . 
This was done . 
The dead must be obeyed . '' 
`` So be it . '' 
`` The body of Bernard Guidonis , born in France near Roche-Abeille , was , as he had ordered , and in spite of the king of Castile , borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges , although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy in Spain . 
Can the contrary be affirmed ? '' 
`` For that matter , no , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse . '' 
Several beads of the chaplet were told off , still in silence . 
The prioress resumed : -- `` Father Fauvent , Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years . '' 
`` That is just . '' 
`` It is a continuation of her slumber . '' 
`` So I shall have to nail up that coffin ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And we are to reject the undertaker 's coffin ? '' 
`` Precisely . '' 
`` I am at the orders of the very reverend community . '' 
`` The four Mother Precentors will assist you . '' 
`` In nailing up the coffin ? 
I do not need them . '' 
`` No . 
In lowering the coffin . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` Into the vault . '' 
`` What vault ? '' 
`` Under the altar . '' 
Fauchelevent started . 
`` The vault under the altar ? '' 
`` Under the altar . '' 
`` But -- '' `` You will have an iron bar . '' 
`` Yes , but -- '' `` You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring . '' 
`` But -- '' `` The dead must be obeyed . 
To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel , not to go to profane earth ; to remain there in death where she prayed while living ; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion . 
She asked it of us ; that is to say , commanded us . '' 
`` But it is forbidden . '' 
`` Forbidden by men , enjoined by God . '' 
`` What if it became known ? '' 
`` We have confidence in you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I am a stone in your walls . '' 
`` The chapter assembled . 
The vocal mothers , whom I have just consulted again , and who are now deliberating , have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried , according to her wish , in her own coffin , under our altar . 
Think , Father Fauvent , if she were to work miracles here ! 
What a glory of God for the community ! 
And miracles issue from tombs . '' 
`` But , reverend Mother , if the agent of the sanitary commission -- '' `` Saint Benoit II. , in the matter of sepulture , resisted Constantine Pogonatus . '' 
`` But the commissary of police -- '' `` Chonodemaire , one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius , expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion , that is to say , beneath the altar . '' 
`` But the inspector from the Prefecture -- '' `` The world is nothing in the presence of the cross . 
Martin , the eleventh general of the Carthusians , gave to his order this device : Stat crux dum volvitur orbis . '' 
`` Amen , '' said Fauchelevent , who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma , whenever he heard Latin . 
Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long . 
On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison , bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in , he halted in front of the first tree which he came to , harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it . 
The prioress , who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence , and whose reservoir was overfull , rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away : -- `` I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard . 
Who was Bernard ? 
The first abbot of Clairvaux . 
Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth . 
His father was named Tecelin , and his mother Alethe . 
He began at Citeaux , to end in Clairvaux ; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone , Guillaume de Champeaux ; he had seven hundred novices , and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries ; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140 , and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple , and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics ; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia , darted lightning at the monk Raoul , the murderer of the Jews , dominated the council of Reims in 1148 , caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea , Bishop of Poitiers , caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile , arranged the disputes of princes , enlightened King Louis the Young , advised Pope Eugene III. , regulated the Temple , preached the crusade , performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime , and as many as thirty-nine in one day . 
Who was Benoit ? 
He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin ; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale , he was the Basil of the West . 
His order has produced forty popes , two hundred cardinals , fifty patriarchs , sixteen hundred archbishops , four thousand six hundred bishops , four emperors , twelve empresses , forty-six kings , forty-one queens , three thousand six hundred canonized saints , and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years . 
On one side Saint Bernard , on the other the agent of the sanitary department ! 
On one side Saint Benoit , on the other the inspector of public ways ! 
The state , the road commissioners , the public undertaker , regulations , the administration , what do we know of all that ? 
There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated . 
We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ ! 
Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention . 
God subordinated to the commissary of police ; such is the age . 
Silence , Fauvent ! '' 
Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath . 
The prioress continued : -- `` No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture . 
Only fanatics and those in error deny it . 
We live in times of terrible confusion . 
We do not know that which it is necessary to know , and we know that which we should ignore . 
We are ignorant and impious . 
In this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics , a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century . 
Others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI . 
to the cross of Jesus Christ . 
Louis XVI . 
was merely a king . 
Let us beware of God ! 
There is no longer just nor unjust . 
The name of Voltaire is known , but not the name of Cesar de Bus . 
Nevertheless , Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory , and Voltaire one of unblessed memory . 
The last arch-bishop , the Cardinal de Perigord , did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle , and Francois Bourgoin to Gondren , and Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin , and Father Sainte-Marthe to Jean-Francois Senault . 
The name of Father Coton is known , not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie , but because he furnished Henri IV. , the Huguenot king , with the material for an oath . 
That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois de Sales , is that he cheated at play . 
And then , religion is attacked . 
Why ? 
Because there have been bad priests , because Sagittaire , Bishop of Gap , was the brother of Salone , Bishop of Embrun , and because both of them followed Mommol . 
What has that to do with the question ? 
Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint , and giving half of his cloak to a beggar ? 
They persecute the saints . 
They shut their eyes to the truth . 
Darkness is the rule . 
The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind . 
No one thinks of hell as a reality . 
Oh ! 
how wicked people are ! 
By order of the king signifies to-day , by order of the revolution . 
One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead . 
A holy death is prohibited . 
Burial is a civil matter . 
This is horrible . 
Saint Leo II . 
wrote two special letters , one to Pierre Notaire , the other to the king of the Visigoths , for the purpose of combating and rejecting , in questions touching the dead , the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor . 
Gauthier , Bishop of Chalons , held his own in this matter against Otho , Duke of Burgundy . 
The ancient magistracy agreed with him . 
In former times we had voices in the chapter , even on matters of the day . 
The Abbot of Citeaux , the general of the order , was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy . 
We do what we please with our dead . 
Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself in France , in the abbey of Fleury , called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire , although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin , on Saturday , the 21st of the month of March , of the year 543 ? 
All this is incontestable . 
I abhor psalm-singers , I hate priors , I execrate heretics , but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary . 
One has only to read Arnoul Wion , Gabriel Bucelin , Trithemus , Maurolics , and Dom Luc d'Achery . '' 
The prioress took breath , then turned to Fauchelevent . 
`` Is it settled , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` It is settled , reverend Mother . '' 
`` We may depend on you ? '' 
`` I will obey . '' 
`` That is well . '' 
`` I am entirely devoted to the convent . '' 
`` That is understood . 
You will close the coffin . 
The sisters will carry it to the chapel . 
The office for the dead will then be said . 
Then we shall return to the cloister . 
Between eleven o'clock and midnight , you will come with your iron bar . 
All will be done in the most profound secrecy . 
There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors , Mother Ascension and yourself . '' 
`` And the sister at the post ? '' 
`` She will not turn round . '' 
`` But she will hear . '' 
`` She will not listen . 
Besides , what the cloister knows the world learns not . '' 
A pause ensued . 
The prioress went on : -- `` You will remove your bell . 
It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit ? '' 
`` He will pay it at four o'clock to-day . 
The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung . 
But you do not understand any of the peals ? '' 
`` I pay no attention to any but my own . '' 
`` That is well , Father Fauvent . '' 
`` Reverend Mother , a lever at least six feet long will be required . '' 
`` Where will you obtain it ? '' 
`` Where gratings are not lacking , iron bars are not lacking . 
I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden . '' 
`` About three-quarters of an hour before midnight ; do not forget . '' 
`` Reverend Mother ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort , my brother is the strong man for you . 
A perfect Turk ! '' 
`` You will do it as speedily as possible . '' 
`` I can not work very fast . 
I am infirm ; that is why I require an assistant . 
I limp . '' 
`` To limp is no sin , and perhaps it is a blessing . 
The Emperor Henry II. , who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII. , has two surnames , the Saint and the Lame . '' 
`` Two surtouts are a good thing , '' murmured Fauchelevent , who really was a little hard of hearing . 
`` Now that I think of it , Father Fauvent , let us give a whole hour to it . 
That is not too much . 
Be near the principal altar , with your iron bar , at eleven o'clock . 
The office begins at midnight . 
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that . '' 
`` I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community . 
These are my orders . 
I am to nail up the coffin . 
At eleven o'clock exactly , I am to be in the chapel . 
The Mother Precentors will be there . 
Mother Ascension will be there . 
Two men would be better . 
However , never mind ! 
I shall have my lever . 
We will open the vault , we will lower the coffin , and we will close the vault again . 
After which , there will be no trace of anything . 
The government will have no suspicion . 
Thus all has been arranged , reverend Mother ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` What else remains ? '' 
`` The empty coffin remains . '' 
This produced a pause . 
Fauchelevent meditated . 
The prioress meditated . 
`` What is to be done with that coffin , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` It will be given to the earth . '' 
`` Empty ? '' 
Another silence . 
Fauchelevent made , with his left hand , that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject . 
`` Reverend Mother , I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church , and no one can enter there but myself , and I will cover the coffin with the pall . '' 
`` Yes , but the bearers , when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave , will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the de -- ! '' 
exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
The prioress began to make the sign of the cross , and looked fixedly at the gardener . 
The vil stuck fast in his throat . 
He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath . 
`` I will put earth in the coffin , reverend Mother . 
That will produce the effect of a corpse . '' 
`` You are right . 
Earth , that is the same thing as man . 
So you will manage the empty coffin ? '' 
`` I will make that my special business . '' 
The prioress 's face , up to that moment troubled and clouded , grew serene once more . 
She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him . 
Fauchelevent went towards the door . 
As he was on the point of passing out , the prioress raised her voice gently : -- `` I am pleased with you , Father Fauvent ; bring your brother to me to-morrow , after the burial , and tell him to fetch his daughter . '' 
IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ AUSTIN CASTILLEJO The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man ; they do not reach their goal very promptly . 
Moreover , Fauchelevent was in a dilemma . 
He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden . 
Cosette had waked up . 
Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire . 
At the moment when Fauchelevent entered , Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner 's basket on the wall , and saying to her , `` Listen attentively to me , my little Cosette . 
We must go away from this house , but we shall return to it , and we shall be very happy here . 
The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that . 
You will wait for me at a lady 's house . 
I shall come to fetch you . 
Obey , and say nothing , above all things , unless you want Madame Thenardier to get you again ! '' 
Cosette nodded gravely . 
Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the door . 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Everything is arranged , and nothing is , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` I have permission to bring you in ; but before bringing you in you must be got out . 
That 's where the difficulty lies . 
It is easy enough with the child . '' 
`` You will carry her out ? '' 
`` And she will hold her tongue ? '' 
`` I answer for that . '' 
`` But you , Father Madeleine ? '' 
And , after a silence , fraught with anxiety , Fauchelevent exclaimed : -- `` Why , get out as you came in ! '' 
Jean Valjean , as in the first instance , contented himself with saying , `` Impossible . '' 
Fauchelevent grumbled , more to himself than to Jean Valjean : -- `` There is another thing which bothers me . 
I have said that I would put earth in it . 
When I come to think it over , the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing , it wo n't do , it will get displaced , it will move about . 
The men will bear it . 
You understand , Father Madeleine , the government will notice it . '' 
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving . 
Fauchelevent went on : -- `` How the de -- uce are you going to get out ? 
It must all be done by to-morrow morning . 
It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in . 
The prioress expects you . '' 
Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he , Fauchelevent , was to render to the community . 
That it fell among his duties to take part in their burials , that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery . 
That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed , and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel . 
That the police regulations forbade this , but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused . 
That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased . 
That it was so much the worse for the government . 
That he , Fauchelevent , was to nail up the coffin in the cell , raise the stone in the chapel , and lower the corpse into the vault . 
And that , by way of thanks , the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener , and his niece as a pupil . 
That his brother was M. Madeleine , and that his niece was Cosette . 
That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening , after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery . 
But that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside . 
That that was the first problem . 
And then , that there was another : the empty coffin . '' 
`` What is that empty coffin ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` The coffin of the administration . '' 
`` What coffin ? 
What administration ? '' 
`` A nun dies . 
The municipal doctor comes and says , ` A nun has died . ' 
The government sends a coffin . 
The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker 's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery . 
The undertaker 's men will come and lift the coffin ; there will be nothing in it . '' 
`` Put something in it . '' 
`` A corpse ? 
I have none . '' 
`` No . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` A living person . '' 
`` What person ? '' 
`` Me ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent , who was seated , sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair . 
`` You ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter . 
`` You know , Fauchelevent , what you have said : ` Mother Crucifixion is dead . ' 
and I add : ` and Father Madeleine is buried . ' 
`` Ah ! 
good , you can laugh , you are not speaking seriously . '' 
`` Very seriously , I must get out of this place . '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` l have told you to find a basket , and a cover for me also , '' `` Well ? '' 
`` The basket will be of pine , and the cover a black cloth . '' 
`` In the first place , it will be a white cloth . 
Nuns are buried in white . '' 
`` Let it be a white cloth , then . '' 
`` You are not like other men , Father Madeleine . '' 
To behold such devices , which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys , spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him , and mingle with what he called the `` petty course of life in the convent , '' caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by . 
Jean Valjean went on : -- `` The problem is to get out of here without being seen . 
This offers the means . 
But give me some information , in the first place . 
How is it managed ? 
Where is this coffin ? '' 
`` The empty one ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Down stairs , in what is called the dead-room . 
It stands on two trestles , under the pall . '' 
`` How long is the coffin ? '' 
`` Six feet . '' 
`` What is this dead-room ? '' 
`` It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden , which is closed on the outside by a shutter , and two doors ; one leads into the convent , the other into the church . '' 
`` What church ? '' 
`` The church in the street , the church which any one can enter . '' 
`` Have you the keys to those two doors ? '' 
`` No ; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent ; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church . '' 
`` When does the porter open that door ? '' 
`` Only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter , when they come to get the coffin . 
When the coffin has been taken out , the door is closed again . '' 
`` Who nails up the coffin ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Who spreads the pall over it ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Are you alone ? '' 
`` Not another man , except the police doctor , can enter the dead-room . 
That is even written on the wall . '' 
`` Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep ? '' 
`` No . 
But I could hide you in a small , dark nook which opens on the dead-room , where I keep my tools to use for burials , and of which I have the key . '' 
`` At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow ? '' 
`` About three o'clock in the afternoon . 
The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall . 
It is not very near . '' 
`` I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the morning . 
And how about food ? 
I shall be hungry . '' 
`` I will bring you something . '' 
`` You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock . '' 
Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints . 
`` But that is impossible ! '' 
`` Bah ! 
Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank ? '' 
What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was , we repeat , a simple matter to Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this . 
Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape . 
The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him . 
An escape is a cure . 
What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure ? 
To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods , to live for a long time in a box , to find air where there is none , to economize his breath for hours , to know how to stifle without dying -- this was one of Jean Valjean 's gloomy talents . 
Moreover , a coffin containing a living being , -- that convict 's expedient , -- is also an imperial expedient . 
If we are to credit the monk Austin Castillejo , this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth , desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication . 
He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste in this manner . 
Fauchelevent , who had recovered himself a little , exclaimed : -- `` But how will you manage to breathe ? '' 
`` I will breathe . '' 
`` In that box ! 
The mere thought of it suffocates me . '' 
`` You surely must have a gimlet , you will make a few holes here and there , around my mouth , and you will nail the top plank on loosely . '' 
`` Good ! 
And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze ? '' 
`` A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze . '' 
And Jean Valjean added : -- `` Father Fauchelevent , we must come to a decision : I must either be caught here , or accept this escape through the hearse . '' 
Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door . 
Who is there who has not said to a cat , `` Do come in ! '' 
There are men who , when an incident stands half-open before them , have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions , at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate . 
The over-prudent , cats as they are , and because they are cats , sometimes incur more danger than the audacious . 
Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature . 
But Jean Valjean 's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself . 
He grumbled : -- `` Well , since there is no other means . '' 
Jean Valjean resumed : -- `` The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery . '' 
`` That is the very point that is not troublesome , '' exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
`` If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right , I am sure of getting you out of the grave . 
The grave-digger is a drunkard , and a friend of mine . 
He is Father Mestienne . 
An old fellow of the old school . 
The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave , and I put the grave-digger in my pocket . 
I will tell you what will take place . 
They will arrive a little before dusk , three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed . 
The hearse will drive directly up to the grave . 
I shall follow ; that is my business . 
I shall have a hammer , a chisel , and some pincers in my pocket . 
The hearse halts , the undertaker 's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down . 
The priest says the prayers , makes the sign of the cross , sprinkles the holy water , and takes his departure . 
I am left alone with Father Mestienne . 
He is my friend , I tell you . 
One of two things will happen , he will either be sober , or he will not be sober . 
If he is not drunk , I shall say to him : ` Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing -LSB- the Good Quince -RSB- is open . ' 
I carry him off , I get him drunk , -- it does not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk , he always has the beginning of it about him , -- I lay him under the table , I take his card , so that I can get into the cemetery again , and I return without him . 
Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with . 
If he is drunk , I shall say to him : ` Be off ; I will do your work for you . ' 
Off he goes , and I drag you out of the hole . '' 
Jean Valjean held out his hand , and Fauchelevent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant . 
`` That is settled , Father Fauchelevent . 
All will go well . '' 
`` Provided nothing goes wrong , '' thought Fauchelevent . 
`` In that case , it would be terrible . '' 
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL On the following day , as the sun was declining , the very rare passers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned hearse , ornamented with skulls , cross-bones , and tears . 
This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross , like a huge corpse with drooping arms . 
A mourning-coach , in which could be seen a priest in his surplice , and a choir boy in his red cap , followed . 
Two undertaker 's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse . 
Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer , who limped along . 
The procession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery . 
The handle of a hammer , the blade of a cold chisel , and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible , protruding from the man 's pocket . 
The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris . 
It had its peculiar usages , just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door , which old people in the quarter , who clung tenaciously to ancient words , still called the porte cavaliere and the porte pietonne . 
-LSB- 16 -RSB- The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission , as we have already stated , to be buried there in a corner apart , and at night , the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community . 
The grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter , in this cemetery , they were subjected to a special discipline . 
The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed , at that epoch , at sundown , and this being a municipal regulation , the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest . 
The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates , adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet , and inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery . 
These gates , therefore , swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides . 
If any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery , there was but one way for him to get out -- his grave-digger 's card furnished by the department of public funerals . 
A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter 's window . 
The grave-digger dropped his card into this box , the porter heard it fall , pulled the rope , and the small door opened . 
If the man had not his card , he mentioned his name , the porter , who was sometimes in bed and asleep , rose , came out and identified the man , and opened the gate with his key ; the grave-digger stepped out , but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs . 
-LSB- 16 -RSB- Instead of porte cochere and porte batarde . 
This cemetery , with its peculiarities outside the regulations , embarrassed the symmetry of the administration . 
It was suppressed a little later than 1830 . 
The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse , called the Eastern cemetery , succeeded to it , and inherited that famous dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery , which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board , and which formed an angle , one side on the drinkers ' tables , and the other on the tombs , with this sign : Au Bon Coing . 
The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery . 
It was falling into disuse . 
Dampness was invading it , the flowers were deserting it . 
The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard ; it hinted at poverty . 
Pere-Lachaise if you please ! 
to be buried in Pere-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany . 
It is recognized as elegant . 
The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure , planted like an old-fashioned French garden . 
Straight alleys , box , thuya-trees , holly , ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees , and very tall grass . 
In the evening it was tragic there . 
There were very lugubrious lines about it . 
The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery . 
The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent . 
The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar , the exit of Cosette , the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room , -- all had been executed without difficulty , and there had been no hitch . 
Let us remark in passing , that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight . 
It is one of the faults which resemble a duty . 
The nuns had committed it , not only without difficulty , but even with the applause of their own consciences . 
In the cloister , what is called the `` government '' is only an intermeddling with authority , an interference which is always questionable . 
In the first place , the rule ; as for the code , we shall see . 
Make as many laws as you please , men ; but keep them for yourselves . 
The tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to God . 
A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle .
