Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper , and who had not the air of being frightfully poor , would have been equivalent to an order . 
But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire , and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will , was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate . 
She retorted with acrimony : -- `` She must work , since she eats . 
I do n't feed her to do nothing . '' 
`` What is she making ? '' 
went on the stranger , in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter 's shoulders . 
The Thenardier deigned to reply : -- `` Stockings , if you please . 
Stockings for my little girls , who have none , so to speak , and who are absolutely barefoot just now . '' 
The man looked at Cosette 's poor little red feet , and continued : -- `` When will she have finished this pair of stockings ? '' 
`` She has at least three or four good days ' work on them still , the lazy creature ! '' 
`` And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them ? '' 
The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him . 
`` Thirty sous at least . '' 
`` Will you sell them for five francs ? '' 
went on the man . 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
exclaimed a carter who was listening , with a loud laugh ; `` five francs ! 
the deuce , I should think so ! 
five balls ! '' 
Thenardier thought it time to strike in . 
`` Yes , sir ; if such is your fancy , you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs . 
We can refuse nothing to travellers . '' 
`` You must pay on the spot , '' said the Thenardier , in her curt and peremptory fashion . 
`` I will buy that pair of stockings , '' replied the man , `` and , '' he added , drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket , and laying it on the table , `` I will pay for them . '' 
Then he turned to Cosette . 
`` Now I own your work ; play , my child . '' 
The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece , that he abandoned his glass and hastened up . 
`` But it 's true ! '' 
he cried , examining it . 
`` A real hind wheel ! 
and not counterfeit ! '' 
Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket . 
The Thenardier had no reply to make . 
She bit her lips , and her face assumed an expression of hatred . 
In the meantime , Cosette was trembling . 
She ventured to ask : -- `` Is it true , Madame ? 
May I play ? '' 
`` Play ! '' 
said the Thenardier , in a terrible voice . 
`` Thanks , Madame , '' said Cosette . 
And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier , her whole little soul thanked the traveller . 
Thenardier had resumed his drinking ; his wife whispered in his ear : -- `` Who can this yellow man be ? '' 
`` I have seen millionaires with coats like that , '' replied Thenardier , in a sovereign manner . 
Cosette had dropped her knitting , but had not left her seat . 
Cosette always moved as little as possible . 
She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her . 
Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on . 
They had just executed a very important operation ; they had just got hold of the cat . 
They had thrown their doll on the ground , and Eponine , who was the elder , was swathing the little cat , in spite of its mewing and its contortions , in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps . 
While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children , whose grace , like the splendor of the butterfly 's wing , vanishes when one essays to fix it fast . 
`` You see , sister , this doll is more amusing than the other . 
She twists , she cries , she is warm . 
See , sister , let us play with her . 
She shall be my little girl . 
I will be a lady . 
I will come to see you , and you shall look at her . 
Gradually , you will perceive her whiskers , and that will surprise you . 
And then you will see her ears , and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you . 
And you will say to me , ` Ah ! 
Mon Dieu ! ' 
and I will say to you : ` Yes , Madame , it is my little girl . 
Little girls are made like that just at present . ' '' 
Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine . 
In the meantime , the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song , and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook . 
Thenardier accompanied and encouraged them . 
As birds make nests out of everything , so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand . 
While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat , Cosette , on her side , had dressed up her sword . 
That done , she laid it in her arms , and sang to it softly , to lull it to sleep . 
The doll is one of the most imperious needs and , at the same time , one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood . 
To care for , to clothe , to deck , to dress , to undress , to redress , to teach , scold a little , to rock , to dandle , to lull to sleep , to imagine that something is some one , -- therein lies the whole woman 's future . 
While dreaming and chattering , making tiny outfits , and baby clothes , while sewing little gowns , and corsages and bodices , the child grows into a young girl , the young girl into a big girl , the big girl into a woman . 
The first child is the continuation of the last doll . 
A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy , and quite as impossible , as a woman without children . 
So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword . 
Madame Thenardier approached the yellow man ; `` My husband is right , '' she thought ; `` perhaps it is M. Laffitte ; there are such queer rich men ! '' 
She came and set her elbows on the table . 
`` Monsieur , '' said she . 
At this word , Monsieur , the man turned ; up to that time , the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme . 
`` You see , sir , '' she pursued , assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien , `` I am willing that the child should play ; I do not oppose it , but it is good for once , because you are generous . 
You see , she has nothing ; she must needs work . '' 
`` Then this child is not yours ? '' 
demanded the man . 
`` Oh ! 
mon Dieu ! 
no , sir ! 
she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity ; a sort of imbecile child . 
She must have water on the brain ; she has a large head , as you see . 
We do what we can for her , for we are not rich ; we have written in vain to her native place , and have received no reply these six months . 
It must be that her mother is dead . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the man , and fell into his revery once more . 
`` Her mother did n't amount to much , '' added the Thenardier ; `` she abandoned her child . '' 
During the whole of this conversation Cosette , as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion , had not taken her eyes from the Thenardier 's face ; she listened vaguely ; she caught a few words here and there . 
Meanwhile , the drinkers , all three-quarters intoxicated , were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety ; it was a highly spiced and wanton song , in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced . 
The Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter . 
Cosette , from her post under the table , gazed at the fire , which was reflected from her fixed eyes . 
She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made , and , as she rocked it , she sang in a low voice , `` My mother is dead ! 
my mother is dead ! 
my mother is dead ! '' 
On being urged afresh by the hostess , the yellow man , `` the millionaire , '' consented at last to take supper . 
`` What does Monsieur wish ? '' 
`` Bread and cheese , '' said the man . 
`` Decidedly , he is a beggar '' thought Madame Thenardier . 
The drunken men were still singing their song , and the child under the table was singing hers . 
All at once , Cosette paused ; she had just turned round and caught sight of the little Thenardiers ' doll , which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table . 
Then she dropped the swaddled sword , which only half met her needs , and cast her eyes slowly round the room . 
Madame Thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ; Ponine and Zelma were playing with the cat ; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing ; not a glance was fixed on her . 
She had not a moment to lose ; she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees , made sure once more that no one was watching her ; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it . 
An instant later she was in her place again , seated motionless , and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms . 
The happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness . 
No one had seen her , except the traveller , who was slowly devouring his meagre supper . 
This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour . 
But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll 's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly . 
That pink and shining foot , projecting from the shadow , suddenly struck the eye of Azelma , who said to Eponine , `` Look ! 
sister . '' 
The two little girls paused in stupefaction ; Cosette had dared to take their doll ! 
Eponine rose , and , without releasing the cat , she ran to her mother , and began to tug at her skirt . 
`` Let me alone ! '' 
said her mother ; `` what do you want ? '' 
`` Mother , '' said the child , `` look there ! '' 
And she pointed to Cosette . 
Cosette , absorbed in the ecstasies of possession , no longer saw or heard anything . 
Madame Thenardier 's countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life , and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras . 
On this occasion , wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further . 
Cosette had overstepped all bounds ; Cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to `` these young ladies . '' 
A czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son 's blue ribbon would wear no other face . 
She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation : -- `` Cosette ! '' 
Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her ; she turned round . 
`` Cosette ! '' 
repeated the Thenardier . 
Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration , mingled with despair ; then , without taking her eyes from it , she clasped her hands , and , what is terrible to relate of a child of that age , she wrung them ; then -- not one of the emotions of the day , neither the trip to the forest , nor the weight of the bucket of water , nor the loss of the money , nor the sight of the whip , nor even the sad words which she had heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her -- she wept ; she burst out sobbing . 
Meanwhile , the traveller had risen to his feet . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
he said to the Thenardier . 
`` Do n't you see ? '' 
said the Thenardier , pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at Cosette 's feet . 
`` Well , what of it ? '' 
resumed the man . 
`` That beggar , '' replied the Thenardier , `` has permitted herself to touch the children 's doll ! '' 
`` All this noise for that ! '' 
said the man ; `` well , what if she did play with that doll ? '' 
`` She touched it with her dirty hands ! '' 
pursued the Thenardier , `` with her frightful hands ! '' 
Here Cosette redoubled her sobs . 
`` Will you stop your noise ? '' 
screamed the Thenardier . 
The man went straight to the street door , opened it , and stepped out . 
As soon as he had gone , the Thenardier profited by his absence to give Cosette a hearty kick under the table , which made the child utter loud cries . 
The door opened again , the man re-appeared ; he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned , and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning , and he set it upright in front of Cosette , saying : -- `` Here ; this is for you . '' 
It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop , lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop . 
Cosette raised her eyes ; she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun ; she heard the unprecedented words , `` It is for you '' ; she stared at him ; she stared at the doll ; then she slowly retreated , and hid herself at the extreme end , under the table in a corner of the wall . 
She no longer cried ; she no longer wept ; she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe . 
The Thenardier , Eponine , and Azelma were like statues also ; the very drinkers had paused ; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room . 
Madame Thenardier , petrified and mute , recommenced her conjectures : `` Who is that old fellow ? 
Is he a poor man ? 
Is he a millionaire ? 
Perhaps he is both ; that is to say , a thief . '' 
The face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force . 
The tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller ; he seemed to be scenting out the man , as he would have scented out a bag of money . 
This did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning . 
He stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice : -- `` That machine costs at least thirty francs . 
No nonsense . 
Down on your belly before that man ! '' 
Gross natures have this in common with naive natures , that they possess no transition state . 
`` Well , Cosette , '' said the Thenardier , in a voice that strove to be sweet , and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women , `` are n't you going to take your doll ? '' 
Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole . 
`` The gentleman has given you a doll , my little Cosette , '' said Thenardier , with a caressing air . 
`` Take it ; it is yours . '' 
Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror . 
Her face was still flooded with tears , but her eyes began to fill , like the sky at daybreak , with strange beams of joy . 
What she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told , `` Little one , you are the Queen of France . '' 
It seemed to her that if she touched that doll , lightning would dart from it . 
This was true , up to a certain point , for she said to herself that the Thenardier would scold and beat her . 
Nevertheless , the attraction carried the day . 
She ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thenardier : -- `` May I , Madame ? '' 
No words can render that air , at once despairing , terrified , and ecstatic . 
`` Pardi ! '' 
cried the Thenardier , `` it is yours . 
The gentleman has given it to you . '' 
`` Truly , sir ? '' 
said Cosette . 
`` Is it true ? 
Is the ` lady ' mine ? '' 
The stranger 's eyes seemed to be full of tears . 
He appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep . 
He nodded to Cosette , and placed the `` lady 's '' hand in her tiny hand . 
Cosette hastily withdrew her hand , as though that of the `` lady '' scorched her , and began to stare at the floor . 
We are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately . 
All at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport . 
`` I shall call her Catherine , '' she said . 
It was an odd moment when Cosette 's rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll . 
`` Madame , '' she resumed , `` may I put her on a chair ? '' 
`` Yes , my child , '' replied the Thenardier . 
It was now the turn of Eponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy . 
Cosette placed Catherine on a chair , then seated herself on the floor in front of her , and remained motionless , without uttering a word , in an attitude of contemplation . 
`` Play , Cosette , '' said the stranger . 
`` Oh ! 
I am playing , '' returned the child . 
This stranger , this unknown individual , who had the air of a visit which Providence was making on Cosette , was the person whom the Thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment . 
However , it was necessary to control herself . 
Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions , these emotions were more than she could endure . 
She made haste to send her daughters to bed , then she asked the man 's permission to send Cosette off also ; `` for she has worked hard all day , '' she added with a maternal air . 
Cosette went off to bed , carrying Catherine in her arms . 
From time to time the Thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was , to relieve her soul , as she said . 
She exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud . 
`` Old beast ! 
What has he got in his belly , to come and upset us in this manner ! 
To want that little monster to play ! 
to give away forty-franc dolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous , so I would ! 
A little more and he will be saying Your Majesty to her , as though to the Duchess de Berry ! 
Is there any sense in it ? 
Is he mad , then , that mysterious old fellow ? '' 
`` Why ! 
it is perfectly simple , '' replied Thenardier , `` if that amuses him ! 
It amuses you to have the little one work ; it amuses him to have her play . 
He 's all right . 
A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it . 
If the old fellow is a philanthropist , what is that to you ? 
If he is an imbecile , it does not concern you . 
What are you worrying for , so long as he has money ? '' 
The language of a master , and the reasoning of an innkeeper , neither of which admitted of any reply . 
The man had placed his elbows on the table , and resumed his thoughtful attitude . 
All the other travellers , both pedlers and carters , had withdrawn a little , and had ceased singing . 
They were staring at him from a distance , with a sort of respectful awe . 
This poorly dressed man , who drew `` hind-wheels '' from his pocket with so much ease , and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes , was certainly a magnificent fellow , and one to be feared . 
Many hours passed . 
The midnight mass was over , the chimes had ceased , the drinkers had taken their departure , the drinking-shop was closed , the public room was deserted , the fire extinct , the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude . 
From time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned . 
That was all ; but he had not said a word since Cosette had left the room . 
The Thenardiers alone , out of politeness and curiosity , had remained in the room . 
`` Is he going to pass the night in that fashion ? '' 
grumbled the Thenardier . 
When two o'clock in the morning struck , she declared herself vanquished , and said to her husband , `` I 'm going to bed . 
Do as you like . '' 
Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner , lighted a candle , and began to read the Courrier Francais . 
A good hour passed thus . 
The worthy inn-keeper had perused the Courrier Francais at least three times , from the date of the number to the printer 's name . 
The stranger did not stir . 
Thenardier fidgeted , coughed , spit , blew his nose , and creaked his chair . 
Not a movement on the man 's part . 
`` Is he asleep ? '' 
thought Thenardier . 
The man was not asleep , but nothing could arouse him . 
At last Thenardier took off his cap , stepped gently up to him , and ventured to say : -- `` Is not Monsieur going to his repose ? '' 
Not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar . 
To repose smacked of luxury and respect . 
These words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day . 
A chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous ; a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs . 
`` Well ! '' 
said the stranger , `` you are right . 
Where is your stable ? '' 
`` Sir ! '' 
exclaimed Thenardier , with a smile , `` I will conduct you , sir . '' 
He took the candle ; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel , and Thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor , which was of rare splendor , all furnished in mahogany , with a low bedstead , curtained with red calico . 
`` What is this ? '' 
said the traveller . 
`` It is really our bridal chamber , '' said the tavern-keeper . 
`` My wife and I occupy another . 
This is only entered three or four times a year . '' 
`` I should have liked the stable quite as well , '' said the man , abruptly . 
Thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark . 
He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the chimney-piece . 
A very good fire was flickering on the hearth . 
On the chimney-piece , under a glass globe , stood a woman 's head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers . 
`` And what is this ? '' 
resumed the stranger . 
`` That , sir , '' said Thenardier , `` is my wife 's wedding bonnet . '' 
The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say , `` There really was a time , then , when that monster was a maiden ? '' 
Thenardier lied , however . 
When he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern , he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner , and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand , with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on `` his spouse , '' and would result in what the English call respectability for his house . 
When the traveller turned round , the host had disappeared . 
Thenardier had withdrawn discreetly , without venturing to wish him a good night , as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning . 
The inn-keeper retired to his room . 
His wife was in bed , but she was not asleep . 
When she heard her husband 's step she turned over and said to him : -- `` Do you know , I 'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow . '' 
Thenardier replied coldly : -- `` How you do go on ! '' 
They exchanged no further words , and a few moments later their candle was extinguished . 
As for the traveller , he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner . 
The landlord once gone , he threw himself into an arm-chair and remained for some time buried in thought . 
Then he removed his shoes , took one of the two candles , blew out the other , opened the door , and quitted the room , gazing about him like a person who is in search of something . 
He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase . 
There he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child . 
He followed this sound , and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase , or rather formed by the staircase itself . 
This recess was nothing else than the space under the steps . 
There , in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds , among dust and spiders ' webs , was a bed -- if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw , and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet . 
No sheets . 
This was placed on the floor . 
In this bed Cosette was sleeping . 
The man approached and gazed down upon her . 
Cosette was in a profound sleep ; she was fully dressed . 
In the winter she did not undress , in order that she might not be so cold . 
Against her breast was pressed the doll , whose large eyes , wide open , glittered in the dark . 
From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking , and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms . 
Beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes . 
A door which stood open near Cosette 's pallet permitted a view of a rather large , dark room . 
The stranger stepped into it . 
At the further extremity , through a glass door , he saw two small , very white beds . 
They belonged to Eponine and Azelma . 
Behind these beds , and half hidden , stood an uncurtained wicker cradle , in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep . 
The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the Thenardier pair . 
He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace -- one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all , and which are so cold to look at . 
There was no fire in this one , there was not even ashes ; but there was something which attracted the stranger 's gaze , nevertheless . 
It was two tiny children 's shoes , coquettish in shape and unequal in size . 
The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve , there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy . 
Eponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this , and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth . 
The traveller bent over them . 
The fairy , that is to say , their mother , had already paid her visit , and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece . 
The man straightened himself up , and was on the point of withdrawing , when far in , in the darkest corner of the hearth , he caught sight of another object . 
He looked at it , and recognized a wooden shoe , a frightful shoe of the coarsest description , half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud . 
It was Cosette 's sabot . 
Cosette , with that touching trust of childhood , which can always be deceived yet never discouraged , had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also . 
Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing . 
There was nothing in this wooden shoe . 
The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat , bent over and placed a louis d'or in Cosette 's shoe . 
Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf . 
THENARDIER AND HIS MANOEUVRES On the following morning , two hours at least before day-break , Thenardier , seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern , pen in hand , was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat . 
His wife , standing beside him , and half bent over him , was following him with her eyes . 
They exchanged not a word . 
On the one hand , there was profound meditation , on the other , the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind . 
A noise was audible in the house ; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs . 
After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour , and some erasures , Thenardier produced the following masterpiece : -- BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1 . 
Supper ... 3 francs . 
Chamber ... 10 '' Candle ... 5 '' Fire ... 4 '' Service ... 1 '' ---------- Total ... 23 francs . 
Service was written servisse . 
`` Twenty-three francs ! '' 
cried the woman , with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation . 
Like all great artists , Thenardier was dissatisfied . 
`` Peuh ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France 's bill at the Congress of Vienna . 
`` Monsieur Thenardier , you are right ; he certainly owes that , '' murmured the wife , who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the presence of her daughters . 
`` It is just , but it is too much . 
He will not pay it . '' 
Thenardier laughed coldly , as usual , and said : -- `` He will pay . '' 
This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority . 
That which was asserted in this manner must needs be so . 
His wife did not insist . 
She set about arranging the table ; her husband paced the room . 
A moment later he added : -- `` I owe full fifteen hundred francs ! '' 
He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner , meditating , with his feet among the warm ashes . 
`` Ah ! 
by the way , '' resumed his wife , `` you do n't forget that I 'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-day ? 
The monster ! 
She breaks my heart with that doll of hers ! 
I 'd rather marry Louis XVIII . 
than keep her another day in the house ! '' 
Thenardier lighted his pipe , and replied between two puffs : -- `` You will hand that bill to the man . '' 
Then he went out . 
Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered . 
Thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half-open door , visible only to his wife . 
The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand . 
`` Up so early ? '' 
said Madame Thenardier ; `` is Monsieur leaving us already ? '' 
As she spoke thus , she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air , and making creases in it with her nails . 
Her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it , -- timidity and scruples . 
To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air `` of a poor wretch '' seemed difficult to her . 
The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded . 
He replied : -- `` Yes , Madame , I am going . '' 
`` So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil ? '' 
`` No , I was passing through . 
That is all . 
What do I owe you , Madame , '' he added . 
The Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill . 
The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it ; but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere . 
`` Madame , '' he resumed , `` is business good here in Montfermeil ? '' 
`` So so , Monsieur , '' replied the Thenardier , stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion . 
She continued , in a dreary and lamentable tone : -- `` Oh ! 
Monsieur , times are so hard ! 
and then , we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood ! 
All the people are poor , you see . 
If we had not , now and then , some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur , we should not get along at all . 
We have so many expenses . 
Just see , that child is costing us our very eyes . '' 
`` What child ? '' 
`` Why , the little one , you know ! 
Cosette -- the Lark , as she is called hereabouts ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the man . 
She went on : -- `` How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames ! 
She has more the air of a bat than of a lark . 
You see , sir , we do not ask charity , and we can not bestow it . 
We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal . 
The license , the imposts , the door and window tax , the hundredths ! 
Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money . 
And then , I have my daughters . 
I have no need to bring up other people 's children . '' 
The man resumed , in that voice which he strove to render indifferent , and in which there lingered a tremor : -- `` What if one were to rid you of her ? '' 
`` Who ? 
Cosette ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
The landlady 's red and violent face brightened up hideously . 
`` Ah ! 
sir , my dear sir , take her , keep her , lead her off , carry her away , sugar her , stuff her with truffles , drink her , eat her , and the blessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you ! '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
`` Really ! 
You will take her away ? '' 
`` I will take her away . '' 
`` Immediately ? '' 
`` Immediately . 
Call the child . '' 
`` Cosette ! '' 
screamed the Thenardier . 
`` In the meantime , '' pursued the man , `` I will pay you what I owe you . 
How much is it ? '' 
He cast a glance on the bill , and could not restrain a start of surprise : -- `` Twenty-three francs ! '' 
He looked at the landlady , and repeated : -- `` Twenty-three francs ? '' 
There was in the enunciation of these words , thus repeated , an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point . 
The Thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock . 
She replied , with assurance : -- `` Good gracious , yes , sir , it is twenty-three francs . '' 
The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table . 
`` Go and get the child , '' said he . 
At that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room , and said : -- `` Monsieur owes twenty-six sous . '' 
`` Twenty-six sous ! '' 
exclaimed his wife . 
`` Twenty sous for the chamber , '' resumed Thenardier , coldly , `` and six sous for his supper . 
As for the child , I must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman . 
Leave us , wife . '' 
Madame Thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent . 
She was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage , uttered not a word in reply , and left the room . 
As soon as they were alone , Thenardier offered the traveller a chair . 
The traveller seated himself ; Thenardier remained standing , and his face assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity . 
`` Sir , '' said he , `` what I have to say to you is this , that I adore that child . '' 
The stranger gazed intently at him . 
`` What child ? '' 
Thenardier continued : -- `` How strange it is , one grows attached . 
What money is that ? 
Take back your hundred-sou piece . 
I adore the child . '' 
`` Whom do you mean ? '' 
demanded the stranger . 
`` Eh ! 
our little Cosette ! 
Are you not intending to take her away from us ? 
Well , I speak frankly ; as true as you are an honest man , I will not consent to it . 
I shall miss that child . 
I saw her first when she was a tiny thing . 
It is true that she costs us money ; it is true that she has her faults ; it is true that we are not rich ; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses ! 
But one must do something for the good God 's sake . 
She has neither father nor mother . 
I have brought her up . 
I have bread enough for her and for myself . 
In truth , I think a great deal of that child . 
You understand , one conceives an affection for a person ; I am a good sort of a beast , I am ; I do not reason ; I love that little girl ; my wife is quick-tempered , but she loves her also . 
You see , she is just the same as our own child . 
I want to keep her to babble about the house . '' 
The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thenardier . 
The latter continued : -- `` Excuse me , sir , but one does not give away one 's child to a passer-by , like that . 
I am right , am I not ? 
Still , I do n't say -- you are rich ; you have the air of a very good man , -- if it were for her happiness . 
But one must find out that . 
You understand : suppose that I were to let her go and to sacrifice myself , I should like to know what becomes of her ; I should not wish to lose sight of her ; I should like to know with whom she is living , so that I could go to see her from time to time ; so that she may know that her good foster-father is alive , that he is watching over her . 
In short , there are things which are not possible . 
I do not even know your name . 
If you were to take her away , I should say : ` Well , and the Lark , what has become of her ? ' 
One must , at least , see some petty scrap of paper , some trifle in the way of a passport , you know ! '' 
The stranger , still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates , as the saying goes , to the very depths of the conscience , replied in a grave , firm voice : -- `` Monsieur Thenardier , one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from Paris . 
If I take Cosette away , I shall take her away , and that is the end of the matter . 
You will not know my name , you will not know my residence , you will not know where she is ; and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives . 
I break the thread which binds her foot , and she departs . 
Does that suit you ? 
Yes or no ? '' 
Since geniuses , like demons , recognize the presence of a superior God by certain signs , Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person . 
It was like an intuition ; he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude . 
While drinking with the carters , smoking , and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening , he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger , watching him like a cat , and studying him like a mathematician . 
He had watched him , both on his own account , for the pleasure of the thing , and through instinct , and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing . 
Not a movement , not a gesture , on the part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him . 
Even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in Cosette , Thenardier had divined his purpose . 
He had caught the old man 's deep glances returning constantly to the child . 
Who was this man ? 
Why this interest ? 
Why this hideous costume , when he had so much money in his purse ? 
Questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them , and which irritated him . 
He had pondered it all night long . 
He could not be Cosette 's father . 
Was he her grandfather ? 
Then why not make himself known at once ? 
When one has a right , one asserts it . 
This man evidently had no right over Cosette . 
What was it , then ? 
Thenardier lost himself in conjectures . 
He caught glimpses of everything , but he saw nothing . 
Be that as it may , on entering into conversation with the man , sure that there was some secret in the case , that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow , he felt himself strong ; when he perceived from the stranger 's clear and firm retort , that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way , he became conscious that he was weak . 
He had expected nothing of the sort . 
His conjectures were put to the rout . 
He rallied his ideas . 
He weighed everything in the space of a second . 
Thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance . 
He decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward , and quickly at that . 
He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment , which they know that they alone recognize ; he abruptly unmasked his batteries . 
`` Sir , '' said he , `` I am in need of fifteen hundred francs . '' 
The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather , opened it , drew out three bank-bills , which he laid on the table . 
Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn-keeper : -- `` Go and fetch Cosette . '' 
While this was taking place , what had Cosette been doing ? 
On waking up , Cosette had run to get her shoe . 
In it she had found the gold piece . 
It was not a Napoleon ; it was one of those perfectly new twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration , on whose effigy the little Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath . 
Cosette was dazzled . 
Her destiny began to intoxicate her . 
She did not know what a gold piece was ; she had never seen one ; she hid it quickly in her pocket , as though she had stolen it . 
Still , she felt that it really was hers ; she guessed whence her gift had come , but the joy which she experienced was full of fear .
