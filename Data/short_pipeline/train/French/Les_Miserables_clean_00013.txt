The wheel really had suffered serious damage . 
The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub , so that the nut no longer held firm . 
`` My friend , '' he said to the stableman , `` is there a wheelwright here ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Do me the service to go and fetch him . '' 
`` He is only a step from here . 
Hey ! 
Master Bourgaillard ! '' 
Master Bourgaillard , the wheelwright , was standing on his own threshold . 
He came , examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken . 
`` Can you repair this wheel immediately ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
`` When can I set out again ? '' 
`` To-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow ! '' 
`` There is a long day 's work on it . 
Are you in a hurry , sir ? '' 
`` In a very great hurry . 
I must set out again in an hour at the latest . '' 
`` Impossible , sir . '' 
`` I will pay whatever you ask . '' 
`` Impossible . '' 
`` Well , in two hours , then . '' 
`` Impossible to-day . 
Two new spokes and a hub must be made . 
Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning . '' 
`` The matter can not wait until to-morrow . 
What if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it ? '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` You are a wheelwright ? '' 
`` Certainly , sir . '' 
`` Have you not a wheel that you can sell me ? 
Then I could start again at once . '' 
`` A spare wheel ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet . 
Two wheels make a pair . 
Two wheels can not be put together hap-hazard . '' 
`` In that case , sell me a pair of wheels . '' 
`` Not all wheels fit all axles , sir . '' 
`` Try , nevertheless . '' 
`` It is useless , sir . 
I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels . 
We are but a poor country here . '' 
`` Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have ? '' 
The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle . 
He shrugged his shoulders . 
`` You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well ! 
If I had one , I would not let it to you ! '' 
`` Well , sell it to me , then . '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` What ! 
not even a spring-cart ? 
I am not hard to please , as you see . '' 
`` We live in a poor country . 
There is , in truth , '' added the wheelwright , `` an old calash under the shed yonder , which belongs to a bourgeois of the town , who gave it to me to take care of , and who only uses it on the thirty-sixth of the month -- never , that is to say . 
I might let that to you , for what matters it to me ? 
But the bourgeois must not see it pass -- and then , it is a calash ; it would require two horses . '' 
`` I will take two post-horses . '' 
`` Where is Monsieur going ? '' 
`` To Arras . '' 
`` And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` By taking two post-horses ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock to-morrow morning ? '' 
`` Certainly not . '' 
`` There is one thing to be said about that , you see , by taking post-horses -- Monsieur has his passport ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , by taking post-horses , Monsieur can not reach Arras before to-morrow . 
We are on a cross-road . 
The relays are badly served , the horses are in the fields . 
The season for ploughing is just beginning ; heavy teams are required , and horses are seized upon everywhere , from the post as well as elsewhere . 
Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay . 
And , then , they drive at a walk . 
There are many hills to ascend . '' 
`` Come then , I will go on horseback . 
Unharness the cabriolet . 
Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood . '' 
`` Without doubt . 
But will this horse bear the saddle ? '' 
`` That is true ; you remind me of that ; he will not bear it . '' 
`` Then -- '' `` But I can surely hire a horse in the village ? '' 
`` A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts . 
You would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you . 
But you will not find one for sale nor to let , for five hundred francs , or for a thousand . '' 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
`` The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man , and set out on your journey to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow will be too late . '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras ? 
When will it pass ? '' 
`` To-night . 
Both the posts pass at night ; the one going as well as the one coming . '' 
`` What ! 
It will take you a day to mend this wheel ? '' 
`` A day , and a good long one . '' 
`` If you set two men to work ? '' 
`` If I set ten men to work . '' 
`` What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes ? '' 
`` That could be done with the spokes , not with the hub ; and the felly is in a bad state , too . '' 
`` Is there any one in this village who lets out teams ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Is there another wheelwright ? '' 
The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert , with a toss of the head `` No . '' 
He felt an immense joy . 
It was evident that Providence was intervening . 
That it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road . 
He had not yielded to this sort of first summons ; he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey ; he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means ; he had been deterred neither by the season , nor fatigue , nor by the expense ; he had nothing with which to reproach himself . 
If he went no further , that was no fault of his . 
It did not concern him further . 
It was no longer his fault . 
It was not the act of his own conscience , but the act of Providence . 
He breathed again . 
He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since Javert 's visit . 
It seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him . 
It seemed to him that God was for him now , and was manifesting Himself . 
He said himself that he had done all he could , and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly . 
If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn , it would have had no witnesses , no one would have heard him , things would have rested there , and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse ; but this conversation had taken place in the street . 
Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd . 
There are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators . 
While he was questioning the wheelwright , some people who were passing back and forth halted around them . 
After listening for a few minutes , a young lad , to whom no one had paid any heed , detached himself from the group and ran off . 
At the moment when the traveller , after the inward deliberation which we have just described , resolved to retrace his steps , this child returned . 
He was accompanied by an old woman . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the woman , `` my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet . '' 
These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs . 
He thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him , ready to seize him once more . 
He answered : -- `` Yes , my good woman ; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire . '' 
And he hastened to add : -- `` But there is none in the place . '' 
`` Certainly there is , '' said the old woman . 
`` Where ? '' 
interpolated the wheelwright . 
`` At my house , '' replied the old woman . 
He shuddered . 
The fatal hand had grasped him again . 
The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart . 
The wheelwright and the stable-man , in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches , interfered . 
`` It was a frightful old trap ; it rests flat on the axle ; it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs ; the rain came into it ; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture ; it would not go much further than the tilbury ; a regular ramshackle old stage-wagon ; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it , '' etc. , etc. . 
All this was true ; but this trap , this ramshackle old vehicle , this thing , whatever it was , ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras . 
He paid what was asked , left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired , intending to reclaim it on his return , had the white horse put to the cart , climbed into it , and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning . 
At the moment when the cart moved off , he admitted that he had felt , a moment previously , a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding . 
He examined this joy with a sort of wrath , and found it absurd . 
Why should he feel joy at turning back ? 
After all , he was taking this trip of his own free will . 
No one was forcing him to it . 
And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose . 
As he left Hesdin , he heard a voice shouting to him : `` Stop ! 
Stop ! '' 
He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope . 
It was the old woman 's little boy . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the latter , `` it was I who got the cart for you . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` You have not given me anything . '' 
He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious . 
`` Ah ! 
it 's you , you scamp ? '' 
said he ; `` you shall have nothing . '' 
He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed . 
He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin . 
He wanted to make it good . 
The little horse was courageous , and pulled for two ; but it was the month of February , there had been rain ; the roads were bad . 
And then , it was no longer the tilbury . 
The cart was very heavy , and in addition , there were many ascents . 
He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol ; four hours for five leagues . 
At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable ; as he had promised Scaufflaire , he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating ; he thought of sad and confusing things . 
The inn-keeper 's wife came to the stable . 
`` Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast ? '' 
`` Come , that is true ; I even have a good appetite . '' 
He followed the woman , who had a rosy , cheerful face ; she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth . 
`` Make haste ! '' 
said he ; `` I must start again ; I am in a hurry . '' 
A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste ; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort . 
`` That is what ailed me , '' he thought ; `` I had not breakfasted . '' 
His breakfast was served ; he seized the bread , took a mouthful , and then slowly replaced it on the table , and did not touch it again . 
A carter was eating at another table ; he said to this man : -- `` Why is their bread so bitter here ? '' 
The carter was a German and did not understand him . 
He returned to the stable and remained near the horse . 
An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course towards Tinques , which is only five leagues from Arras . 
What did he do during this journey ? 
Of what was he thinking ? 
As in the morning , he watched the trees , the thatched roofs , the tilled fields pass by , and the way in which the landscape , broken at every turn of the road , vanished ; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul , and almost relieves it from thought . 
What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time ? 
To travel is to be born and to die at every instant ; perhaps , in the vaguest region of his mind , be did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence : all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us ; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled ; after a dazzling moment , an eclipse ; we look , we hasten , we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing ; each event is a turn in the road , and , all at once , we are old ; we feel a shock ; all is black ; we distinguish an obscure door ; the gloomy horse of life , which has been drawing us halts , and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows . 
Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques ; it is true that the days were still short ; he did not halt at Tinques ; as he emerged from the village , a laborer , who was mending the road with stones , raised his head and said to him : -- `` That horse is very much fatigued . '' 
The poor beast was , in fact , going at a walk . 
`` Are you going to Arras ? '' 
added the road-mender . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early . '' 
He stopped his horse , and asked the laborer : -- `` How far is it from here to Arras ? '' 
`` Nearly seven good leagues . '' 
`` How is that ? 
the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
returned the road-mender , `` so you do n't know that the road is under repair ? 
You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on ; there is no way to proceed further . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` You will take the road on the left , leading to Carency ; you will cross the river ; when you reach Camblin , you will turn to the right ; that is the road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads to Arras . '' 
`` But it is night , and I shall lose my way . '' 
`` You do not belong in these parts ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` And , besides , it is all cross-roads ; stop ! 
sir , '' resumed the road-mender ; `` shall I give you a piece of advice ? 
your horse is tired ; return to Tinques ; there is a good inn there ; sleep there ; you can reach Arras to-morrow . '' 
`` I must be there this evening . '' 
`` That is different ; but go to the inn all the same , and get an extra horse ; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads . '' 
He followed the road-mender 's advice , retraced his steps , and , half an hour later , he passed the same spot again , but this time at full speed , with a good horse to aid ; a stable-boy , who called himself a postilion , was seated on the shaft of the cariole . 
Still , he felt that he had lost time . 
Night had fully come . 
They turned into the cross-road ; the way became frightfully bad ; the cart lurched from one rut to the other ; he said to the postilion : -- `` Keep at a trot , and you shall have a double fee . '' 
In one of the jolts , the whiffle-tree broke . 
`` There 's the whiffle-tree broken , sir , '' said the postilion ; `` I do n't know how to harness my horse now ; this road is very bad at night ; if you wish to return and sleep at Tinques , we could be in Arras early to-morrow morning . '' 
He replied , `` Have you a bit of rope and a knife ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it . 
This caused another loss of twenty minutes ; but they set out again at a gallop . 
The plain was gloomy ; low-hanging , black , crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke : there were whitish gleams in the clouds ; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon , as of some one moving furniture ; everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror . 
How many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night ! 
He was stiff with cold ; he had eaten nothing since the night before ; he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of D -- , eight years previously , and it seemed but yesterday . 
The hour struck from a distant tower ; he asked the boy : -- `` What time is it ? '' 
`` Seven o'clock , sir ; we shall reach Arras at eight ; we have but three leagues still to go . '' 
At that moment , he for the first time indulged in this reflection , thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner : that all this trouble which he was taking was , perhaps , useless ; that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial ; that he should , at least , have informed himself of that ; that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not ; then he sketched out some calculations in his mind : that , ordinarily , the sittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning ; that it could not be a long affair ; that the theft of the apples would be very brief ; that there would then remain only a question of identity , four or five depositions , and very little for the lawyers to say ; that he should arrive after all was over . 
The postilion whipped up the horses ; they had crossed the river and left Mont-Saint-Eloy behind them . 
The night grew more profound . 
SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF But at that moment Fantine was joyous . 
She had passed a very bad night ; her cough was frightful ; her fever had doubled in intensity ; she had had dreams : in the morning , when the doctor paid his visit , she was delirious ; he assumed an alarmed look , and ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived . 
All the morning she was melancholy , said but little , and laid plaits in her sheets , murmuring the while , in a low voice , calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances . 
Her eyes were hollow and staring . 
They seemed almost extinguished at intervals , then lighted up again and shone like stars . 
It seems as though , at the approach of a certain dark hour , the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth . 
Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt , she replied invariably , `` Well . 
I should like to see M. Madeleine . '' 
Some months before this , at the moment when Fantine had just lost her last modesty , her last shame , and her last joy , she was the shadow of herself ; now she was the spectre of herself . 
Physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering . 
This creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow , flabby cheeks , pinched nostrils , teeth from which the gums had receded , a leaden complexion , a bony neck , prominent shoulder-blades , frail limbs , a clayey skin , and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray . 
Alas ! 
how illness improvises old-age ! 
At mid-day the physician returned , gave some directions , inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary , and shook his head . 
M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock . 
As exactness is kindness , he was exact . 
About half-past two , Fantine began to be restless . 
In the course of twenty minutes , she asked the nun more than ten times , `` What time is it , sister ? '' 
Three o'clock struck . 
At the third stroke , Fantine sat up in bed ; she who could , in general , hardly turn over , joined her yellow , fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp , and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection . 
Then Fantine turned and looked at the door . 
No one entered ; the door did not open . 
She remained thus for a quarter of an hour , her eyes riveted on the door , motionless and apparently holding her breath . 
The sister dared not speak to her . 
The clock struck a quarter past three . 
Fantine fell back on her pillow . 
She said nothing , but began to plait the sheets once more . 
Half an hour passed , then an hour , no one came ; every time the clock struck , Fantine started up and looked towards the door , then fell back again . 
Her thought was clearly perceptible , but she uttered no name , she made no complaint , she blamed no one . 
But she coughed in a melancholy way . 
One would have said that something dark was descending upon her . 
She was livid and her lips were blue . 
She smiled now and then . 
Five o'clock struck . 
Then the sister heard her say , very low and gently , `` He is wrong not to come to-day , since I am going away to-morrow . '' 
Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine 's delay . 
In the meantime , Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed . 
She seemed to be endeavoring to recall something . 
All at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath . 
The nun listened . 
This is what Fantine was singing : -- `` Lovely things we will buy As we stroll the faubourgs through . 
Roses are pink , corn-flowers are blue , I love my love , corn-flowers are blue . 
`` Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove , in a broidered mantle clad , and said to me , ` Here , hide ` neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me . 
Haste to the city , buy linen , buy a needle , buy thread . ' 
`` Lovely things we will buy As we stroll the faubourgs through . 
`` Dear Holy Virgin , beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbons decked . 
God may give me his loveliest star ; I prefer the child thou hast granted me . 
` Madame , what shall I do with this linen fine ? ' 
-- ` Make of it clothes for thy new-born babe . ' 
`` Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue , I love my love , and corn-flowers are blue . '' 
` Wash this linen . ' 
-- ` Where ? ' 
-- ` In the stream . 
Make of it , soiling not , spoiling not , a petticoat fair with its bodice fine , which I will embroider and fill with flowers . ' 
-- ` Madame , the child is no longer here ; what is to be done ? ' 
-- ` Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury me . ' 
`` Lovely things we will buy As we stroll the faubourgs through , Roses are pink , corn-flowers are blue , I love my love , corn-flowers are blue . '' 
This song was an old cradle romance with which she had , in former days , lulled her little Cosette to sleep , and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child . 
She sang it in so sad a voice , and to so sweet an air , that it was enough to make any one , even a nun , weep . 
The sister , accustomed as she was to austerities , felt a tear spring to her eyes . 
The clock struck six . 
Fantine did not seem to hear it . 
She no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her . 
Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the factory , whether the mayor had returned , and if he would not come to the infirmary soon . 
The girl returned in a few minutes . 
Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts . 
The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone , that the mayor had set out that morning before six o'clock , in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse , cold as the weather was ; that he had gone alone , without even a driver ; that no one knew what road he had taken ; that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras ; that others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris . 
That when he went away he had been very gentle , as usual , and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night . 
While the two women were whispering together , with their backs turned to Fantine 's bed , the sister interrogating , the servant conjecturing , Fantine , with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies , which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death , had raised herself to her knees in bed , with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster , and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains , and was listening . 
All at once she cried : -- `` You are speaking of M. Madeleine ! 
Why are you talking so low ? 
What is he doing ? 
Why does he not come ? '' 
Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man ; they wheeled round in affright . 
`` Answer me ! '' 
cried Fantine . 
The servant stammered : -- `` The portress told me that he could not come to-day . '' 
`` Be calm , my child , '' said the sister ; `` lie down again . '' 
Fantine , without changing her attitude , continued in a loud voice , and with an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending : -- `` He can not come ? 
Why not ? 
You know the reason . 
You are whispering it to each other there . 
I want to know it . '' 
The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun 's ear , `` Say that he is busy with the city council . '' 
Sister Simplice blushed faintly , for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her . 
On the other hand , it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would , without doubt , deal her a terrible blow , and that this was a serious matter in Fantine 's present state . 
Her flush did not last long ; the sister raised her calm , sad eyes to Fantine , and said , `` Monsieur le Maire has gone away . '' 
Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed : her eyes sparkled ; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face . 
`` Gone ! '' 
she cried ; `` he has gone to get Cosette . '' 
Then she raised her arms to heaven , and her white face became ineffable ; her lips moved ; she was praying in a low voice . 
When her prayer was finished , `` Sister , '' she said , `` I am willing to lie down again ; I will do anything you wish ; I was naughty just now ; I beg your pardon for having spoken so loud ; it is very wrong to talk loudly ; I know that well , my good sister , but , you see , I am very happy : the good God is good ; M. Madeleine is good ; just think ! 
he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little Cosette . '' 
She lay down again , with the nun 's assistance , helped the nun to arrange her pillow , and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck , and which Sister Simplice had given her . 
`` My child , '' said the sister , `` try to rest now , and do not talk any more . '' 
Fantine took the sister 's hand in her moist hands , and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration . 
`` He set out this morning for Paris ; in fact , he need not even go through Paris ; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence . 
Do you remember how he said to me yesterday , when I spoke to him of Cosette , Soon , soon ? 
He wants to give me a surprise , you know ! 
he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers ; they can not say anything , can they ? 
they will give back Cosette , for they have been paid ; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay . 
Do not make signs to me that I must not talk , sister ! 
I am extremely happy ; I am doing well ; I am not ill at all any more ; I am going to see Cosette again ; I am even quite hungry ; it is nearly five years since I saw her last ; you can not imagine how much attached one gets to children , and then , she will be so pretty ; you will see ! 
If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had ! 
In the first place , she will have very beautiful hands ; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old ; like this ! 
she must be a big girl now ; she is seven years old ; she is quite a young lady ; I call her Cosette , but her name is really Euphrasie . 
Stop ! 
this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece , and I had a sort of idea come across me , like that , that I should see Cosette again soon . 
Mon Dieu ! 
how wrong it is not to see one 's children for years ! 
One ought to reflect that life is not eternal . 
Oh , how good M. le Maire is to go ! 
it is very cold ! 
it is true ; he had on his cloak , at least ? 
he will be here to-morrow , will he not ? 
to-morrow will be a festival day ; to-morrow morning , sister , you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it . 
What a place that Montfermeil is ! 
I took that journey on foot once ; it was very long for me , but the diligences go very quickly ! 
he will be here to-morrow with Cosette : how far is it from here to Montfermeil ? '' 
The sister , who had no idea of distances , replied , `` Oh , I think that be will be here to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow ! 
to-morrow ! '' 
said Fantine , `` I shall see Cosette to-morrow ! 
you see , good sister of the good God , that I am no longer ill ; I am mad ; I could dance if any one wished it . '' 
A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change ; she was all rosy now ; she spoke in a lively and natural voice ; her whole face was one smile ; now and then she talked , she laughed softly ; the joy of a mother is almost infantile . 
`` Well , '' resumed the nun , `` now that you are happy , mind me , and do not talk any more . '' 
Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice : `` Yes , lie down again ; be good , for you are going to have your child ; Sister Simplice is right ; every one here is right . '' 
And then , without stirring , without even moving her head , she began to stare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air , and she said nothing more . 
The sister drew the curtains together again , hoping that she would fall into a doze . 
Between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came ; not hearing any sound , he thought Fantine was asleep , entered softly , and approached the bed on tiptoe ; he opened the curtains a little , and , by the light of the taper , he saw Fantine 's big eyes gazing at him . 
She said to him , `` She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed , will she not , sir ? '' 
The doctor thought that she was delirious . 
She added : -- `` See ! 
there is just room . '' 
The doctor took Sister Simplice aside , and she explained matters to him ; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two , and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid , who believed that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil ; that it was possible , after all , that her guess was correct : the doctor approved . 
He returned to Fantine 's bed , and she went on : -- `` You see , when she wakes up in the morning , I shall be able to say good morning to her , poor kitten , and when I can not sleep at night , I can hear her asleep ; her little gentle breathing will do me good . '' 
`` Give me your hand , '' said the doctor . 
She stretched out her arm , and exclaimed with a laugh : -- `` Ah , hold ! 
in truth , you did not know it ; I am cured ; Cosette will arrive to-morrow . '' 
The doctor was surprised ; she was better ; the pressure on her chest had decreased ; her pulse had regained its strength ; a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor , worn-out creature . 
`` Doctor , '' she went on , `` did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has gone to get that mite of a child ? '' 
The doctor recommended silence , and that all painful emotions should be avoided ; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona , and , in case the fever should increase again during the night , a calming potion . 
As he took his departure , he said to the sister : -- `` She is doing better ; if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to-morrow with the child , who knows ? 
there are crises so astounding ; great joy has been known to arrest maladies ; I know well that this is an organic disease , and in an advanced state , but all those things are such mysteries : we may be able to save her . '' 
THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR DEPARTURE It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart , which we left on the road , entered the porte-cochere of the Hotel de la Poste in Arras ; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it , responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn , sent back the extra horse , and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable ; then he opened the door of a billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor , sat down there , and leaned his elbows on a table ; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six ; he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault , but at bottom , he was not sorry . 
The landlady of the hotel entered . 
`` Does Monsieur wish a bed ? 
Does Monsieur require supper ? '' 
He made a sign of the head in the negative . 
`` The stableman says that Monsieur 's horse is extremely fatigued . '' 
Here he broke his silence . 
`` Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow morning ? '' 
`` Oh , Monsieur ! 
he must rest for two days at least . '' 
He inquired : -- `` Is not the posting-station located here ? '' 
`` Yes , sir . '' 
The hostess conducted him to the office ; he showed his passport , and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon ; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be vacant ; he engaged it and paid for it . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the clerk , `` do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning . '' 
This done , he left the hotel and began to wander about the town . 
He was not acquainted with Arras ; the streets were dark , and he walked on at random ; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers-by . 
He crossed the little river Crinchon , and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way . 
A citizen was passing along with a lantern . 
After some hesitation , he decided to apply to this man , not without having first glanced behind and in front of him , as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` where is the court-house , if you please . '' 
`` You do not belong in town , sir ? '' 
replied the bourgeois , who was an oldish man ; `` well , follow me . 
I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house , that is to say , in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture ; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment , and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture . '' 
`` Is it there that the Assizes are held ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Certainly , sir ; you see , the prefecture of to-day was the bishop 's palace before the Revolution . 
M. de Conzie , who was bishop in ' 82 , built a grand hall there . 
It is in this grand hall that the court is held . '' 
On the way , the bourgeois said to him : -- `` If Monsieur desires to witness a case , it is rather late . 
The sittings generally close at six o'clock . '' 
When they arrived on the grand square , however , the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up , in the front of a vast and gloomy building . 
`` Upon my word , sir , you are in luck ; you have arrived in season . 
Do you see those four windows ? 
That is the Court of Assizes . 
There is light there , so they are not through . 
The matter must have been greatly protracted , and they are holding an evening session . 
Do you take an interest in this affair ? 
Is it a criminal case ? 
Are you a witness ? '' 
He replied : -- `` I have not come on any business ; I only wish to speak to one of the lawyers . '' 
`` That is different , '' said the bourgeois . 
`` Stop , sir ; here is the door where the sentry stands . 
You have only to ascend the grand staircase . '' 
He conformed to the bourgeois 's directions , and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people , and where groups , intermingled with lawyers in their gowns , were whispering together here and there . 
It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black , murmuring together in low voices , on the threshold of the halls of justice . 
It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words . 
Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result . 
All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices . 
This spacious hall , illuminated by a single lamp , was the old hall of the episcopal palace , and served as the large hall of the palace of justice . 
A double-leaved door , which was closed at that moment , separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting . 
The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met . 
`` What stage have they reached , sir ? '' 
he asked . 
`` It is finished , '' said the lawyer . 
`` Finished ! '' 
This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round . 
`` Excuse me sir ; perhaps you are a relative ? '' 
`` No ; I know no one here . 
Has judgment been pronounced ? '' 
`` Of course . 
Nothing else was possible . '' 
`` To penal servitude ? '' 
`` For life . '' 
He continued , in a voice so weak that it was barely audible : -- `` Then his identity was established ? '' 
`` What identity ? '' 
replied the lawyer . 
`` There was no identity to be established . 
The matter was very simple . 
The woman had murdered her child ; the infanticide was proved ; the jury threw out the question of premeditation , and she was condemned for life . '' 
`` So it was a woman ? '' 
said he . 
`` Why , certainly . 
The Limosin woman . 
Of what are you speaking ? '' 
`` Nothing . 
But since it is all over , how comes it that the hall is still lighted ? '' 
`` For another case , which was begun about two hours ago . 
`` What other case ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
this one is a clear case also . 
It is about a sort of blackguard ; a man arrested for a second offence ; a convict who has been guilty of theft . 
I do n't know his name exactly . 
There 's a bandit 's phiz for you ! 
I 'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone . '' 
`` Is there any way of getting into the court-room , sir ? '' 
said he . 
`` I really think that there is not . 
There is a great crowd . 
However , the hearing has been suspended . 
Some people have gone out , and when the hearing is resumed , you might make an effort . '' 
`` Where is the entrance ? '' 
`` Through yonder large door . '' 
The lawyer left him . 
In the course of a few moments he had experienced , almost simultaneously , almost intermingled with each other , all possible emotions . 
The words of this indifferent spectator had , in turn , pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire . 
When he saw that nothing was settled , he breathed freely once more ; but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure . 
He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying . 
The docket of the session was very heavy ; the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases . 
They had begun with the infanticide , and now they had reached the convict , the old offender , the `` return horse . '' 
This man had stolen apples , but that did not appear to be entirely proved ; what had been proved was , that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon . 
It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case . 
However , the man 's examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed , but the lawyer 's plea , and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come ; it could not be finished before midnight . 
The man would probably be condemned ; the attorney-general was very clever , and never missed his culprits ; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses . 
An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes . 
He inquired of this usher : -- `` Will the door be opened soon , sir ? '' 
`` It will not be opened at all , '' replied the usher . 
`` What ! 
It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed ? 
Is not the hearing suspended ? '' 
`` The hearing has just been begun again , '' replied the usher , `` but the door will not be opened again . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because the hall is full . '' 
`` What ! 
There is not room for one more ? '' 
`` Not another one . 
The door is closed . 
No one can enter now . '' 
The usher added after a pause : `` There are , to tell the truth , two or three extra places behind Monsieur le President , but Monsieur le President only admits public functionaries to them . '' 
So saying , the usher turned his back . 
He retired with bowed head , traversed the antechamber , and slowly descended the stairs , as though hesitating at every step . 
It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself . 
The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended ; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it . 
On reaching the landing-place , he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms . 
All at once he opened his coat , drew out his pocket-book , took from it a pencil , tore out a leaf , and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly , by the light of the street lantern , this line : M. Madeleine , Mayor of M. sur M. ; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides , made his way through the crowd , walked straight up to the usher , handed him the paper , and said in an authoritative manner : -- `` Take this to Monsieur le President . '' 
The usher took the paper , cast a glance upon it , and obeyed . 
AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR Although he did not suspect the fact , the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a sort of celebrity . 
For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais ; it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments . 
Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry , there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some benefit . 
He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements .
