The king will not refuse me , and I will take you with me . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' replied Raoul , pressing his hand with emotion , `` thanks for that offer , which would give us more than we wish , either monsieur le comte or I. I , who am young , stand in need of labor of mind and fatigue of body ; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose . 
You are his best friend . 
I recommend him to your care . 
In watching over him , you are holding both our souls in your hands . '' 
`` I must go ; my horse is all in a fret , '' said D'Artagnan , with whom the most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in conversation . 
`` Come , comte , how many days longer has Raoul to stay here ? '' 
`` Three days at most . '' 
`` And how long will it take you to reach home ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a considerable time , '' replied Athos . 
`` I shall not like the idea of being separated too quickly from Raoul . 
Time will travel too fast of itself to require me to aid it by distance . 
I shall only make half - stages . '' 
`` And why so , my friend ? 
Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly ; and hostelry life does not become a man like you . '' 
`` My friend , I came hither on post-horses ; but I wish to purchase two animals of a superior kind . 
Now , to take them home fresh , it would not be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day . '' 
`` Where is Grimaud ? '' 
`` He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul 's appointments ; and I have left him to sleep . '' 
`` That is , never to come back again , '' D'Artagnan suffered to escape him . 
`` Till we meet again , then , dear Athos - and if you are diligent , I shall embrace you the sooner . '' 
So saying , he put his foot in the stirrup , which Raoul held . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said the young man , embracing him . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , as he got into his saddle . 
His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends . 
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos , near the gates of Antibes , whither D'Artagnan , after his supper , had ordered his horses to be brought . 
The road began to branch off there , white and undulating in the vapors of the night . 
The horse eagerly respired the salt , sharp perfume of the marshes . 
D'Artagnan put him to a trot ; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house . 
All at once they heard the rapid approach of a horse 's steps , and first believed it to be one of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a road . 
But it was really the return of the horseman . 
They uttered a cry of joyous surprise ; and the captain , springing to the ground like a young man , seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul . 
He held them long embraced thus , without speaking a word , or suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him . 
Then , as rapidly as he had come back , he set off again , with a sharp application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the comte , in a low voice , `` alas ! 
alas ! '' 
`` An evil omen ! '' 
on his side , said D'Artagnan to himself , making up for lost time . 
`` I could not smile upon them . 
An evil omen ! '' 
The next day Grimaud was on foot again . 
The service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished . 
The flotilla , sent to Toulon by the exertions of Raoul , had set out , dragging after it in little nutshells , almost invisible , the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in requisition for the service of the fleet . 
The time , so short , which remained for father and son to live together , appeared to go by with double rapidity , like some swift stream that flows towards eternity . 
Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon , which began to be filled with the noise of carriages , with the noise of arms , the noise of neighing horses . 
The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches ; the drummers signalized their strength ; the streets were overflowing with soldiers , servants , and tradespeople . 
The Duc de Beaufort was everywhere , superintending the embarkation with the zeal and interest of a good captain . 
He encouraged the humblest of his companions ; he scolded his lieutenants , even those of the highest rank . 
Artillery , provisions , baggage , he insisted upon seeing all himself . 
He examined the equipment of every soldier ; assured himself of the health and soundness of every horse . 
It was plain that , light , boastful , egotistical , in his hotel , the gentleman became the soldier again - the high noble , a captain - in face of the responsibility he had accepted . 
And yet , it must be admitted that , whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations for departure , it was easy to perceive careless precipitation , and the absence of all the precaution that make the French solider the first soldier in the world , because , in that world , he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral resources . 
All things having satisfied , or appearing to have satisfied , the admiral , he paid his compliments to Raoul , and gave the last orders for sailing , which was ordered the next morning at daybreak . 
He invited the comte had his son to dine with him ; but they , under a pretext of service , kept themselves apart . 
Gaining their hostelry , situated under the trees of the great Place , they took their repast in haste , and Athos led Raoul to the rocks which dominate the city , vast gray mountains , whence the view is infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears , so remote is it , on a level with the rocks themselves . 
The night was fine , as it always is in these happy climes . 
The moon , rising behind the rocks , unrolled a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea . 
In the roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to facilitate the embarkation . 
The sea , loaded with phosphoric light , opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and munitions ; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames ; from every oar dropped liquid diamonds . 
The sailors , rejoicing in the largesses of the admiral , were heard murmuring their slow and artless songs . 
Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot falling into the holds . 
Such harmonies , such a spectacle , oppress the heart like fear , and dilate it like hope . 
All this life speaks of death . 
Athos had seated himself with his son , upon the moss , among the brambles of the promontory . 
Around their heads passed and repassed large bats , carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind chase . 
The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff , bathed in that void which is peopled by vertigo , and provokes to self-annihilation . 
When the moon had risen to its fullest height , caressing with light the neighboring peaks , when the watery mirror was illumined in its full extent , and the little red fires had made their openings in the black masses of every ship , Athos , collecting all his ideas and all his courage , said : `` God has made all these things that we see , Raoul ; He has made us also , - poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe . 
We shine like those fires and those stars ; we sigh like those waves ; we suffer like those great ships , which are worn out in plowing the waves , in obeying the wind that urges them towards an end , as the breath of God blows us towards a port . 
Everything likes to live , Raoul ; and everything seems beautiful to living things . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said Raoul , `` we have before us a beautiful spectacle ! '' 
`` How good D'Artagnan is ! '' 
interrupted Athos , suddenly , `` and what a rare good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as he is ! 
That is what you have missed , Raoul . '' 
`` A friend ! '' 
cried Raoul , `` I have wanted a friend ! '' 
`` M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion , '' resumed the comte , coldly , `` but I believe , in the times in which you live , men are more engaged in their own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours . 
You have sought a secluded life ; that is a great happiness , but you have lost your strength thereby . 
We four , more weaned from those delicate abstractions that constitute your joy , furnished much more resistance when misfortune presented itself . '' 
`` I have not interrupted you , monsieur , to tell you that I had a friend , and that that friend is M. de Guiche . 
Certes , he is good and generous , and moreover he loves me . 
But I have lived under the guardianship of another friendship , monsieur , as precious and as strong as that of which you speak , since it is yours . '' 
`` I have not been a friend for you , Raoul , '' said Athos . 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur , and in what respect not ? '' 
`` Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face , because , sad and severe , alas ! 
I have always cut off for you , without , God knows , wishing to do so , the joyous buds that spring incessantly from the fair tree of youth ; so that at this moment I repent of not having made of you a more expansive , dissipated , animated man . '' 
`` I know why you say that , monsieur . 
No , it is not you who have made me what I am ; it was love , which took me at the time when children only have inclinations ; it is the constancy natural to my character , which with other creatures is but habit . 
I believed that I should always be as I was ; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear , quite straight , bordered with fruits and flowers . 
I had ever watching over me your vigilance and strength . 
I believed myself to be vigilant and strong . 
Nothing prepared me ; I fell once , and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my life . 
It is quite true that I wrecked myself . 
Oh , no , monsieur ! 
you are nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope ! 
No , I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me ; I bless you , and I love you ardently . '' 
`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . '' 
`` I will do all you may command , '' said Raoul , much agitated . 
`` It is not necessary , Raoul , that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into too hazardous enterprises . 
You have gone through your ordeal ; you are known to be a true man under fire . 
Remember that war with Arabs is a war of snares , ambuscades , and assassinations . '' 
`` So it is said , monsieur . '' 
`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults . 
Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you , Raoul ? 
God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters . '' 
`` I am naturally prudent , monsieur , and I have very good fortune , '' said Raoul , with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father ; `` for , '' the young man hastened to add , `` in twenty combats through which I have been , I have only received one scratch . '' 
`` There is in addition , '' said Athos , `` the climate to be dreaded : that is an ugly end , to die of fever ! 
King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague , rather than the fever . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
with sobriety , with reasonable exercise - '' `` I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France . 
You , as his aide - de-camp , will be charged with expediting them , and will be sure not to forget me . '' 
`` No , monsieur , '' said Raoul , almost choked with emotion . 
`` Besides , Raoul , as you are a good Christian , and I am one also , we ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels . 
Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you , on any occasion , you will think of me at once . '' 
`` First and at once ! 
Oh ! 
yes , monsieur . '' 
`` And will call upon me ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` You dream of me sometimes , do you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Every night , monsieur . 
During my early youth I saw you in my dreams , calm and mild , with one hand stretched out over my head , and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - formerly . '' 
`` We love each other too dearly , '' said the comte , `` that from this moment , in which we separate , a portion of both our souls should not travel with one and the other of us , and should not dwell wherever we may dwell . 
Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill . 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting , they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards , as if in indecision or ashamed to be seen . 
It was Grimaud , who in his anxiety had tracked his master , and was there awaiting him . 
`` Oh ! 
my good Grimaud , '' cried Raoul , `` what do you want ? 
You are come to tell us it is time to be gone , have you not ? '' 
`` Alone ? '' 
said Grimaud , addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of reproach , which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled . 
`` Oh ! 
you are right ! '' 
cried the comte . 
`` No , Raoul shall not go alone ; no , he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand to support him , some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved ! '' 
`` I ? '' 
said Grimaud . 
`` You , yes , you ! '' 
cried Raoul , touched to the inmost heart . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Athos , `` you are very old , my good Grimaud . '' 
`` So much the better , '' replied the latter , with an inexpressible depth of feeling and intelligence . 
`` But the embarkation is begun , '' said Raoul , `` and you are not prepared . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Grimaud , showing the keys of his trunks , mixed with those of his young master . 
`` But , '' again objected Raoul , `` you can not leave monsieur le comte thus alone ; monsieur le comte , whom you have never quitted ? '' 
Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul , as if to measure the strength of both . 
The comte uttered not a word . 
`` Monsieur le comte prefers my going , '' said Grimaud . 
`` I do , '' said Athos , by an inclination of the head . 
At that moment the drums suddenly rolled , and the clarions filled the air with their inspiring notes . 
The regiments destined for the expedition began to debouch from the city . 
They advanced to the number of five , each composed of forty companies . 
Royals marched first , distinguished by their white uniform , faced with blue . 
The ordonnance colors , quartered cross-wise , violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs-de - lis , left the white-colored flag , with its fleur-de-lised cross , to dominate the whole . 
Musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders ; pikemen in the center , with their lances , fourteen feet in length , marched gayly towards the transports , which carried them in detail to the ships . 
The regiments of Picardy , Navarre , Normandy , and Royal Vaisseau , followed after . 
M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops . 
He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would take a full hour before he could reach the sea . 
Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach , in order to take his place when the prince embarked . 
Grimaud , boiling with the ardor of a young man , superintended the embarkation of Raoul 's baggage in the admiral 's vessel . 
Athos , with his arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose , absorbed in melancholy meditation , was deaf to every noise around him . 
An officer came quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have him by his side . 
`` Have the kindness to tell the prince , '' said Raoul , `` that I request he will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Athos , `` an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his general . 
Please to tell the prince , monsieur , that the vicomte will join him immediately . '' 
The officer set off at a gallop . 
`` Whether we part here or part there , '' added the comte , `` it is no less a separation . '' 
He carefully brushed the dust from his son 's coat , and passed his hand over his hair as they walked along . 
`` But , Raoul , '' said he , `` you want money . 
M. de Beaufort 's train will be splendid , and I am certain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms , which are very dear things in Africa . 
Now , as you are not actually in the service of the king or M. de Beaufort , and are simply a volunteer , you must not reckon upon either pay or largesse . 
But I should not like you to want for anything at Gigelli . 
Here are two hundred pistoles ; if you would please me , Raoul , spend them . '' 
Raoul pressed the hand of his father , and , at the turning of a street , they saw M. de Beaufort , mounted on a magnificent white genet , which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city . 
The duke called Raoul , and held out his hand to the comte . 
He spoke to him for some time , with such a kindly expression that the heart of the poor father even felt a little comforted . 
It was , however , evident to both father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a punishment . 
There was a terrible moment - that at which , on quitting the sands of the shore , the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their families and friends ; a supreme moment , in which , notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens , the warmth of the sun , of the perfumes of the air , and the rich life that was circulating in their veins , everything appeared black , everything bitter , everything created doubts of Providence , nay , at the most , of God . 
It was customary for the admiral and his suite to embark last ; the cannon waited to announce , with its formidable voice , that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel . 
Athos , forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet , and of his own dignity as a strong man , opened his arms to his son , and pressed him convulsively to his heart . 
`` Accompany us on board , '' said the duke , very much affected ; `` you will gain a good half-hour . '' 
`` No , '' said Athos , `` my farewell has been spoken , I do not wish to voice a second . '' 
`` Then , vicomte , embark - embark quickly ! '' 
added the prince , wishing to spare the tears of these two men , whose hearts were bursting . 
And paternally , tenderly , very much as Porthos might have done , he took Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat , the oars of which , at a signal , immediately were dipped in the waves . 
He himself , forgetful of ceremony , jumped into his boat , and pushed it off with a vigorous foot . 
`` Adieu ! '' 
cried Raoul . 
Athos replied only by a sign , but he felt something burning on his hand : it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud - the last farewell of the faithful dog . 
This kiss given , Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon the stem of a two-oared yawl , which had just been taken in tow by a chaland served by twelve galley-oars . 
Athos seated himself on the mole , stunned , deaf , abandoned . 
Every instant took from him one of the features , one of the shades of the pale face of his son . 
With his arms hanging down , his eyes fixed , his mouth open , he remained confounded with Raoul - in one same look , in one same thought , in one same stupor . 
The sea , by degrees , carried away boats and faces to that distance at which men become nothing but points , - loves , nothing but remembrances . 
Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral 's ship , he saw him lean upon the rail of the deck , and place himself in such a manner as to be always an object in the eye of his father . 
In vain the cannon thundered , in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult , responded to by immense acclamations from the shore ; in vain did the noise deafen the ear of the father , the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations . 
Raoul appeared to him to the last moment ; and the imperceptible atom , passing from black to pale , from pale to white , from white to nothing , disappeared for Athos - disappeared very long after , to all the eyes of the spectators , had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling sails . 
Towards midday , when the sun devoured space , and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of the sea , Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise , and vanish as soon as seen . 
This was the smoke of a cannon , which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the coast of France . 
The point was buried in its turn beneath the sky , and Athos returned with slow and painful step to his deserted hostelry . 
: Among Women . 
D'Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends so much as he would have wished . 
The stoical soldier , the impassive man-at - arms , overcome by fear and sad presentiments , had yielded , for a few moments , to human weakness . 
When , therefore , he had silenced his heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves , turning towards his lackey , a silent servant , always listening , in order to obey the more promptly : `` Rabaud , '' said he , `` mind , we must travel thirty leagues a day . '' 
`` At your pleasure , captain , '' replied Rabaud . 
And from that moment , D'Artagnan , accommodating his action to the pace of the horse , like a true centaur , gave up his thoughts to nothing - that is to say , to everything . 
He asked himself why the king had sent for him back ; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of Raoul . 
As to the first subject , the reply was negative ; he knew right well that the king 's calling him was from necessity . 
He still further knew that Louis XIV . 
must experience an imperious desire for a private conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level with the highest powers of the kingdom . 
But as to saying exactly what the king 's wish was , D'Artagnan found himself completely at a loss . 
The musketeer had no doubts , either , upon the reason which had urged the unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth . 
Philippe , buried forever beneath a mask of steel , exiled to a country where the men seemed little more than slaves of the elements ; Philippe , deprived even of the society of D'Artagnan , who had loaded him with honors and delicate attentions , had nothing more to see than odious specters in this world , and , despair beginning to devour him , he poured himself forth in complaints , in the belief that his revelations would raise up some avenger for him . 
The manner in which the musketeer had been near killing his two best friends , the destiny which had so strangely brought Athos to participate in the great state secret , the farewell of Raoul , the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy death ; all this threw D'Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable predictions and forebodings , which the rapidity of his pace did not dissipate , as it used formerly to do . 
D'Artagnan passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis . 
He saw them both , fugitives , tracked , ruined - laborious architects of fortunes they had lost ; and as the king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and malice , D'Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed . 
Sometimes , ascending hills , when the winded horse breathed hard from his red nostrils , and heaved his flanks , the captain , left to more freedom of thought , reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis , a genius of acumen and intrigue , a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice . 
Soldier , priest , diplomatist ; gallant , avaricious , cunning ; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except as stepping - stones to rise to giddier ends . 
Generous in spirit , if not lofty in heart , he never did ill but for the sake of shining even yet more brilliantly . 
Towards the end of his career , at the moment of reaching the goal , like the patrician Fuscus , he had made a false step upon a plank , and had fallen into the sea . 
But Porthos , good , harmless Porthos ! 
To see Porthos hungry , to see Mousqueton without gold lace , imprisoned , perhaps ; to see Pierrefonds , Bracieux , razed to the very stones , dishonored even to the timber , - these were so many poignant griefs for D'Artagnan , and every time that one of these griefs struck him , he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun . 
Never was the man of spirit subjected to ennui , if his body was exposed to fatigue ; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light , if he had something to engage his mind . 
D'Artagnan , riding fast , thinking as constantly , alighted from his horse in Pairs , fresh and tender in his muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium . 
The king did not expect him so soon , and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon . 
D'Artagnan , instead of riding after the king , as he would formerly have done , took off his boots , had a bath , and waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired . 
He occupied the interval of five hours in taking , as people say , the air of the house , and in arming himself against all ill chances . 
He learned that the king , during the last fortnight , had been gloomy ; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed ; that Monsieur , the king 's brother , was exhibiting a devotional turn ; that Madame had the vapors ; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates . 
He learned that M. Colbert was radiant ; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day , who still did not cure him , and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not usually cure , unless they are political physicians . 
The king , D'Artagnan was told , behaved in the kindest manner to M. Fouquet , and did not allow him to be ever out of his sight ; but the surintendant , touched to the heart , like one of those fine trees a worm has punctured , was declining daily , in spite of the royal smile , that sun of court trees . 
D'Artagnan learned that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had become indispensable to the king ; that the king , during his sporting excursions , if he did not take her with him , wrote to her frequently , no longer verses , but , which was much worse , prose , and that whole pages at a time . 
Thus , as the political Pleiad of the day said , the first king in the world was seen descending from his horse with an ardor beyond compare , and on the crown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases , which M. de Saint-Aignan , aide-de-camp in perpetuity , carried to La Valliere at the risk of foundering his horses . 
During this time , deer and pheasants were left to the free enjoyment of their nature , hunted so lazily that , it was said , the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France . 
D'Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor Raoul , of that desponding letter destined for a woman who passed her life in hoping , and as D'Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally , he resolved to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute 's talk with Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
This was a very easy affair ; while the king was hunting , Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of the galleries of the Palais Royal , exactly where the captain of the musketeers had some guards to inspect . 
D'Artagnan did not doubt that , if he could but open the conversation on Raoul , Louise might give him grounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile ; and hope , or at least consolation for Raoul , in the state of heart in which he had left him , was the sun , was life to two men , who were very dear to our captain . 
He directed his course , therefore , to the spot where he knew he should find Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
D'Artagnan found La Valliere the center of the circle . 
In her apparent solitude , the king 's favorite received , like a queen , more , perhaps , than the queen , a homage of which Madame had been so proud , when all the king 's looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the courtiers . 
D'Artagnan , although no squire of dames , received , nevertheless , civilities and attentions from the ladies ; he was polite , as a brave man always is , and his terrible reputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as admiration among the women . 
On seeing him enter , therefore , they immediately accosted him ; and , as is not unfrequently the case with fair ladies , opened the attack by questions . 
`` Where had he been ? 
What had become of him so long ? 
Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style , to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king 's balcony ? '' 
He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges . 
This set all the ladies laughing . 
Those were times in which everybody traveled , but in which , notwithstanding , a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem often solved by death . 
`` From the land of oranges ? '' 
cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente . 
`` From Spain ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` From Malta ? '' 
echoed Montalais . 
`` Ma foi ! 
You are coming very near , ladies . '' 
`` Is it an island ? '' 
asked La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I will not give you the trouble of seeking any further ; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is , at this moment , embarking for Algiers . '' 
`` Have you seen the army ? '' 
asked several warlike fair ones . 
`` As plainly as I see you , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` And the fleet ? '' 
`` Yes , I saw everything . '' 
`` Have we any of us any friends there ? '' 
said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , coldly , but in a manner to attract attention to a question that was not without its calculated aim . 
`` Why , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes ; there were M. de la Guillotiere , M. de Manchy , M. de Bragelonne - '' La Valliere became pale . 
`` M. de Bragelonne ! '' 
cried the perfidious Athenais . 
`` Eh , what ! 
- is he gone to the wars ? 
- he ! '' 
Montalais trod on her toe , but all in vain . 
`` Do you know what my opinion is ? '' 
continued she , addressing D'Artagnan . 
`` No , mademoiselle ; but I should like very much to know it . '' 
`` My opinion is , then , that all the men who go to this war are desperate , desponding men , whom love has treated ill ; and who go to try if they can not find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been . '' 
Some of the ladies laughed ; La Valliere was evidently confused ; Montalais coughed loud enough to waken the dead . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` you are in error when you speak of black women at Gigelli ; the women there have not jet faces ; it is true they are not white - they are yellow . '' 
`` Yellow ! '' 
exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties . 
`` Eh ! 
do not disparage it . 
I have never seen a finer color to match with black eyes and a coral mouth . '' 
`` So much the better for M. de Bragelonne , '' said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , with persistent malice . 
`` He will make amends for his loss . 
Poor fellow ! '' 
A profound silence followed these words ; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves - treat each other more cruelly than tigers . 
But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy Athenais ; she determined to make her blush likewise . 
Resuming the conversation without pause , `` Do you know , Louise , '' said she , `` that there is a great sin on your conscience ? '' 
`` What sin , mademoiselle ? '' 
stammered the unfortunate girl , looking round her for support , without finding it . 
`` Eh ! 
- why , '' continued Athenais , `` the poor young man was affianced to you ; he loved you ; you cast him off . '' 
`` Well , that is a right which every honest woman has , '' said Montalais , in an affected tone . 
`` When we know we can not constitute the happiness of a man , it is much better to cast him off . '' 
`` Cast him off ! 
or refuse him ! 
- that 's all very well , '' said Athenais , `` but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach herself with . 
The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars ; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with . '' 
Louise pressed her hand over her icy brow . 
`` And if he dies , '' continued her pitiless tormentor , `` you will have killed him . 
That is the sin . '' 
Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? '' 
D'Artagnan made several steps along the gallery , holding Louise on his arm ; then , when they were far enough removed from the others - `` What I had to say to you , mademoiselle , '' replied he , `` Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente has just expressed ; roughly and unkindly , it is true but still in its entirety . '' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die . 
She disappeared at one door , at the moment the king was entering by another . 
The first glance of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress . 
Not perceiving La Valliere , a frown came over his brow ; but as soon as he saw D'Artagnan , who bowed to him - `` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
cried he , `` you have been diligent ! 
I am much pleased with you . '' 
This was the superlative expression of royal satisfaction . 
Many men would have been ready to lay down their lives for such a speech from the king . 
The maids of honor and the courtiers , who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his entrance , drew back , on observing he wished to speak privately with his captain of the musketeers . 
The king led the way out of the gallery , after having again , with his eyes , sought everywhere for La Valliere , whose absence he could not account for . 
The moment they were out of the reach of curious ears , `` Well ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` the prisoner ? '' 
`` Is in his prison , sire . '' 
`` What did he say on the road ? '' 
`` Nothing , sire . '' 
`` What did he do ? '' 
`` There was a moment at which the fisherman - who took me in his boat to Sainte-Marguerite - revolted , and did his best to kill me . 
The - the prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly . '' 
The king became pale . 
`` Enough ! '' 
said he ; and D'Artagnan bowed . 
Louis walked about his cabinet with hasty steps . 
`` Were you at Antibes , '' said he , `` when Monsieur de Beaufort came there ? '' 
`` No , sire ; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
which was followed by a fresh silence . 
`` Whom did you see there ? '' 
`` A great many persons , '' said D'Artagnan , coolly . 
The king perceived he was unwilling to speak . 
`` I have sent for you , monsieur le capitaine , to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at Nantes . '' 
`` At Nantes ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` In Bretagne . '' 
`` Yes , sire , it is in Bretagne . 
Will you majesty make so long a journey as to Nantes ? '' 
`` The States are assembled there , '' replied the king . 
`` I have two demands to make of them : I wish to be there . '' 
`` When shall I set out ? '' 
said the captain . 
`` This evening - to-morrow - to-morrow evening ; for you must stand in need of rest . '' 
`` I have rested , sire . '' 
`` That is well . 
Then between this and to-morrow evening , when you please . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave ; but , perceiving the king very much embarrassed , `` Will you majesty , '' said he , stepping two paces forward , `` take the court with you ? '' 
`` Certainly I shall . '' 
`` Then you majesty will , doubtless , want the musketeers ? '' 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain . 
`` Take a brigade of them , '' replied Louis . 
`` Is that all ? 
Has your majesty no other orders to give me ? '' 
`` No - ah - yes . '' 
`` I am all attention , sire . '' 
`` At the castle of Nantes , which I hear is very ill arranged , you will adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the principal dignitaries I shall take with me . '' 
`` Of the principal ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` For instance , at the door of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And that of M. Letellier ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Of M. de Brienne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And of monsieur le surintendant ? '' 
`` Without doubt . '' 
`` Very well , sire . 
By to-morrow I shall have set out . '' 
`` Oh , yes ; but one more word , Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
At Nantes you will meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres , captain of the guards . 
Be sure that your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive . 
Precedence always belongs to the first comer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And if M. de Gesvres should question you ? '' 
`` Question me , sire ! 
Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question me ? '' 
And the musketeer , turning cavalierly on his heel , disappeared . 
`` To Nantes ! '' 
said he to himself , as he descended from the stairs . 
`` Why did he not dare to say , from thence to Belle-Isle ? '' 
As he reached the great gates , one of M. Brienne 's clerks came running after him , exclaiming , `` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! 
I beg your pardon - '' `` What is the matter , Monsieur Ariste ? '' 
`` The king has desired me to give you this order . '' 
`` Upon your cash-box ? '' 
asked the musketeer . 
`` No , monsieur ; on that of M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan was surprised , but he took the order , which was in the king 's own writing , and was for two hundred pistoles . 
`` What ! '' 
thought he , after having politely thanked M. Brienne 's clerk , `` M. Fouquet is to pay for the journey , then ! 
Mordioux ! 
that is a bit of pure Louis XI . 
Why was not this order on the chest of M. Colbert ? 
He would have paid it with such joy . '' 
And D'Artagnan , faithful to his principle of never letting an order at sight get cold , went straight to the house of M. Fouquet , to receive his two hundred pistoles . 
: The Last Supper . 
The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching departure , for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends . 
From the bottom to the top of the house , the hurry of the servants bearing dishes , and the diligence of the registres , denoted an approaching change in offices and kitchen . 
D'Artagnan , with his order in his hand , presented himself at the offices , when he was told it was too late to pay cash , the chest was closed . 
He only replied : `` On the king 's service . '' 
The clerk , a little put out by the serious air of the captain , replied , that `` that was a very respectable reason , but that the customs of the house were respectable likewise ; and that , in consequence , he begged the bearer to call again next day . '' 
D'Artagnan asked if he could not see M. Fouquet . 
The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with such details , and rudely closed the outer door in the captain 's face . 
But the latter had foreseen this stroke , and placed his boot between the door and the door-case , so that the lock did not catch , and the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor . 
This made him change his tone , and say , with terrified politeness , `` If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le surintendant , he must go to the ante-chambers ; these are the offices , where monseigneur never comes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
very well ! 
Where are they ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan . 
`` On the other side of the court , '' said the clerk , delighted to be free . 
D'Artagnan crossed the court , and fell in with a crowd of servants . 
`` Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour , '' he was answered by a fellow carrying a vermeil dish , in which were three pheasants and twelve quails . 
`` Tell him , '' said the captain , laying hold of the servant by the end of his dish , `` that I am M. d'Artagnan , captain of his majesty 's musketeers . '' 
The fellow uttered a cry of surprise , and disappeared ; D'Artagnan following him slowly . 
He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in the ante-chamber : the latter , a little pale , came hastily out of the dining - room to learn what was the matter . 
D'Artagnan smiled . 
`` There is nothing unpleasant , Monsieur Pelisson ; only a little order to receive the money for . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet 's friend , breathing more freely ; and he took the captain by the hand , and , dragging him behind him , led him into the dining-room , where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant , placed in the center , and buried in the cushions of a fauteuil . 
There were assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet . 
Joyous friends , for the most part faithful , they had not fled their protector at the approach of the storm , and , in spite of the threatening heavens , in spite of the trembling earth , they remained there , smiling , cheerful , as devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity . 
On the left of the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere ; on his right was Madame Fouquet ; as if braving the laws of the world , and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to silence , the two protecting angels of this man united to offer , at the moment of the crisis , the support of their twined arms . 
Madame de Belliere was pale , trembling , and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante , who , with one hand on her husband 's , was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson had gone out to bring D'Artagnan . 
The captain entered at first full of courtesy , and afterwards of admiration , when , with his infallible glance , he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face . 
Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . '' 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness , which filled the hearts of all his friends with terror . 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast . 
`` Ah ! 
then , '' said he , `` perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes ? '' 
`` I do not know whither I am setting out , monseigneur . '' 
`` But , '' said Madame Fouquet , recovered from her fright , `` you are not going so soon , monsieur le capitaine , as not to do us the honor to take a seat with us ? '' 
`` Madame , I should esteem that a great honor done me , but I am so pressed for time , that , you see , I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note . '' 
`` The reply to which shall be gold , '' said Fouquet , making a sign to his intendant , who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the latter , `` I was not uneasy about the payment ; the house is good . '' 
A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet . 
`` Are you in pain ? '' 
asked Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do you feel your attack coming on ? '' 
asked Madame Fouquet . 
`` Neither , thank you both , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Your attack ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , in his turn ; `` are you unwell , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I have a tertian fever , which seized me after the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Caught cold in the grottos , at night , perhaps ? '' 
`` No , no ; nothing but agitation , that was all . '' 
`` The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king , '' said La Fontaine , quietly , without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege . 
`` We can not devote too much heart to the reception of our king , '' said Fouquet , mildly , to his poet . 
`` Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , with perfect frankness and much amenity . 
`` The fact is , monseigneur , that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux . '' 
Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted himself well towards the king , the king had hardly done the like to the minister . 
But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret . 
He alone with Fouquet knew it ; those two men had not , the one the courage to complain , the other the right to accuse . 
The captain , to whom the two hundred pistoles were brought , was about to take his leave , when Fouquet , rising , took a glass of wine , and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` to the health of the king , whatever may happen . '' 
`` And to your health , monseigneur , whatever may happen , '' said D'Artagnan . 
He bowed , with these words of evil omen , to all the company , who rose as soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs . 
`` I , for a moment , thought it was I and not my money he wanted , '' said Fouquet , endeavoring to laugh . 
`` You ! '' 
cried his friends ; `` and what for , in the name of Heaven ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
do not deceive yourselves , my dear brothers in Epicurus , '' said the superintendent ; `` I do not wish to make a comparison between the most humble sinner on the earth , and the God we adore , but remember , he gave one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper , and which was nothing but a farewell dinner , like that which we are making at this moment . '' 
A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table . 
`` Shut the doors , '' said Fouquet , and the servants disappeared . 
`` My friends , '' continued Fouquet , lowering his voice , `` what was I formerly ? 
What am I now ? 
Consult among yourselves and reply . 
A man like me sinks when he does not continue to rise . 
What shall we say , then , when he really sinks ? 
I have no more money , no more credit ; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies , and powerless friends . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried Pelisson .
