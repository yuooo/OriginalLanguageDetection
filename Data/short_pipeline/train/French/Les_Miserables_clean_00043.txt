One day , her butcher , who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean , said to her : `` That 's a queer fish . '' 
She replied : `` He 's a saint . '' 
Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the Rue de Babylone . 
Unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet . 
That gate was always closed . 
Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated , in order not to attract attention . 
In this , possibly , he made a mistake . 
FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming . 
The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it , without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths . 
More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient , padlocked gate , twisted , tottering , fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars , and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque . 
There was a stone bench in one corner , one or two mouldy statues , several lattices which had lost their nails with time , were rotting on the wall , and there were no walks nor turf ; but there was enough grass everywhere . 
Gardening had taken its departure , and nature had returned . 
Weeds abounded , which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land . 
The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid . 
Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life ; venerable growth reigned there among them . 
The trees had bent over towards the nettles , the plant had sprung upward , the branch had inclined , that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air , that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss ; trunks , boughs , leaves , fibres , clusters , tendrils , shoots , spines , thorns , had mingled , crossed , married , confounded themselves in each other ; vegetation in a deep and close embrace , had celebrated and accomplished there , under the well-pleased eye of the Creator , in that enclosure three hundred feet square , the holy mystery of fraternity , symbol of the human fraternity . 
This garden was no longer a garden , it was a colossal thicket , that is to say , something as impenetrable as a forest , as peopled as a city , quivering like a nest , sombre like a cathedral , fragrant like a bouquet , solitary as a tomb , living as a throng . 
In Floreal -LSB- 34 -RSB- this enormous thicket , free behind its gate and within its four walls , entered upon the secret labor of germination , quivered in the rising sun , almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love , and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins , and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks , sprinkled on the damp earth , on the defaced statues , on the crumbling steps of the pavilion , and even on the pavement of the deserted street , flowers like stars , dew like pearls , fecundity , beauty , life , joy , perfumes . 
At midday , a thousand white butterflies took refuge there , and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade . 
There , in those gay shadows of verdure , a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul , and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed . 
In the evening , a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it ; a shroud of mist , a calm and celestial sadness covered it ; the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it , like an exquisite and subtle poison ; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches ; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees ; by day the wings rejoice the leaves , by night the leaves protect the wings . 
-LSB- 34 -RSB- From April 19 to May 20 . 
In winter the thicket was black , dripping , bristling , shivering , and allowed some glimpse of the house . 
Instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers , the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold , thick carpet of yellow leaves ; but in any fashion , under any aspect , at all seasons , spring , winter , summer , autumn , this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy , contemplation , solitude , liberty , the absence of man , the presence of God ; and the rusty old gate had the air of saying : `` This garden belongs to me . '' 
It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side , the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces away , the dome of the Invalides close at hand , the Chamber of Deputies not far off ; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously , in vain , in the vicinity , in vain did the yellow , brown , white , and red omnibuses cross each other 's course at the neighboring cross-roads ; the Rue Plumet was the desert ; and the death of the former proprietors , the revolution which had passed over it , the crumbling away of ancient fortunes , absence , forgetfulness , forty years of abandonment and widowhood , had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns , mulleins , hemlock , yarrow , tall weeds , great crimped plants , with large leaves of pale green cloth , lizards , beetles , uneasy and rapid insects ; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur ; and for nature , which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man , and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all , in the ant as well as in the eagle , to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World . 
Nothing is small , in fact ; any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this . 
Although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy , either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect , the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity . 
Everything toils at everything . 
Algebra is applied to the clouds ; the radiation of the star profits the rose ; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations . 
Who , then , can calculate the course of a molecule ? 
How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand ? 
Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little , the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being , and the avalanches of creation ? 
The tiniest worm is of importance ; the great is little , the little is great ; everything is balanced in necessity ; alarming vision for the mind . 
There are marvellous relations between beings and things ; in that inexhaustible whole , from the sun to the grub , nothing despises the other ; all have need of each other . 
The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths , without knowing what it is doing ; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers . 
All birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite . 
Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg , and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates . 
Where the telescope ends , the microscope begins . 
Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision ? 
Choose . 
A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers ; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars . 
The same promiscuousness , and yet more unprecedented , exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance . 
Elements and principles mingle , combine , wed , multiply with each other , to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness . 
The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself . 
In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities , rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia , employing everything , not losing a single dream , not a single slumber , sowing an animalcule here , crumbling to bits a planet there , oscillating and winding , making of light a force and of thought an element , disseminated and invisible , dissolving all , except that geometrical point , the I ; bringing everything back to the soul-atom ; expanding everything in God , entangling all activity , from summit to base , in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism , attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth , subordinating , who knows ? 
Were it only by the identity of the law , the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water . 
A machine made of mind . 
Enormous gearing , the prime motor of which is the gnat , and whose final wheel is the zodiac . 
CHANGE OF GATE It seemed that this garden , created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries , had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries . 
There were no longer either arbors , or bowling greens , or tunnels , or grottos ; there was a magnificent , dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all . 
Paphos had been made over into Eden . 
It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome . 
This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul . 
This coquettish garden , formerly decidedly compromised , had returned to virginity and modesty . 
A justice assisted by a gardener , a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon , and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lenotre , had turned it about , cut , ruffled , decked , moulded it to gallantry ; nature had taken possession of it once more , had filled it with shade , and had arranged it for love . 
There was , also , in this solitude , a heart which was quite ready . 
Love had only to show himself ; he had here a temple composed of verdure , grass , moss , the sight of birds , tender shadows , agitated branches , and a soul made of sweetness , of faith , of candor , of hope , of aspiration , and of illusion . 
Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child ; she was a little more than fourteen , and she was at the `` ungrateful age '' ; we have already said , that with the exception of her eyes , she was homely rather than pretty ; she had no ungraceful feature , but she was awkward , thin , timid and bold at once , a grown-up little girl , in short . 
Her education was finished , that is to say , she has been taught religion , and even and above all , devotion ; then `` history , '' that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents , geography , grammar , the participles , the kings of France , a little music , a little drawing , etc. ; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant , which is a great charm and a great peril . 
The soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later on , mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there , as in a dark chamber . 
She should be gently and discreetly enlightened , rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light . 
A useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls . 
There is nothing but the maternal instinct , that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman , which knows how this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist . 
Nothing supplies the place of this instinct . 
All the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl 's soul . 
Cosette had had no mother . 
She had only had many mothers , in the plural . 
As for Jean Valjean , he was , indeed , all tenderness , all solicitude ; but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all . 
Now , in this work of education , in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life , what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence ! 
Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent . 
The convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown . 
The heart , thus thrown back upon itself , works downward within itself , since it can not overflow , and grows deep , since it can not expand . 
Hence visions , suppositions , conjectures , outlines of romances , a desire for adventures , fantastic constructions , edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind , sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter . 
The convent is a compression which , in order to triumph over the human heart , should last during the whole life . 
On quitting the convent , Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet . 
It was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty ; a garden that was closed , but a nature that was acrid , rich , voluptuous , and fragrant ; the same dreams as in the convent , but with glimpses of young men ; a grating , but one that opened on the street . 
Still , when she arrived there , we repeat , she was only a child . 
Jean Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her . 
`` Do what you like with it , '' he said to her . 
This amused Cosette ; she turned over all the clumps and all the stones , she hunted for `` beasts '' ; she played in it , while awaiting the time when she would dream in it ; she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass , while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head . 
And then , she loved her father , that is to say , Jean Valjean , with all her soul , with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her . 
It will be remembered that M. Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal . 
Jean Valjean had continued this practice ; he had come to converse well ; he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself . 
He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness ; his mind was rough and his heart was soft . 
During their conversations in the Luxembourg , he gave her explanations of everything , drawing on what he had read , and also on what he had suffered . 
As she listened to him , Cosette 's eyes wandered vaguely about . 
This simple man sufficed for Cosette 's thought , the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes . 
When she had had a good chase after the butterflies , she came panting up to him and said : `` Ah ! 
How I have run ! '' 
He kissed her brow . 
Cosette adored the goodman . 
She was always at his heels . 
Where Jean Valjean was , there happiness was . 
Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden ; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard , than in the enclosure filled with flowers , and in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry , against which stood tufted easy-chairs . 
Jean Valjean sometimes said to her , smiling at his happiness in being importuned : `` Do go to your own quarters ! 
Leave me alone a little ! '' 
She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father . 
`` Father , I am very cold in your rooms ; why do n't you have a carpet here and a stove ? '' 
`` Dear child , there are so many people who are better than I and who have not even a roof over their heads . '' 
`` Then why is there a fire in my rooms , and everything that is needed ? '' 
`` Because you are a woman and a child . '' 
`` Bah ! 
must men be cold and feel uncomfortable ? '' 
`` Certain men . '' 
`` That is good , I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire . '' 
And again she said to him : -- `` Father , why do you eat horrible bread like that ? '' 
`` Because , my daughter . '' 
`` Well , if you eat it , I will eat it too . '' 
Then , in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread , Jean Valjean ate white bread . 
Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood . 
She prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known . 
The Thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream . 
She remembered that she had gone `` one day , at night , '' to fetch water in a forest . 
She thought that it had been very far from Paris . 
It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss , and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it . 
Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds , spiders , and serpents . 
When she meditated in the evening , before falling asleep , as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean 's daughter , and that he was her father , she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her . 
When he was seated , she leaned her cheek against his white hair , and dropped a silent tear , saying to herself : `` Perhaps this man is my mother . '' 
Cosette , although this is a strange statement to make , in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent , -- maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity , -- had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible . 
She did not even know her mother 's name . 
Whenever she asked Jean Valjean , Jean Valjean remained silent . 
If she repeated her question , he responded with a smile . 
Once she insisted ; the smile ended in a tear . 
This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness . 
Was it prudence ? 
Was it respect ? 
Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own ? 
So long as Cosette had been small , Jean Valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother ; when she became a young girl , it was impossible for him to do so . 
It seemed to him that he no longer dared . 
Was it because of Cosette ? 
Was it because of Fantine ? 
He felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette 's thought ; and of placing a third in their destiny . 
The more sacred this shade was to him , the more did it seem that it was to be feared . 
He thought of Fantine , and felt himself overwhelmed with silence . 
Through the darkness , he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips . 
Had all the modesty which had been in Fantine , and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime , returned to rest upon her after her death , to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman , and in its shyness , to keep her in her grave ? 
Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure ? 
We who believe in death , are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation . 
Hence the impossibility of uttering , even for Cosette , that name of Fantine . 
One day Cosette said to him : -- `` Father , I saw my mother in a dream last night . 
She had two big wings . 
My mother must have been almost a saint during her life . '' 
`` Through martyrdom , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
However , Jean Valjean was happy . 
When Cosette went out with him , she leaned on his arm , proud and happy , in the plenitude of her heart . 
Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight , at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive , so wholly satisfied with himself alone . 
The poor man trembled , inundated with angelic joy ; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives ; he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss , and he thanked God , in the depths of his soul , for having permitted him to be loved thus , he , a wretch , by that innocent being . 
THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR One day , Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror , and she said to herself : `` Really ! '' 
It seemed to her almost that she was pretty . 
This threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind . 
Up to that moment she had never thought of her face . 
She saw herself in her mirror , but she did not look at herself . 
And then , she had so often been told that she was homely ; Jean Valjean alone said gently : `` No indeed ! 
no indeed ! '' 
At all events , Cosette had always thought herself homely , and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood . 
And here , all at once , was her mirror saying to her , as Jean Valjean had said : `` No indeed ! '' 
That night , she did not sleep . 
`` What if I were pretty ! '' 
she thought . 
`` How odd it would be if I were pretty ! '' 
And she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent , and she said to herself : `` What ! 
Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So ? '' 
The next morning she looked at herself again , not by accident this time , and she was assailed with doubts : `` Where did I get such an idea ? '' 
said she ; `` no , I am ugly . '' 
She had not slept well , that was all , her eyes were sunken and she was pale . 
She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful , but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer . 
She did not look at herself again , and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror . 
In the evening , after dinner , she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing-room , and Jean Valjean read beside her . 
Once she raised her eyes from her work , and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her . 
On another occasion , she was passing along the street , and it seemed to her that some one behind her , whom she did not see , said : `` A pretty woman ! 
but badly dressed . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
she thought , `` he does not mean me . 
I am well dressed and ugly . '' 
She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown . 
At last , one day when she was in the garden , she heard poor old Toussaint saying : `` Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing , sir ? '' 
Cosette did not hear her father 's reply , but Toussaint 's words caused a sort of commotion within her . 
She fled from the garden , ran up to her room , flew to the looking-glass , -- it was three months since she had looked at herself , -- and gave vent to a cry . 
She had just dazzled herself . 
She was beautiful and lovely ; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint and her mirror . 
Her figure was formed , her skin had grown white , her hair was lustrous , an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes . 
The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant , like the sudden advent of daylight ; other people noticed it also , Toussaint had said so , it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken , there could no longer be any doubt of that ; she descended to the garden again , thinking herself a queen , imagining that she heard the birds singing , though it was winter , seeing the sky gilded , the sun among the trees , flowers in the thickets , distracted , wild , in inexpressible delight . 
Jean Valjean , on his side , experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart . 
In fact , he had , for some time past , been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette 's sweet face . 
The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him . 
Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself . 
But , from the very first day , that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl 's person , wounded Jean Valjean 's sombre eye . 
He felt that it was a change in a happy life , a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something . 
This man , who had passed through all manner of distresses , who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate , who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint , who , after having dragged the chain of the galleys , was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery , this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium , this man accepted all , excused all , pardoned all , and merely asked of Providence , of man , of the law , of society , of nature , of the world , one thing , that Cosette might love him ! 
That Cosette might continue to love him ! 
That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him , and from remaining with him ! 
Beloved by Cosette , he felt that he was healed , rested , appeased , loaded with benefits , recompensed , crowned . 
Beloved by Cosette , it was well with him ! 
He asked nothing more ! 
Had any one said to him : `` Do you want anything better ? '' 
he would have answered : `` No . '' 
God might have said to him : `` Do you desire heaven ? '' 
and he would have replied : `` I should lose by it . '' 
Everything which could affect this situation , if only on the surface , made him shudder like the beginning of something new . 
He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means ; but he understood instinctively , that it was something terrible . 
He gazed with terror on this beauty , which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him , beneath his very eyes , on the innocent and formidable brow of that child , from the depths of her homeliness , of his old age , of his misery , of his reprobation . 
He said to himself : `` How beautiful she is ! 
What is to become of me ? '' 
There , moreover , lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother . 
What he beheld with anguish , a mother would have gazed upon with joy . 
The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance . 
On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself : `` Decidedly I am beautiful ! '' 
Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet . 
She recalled the remark of that passer-by : `` Pretty , but badly dressed , '' the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished , after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined , later on , to fill the whole life of woman , coquetry . 
Love is the other . 
With faith in her beauty , the whole feminine soul expanded within her . 
She conceived a horror for her merinos , and shame for her plush hat . 
Her father had never refused her anything . 
She at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet , the gown , the mantle , the boot , the cuff , the stuff which is in fashion , the color which is becoming , that science which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming , so deep , and so dangerous . 
The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne . 
In less than a month , little Cosette , in that Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone , was not only one of the prettiest , but one of the `` best dressed '' women in Paris , which means a great deal more . 
She would have liked to encounter her `` passer-by , '' to see what he would say , and to `` teach him a lesson ! '' 
The truth is , that she was ravishing in every respect , and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way . 
Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety . 
He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl , walk at the most , beheld wings sprouting on Cosette . 
Moreover , from the mere inspection of Cosette 's toilet , a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother . 
Certain little proprieties , certain special conventionalities , were not observed by Cosette . 
A mother , for instance , would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask . 
The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle , and her white crape bonnet , she took Jean Valjean 's arm , gay , radiant , rosy , proud , dazzling . 
`` Father , '' she said , `` how do you like me in this guise ? '' 
Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man : `` Charming ! '' 
He was the same as usual during their walk . 
On their return home , he asked Cosette : -- `` Wo n't you put on that other gown and bonnet again , -- you know the ones I mean ? '' 
This took place in Cosette 's chamber . 
Cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl 's clothes were hanging . 
`` That disguise ! '' 
said she . 
`` Father , what do you want me to do with it ? 
Oh no , the idea ! 
I shall never put on those horrors again . 
With that machine on my head , I have the air of Madame Mad-dog . '' 
Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh . 
From that moment forth , he noticed that Cosette , who had always heretofore asked to remain at home , saying : `` Father , I enjoy myself more here with you , '' now was always asking to go out . 
In fact , what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them ? 
He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden . 
Now she preferred the garden , and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence . 
Jean Valjean , who was shy , never set foot in the garden . 
He kept to his back yard , like a dog . 
Cosette , in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful , lost the grace of ignoring it . 
An exquisite grace , for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable , and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along , holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it . 
But what she had lost in ingenuous grace , she gained in pensive and serious charm . 
Her whole person , permeated with the joy of youth , of innocence , and of beauty , breathed forth a splendid melancholy . 
It was at this epoch that Marius , after the lapse of six months , saw her once more at the Luxembourg . 
THE BATTLE BEGUN Cosette in her shadow , like Marius in his , was all ready to take fire . 
Destiny , with its mysterious and fatal patience , slowly drew together these two beings , all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion , these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning , and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire . 
The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute . 
One hardly dares to say , nowadays , that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other . 
That is the way people do fall in love , nevertheless , and the only way . 
The rest is nothing , but the rest comes afterwards . 
Nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark . 
At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled Marius , Marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette . 
He caused her the same good and the same evil . 
She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time , and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see , while looking elsewhere . 
Marius still considered Cosette ugly , when she had already begun to think Marius handsome . 
But as he paid no attention to her , the young man was nothing to her . 
Still , she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair , beautiful eyes , handsome teeth , a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades , that he held himself badly when he walked , if you like , but with a grace that was all his own , that he did not appear to be at all stupid , that his whole person was noble , gentle , simple , proud , and that , in short , though he seemed to be poor , yet his air was fine . 
On the day when their eyes met at last , and said to each other those first , obscure , and ineffable things which the glance lisps , Cosette did not immediately understand . 
She returned thoughtfully to the house in the Rue de l'Ouest , where Jean Valjean , according to his custom , had come to spend six weeks . 
The next morning , on waking , she thought of that strange young man , so long indifferent and icy , who now seemed to pay attention to her , and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her . 
She was , on the contrary , somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual . 
A substratum of war stirred within her . 
It struck her , and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy , that she was going to take her revenge at last . 
Knowing that she was beautiful , she was thoroughly conscious , though in an indistinct fashion , that she possessed a weapon . 
Women play with their beauty as children do with a knife . 
They wound themselves . 
The reader will recall Marius ' hesitations , his palpitations , his terrors . 
He remained on his bench and did not approach . 
This vexed Cosette . 
One day , she said to Jean Valjean : `` Father , let us stroll about a little in that direction . '' 
Seeing that Marius did not come to her , she went to him . 
In such cases , all women resemble Mahomet . 
And then , strange to say , the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity ; in a young girl it is boldness . 
This is surprising , and yet nothing is more simple . 
It is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming , each the other 's qualities . 
That day , Cosette 's glance drove Marius beside himself , and Marius ' glance set Cosette to trembling . 
Marius went away confident , and Cosette uneasy . 
From that day forth , they adored each other . 
The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy . 
It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before . 
She no longer recognized it . 
The whiteness of soul in young girls , which is composed of coldness and gayety , resembles snow . 
It melts in love , which is its sun . 
Cosette did not know what love was . 
She had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense . 
On the books of profane music which entered the convent , amour -LRB- love -RRB- was replaced by tambour -LRB- drum -RRB- or pandour . 
This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls , such as : Ah , how delightful is the drum ! 
or , Pity is not a pandour . 
But Cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the `` drum . '' 
Therefore , she did not know what name to give to what she now felt . 
Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one 's malady ? 
She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly . 
She did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing , useful or dangerous , eternal or temporary , allowable or prohibited ; she loved . 
She would have been greatly astonished , had any one said to her : `` You do not sleep ? 
But that is forbidden ! 
You do not eat ? 
Why , that is very bad ! 
You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart ? 
That must not be ! 
You blush and turn pale , when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk ? 
But that is abominable ! '' 
She would not have understood , and she would have replied : `` What fault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing ? '' 
It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul . 
It was a sort of admiration at a distance , a mute contemplation , the deification of a stranger . 
It was the apparition of youth to youth , the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream , the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last , but having as yet , neither name , nor fault , nor spot , nor exigence , nor defect ; in a word , the distant lover who lingered in the ideal , a chimaera with a form . 
Any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at this first stage , when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister . 
She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined . 
The spirit of the convent , with which she had been permeated for the space of five years , was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person , and made everything tremble around her . 
In this situation he was not a lover , he was not even an admirer , he was a vision . 
She set herself to adoring Marius as something charming , luminous , and impossible . 
As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry , she smiled at him with all frankness . 
Every day , she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience , she found Marius there , she felt herself unspeakably happy , and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to Jean Valjean : -- `` What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is ! '' 
Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another . 
They did not address each other , they did not salute each other , they did not know each other ; they saw each other ; and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues , they lived by gazing at each other . 
It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed , beautiful and loving , with a consciousness of her beauty , and in ignorance of her love . 
She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance . 
TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF All situations have their instincts . 
Old and eternal Mother Nature warned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius . 
Jean Valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul . 
Jean Valjean saw nothing , knew nothing , and yet he scanned with obstinate attention , the darkness in which he walked , as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction , and on the other , something which was crumbling away . 
Marius , also warned , and , in accordance with the deep law of God , by that same Mother Nature , did all he could to keep out of sight of `` the father . '' 
Nevertheless , it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes espied him . 
Marius ' manners were no longer in the least natural . 
He exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring . 
He no longer came quite close to them as formerly . 
He seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading ; why did he pretend that ? 
Formerly he had come in his old coat , now he wore his new one every day ; Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled , his eyes were very queer , he wore gloves ; in short , Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man . 
Cosette allowed nothing to be divined . 
Without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it , and that it must be concealed . 
There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to Cosette , and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean . 
It might be accidental , no doubt , certainly , but it was a menacing accident . 
He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger . 
One day , however , he could not refrain from so doing , and , with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair , he said to her : `` What a very pedantic air that young man has ! '' 
Cosette , but a year before only an indifferent little girl , would have replied : `` Why , no , he is charming . '' 
Ten years later , with the love of Marius in her heart , she would have answered : `` A pedant , and insufferable to the sight ! 
You are right ! '' 
-- At the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained , she contented herself with replying , with supreme calmness : `` That young man ! '' 
As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life . 
`` How stupid I am ! '' 
thought Jean Valjean . 
`` She had not noticed him . 
It is I who have pointed him out to her . '' 
Oh , simplicity of the old ! 
oh , the depth of children ! 
It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble , of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles , that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever , and that the young man falls into every one . 
Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared war against Marius , which Marius , with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age , did not divine . 
Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him ; he changed his hour , he changed his bench , he forgot his handkerchief , he came alone to the Luxembourg ; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares ; and to all the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway , he ingenuously answered `` yes . '' 
But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity , so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following conclusion : `` That ninny is madly in love with Cosette , but Cosette does not even know that he exists . '' 
None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor . 
The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment . 
Does not everything begin with indifference ? 
Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him . 
He rose from his seat to depart , after a stay of three hours , and she said : `` What , already ? '' 
Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg , as he did not wish to do anything out of the way , and as , above all things , he feared to arouse Cosette ; but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers , while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius , who perceived nothing else now , and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face , Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing and terrible eyes . 
He , who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling , experienced moments when Marius was present , in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more , and he felt the old depths of his soul , which had formerly contained so much wrath , opening once more and rising up against that young man . 
It almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom . 
What ! 
he was there , that creature ! 
What was he there for ? 
He came creeping about , smelling out , examining , trying ! 
He came , saying : `` Hey ! 
Why not ? '' 
He came to prowl about his , Jean Valjean 's , life ! 
to prowl about his happiness , with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away ! 
Jean Valjean added : `` Yes , that 's it ! 
What is he in search of ? 
An adventure ! 
What does he want ? 
A love affair ! 
A love affair ! 
And I ? 
What ! 
I have been first , the most wretched of men , and then the most unhappy , and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees , I have suffered everything that man can suffer , I have grown old without having been young , I have lived without a family , without relatives , without friends , without life , without children , I have left my blood on every stone , on every bramble , on every mile-post , along every wall , I have been gentle , though others have been hard to me , and kind , although others have been malicious , I have become an honest man once more , in spite of everything , I have repented of the evil that I have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me , and at the moment when I receive my recompense , at the moment when it is all over , at the moment when I am just touching the goal , at the moment when I have what I desire , it is well , it is good , I have paid , I have earned it , all this is to take flight , all this will vanish , and I shall lose Cosette , and I shall lose my life , my joy , my soul , because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg . '' 
Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam . 
It was no longer a man gazing at a man ; it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy . 
It was a dog scanning a thief . 
The reader knows the rest . 
Marius pursued his senseless course . 
One day he followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest . 
Another day he spoke to the porter . 
The porter , on his side , spoke , and said to Jean Valjean : `` Monsieur , who is that curious young man who is asking for you ? '' 
On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last perceived . 
A week later , Jean Valjean had taken his departure . 
He swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg or in the Rue de l'Ouest . 
He returned to the Rue Plumet . 
Cosette did not complain , she said nothing , she asked no questions , she did not seek to learn his reasons ; she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined , and of betraying herself . 
Jean Valjean had no experience of these miseries , the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted ; the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of Cosette 's silence . 
He merely noticed that she had grown sad , and he grew gloomy . 
On his side and on hers , inexperience had joined issue . 
Once he made a trial . 
He asked Cosette : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? '' 
A ray illuminated Cosette 's pale face . 
`` Yes , '' said she . 
They went thither . 
Three months had elapsed . 
Marius no longer went there . 
Marius was not there . 
On the following day , Jean Valjean asked Cosette again : -- `` Would you like to come to the Luxembourg ? '' 
She replied , sadly and gently : -- `` No . '' 
Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness , and heart-broken at this gentleness . 
What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable ? 
What was on its way there within ? 
What was taking place in Cosette 's soul ? 
Sometimes , instead of going to bed , Jean Valjean remained seated on his pallet , with his head in his hands , and he passed whole nights asking himself : `` What has Cosette in her mind ? '' 
and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about . 
Oh ! 
at such moments , what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister , that chaste peak , that abode of angels , that inaccessible glacier of virtue ! 
How he contemplated , with despairing ecstasy , that convent garden , full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins , where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven ! 
How he adored that Eden forever closed against him , whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged ! 
How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought Cosette back into the world , poor hero of sacrifice , seized and hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion ! 
How he said to himself , `` What have I done ? '' 
However , nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette . 
No ill-temper , no harshness . 
His face was always serene and kind . 
Jean Valjean 's manners were more tender and more paternal than ever . 
If anything could have betrayed his lack of joy , it was his increased suavity . 
On her side , Cosette languished . 
She suffered from the absence of Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence , peculiarly , without exactly being conscious of it . 
When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls , a feminine instinct murmured confusedly , at the bottom of her heart , that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden , and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her , her father would take her thither once more . 
But days , weeks , months , elapsed . 
Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette 's tacit consent . 
She regretted it . 
It was too late . 
So Marius had disappeared ; all was over . 
The day on which she returned to the Luxembourg , Marius was no longer there . 
What was to be done ? 
Should she ever find him again ? 
She felt an anguish at her heart , which nothing relieved , and which augmented every day ; she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer , whether it was raining or shining , whether the birds were singing , whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies , whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries , whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough , whether Toussaint had done `` her marketing '' well or ill ; and she remained dejected , absorbed , attentive to but a single thought , her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished . 
However , she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this , except her pallor . 
She still wore her sweet face for him . 
This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean . 
Sometimes he asked her : -- `` What is the matter with you ? '' 
She replied : `` There is nothing the matter with me . '' 
And after a silence , when she divined that he was sad also , she would add : -- `` And you , father -- is there anything wrong with you ? '' 
`` With me ? 
Nothing , '' said he . 
These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively , and with so touching an affection , and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side , each on the other 's account ; without acknowledging it to each other , without anger towards each other , and with a smile . 
THE CHAIN-GANG Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two . 
Youth , even in its sorrows , always possesses its own peculiar radiance . 
At times , Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile . 
It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear . 
He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him . 
He would have liked to resist , to retain her , to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter . 
These ideas , puerile , as we have just said , and at the same time senile , conveyed to him , by their very childishness , a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls . 
He once chanced to see a general on horseback , in full uniform , pass along the street , Comte Coutard , the commandant of Paris . 
He envied that gilded man ; what happiness it would be , he said to himself , if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing ; and if Cosette could behold him thus , she would be dazzled , and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries , the guard would present arms to him , and that would suffice for Cosette , and would dispel her idea of looking at young men . 
An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections . 
In the isolated life which they led , and since they had come to dwell in the Rue Plumet , they had contracted one habit . 
They sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise , a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it . 
For those who love solitude , a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night , with the cheerfulness of nature added . 
The streets are deserted and the birds are singing . 
Cosette , a bird herself , liked to rise early . 
These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening . 
He proposed , and she agreed . 
It was arranged like a plot , they set out before daybreak , and these trips were so many small delights for Cosette . 
These innocent eccentricities please young people . 
Jean Valjean 's inclination led him , as we have seen , to the least frequented spots , to solitary nooks , to forgotten places . 
There then existed , in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris , a sort of poor meadows , which were almost confounded with the city , where grew in summer sickly grain , and which , in autumn , after the harvest had been gathered , presented the appearance , not of having been reaped , but peeled . 
Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields . 
Cosette was not bored there . 
It meant solitude to him and liberty to her . 
There , she became a little girl once more , she could run and almost play ; she took off her hat , laid it on Jean Valjean 's knees , and gathered bunches of flowers . 
She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers , but did not catch them ; gentleness and tenderness are born with love , and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly . 
She wove garlands of poppies , which she placed on her head , and which , crossed and penetrated with sunlight , glowing until they flamed , formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers . 
Even after their life had grown sad , they kept up their custom of early strolls . 
One morning in October , therefore , tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of 1831 , they set out , and found themselves at break of day near the Barriere du Maine . 
It was not dawn , it was daybreak ; a delightful and stern moment . 
A few constellations here and there in the deep , pale azure , the earth all black , the heavens all white , a quiver amid the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight . 
A lark , which seemed mingled with the stars , was carolling at a prodigious height , and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity . 
In the East , the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel ; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice . 
All was peace and silence ; there was no one on the road ; a few stray laborers , of whom they caught barely a glimpse , were on their way to their work along the side-paths . 
Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber-yard . 
His face was turned towards the highway , his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising ; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated , which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls . 
There are meditations which may be called vertical ; when one is at the bottom of them , time is required to return to earth . 
Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries . 
He was thinking of Cosette , of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her , of the light with which she filled his life , a light which was but the emanation of her soul . 
He was almost happy in his revery . 
Cosette , who was standing beside him , was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy . 
All at once Cosette exclaimed : `` Father , I should think some one was coming yonder . '' 
Jean Valjean raised his eyes . 
Cosette was right . 
The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere du Maine is a prolongation , as the reader knows , of the Rue de Sevres , and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard . 
At the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard , at the spot where it branches , they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour , and a sort of confused pile made its appearance . 
Some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road . 
It grew larger , it seemed to move in an orderly manner , though it was bristling and quivering ; it seemed to be a vehicle , but its load could not be distinctly made out . 
There were horses , wheels , shouts ; whips were cracking . 
By degrees the outlines became fixed , although bathed in shadows . 
It was a vehicle , in fact , which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway , and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean ; a second , of the same aspect , followed , then a third , then a fourth ; seven chariots made their appearance in succession , the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front . 
Figures were moving on these vehicles , flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there , a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains , and as this something advanced , the sound of voices waxed louder , and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams . 
As it drew nearer , it assumed a form , and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition ; the mass grew white ; the day , which was slowly dawning , cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living , the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses , and this is what it proved to be : -- Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road . 
The first six were singularly constructed . 
They resembled coopers ' drays ; they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities . 
Each dray , or rather let us say , each ladder , was attached to four horses harnessed tandem . 
On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn . 
In the faint light , these men were to be divined rather than seen . 
Twenty-four on each vehicle , twelve on a side , back to back , facing the passers-by , their legs dangling in the air , -- this was the manner in which these men were travelling , and behind their backs they had something which clanked , and which was a chain , and on their necks something which shone , and which was an iron collar .
