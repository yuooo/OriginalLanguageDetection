in order to arrest this haughty , arrogant Titan who , true to his menace , threatens to scale my heaven . '' 
`` Arrest M. Fouquet , do you say ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
does that surprise you ? '' 
`` In his own house ! '' 
`` Why not ? 
If he be guilty , he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere else . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign . '' 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , it seems as if you were defending this traitor . '' 
Colbert began to chuckle silently . 
The king turned round at the sound of this suppressed mirth . 
`` Sire , '' said La Valliere , `` it is not M. Fouquet I am defending ; it is yourself . '' 
`` Me ! 
you are defending me ? '' 
`` Sire , you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order . '' 
`` Dishonor myself ! '' 
murmured the king , turning pale with anger . 
`` In plain truth , mademoiselle , you show a strange persistence in what you say . '' 
`` If I do , sire , my only motive is that of serving your majesty , '' replied the noble-hearted girl : `` for that I would risk , I would sacrifice my very life , without the least reserve . '' 
Colbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain . 
La Valliere , that timid , gentle lamb , turned round upon him , and with a glance like lightning imposed silence upon him . 
`` Monsieur , '' she said , `` when the king acts well , whether , in doing so , he does either myself or those who belong to me an injury , I have nothing to say ; but were the king to confer a benefit either upon me or mine , and if he acted badly , I should tell him so . '' 
`` But it appears to me , mademoiselle , '' Colbert ventured to say , `` that I too love the king . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur , we both love him , but each in a different manner , '' replied La Valliere , with such an accent that the heart of the young king was powerfully affected by it . 
`` I love him so deeply , that the whole world is aware of it ; so purely , that the king himself does not doubt my affection . 
He is my king and my master ; I am the least of all his servants . 
But whoso touches his honor assails my life . 
Therefore , I repeat , that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet under his own roof . '' 
Colbert hung down his head , for he felt that the king had abandoned him . 
However , as he bent his head , he murmured , `` Mademoiselle , I have only one word to say . '' 
`` Do not say it , then , monsieur ; for I would not listen to it . 
Besides , what could you have to tell me ? 
That M. Fouquet has been guilty of certain crimes ? 
I believe he has , because the king has said so ; and , from the moment the king said , ' I think so , ' I have no occasion for other lips to say , ' I affirm it . ' 
But , were M. Fouquet the vilest of men , I should say aloud , 'M . 
Fouquet 's person is sacred to the king because he is the guest of M. Fouquet . 
Were his house a den of thieves , were Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers , his home is sacred , his palace is inviolable , since his wife is living in it ; and that is an asylum which even executioners would not dare to violate . ' '' 
La Valliere paused , and was silent . 
In spite of himself the king could not but admire her ; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her voice ; by the nobleness of the cause she advocated . 
Colbert yielded , overcome by the inequality of the struggle . 
At last the king breathed again more freely , shook his head , and held out his hand to La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' he said , gently , `` why do you decide against me ? 
Do you know what this wretched fellow will do , if I give him time to breathe again ? '' 
`` Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp ? '' 
`` Should he escape , and take to flight ? '' 
exclaimed Colbert . 
`` Well , monsieur , it will always remain on record , to the king 's eternal honor , that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee ; and the more guilty he may have been , the greater will the king 's honor and glory appear , compared with such unnecessary misery and shame . '' 
Louis kissed La Valliere 's hand , as he knelt before her . 
`` I am lost , '' thought Colbert ; then suddenly his face brightened up again . 
`` Oh ! 
no , no , aha , old fox ! 
- not yet , '' he said to himself . 
And while the king , protected from observation by the thick covert of an enormous lime , pressed La Valliere to his breast , with all the ardor of ineffable affection , Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his pocket-book and drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter , somewhat yellow , perhaps , but one that must have been most precious , since the intendant smiled as he looked at it ; he then bent a look , full of hatred , upon the charming group which the young girl and the king formed together - a group revealed but for a moment , as the light of the approaching torches shone upon it . 
Louis noticed the light reflected upon La Valliere 's white dress . 
`` Leave me , Louise , '' he said , `` for some one is coming . '' 
`` Mademoiselle , mademoiselle , some one is coming , '' cried Colbert , to expedite the young girl 's departure . 
Louise disappeared rapidly among the trees ; and then , as the king , who had been on his knees before the young girl , was rising from his humble posture , Colbert exclaimed , `` Ah ! 
Mademoiselle de la Valliere has let something fall . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
inquired the king . 
`` A paper - a letter - something white ; look there , sire . '' 
The king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter , crumpling it in his hand , as he did so ; and at the same moment the torches arrived , inundating the blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as day . 
: Jealousy . 
The torches we have just referred to , the eager attention every one displayed , and the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet , arrived in time to suspend the effect of a resolution which La Valliere had already considerably shaken in Louis XIV . 
's heart . 
He looked at Fouquet with a feeling almost of gratitude for having given La Valliere an opportunity of showing herself so generously disposed , so powerful in the influence she exercised over his heart . 
The moment of the last and greatest display had arrived . 
Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king towards the chateau , when a mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux , with a prodigious uproar , pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on every side , and illumining the remotest corners of the gardens . 
The fireworks began . 
Colbert , at twenty paces from the king , who was surrounded and feted by the owner of Vaux , seemed , by the obstinate persistence of his gloomy thoughts , to do his utmost to recall Louis 's attention , which the magnificence of the spectacle was already , in his opinion , too easily diverting . 
Suddenly , just as Louis was on the point of holding it out to Fouquet , he perceived in his hand the paper which , as he believed , La Valliere had dropped at his feet as she hurried away . 
The still stronger magnet of love drew the young prince 's attention towards the souvenir of his idol ; and , by the brilliant light , which increased momentarily in beauty , and drew from the neighboring villages loud cheers of admiration , the king read the letter , which he supposed was a loving and tender epistle La Valliere had destined for him . 
But as he read it , a death - like pallor stole over his face , and an expression of deep-seated wrath , illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed so brightly , soaringly around the scene , produced a terrible spectacle , which every one would have shuddered at , could they only have read into his heart , now torn by the most stormy and most bitter passions . 
There was no truce for him now , influenced as he was by jealousy and mad passion . 
From the very moment when the dark truth was revealed to him , every gentler feeling seemed to disappear ; pity , kindness of consideration , the religion of hospitality , all were forgotten . 
In the bitter pang which wrung his heart , he , still too weak to hide his sufferings , was almost on the point of uttering a cry of alarm , and calling his guards to gather round him . 
This letter which Colbert had thrown down at the king 's feet , the reader has doubtlessly guessed , was the same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau , after the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Valliere 's heart . 
Fouquet saw the king 's pallor , and was far from guessing the evil ; Colbert saw the king 's anger , and rejoiced inwardly at the approach of the storm . 
Fouquet 's voice drew the young prince from his wrathful reverie . 
`` What is the matter , sire ? '' 
inquired the superintendent , with an expression of graceful interest . 
Louis made a violent effort over himself , as he replied , `` Nothing . '' 
`` I am afraid your majesty is suffering ? '' 
`` I am suffering , and have already told you so , monsieur ; but it is nothing . '' 
And the king , without waiting for the termination of the fireworks , turned towards the chateau . 
Fouquet accompanied him , and the whole court followed , leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own amusement . 
The superintendent endeavored again to question Louis XIV. , but did not succeed in obtaining a reply . 
He imagined there had been some misunderstanding between Louis and La Valliere in the park , which had resulted in a slight quarrel ; and that the king , who was not ordinarily sulky by disposition , but completely absorbed by his passion for La Valliere , had taken a dislike to every one because his mistress had shown herself offended with him . 
This idea was sufficient to console him ; he had even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king , when the latter wished him good night . 
This , however , was not all the king had to submit to ; he was obliged to undergo the usual ceremony , which on that evening was marked by close adherence to the strictest etiquette . 
The next day was the one fixed for the departure ; it was but proper that the guests should thank their host , and show him a little attention in return for the expenditure of his twelve millions . 
The only remark , approaching to amiability , which the king could find to say to M. Fouquet , as he took leave of him , were in these words , `` M. Fouquet , you shall hear from me . 
Be good enough to desire M. d'Artagnan to come here . '' 
But the blood of Louis XIV. , who had so profoundly dissimulated his feelings , boiled in his veins ; and he was perfectly willing to order M. Fouquet to be put an end to with the same readiness , indeed , as his predecessor had caused the assassination of le Marechal d'Ancre ; and so he disguised the terrible resolution he had formed beneath one of those royal smiles which , like lightning-flashes , indicated coups d'etat . 
Fouquet took the king 's hand and kissed it ; Louis shuddered throughout his whole frame , but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his hand with his lips . 
Five minutes afterwards , D'Artagnan , to whom the royal order had been communicated , entered Louis XIV . 
's apartment . 
Aramis and Philippe were in theirs , still eagerly attentive , and still listening with all their ears . 
The king did not even give the captain of the musketeers time to approach his armchair , but ran forward to meet him . 
`` Take care , '' he exclaimed , `` that no one enters here . '' 
`` Very good , sire , '' replied the captain , whose glance had for a long time past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance . 
He gave the necessary order at the door ; but , returning to the king , he said , `` Is there something fresh the matter , your majesty ? '' 
`` How many men have you here ? '' 
inquired the king , without making any other reply to the question addressed to him . 
`` What for , sire ? '' 
`` How many men have you , I say ? '' 
repeated the king , stamping upon the ground with his foot . 
`` I have the musketeers . '' 
`` Well ; and what others ? '' 
`` Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss . '' 
`` How many men will be required to - '' `` To do what , sire ? '' 
replied the musketeer , opening his large , calm eyes . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan fell back a step . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet ! '' 
he burst forth . 
`` Are you going to tell me that it is impossible ? '' 
exclaimed the king , in tones of cold , vindictive passion . 
`` I never say that anything is impossible , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the quick . 
`` Very well ; do it , then . '' 
D'Artagnan turned on his heel , and made his way towards the door ; it was but a short distance , and he cleared it in half a dozen paces ; when he reached it he suddenly paused , and said , `` Your majesty will forgive me , but , in order to effect this arrest , I should like written directions . '' 
`` For what purpose - and since when has the king 's word been insufficient for you ? '' 
`` Because the word of a king , when it springs from a feeling of anger , may possibly change when the feeling changes . '' 
`` A truce to set phrases , monsieur ; you have another thought besides that ? '' 
`` Oh , I , at least , have certain thoughts and ideas , which , unfortunately , others have not , '' D'Artagnan replied , impertinently . 
The king , in the tempest of his wrath , hesitated , and drew back in the face of D'Artagnan 's frank courage , just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider . 
`` What is your thought ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan : `` you cause a man to be arrested when you are still under his roof ; and passion is alone the cause of that . 
When your anger shall have passed , you will regret what you have done ; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature . 
If that , however , should fail to be a reparation , it will at least show us that the king was wrong to lose his temper . '' 
`` Wrong to lose his temper ! '' 
cried the king , in a loud , passionate voice . 
`` Did not my father , my grandfathers , too , before me , lose their temper at times , in Heaven 's name ? '' 
`` The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their temper except when under the protection of their own palace . '' 
`` The king is master wherever he may be . '' 
`` That is a flattering , complimentary phrase which can not proceed from any one but M. Colbert ; but it happens not to be the truth . 
The king is at home in every man 's house when he has driven its owner out of it . '' 
The king bit his lips , but said nothing . 
`` Can it be possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan ; `` here is a man who is positively ruining himself in order to please you , and you wish to have him arrested ! 
Mordioux ! 
Sire , if my name was Fouquet , and people treated me in that manner , I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of fireworks and other things , and I would set fire to them , and send myself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky . 
But it is all the same ; it is your wish , and it shall be done . '' 
`` Go , '' said the king ; `` but have you men enough ? '' 
`` Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me ? 
Arrest M. Fouquet ! 
why , that is so easy that a very child might do it ! 
It is like drinking a glass of wormwood ; one makes an ugly face , and that is all . '' 
`` If he defends himself ? '' 
`` He ! 
it is not at all likely . 
Defend himself when such extreme harshness as you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr ! 
Nay , I am sure that if he has a million of francs left , which I very much doubt , he would be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination as this . 
But what does that matter ? 
it shall be done at once . '' 
`` Stay , '' said the king ; `` do not make his arrest a public affair . '' 
`` That will be more difficult . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of a thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him , and say , ` In the king 's name , I arrest you . ' 
But to go up to him , to turn him first one way and then another , to drive him up into one of the corners of the chess-board , in such a way that he can not escape ; to take him away from his guests , and keep him a prisoner for you , without one of them , alas ! 
having heard anything about it ; that , indeed , is a genuine difficulty , the greatest of all , in truth ; and I hardly see how it is to be done . '' 
`` You had better say it is impossible , and you will have finished much sooner . 
Heaven help me , but I seem to be surrounded by people who prevent me doing what I wish . '' 
`` I do not prevent your doing anything . 
Have you indeed decided ? '' 
`` Take care of M. Fouquet , until I shall have made up my mind by to-morrow morning . '' 
`` That shall be done , sire . '' 
`` And return , when I rise in the morning , for further orders ; and now leave me to myself . '' 
`` You do not even want M. Colbert , then ? '' 
said the musketeer , firing his last shot as he was leaving the room . 
The king started . 
With his whole mind fixed on the thought of revenge , he had forgotten the cause and substance of the offense . 
`` No , no one , '' he said ; `` no one here ! 
Leave me . '' 
D'Artagnan quitted the room . 
The king closed the door with his own hands , and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace , like a wounded bull in an arena , trailing from his horn the colored streamers and the iron darts . 
At last he began to take comfort in the expression of his violent feelings . 
`` Miserable wretch that he is ! 
not only does he squander my finances , but with his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries , friends , generals , artists , and all , and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most attached . 
This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took his part ! 
Gratitude ! 
and who can tell whether it was not a stronger feeling - love itself ? '' 
He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest reflections . 
`` A satyr ! '' 
he thought , with that abhorrent hate with which young men regard those more advanced in life , who still think of love . 
`` A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one , who lavishes his gold and jewels in every direction , and who retains his staff of painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses in the costume of goddesses . '' 
The king trembled with passion as he continued , `` He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs to me ! 
He destroys everything that is mine . 
He will be my death at last , I know . 
That man is too much for me ; he is my mortal enemy , but he shall forthwith fall ! 
I hate him - I hate him - I hate him ! '' 
and as he pronounced these words , he struck the arm of the chair in which he was sitting violently , over and over again , and then rose like one in an epileptic fit . 
`` To-morrow ! 
to-morrow ! 
oh , happy day ! '' 
he murmured , `` when the sun rises , no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess but me . 
That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject ruin my anger shall have wrought , they will be forced to confess at last and at least that I am indeed greater than he . '' 
The king , who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer , knocked over with a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside , and in the very bitterness of anger , almost weeping , and half-suffocated , he threw himself on his bed , dressed as he was , and bit the sheets in his extremity of passion , trying to find repose of body at least there . 
The bed creaked beneath his weight , and with the exception of a few broken sounds , emerging , or , one might say , exploding , from his overburdened chest , absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus . 
: High Treason . 
The ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and at the perusal of Fouquet 's letter to La Valliere by degrees subsided into a feeling of pain and extreme weariness . 
Youth , invigorated by health and lightness of spirits , requiring soon that what it loses should be immediately restored - youth knows not those endless , sleepless nights which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly feeding on Prometheus . 
In cases where the man of middle life , in his acquired strength of will and purpose , and the old , in their state of natural exhaustion , find incessant augmentation of their bitter sorrow , a young man , surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune , weakens himself in sighs , and groans , and tears , directly struggling with his grief , and is thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with whom he is engaged . 
Once overthrown , his struggles cease . 
Louis could not hold out more than a few minutes , at the end of which he had ceased to clench his hands , and scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible objects of his hatred ; he soon ceased to attack with his violent imprecations not M. Fouquet alone , but even La Valliere herself ; from fury he subsided into despair , and from despair to prostration . 
After he had thrown himself for a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his bed , his nerveless arms fell quietly down ; his head lay languidly on his pillow ; his limbs , exhausted with excessive emotion , still trembled occasionally , agitated by muscular contractions ; while from his breast faint and infrequent sighs still issued . 
Morpheus , the tutelary deity of the apartment , towards whom Louis raised his eyes , wearied by his anger and reconciled by his tears , showered down upon him the sleep-inducing poppies with which his hands are ever filled ; so presently the monarch closed his eyes and fell asleep . 
Then it seemed to him , as it often happens in that first sleep , so light and gentle , which raises the body above the couch , and the soul above the earth - it seemed to him , we say , as if the god Morpheus , painted on the ceiling , looked at him with eyes resembling human eyes ; that something shone brightly , and moved to and fro in the dome above the sleeper ; that the crowd of terrible dreams which thronged together in his brain , and which were interrupted for a moment , half revealed a human face , with a hand resting against the mouth , and in an attitude of deep and absorbed meditation . 
And strange enough , too , this man bore so wonderful a resemblance to the king himself , that Louis fancied he was looking at his own face reflected in a mirror ; with the exception , however , that the face was saddened by a feeling of the profoundest pity . 
Then it seemed to him as if the dome gradually retired , escaping from his gaze , and that the figures and attributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance became more and more remote . 
A gentle , easy movement , as regular as that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves , had succeeded to the immovableness of the bed . 
Doubtless the king was dreaming , and in this dream the crown of gold , which fastened the curtains together , seemed to recede from his vision , just as the dome , to which it remained suspended , had done , so that the winged genius which , with both its hand , supported the crown , seemed , though vainly so , to call upon the king , who was fast disappearing from it . 
The bed still sunk . 
Louis , with his eyes open , could not resist the deception of this cruel hallucination . 
At last , as the light of the royal chamber faded away into darkness and gloom , something cold , gloomy , and inexplicable in its nature seemed to infect the air . 
No paintings , nor gold , nor velvet hangings , were visible any longer , nothing but walls of a dull gray color , which the increasing gloom made darker every moment . 
And yet the bed still continued to descend , and after a minute , which seemed in its duration almost an age to the king , it reached a stratum of air , black and chill as death , and then it stopped . 
The king could no longer see the light in his room , except as from the bottom of a well we can see the light of day . 
`` I am under the influence of some atrocious dream , '' he thought . 
`` It is time to awaken from it . 
Come ! 
let me wake . '' 
Every one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys ; there is hardly a person who , in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is suffocating , has not said to himself , by the help of that light which still burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished , `` It is nothing but a dream , after all . '' 
This was precisely what Louis XIV . 
said to himself ; but when he said , `` Come , come ! 
wake up , '' he perceived that not only was he already awake , but still more , that he had his eyes open also . 
And then he looked all round him . 
On his right hand and on his left two armed men stood in stolid silence , each wrapped in a huge cloak , and the face covered with a mask ; one of them held a small lamp in his hand , whose glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king could look upon . 
Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream still lasted , and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was to move his arms or to say something aloud ; he darted from his bed , and found himself upon the damp , moist ground . 
Then , addressing himself to the man who held the lamp in his hand , he said : `` What is this , monsieur , and what is the meaning of this jest ? '' 
`` It is no jest , '' replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the lantern . 
`` Do you belong to M. Fouquet ? '' 
inquired the king , greatly astonished at his situation . 
`` It matters very little to whom we belong , '' said the phantom ; `` we are your masters now , that is sufficient . '' 
The king , more impatient than intimidated , turned to the other masked figure . 
`` If this is a comedy , '' he said , `` you will tell M. Fouquet that I find it unseemly and improper , and that I command it should cease . '' 
The second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a man of huge stature and vast circumference . 
He held himself erect and motionless as any block of marble . 
`` Well ! '' 
added the king , stamping his foot , `` you do not answer ! '' 
`` We do not answer you , my good monsieur , '' said the giant , in a stentorian voice , `` because there is nothing to say . '' 
`` At least , tell me what you want , '' exclaimed Louis , folding his arms with a passionate gesture . 
`` You will know by and by , '' replied the man who held the lamp . 
`` In the meantime tell me where I am . '' 
`` Look . '' 
Louis looked all round him ; but by the light of the lamp which the masked figure raised for the purpose , he could perceive nothing but the damp walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the snail . 
`` Oh - oh ! 
- a dungeon , '' cried the king . 
`` No , a subterranean passage . '' 
`` Which leads - ? '' 
`` Will you be good enough to follow us ? '' 
`` I shall not stir from hence ! '' 
cried the king . 
`` If you are obstinate , my dear young friend , '' replied the taller of the two , `` I will lift you up in my arms , and roll you up in your own cloak , and if you should happen to be stifled , why - so much the worse for you . '' 
As he said this , he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which Milo of Crotona would have envied him the possession , on the day when he had that unhappy idea of rending his last oak . 
The king dreaded violence , for he could well believe that the two men into whose power he had fallen had not gone so far with any idea of drawing back , and that they would consequently be ready to proceed to extremities , if necessary . 
He shook his head and said : `` It seems I have fallen into the hands of a couple of assassins . 
Move on , then . '' 
Neither of the men answered a word to this remark . 
The one who carried the lantern walked first , the king followed him , while the second masked figure closed the procession . 
In this manner they passed along a winding gallery of some length , with as many staircases leading out of it as are to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe 's creation . 
All these windings and turnings , during which the king heard the sound of running water over his head , ended at last in a long corridor closed by an iron door . 
The figure with the lamp opened the door with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle , where , during the whole of the brief journey , the king had heard them rattle . 
As soon as the door was opened and admitted the air , Louis recognized the balmy odors that trees exhale in hot summer nights . 
He paused , hesitatingly , for a moment or two ; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him out of the subterranean passage . 
`` Another blow , '' said the king , turning towards the one who had just had the audacity to touch his sovereign ; `` what do you intend to do with the king of France ? '' 
`` Try to forget that word , '' replied the man with the lamp , in a tone which as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of Minos . 
`` You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just made use of , '' said the giant , as he extinguished the lamp his companion handed to him ; `` but the king is too kind-hearted . '' 
Louis , at that threat , made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if he meditated flight ; but the giant 's hand was in a moment placed on his shoulder , and fixed him motionless where he stood . 
`` But tell me , at least , where we are going , '' said the king . 
`` Come , '' replied the former of the two men , with a kind of respect in his manner , and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be in waiting . 
The carriage was completely concealed amid the trees . 
Two horses , with their feet fettered , were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of a large oak . 
`` Get in , '' said the same man , opening the carriage-door and letting down the step . 
The king obeyed , seated himself at the back of the carriage , the padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and his guide . 
As for the giant , he cut the fastenings by which the horses were bound , harnessed them himself , and mounted on the box of the carriage , which was unoccupied . 
The carriage set off immediately at a quick trot , turned into the road to Paris , and in the forest of Senart found a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the first horses had been , and without a postilion . 
The man on the box changed the horses , and continued to follow the road towards Paris with the same rapidity , so that they entered the city about three o'clock in the morning . 
They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , and , after having called out to the sentinel , `` By the king 's order , '' the driver conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile , looking out upon the courtyard , called La Cour du Gouvernement . 
There the horses drew up , reeking with sweat , at the flight of steps , and a sergeant of the guard ran forward . 
`` Go and wake the governor , '' said the coachman in a voice of thunder . 
With the exception of this voice , which might have been heard at the entrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , everything remained as calm in the carriage as in the prison . 
Ten minutes afterwards , M. de Baisemeaux appeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door . 
`` What is the matter now ? '' 
he asked ; `` and whom have you brought me there ? '' 
The man with the lantern opened the carriage-door , and said two or three words to the one who acted as driver , who immediately got down from his seat , took up a short musket which he kept under his feet , and placed its muzzle on his prisoner 's chest . 
`` And fire at once if he speaks ! '' 
added aloud the man who alighted from the carriage . 
`` Very good , '' replied his companion , without another remark . 
With this recommendation , the person who had accompanied the king in the carriage ascended the flight of steps , at the top of which the governor was awaiting him . 
`` Monsieur d'Herblay ! '' 
said the latter . 
`` Hush ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Let us go into your room . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
what brings you here at this hour ? '' 
`` A mistake , my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , '' Aramis replied , quietly . 
`` It appears that you were quite right the other day . '' 
`` What about ? '' 
inquired the governor . 
`` About the order of release , my dear friend . '' 
`` Tell me what you mean , monsieur - no , monseigneur , '' said the governor , almost suffocated by surprise and terror . 
`` It is a very simple affair : you remember , dear M. de Baisemeaux , that an order of release was sent to you . '' 
`` Yes , for Marchiali . '' 
`` Very good ! 
we both thought that it was for Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you will recollect , however , that I would not credit it , but that you compelled me to believe it . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Baisemeaux , my good fellow , what a word to make use of ! 
- strongly recommended , that was all . '' 
`` Strongly recommended , yes ; strongly recommended to give him up to you ; and that you carried him off with you in your carriage . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , it was a mistake ; it was discovered at the ministry , so that I now bring you an order from the king to set at liberty Seldon , - that poor Seldon fellow , you know . '' 
`` Seldon ! 
are you sure this time ? '' 
`` Well , read it yourself , '' added Aramis , handing him the order . 
`` Why , '' said Baisemeaux , `` this order is the very same that has already passed through my hands . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening . 
Parbleu ! 
I recognize it by the blot of ink . '' 
`` I do not know whether it is that ; but all I know is , that I bring it for you . '' 
`` But then , what about the other ? '' 
`` What other ? '' 
`` Marchiali . '' 
`` I have got him here with me . '' 
`` But that is not enough for me . 
I require a new order to take him back again . '' 
`` Do n't talk such nonsense , my dear Baisemeaux ; you talk like a child ! 
Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali ? '' 
Baisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out . 
Aramis seized hold of it , coolly tore it in four pieces , held them to the lamp , and burnt them . 
`` Good heavens ! 
what are you doing ? '' 
exclaimed Baisemeaux , in an extremity of terror . 
`` Look at your position quietly , my good governor , '' said Aramis , with imperturbable self-possession , `` and you will see how very simple the whole affair is . 
You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali 's release . '' 
`` I am a lost man ! '' 
`` Far from it , my good fellow , since I have brought Marchiali back to you , and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , completely overcome by terror . 
`` Plain enough , you see ; and you will go and shut him up immediately . '' 
`` I should think so , indeed . '' 
`` And you will hand over this Seldon to me , whose liberation is authorized by this order . 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` I - I - '' `` You do understand , I see , '' said Aramis . 
`` Very good . '' 
Baisemeaux clapped his hands together . 
`` But why , at all events , after having taken Marchiali away from me , do you bring him back again ? '' 
cried the unhappy governor , in a paroxysm of terror , and completely dumbfounded . 
`` For a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis - `` for so devoted a servant , I have no secrets ; '' and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux 's ear , as he said , in a low tone of voice , `` you know the resemblance between that unfortunate fellow , and - '' `` And the king ? 
- yes ! '' 
`` Very good ; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to persist - Can you guess what ? '' 
`` How is it likely I should guess ? '' 
`` To persist in saying that he was king of France ; to dress himself up in clothes like those of the king ; and then pretend to assume that he was the king himself . '' 
`` Gracious heavens ! '' 
`` That is the reason why I have brought him back again , my dear friend . 
He is mad and lets every one see how mad he is . '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` That is very simple ; let no one hold any communication with him . 
You understand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king 's ears , the king , who had pitied his terrible affliction , and saw that all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude , became perfectly furious ; so that , now - and remember this very distinctly , dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux , for it concerns you most closely - so that there is now , I repeat , sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself . 
You understand , Baisemeaux , sentence of death ! '' 
`` You need not ask me whether I understand . '' 
`` And now , let us go down , and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon again , unless you prefer he should come up here . '' 
`` What would be the good of that ? '' 
`` It would be better , perhaps , to enter his name in the prison-book at once ! '' 
`` Of course , certainly ; not a doubt of it . '' 
`` In that case , have him up . '' 
Baisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung , as a warning to every one to retire , in order to avoid meeting a prisoner , about whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery . 
Then , when the passages were free , he went to take the prisoner from the carriage , at whose breast Porthos , faithful to the directions which had been given him , still kept his musket leveled . 
`` Ah ! 
is that you , miserable wretch ? '' 
cried the governor , as soon as he perceived the king . 
`` Very good , very good . '' 
And immediately , making the king get out of the carriage , he led him , still accompanied by Porthos , who had not taken off his mask , and Aramis , who again resumed his , up the stairs , to the second Bertaudiere , and opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had bemoaned his existence . 
The king entered the cell without pronouncing a single word : he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily . 
Baisemeaux shut the door upon him , turned the key twice in the lock , and then returned to Aramis . 
`` It is quite true , '' he said , in a low tone , `` that he bears a striking resemblance to the king ; but less so than you said . '' 
`` So that , '' said Aramis , `` you would not have been deceived by the substitution of the one for the other ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` You are a most valuable fellow , Baisemeaux , '' said Aramis ; `` and now , set Seldon free . '' 
`` Oh , yes . 
I was going to forget that . 
I will go and give orders at once . '' 
`` Bah ! 
to-morrow will be time enough . '' 
`` To-morrow ! 
- oh , no . 
This very minute . '' 
`` Well ; go off to your affairs , I will go away to mine . 
But it is quite understood , is it not ? '' 
`` What ` is quite understood ' ? '' 
`` That no one is to enter the prisoner 's cell , expect with an order from the king ; an order which I will myself bring . '' 
`` Quite so . 
Adieu , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis returned to his companion . 
`` Now , Porthos , my good fellow , back again to Vaux , and as fast as possible . '' 
`` A man is light and easy enough , when he has faithfully served his king ; and , in serving him , saved his country , '' said Porthos . 
`` The horses will be as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven . 
So let us be off . '' 
And the carriage , lightened of a prisoner , who might well be - as he in fact was - very heavy in the sight of Aramis , passed across the drawbridge of the Bastile , which was raised again immediately behind it . 
: A Night at the Bastile . 
Pain , anguish , and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed . 
We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man 's capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him ; for that , indeed , would not be true , since Heaven permits the existence of death , which is , sometimes , the only refuge open to those who are too closely pressed - too bitterly afflicted , as far as the body is concerned . 
Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded ; in other words , the weak suffer more , where the trial is the same , than the strong . 
And what are the elementary principles , we may ask , that compose human strength ? 
Is it not - more than anything else - exercise , habit , experience ? 
We shall not even take the trouble to demonstrate this , for it is an axiom in morals , as in physics . 
When the young king , stupefied and crushed in every sense and feeling , found himself led to a cell in the Bastile , he fancied death itself is but a sleep ; that it , too , has its dreams as well ; that the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux ; that death had resulted from the occurrence ; and that , still carrying out his dream , the king , Louis XIV. , now no longer living , was dreaming one of those horrors , impossible to realize in life , which is termed dethronement , imprisonment , and insult towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power . 
To be present at - an actual witness , too - of this bitterness of death ; to float , indecisively , in an incomprehensible mystery , between resemblance and reality ; to hear everything , to see everything , without interfering in a single detail of agonizing suffering , was - so the king thought within himself - a torture far more terrible , since it might last forever . 
`` Is this what is termed eternity - hell ? '' 
he murmured , at the moment the door was closed upon him , which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands . 
He did not even look round him ; and in the room , leaning with his back against the wall , he allowed himself to be carried away by the terrible supposition that he was already dead , as he closed his eyes , in order to avoid looking upon something even worse still . 
`` How can I have died ? '' 
he said to himself , sick with terror . 
`` The bed might have been let down by some artificial means ? 
But no ! 
I do not remember to have felt a bruise , nor any shock either . 
Would they not rather have poisoned me at my meals , or with the fumes of wax , as they did my ancestress , Jeanne d'Albret ? '' 
Suddenly , the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis 's shoulders . 
`` I have seen , '' he said , `` my father lying dead upon his funeral couch , in his regal robes . 
That pale face , so calm and worn ; those hands , once so skillful , lying nerveless by his side ; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death ; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams . 
And yet , how numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse - him whom so many others had preceded , hurried away by him into eternal death ! 
No , that king was still the king : he was enthroned still upon that funeral couch , as upon a velvet armchair ; he had not abdicated one title of his majesty . 
God , who had not punished him , can not , will not punish me , who have done nothing . '' 
A strange sound attracted the young man 's attention . 
He looked round him , and saw on the mantel-shelf , just below an enormous crucifix , coarsely painted in fresco on the wall , a rat of enormous size engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread , but fixing all the time , an intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell . 
The king could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust : he moved back towards the door , uttering a loud cry ; and as if he but needed this cry , which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously , to recognize himself , Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his natural senses . 
`` A prisoner ! '' 
he cried . 
`` I - I , a prisoner ! '' 
He looked round him for a bell to summon some one to him . 
`` There are no bells in the Bastile , '' he said , `` and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned . 
In what way can I have been made a prisoner ? 
It must have been owing to a conspiracy of M. Fouquet . 
I have been drawn to Vaux , as to a snare . 
M. Fouquet can not be acting alone in this affair . 
His agent - That voice that I but just now heard was M. d'Herblay 's ; I recognized it . 
Colbert was right , then . 
But what is Fouquet 's object ? 
To reign in my place and stead ? 
- Impossible . 
Yet who knows ! '' 
thought the king , relapsing into gloom again . 
`` Perhaps my brother , the Duc d'Orleans , is doing that which my uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father . 
But the queen ? 
- My mother , too ? 
And La Valliere ? 
Oh ! 
La Valliere , she will have been abandoned to Madame . 
Dear , dear girl ! 
Yes , it is - it must be so . 
They have shut her up as they have me . 
We are separated forever ! '' 
And at this idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of tears and sobs and groans . 
`` There is a governor in this place , '' the king continued , in a fury of passion ; `` I will speak to him , I will summon him to me . '' 
He called - no voice replied to his . 
He seized hold of his chair , and hurled it against the massive oaken door . 
The wood resounded against the door , and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the staircase ; but from a human creature , none . 
This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was held at the Bastile . 
Therefore , when his first fit of anger had passed away , having remarked a barred window through which there passed a stream of light , lozenge-shaped , which must be , he knew , the bright orb of approaching day , Louis began to call out , at first gently enough , then louder and louder still ; but no one replied . 
Twenty other attempts which he made , one after another , obtained no other or better success . 
His blood began to boil within him , and mount to his head . 
His nature was such , that , accustomed to command , he trembled at the idea of disobedience . 
The prisoner broke the chair , which was too heavy for him to lift , and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the door . 
He struck so loudly , and so repeatedly , that the perspiration soon began to pour down his face . 
The sound became tremendous and continuous ; certain stifled , smothered cries replied in different directions . 
This sound produced a strange effect upon the king . 
He paused to listen ; it was the voice of the prisoners , formerly his victims , now his companions . 
The voices ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings and the massive walls , and rose in accusations against the author of this noise , as doubtless their sighs and tears accused , in whispered tones , the author of their captivity . 
After having deprived so many people of their liberty , the king came among them to rob them of their rest . 
This idea almost drove him mad ; it redoubled his strength , or rather his well , bent upon obtaining some information , or a conclusion to the affair . 
With a portion of the broken chair he recommenced the noise . 
At the end of an hour , Louis heard something in the corridor , behind the door of his cell , and a violent blow , which was returned upon the door itself , made him cease his own . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
said a rude , brutal voice . 
`` What is the matter with you this morning ? '' 
`` This morning ! '' 
thought the king ; but he said aloud , politely , `` Monsieur , are you the governor of the Bastile ? '' 
`` My good fellow , your head is out of sorts , '' replied the voice ; `` but that is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance . 
Be quiet ; mordioux ! '' 
`` Are you the governor ? '' 
the king inquired again . 
He heard a door on the corridor close ; the jailer had just left , not condescending to reply a single word . 
When the king had assured himself of his departure , his fury knew no longer any bounds . 
As agile as a tiger , he leaped from the table to the window , and struck the iron bars with all his might . 
He broke a pane of glass , the pieces of which fell clanking into the courtyard below . 
He shouted with increasing hoarseness , `` The governor , the governor ! '' 
This excess lasted fully an hour , during which time he was in a burning fever . 
With his hair in disorder and matted on his forehead , his dress torn and covered with dust and plaster , his linen in shreds , the king never rested until his strength was utterly exhausted , and it was not until then that he clearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls , the impenetrable nature of the cement , invincible to every influence but that of time , and that he possessed no other weapon but despair . 
He leaned his forehead against the door , and let the feverish throbbings of his heart calm by degrees ; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation would have made it burst . 
`` A moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will be brought to me . 
I shall then see some one , I shall speak to him , and get an answer . '' 
And the king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the prisoners was served at the Bastile ; he was ignorant even of this detail . 
The feeling of remorse at this remembrance smote him like the thrust of a dagger , that he should have lived for five and twenty years a king , and in the enjoyment of every happiness , without having bestowed a moment 's thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived of their liberty . 
The king blushed for very shame . 
He felt that Heaven , in permitting this fearful humiliation , did no more than render to the man the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many others . 
Nothing could be more efficacious for reawakening his mind to religious influences than the prostration of his heart and mind and soul beneath the feeling of such acute wretchedness . 
But Louis dared not even kneel in prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial .
