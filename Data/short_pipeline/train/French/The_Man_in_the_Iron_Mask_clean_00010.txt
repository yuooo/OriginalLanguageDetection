Strongly impressed with this idea , he gave certain sealed orders on his route , while fresh horses were being harnessed to his carriage . 
These orders were addressed to M. d'Artagnan and to certain others whose fidelity to the king was far above suspicion . 
`` In this way , '' said Fouquet to himself , `` prisoner or not , I shall have performed the duty that I owe my honor . 
The orders will not reach them until after my return , if I should return free , and consequently they will not have been unsealed . 
I shall take them back again . 
If I am delayed ; it will be because some misfortune will have befallen me ; and in that case assistance will be sent for me as well as for the king . '' 
Prepared in this manner , the superintendent arrived at the Bastile ; he had traveled at the rate of five leagues and a half the hour . 
Every circumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the Bastile befell Fouquet . 
It was useless giving his name , equally useless his being recognized ; he could not succeed in obtaining an entrance . 
By dint of entreaties , threats , commands , he succeeded in inducing a sentinel to speak to one of the subalterns , who went and told the major . 
As for the governor they did not even dare disturb him . 
Fouquet sat in his carriage , at the outer gate of the fortress , chafing with rage and impatience , awaiting the return of the officers , who at last re-appeared with a sufficiently sulky air . 
`` Well , '' said Fouquet , impatiently , `` what did the major say ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur , '' replied the soldier , `` the major laughed in my face . 
He told me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux , and that even were he at Paris , M. Fouquet would not get up at so early an hour as the present . '' 
`` Mordieu ! 
you are an absolute set of fools , '' cried the minister , darting out of the carriage ; and before the subaltern had time to shut the gate , Fouquet sprang through it , and ran forward in spite of the soldier , who cried out for assistance . 
Fouquet gained ground , regardless of the cries of the man , who , however , having at last come up with Fouquet , called out to the sentinel of the second gate , `` Look out , look out , sentinel ! '' 
The man crossed his pike before the minister ; but the latter , robust and active , and hurried away , too , by his passion , wrested the pike from the soldier and struck him a violent blow on the shoulder with it . 
The subaltern , who approached too closely , received a share of the blows as well . 
Both of them uttered loud and furious cries , at the sound of which the whole of the first body of the advanced guard poured out of the guardhouse . 
Among them there was one , however , who recognized the superintendent , and who called , `` Monseigneur , ah ! 
monseigneur . 
Stop , stop , you fellows ! '' 
And he effectually checked the soldiers , who were on the point of revenging their companions . 
Fouquet desired them to open the gate , but they refused to do so without the countersign ; he desired them to inform the governor of his presence ; but the latter had already heard the disturbance at the gate . 
He ran forward , followed by his major , and accompanied by a picket of twenty men , persuaded that an attack was being made on the Bastile . 
Baisemeaux also recognized Fouquet immediately , and dropped the sword he bravely had been brandishing . 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , '' he stammered , `` how can I excuse - '' `` Monsieur , '' said the superintendent , flushed with anger , and heated by his exertions , `` I congratulate you . 
Your watch and ward are admirably kept . '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale , thinking that this remark was made ironically , and portended a furious burst of anger . 
But Fouquet had recovered his breath , and , beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern , who were rubbing their shoulders , towards him , he said , `` There are twenty pistoles for the sentinel , and fifty for the officer . 
Pray receive my compliments , gentlemen . 
I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you . 
And now , M. Baisemeaux , a word with you . '' 
And he followed the governor to his official residence , accompanied by a murmur of general satisfaction . 
Baisemeaux was already trembling with shame and uneasiness . 
Aramis 's early visit , from that moment , seemed to possess consequences , which a functionary such as he -LRB- Baisemeaux -RRB- was , was perfectly justified in apprehending . 
It was quite another thing , however , when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice , and with an imperious look , said , `` You have seen M. d'Herblay this morning ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself an accomplice ? '' 
`` Well , '' thought Baisemeaux , `` good so far ; '' and then he added , aloud , `` But what crime , monseigneur , do you allude to ? '' 
`` That for which you can be quartered alive , monsieur - do not forget that ! 
But this is not a time to show anger . 
Conduct me immediately to the prisoner . '' 
`` To what prisoner ? '' 
said Baisemeaux , trembling . 
`` You pretend to be ignorant ? 
Very good - it is the best plan for you , perhaps ; for if , in fact , you were to admit your participation in such a crime , it would be all over with you . 
I wish , therefore , to seem to believe in your assumption of ignorance . '' 
`` I entreat you , monseigneur - '' `` That will do . 
Lead me to the prisoner . '' 
`` To Marchiali ? '' 
`` Who is Marchiali ? '' 
`` The prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` He is called Marchiali ? '' 
said the superintendent , his conviction somewhat shaken by Baisemeaux 's cool manner . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; that is the name under which he was inscribed here . '' 
Fouquet looked steadily at Baisemeaux , as if he would read his very heart ; and perceived , with that clear-sightedness most men possess who are accustomed to the exercise of power , that the man was speaking with perfect sincerity . 
Besides , in observing his face for a few moments , he could not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant . 
`` It is the prisoner , '' said the superintendent to him , `` whom M. d'Herblay carried away the day before yesterday ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And whom he brought back this morning ? '' 
added Fouquet , quickly : for he understood immediately the mechanism of Aramis 's plan . 
`` Precisely , monseigneur . '' 
`` And his name is Marchiali , you say ? '' 
`` Yes , Marchiali . 
If monseigneur has come here to remove him , so much the better , for I was going to write about him . '' 
`` What has he done , then ? '' 
`` Ever since this morning he has annoyed me extremely . 
He has had such terrible fits of passion , as almost to make me believe that he would bring the Bastile itself down about our ears . '' 
`` I will soon relieve you of his possession , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Ah ! 
so much the better . '' 
`` Conduct me to his prison . '' 
`` Will monseigneur give me the order ? '' 
`` What order ? '' 
`` An order from the king . '' 
`` Wait until I sign you one . '' 
`` That will not be sufficient , monseigneur . 
I must have an order from the king . '' 
Fouquet assumed an irritated expression . 
`` As you are so scrupulous , '' he said , `` with regard to allowing prisoners to leave , show me the order by which this one was set at liberty . '' 
Baisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon . 
`` Very good , '' said Fouquet ; `` but Seldon is not Marchiali . '' 
`` But Marchiali is not at liberty , monseigneur ; he is here . '' 
`` But you said that M. d'Herblay carried him away and brought him back again . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` So surely did you say it , that I almost seem to hear it now . '' 
`` It was a slip of my tongue , then , monseigneur . '' 
`` Take care , M. Baisemeaux , take care . '' 
`` I have nothing to fear , monseigneur ; I am acting according to the very strictest regulation . '' 
`` Do you dare to say so ? '' 
`` I would say so in the presence of one of the apostles . 
M. d'Herblay brought me an order to set Seldon at liberty . 
Seldon is free . '' 
`` I tell you that Marchiali has left the Bastile . '' 
`` You must prove that , monseigneur . '' 
`` Let me see him . '' 
`` You , monseigneur , who govern this kingdom , know very well that no one can see any of the prisoners without an express order from the king . '' 
`` M. d'Herblay has entered , however . '' 
`` That remains to be proved , monseigneur . '' 
`` M. de Baisemeaux , once more I warn you to pay particular attention to what you are saying . '' 
`` All the documents are there , monseigneur . '' 
`` M. d'Herblay is overthrown . '' 
`` Overthrown ? 
- M. d'Herblay ! 
Impossible ! '' 
`` You see that he has undoubtedly influenced you . '' 
`` No , monseigneur ; what does , in fact , influence me , is the king 's service . 
I am doing my duty . 
Give me an order from him , and you shall enter . '' 
`` Stay , M. le gouverneur , I give you my word that if you allow me to see the prisoner , I will give you an order from the king at once . '' 
`` Give it to me now , monseigneur . '' 
`` And that , if you refuse me , I will have you and all your officers arrested on the spot . '' 
`` Before you commit such an act of violence , monseigneur , you will reflect , '' said Baisemeaux , who had turned very pale , `` that we will only obey an order signed by the king ; and that it will be just as easy for you to obtain one to see Marchiali as to obtain one to do me so much injury ; me , too , who am perfectly innocent . '' 
`` True . 
True ! '' 
cried Fouquet , furiously ; `` perfectly true . 
M. de Baisemeaux , '' he added , in a sonorous voice , drawing the unhappy governor towards him , `` do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur ; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out of my senses ; I am trembling all over - in fact , I feel as though I were about to faint . '' 
`` You will stand a better chance of fainting outright , Monsieur Baisemeaux , when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and thirty pieces of cannon . '' 
`` Good heavens , monseigneur , you are losing your senses . '' 
`` When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your accursed towers , and have battered open the gates of this place , and hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle ! '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! 
for pity 's sake ! '' 
`` I give you ten minutes to make up your mind , '' added Fouquet , in a calm voice . 
`` I will sit down here , in this armchair , and wait for you ; if , in ten minutes ' time , you still persist , I leave this place , and you may think me as mad as you like . 
Then - you shall see ! '' 
Baisemeaux stamped his foot on the ground like a man in a state of despair , but he did not reply a single syllable ; whereupon Fouquet seized a pen and ink , and wrote : `` Order for M. le Prevot des Marchands to assemble the municipal guard and to march upon the Bastile on the king 's immediate service . '' 
Baisemeaux shrugged his shoulders . 
Fouquet wrote : `` Order for the Duc de Bouillon and M. le Prince de Conde to assume the command of the Swiss guards , of the king 's guards , and to march upon the Bastile on the king 's immediate service . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected . 
Fouquet still wrote : `` Order for every soldier , citizen , or gentleman to seize and apprehend , wherever he may be found , le Chevalier d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes , and his accomplices , who are : first , M. de Baisemeaux , governor of the Bastile , suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion - '' `` Stop , monseigneur ! '' 
cried Baisemeaux ; `` I do not understand a single jot of the whole matter ; but so many misfortunes , even were it madness itself that had set them at their awful work , might happen here in a couple of hours , that the king , by whom I must be judged , will see whether I have been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this flood of imminent catastrophes . 
Come with me to the keep , monseigneur , you shall see Marchiali . '' 
Fouquet darted out of the room , followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the perspiration from his face . 
`` What a terrible morning ! '' 
he said ; `` what a disgrace for me ! '' 
`` Walk faster , '' replied Fouquet . 
Baisemeaux made a sign to the jailer to precede them . 
He was afraid of his companion , which the latter could not fail to perceive . 
`` A truce to this child 's play , '' he said , roughly . 
`` Let the man remain here ; take the keys yourself , and show me the way . 
Not a single person , do you understand , must hear what is going to take place here . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , undecided . 
`` Again ! '' 
cried M. Fouquet . 
`` Ah ! 
say ` no ' at once , and I will leave the Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches . '' 
Baisemeaux bowed his head , took the keys , and unaccompanied , except by the minister , ascended the staircase . 
The higher they advanced up the spiral staircase , the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become distinct appeals and fearful imprecations . 
`` What is that ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` That is your Marchiali , '' said the governor ; `` this is the way these madmen scream . '' 
And he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious allusion , as far as Fouquet was concerned , than politeness . 
The latter trembled ; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that had preceded it , the king 's voice . 
He paused on the staircase , snatching the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux , who thought this new madman was going to dash out his brains with one of them . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he cried , `` M. d'Herblay did not say a word about that . '' 
`` Give me the keys at once ! '' 
cried Fouquet , tearing them from his hand . 
`` Which is the key of the door I am to open ? '' 
`` That one . '' 
A fearful cry , followed by a violent blow against the door , made the whole staircase resound with the echo . 
`` Leave this place , '' said Fouquet to Baisemeaux , in a threatening tone . 
`` I ask nothing better , '' murmured the latter , to himself . 
`` There will be a couple of madmen face to face , and the one will kill the other , I am sure . '' 
`` Go ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` If you place your foot on this staircase before I call you , remember that you shall take the place of the meanest prisoner in the Bastile . '' 
`` This job will kill me , I am sure it will , '' muttered Baisemeaux , as he withdrew with tottering steps . 
The prisoner 's cries became more and more terrible . 
When Fouquet had satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase , he inserted the key in the first lock . 
It was then that he heard the hoarse , choking voice of the king , crying out , in a frenzy of rage , `` Help , help ! 
I am the king . '' 
The key of the second door was not the same as the first , and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the bunch . 
The king , however , furious and almost mad with rage and passion , shouted at the top of his voice , `` It was M. Fouquet who brought me here . 
Help me against M. Fouquet ! 
I am the king ! 
Help the king against M. Fouquet ! '' 
These cries filled the minister 's heart with terrible emotions . 
They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the door with a part of the broken chair with which the king had armed himself . 
Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the key . 
The king was almost exhausted ; he could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted , `` Death to Fouquet ! 
death to the traitor Fouquet ! '' 
The door flew open . 
: The King 's Gratitude . 
The two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they suddenly and abruptly stopped , as a mutual recognition took place , and each uttered a cry of horror . 
`` Have you come to assassinate me , monsieur ? '' 
said the king , when he recognized Fouquet . 
`` The king in this state ! '' 
murmured the minister . 
Nothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him ; his clothes were in tatters ; his shirt , open and torn to rags , was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms . 
Haggard , ghastly pale , his hair in disheveled masses , Louis XIV . 
presented the most perfect picture of despair , distress , anger and fear combined that could possibly be united in one figure . 
Fouquet was so touched , so affected and disturbed by it , that he ran towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears . 
Louis held up the massive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use . 
`` Sire , '' said Fouquet , in a voice trembling with emotion , `` do you not recognize the most faithful of your friends ? '' 
`` A friend - you ! '' 
repeated Louis , gnashing his teeth in a manner which betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance . 
`` The most respectful of your servants , '' added Fouquet , throwing himself on his knees . 
The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp . 
Fouquet approached him , kissed his knees , and took him in his arms with inconceivable tenderness . 
`` My king , my child , '' he said , `` how you must have suffered ! '' 
Louis , recalled to himself by the change of situation , looked at himself , and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel , ashamed of his conduct , and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was shown towards him , drew back . 
Fouquet did not understand this movement ; he did not perceive that the king 's feeling of pride would never forgive him for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness . 
`` Come , sire , '' he said , `` you are free . '' 
`` Free ? '' 
repeated the king . 
`` Oh ! 
you set me at liberty , then , after having dared to lift up your hand against me . '' 
`` You do not believe that ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet , indignantly ; `` you can not believe me to be guilty of such an act . '' 
And rapidly , warmly even , he related the whole particulars of the intrigue , the details of which are already known to the reader . 
While the recital continued , Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind ; and when it was finished , the magnitude of the danger he had run struck him far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin brother . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , suddenly to Fouquet , `` this double birth is a falsehood ; it is impossible - you can not have been the dupe of it . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
`` It is impossible , I tell you , that the honor , the virtue of my mother can be suspected , and my first minister has not yet done justice on the criminals ! '' 
`` Reflect , sire , before you are hurried away by anger , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` The birth of your brother - '' `` I have only one brother - and that is Monsieur . 
You know it as well as myself . 
There is a plot , I tell you , beginning with the governor of the Bastile . '' 
`` Be careful , sire , for this man has been deceived as every one else has by the prince 's likeness to yourself . '' 
`` Likeness ? 
Absurd ! '' 
`` This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty , to be able to deceive every one 's eye , '' Fouquet persisted . 
`` Ridiculous ! '' 
`` Do not say so , sire ; those who had prepared everything in order to face and deceive your ministers , your mother , your officers of state , the members of your family , must be quite confident of the resemblance between you . '' 
`` But where are these persons , then ? '' 
murmured the king . 
`` At Vaux . '' 
`` At Vaux ! 
and you suffer them to remain there ! '' 
`` My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty 's release . 
I have accomplished that duty ; and now , whatever your majesty may command , shall be done . 
I await your orders . '' 
Louis reflected for a few moments . 
`` Muster all the troops in Paris , '' he said . 
`` All the necessary orders are given for that purpose , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` You have given orders ! '' 
exclaimed the king . 
`` For that purpose , yes , sire ; your majesty will be at the head of ten thousand men in less than an hour . '' 
The only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet 's hand with such an expression of feeling , that it was very easy to perceive how strongly he had , until that remark , maintained his suspicions of the minister , notwithstanding the latter 's intervention . 
`` And with these troops , '' he said , `` we shall go at once and besiege in your house the rebels who by this time will have established and intrenched themselves therein . '' 
`` I should be surprised if that were the case , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because their chief - the very soul of the enterprise - having been unmasked by me , the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried . '' 
`` You have unmasked this false prince also ? '' 
`` No , I have not seen him . '' 
`` Whom have you seen , then ? '' 
`` The leader of the enterprise , not that unhappy young man ; the latter is merely an instrument , destined through his whole life to wretchedness , I plainly perceive . '' 
`` Most certainly . '' 
`` It is M. l'Abbe d'Herblay , Eveque de Vannes . '' 
`` Your friend ? '' 
`` He was my friend , sire , '' replied Fouquet , nobly . 
`` An unfortunate circumstance for you , '' said the king , in a less generous tone of voice . 
`` Such friendships , sire , had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I was ignorant of the crime . '' 
`` You should have foreseen it . '' 
`` If I am guilty , I place myself in your majesty 's hands . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Monsieur Fouquet , it was not that I meant , '' returned the king , sorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner . 
`` Well ! 
I assure you that , notwithstanding the mask with which the villain covered his face , I had something like a vague suspicion that he was the very man . 
But with this chief of the enterprise there was a man of prodigious strength , the one who menaced me with a force almost herculean ; what is he ? '' 
`` It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon , formerly one of the musketeers . '' 
`` The friend of D'Artagnan ? 
the friend of the Comte de la Fere ? 
Ah ! '' 
exclaimed the king , as he paused at the name of the latter , `` we must not forget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de Bragelonne . '' 
`` Sire , sire , do not go too far . 
M. de la Fere is the most honorable man in France . 
Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you . '' 
`` With those whom you deliver up to me , you say ? 
Very good , for you will deliver up those who are guilty to me . '' 
`` What does your majesty understand by that ? '' 
inquired Fouquet . 
`` I understand , '' replied the king , `` that we shall soon arrive at Vaux with a large body of troops , that we will lay violent hands upon that nest of vipers , and that not a soul shall escape . '' 
`` Your majesty will put these men to death ! '' 
cried Fouquet . 
`` To the very meanest of them . '' 
`` Oh ! 
sire . '' 
`` Let us understand one another , Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , haughtily . 
`` We no longer live in times when assassination was the only and the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity . 
No , Heaven be praised ! 
I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name , and I have scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out . '' 
Fouquet turned pale . 
`` I will take the liberty of observing to your majesty , that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne . 
The august name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of the people accompanied by a smile . '' 
`` Justice must be done , however , monsieur . '' 
`` Good , sire ; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold . '' 
`` The royal blood ! 
you believe that ! '' 
cried the king with fury in his voice , stamping his foot on the ground . 
`` This double birth is an invention ; and in that invention , particularly , do I see M. d'Herblay 's crime . 
It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence , or the insult . '' 
`` And punish it with death , sire ? '' 
`` With death ; yes , monsieur , I have said it . '' 
`` Sire , '' said the surintendant , with firmness , as he raised his head proudly , `` your majesty will take the life , if you please , of your brother Philippe of France ; that concerns you alone , and you will doubtless consult the queen-mother upon the subject . 
Whatever she may command will be perfectly correct . 
I do not wish to mix myself up in it , not even for the honor of your crown , but I have a favor to ask of you , and I beg to submit it to you . '' 
`` Speak , '' said the king , in no little degree agitated by his minister 's last words . 
`` What do you require ? '' 
`` The pardon of M. d'Herblay and of M. du Vallon . '' 
`` My assassins ? '' 
`` Two rebels , sire , that is all . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I understand , then , you ask me to forgive your friends . '' 
`` My friends ! '' 
said Fouquet , deeply wounded . 
`` Your friends , certainly ; but the safety of the state requires that an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty . '' 
`` I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just restored you to liberty , and have saved your life . '' 
`` Monsieur ! '' 
`` I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d'Herblay wished to carry out his character of an assassin , he could very easily have assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart , and all would have been over . '' 
The king started . 
`` A pistol-bullet through the head , '' pursued Fouquet , `` and the disfigured features of Louis XIV. , which no one could have recognized , would be M. d'Herblay 's complete and entire justification . '' 
The king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had escaped . 
`` If M. d'Herblay , '' continued Fouquet , `` had been an assassin , he had no occasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed . 
Freed from the real king , it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the false . 
And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria , he would still have been - her son . 
The usurper , as far as Monsieur d'Herblay 's conscience was concerned , was still a king of the blood of Louis XIII . 
Moreover , the conspirator , in that course , would have had security , secrecy , impunity . 
A pistol-bullet would have procured him all that . 
For the sake of Heaven , sire , grant me his forgiveness . '' 
The king , instead of being touched by the picture , so faithfully drawn in all details , of Aramis 's generosity , felt himself most painfully and cruelly humiliated . 
His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a man had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal life . 
Every word that fell from Fouquet 's lips , and which he thought most efficacious in procuring his friend 's pardon , seemed to pour another drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV . 
Nothing could bend or soften him . 
Addressing himself to Fouquet , he said , `` I really do n't know , monsieur , why you should solicit the pardon of these men . 
What good is there in asking that which can be obtained without solicitation ? '' 
`` I do not understand you , sire . '' 
`` It is not difficult , either . 
Where am I now ? '' 
`` In the Bastile , sire . '' 
`` Yes ; in a dungeon . 
I am looked upon as a madman , am I not ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And no one is known here but Marchiali ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Well ; change nothing in the position of affairs . 
Let the poor madman rot between the slimy walls of the Bastile , and M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness . 
Their new king will absolve them . '' 
`` Your majesty does me a great injustice , sire ; and you are wrong , '' replied Fouquet , dryly ; `` I am not child enough , nor is M. d'Herblay silly enough , to have omitted to make all these reflections ; and if I had wished to make a new king , as you say , I had no occasion to have come here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile , to free you from this place . 
That would show a want of even common sense . 
Your majesty 's mind is disturbed by anger ; otherwise you would be far from offending , groundlessly , the very one of your servants who has rendered you the most important service of all . '' 
Louis perceived that he had gone too far ; that the gates of the Bastile were still closed upon him , whilst , by degrees , the floodgates were gradually being opened , behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had restrained his anger . 
`` I did not say that to humiliate you , Heaven knows , monsieur , '' he replied . 
`` Only you are addressing yourself to me in order to obtain a pardon , and I answer according to my conscience . 
And so , judging by my conscience , the criminals we speak of are not worthy of consideration or forgiveness . '' 
Fouquet was silent . 
`` What I do is as generous , '' added the king , `` as what you have done , for I am in your power . 
I will even say it is more generous , inasmuch as you place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty , my life , may depend ; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both . '' 
`` I was wrong , certainly , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Yes , - I had the appearance of extorting a favor ; I regret it , and entreat your majesty 's forgiveness . '' 
`` And you are forgiven , my dear Monsieur Fouquet , '' said the king , with a smile , which restored the serene expression of his features , which so many circumstances had altered since the preceding evening . 
`` I have my own forgiveness , '' replied the minister , with some degree of persistence ; `` but M. d'Herblay , and M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` They will never obtain theirs , as long as I live , '' replied the inflexible king . 
`` Do me the kindness not to speak of it again . '' 
`` Your majesty shall be obeyed . '' 
`` And you will bear me no ill-will for it ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , sire ; for I anticipated the event . '' 
`` You had ` anticipated ' that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen ? '' 
`` Certainly ; and all my measures were taken in consequence . '' 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
cried the king , surprised . 
`` M. d'Herblay came , as may be said , to deliver himself into my hands . 
M. d'Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country . 
I could not condemn M. d'Herblay to death ; nor could I , on the other hand , expose him to your majesty 's justifiable wrath ; it would have been just the same as if I had killed him myself . '' 
`` Well ! 
and what have you done ? '' 
`` Sire , I gave M. d'Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours ' start over all those your majesty might , probably , dispatch after him . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` But still , the world is wide enough and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses , notwithstanding the ` four hours ' start ' which you have given to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` In giving him these four hours , sire , I knew I was giving him his life , and he will save his life . '' 
`` In what way ? '' 
`` After having galloped as hard as possible , with the four hours ' start , before your musketeers , he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle , where I have given him a safe asylum . '' 
`` That may be ! 
But you forget that you have made me a present of Belle - Isle . '' 
`` But not for you to arrest my friends . '' 
`` You take it back again , then ? '' 
`` As far as that goes - yes , sire . '' 
`` My musketeers shall capture it , and the affair will be at an end . '' 
`` Neither your musketeers , nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle , '' said Fouquet , coldly . 
`` Belle-Isle is impregnable . '' 
The king became perfectly livid ; a lightning flash seemed to dart from his eyes . 
Fouquet felt that he was lost , but he as not one to shrink when the voice of honor spoke loudly within him . 
He bore the king 's wrathful gaze ; the latter swallowed his rage , and after a few moments ' silence , said , `` Are we going to return to Vaux ? '' 
`` I am at your majesty 's orders , '' replied Fouquet , with a low bow ; `` but I think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes previous to appearing before your court . '' 
`` We shall pass by the Louvre , '' said the king . 
`` Come . '' 
And they left the prison , passing before Baisemeaux , who looked completely bewildered as he saw Marchiali once more leave ; and , in his helplessness , tore out the major portion of his few remaining hairs . 
It was perfectly true , however , that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner 's release , and that the king wrote beneath it , `` Seen and approved , Louis '' ; a piece of madness that Baisemeaux , incapable of putting two ideas together , acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead with his own fist . 
: The False King . 
In the meantime , usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at Vaux . 
Philippe gave orders that for his petit lever the grandes entrees , already prepared to appear before the king , should be introduced . 
He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence of M. d'Herblay , who did not return - our readers know the reason . 
But the prince , not believing that absence could be prolonged , wished , as all rash spirits do , to try his valor and his fortune far from all protection and instruction . 
Another reason urged him to this - Anne of Austria was about to appear ; the guilty mother was about to stand in the presence of her sacrificed son . 
Philippe was not willing , if he had a weakness , to render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound thenceforth to display so much strength . 
Philippe opened his folding doors , and several persons entered silently . 
Philippe did not stir whilst his valets de chambre dressed him . 
He had watched , the evening before , all the habits of his brother , and played the king in such a manner as to awaken no suspicion . 
He was thus completely dressed in hunting costume when he received his visitors . 
His own memory and the notes of Aramis announced everybody to him , first of all Anne of Austria , to whom Monsieur gave his hand , and then Madame with M. de Saint-Aignan . 
He smiled at seeing these countenances , but trembled on recognizing his mother . 
That still so noble and imposing figure , ravaged by pain , pleaded in his heart the cause of the famous queen who had immolated a child to reasons of state . 
He found his mother still handsome . 
He knew that Louis XIV . 
loved her , and he promised himself to love her likewise , and not to prove a scourge to her old age . 
He contemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be understood . 
The latter had usurped nothing , had cast no shades athwart his life . 
A separate tree , he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its elevation or majestic life . 
Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother to this prince , who required nothing but gold to minister to his pleasures . 
He bowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan , who was all reverences and smiles , and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta , his sister-in-law , whose beauty struck him ; but he saw in the eyes of that princess an expression of coldness which would facilitate , as he thought , their future relations . 
`` How much more easy , '' thought he , `` it will be to be the brother of that woman than her gallant , if she evinces towards me a coldness that my brother could not have for her , but which is imposed upon me as a duty . '' 
The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen ; his heart - his mind - had just been shaken by so violent a trial , that , in spite of their firm temperament , they would not , perhaps , support another shock . 
Happily the queen did not come . 
Then commenced , on the part of Anne of Austria , a political dissertation upon the welcome M. Fouquet had given to the house of France . 
She mixed up hostilities with compliments addressed to the king , and questions as to his health , with little maternal flatteries and diplomatic artifices . 
`` Well , my son , '' said she , `` are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' said Philippe , `` have the goodness to go and inquire after the queen . '' 
At these words , the first Philippe had pronounced aloud , the slight difference that there was between his voice and that of the king was sensible to maternal ears , and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her son . 
Saint-Aignan left the room , and Philippe continued : `` Madame , I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of , you know I do not - and you have even spoken well of him yourself . '' 
`` That is true ; therefore I only question you on the state of your sentiments with respect to him . '' 
`` Sire , '' said Henrietta , `` I , on my part , have always liked M. Fouquet . 
He is a man of good taste , - a superior man . '' 
`` A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly , '' added Monsieur ; `` and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him . '' 
`` Every one in this thinks too much of himself , and nobody for the state , '' said the old queen . 
`` M. Fouquet , it is a fact , M. Fouquet is ruining the state . '' 
`` Well , mother ! '' 
replied Philippe , in rather a lower key , `` do you likewise constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert ? '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
replied the old queen , rather surprised . 
`` Why , in truth , '' replied Philippe , `` you speak that just as your old friend Madame de Chevreuse would speak . '' 
`` Why do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me ? '' 
said she , `` and what sort of humor are you in to-day towards me ? '' 
Philippe continued : `` Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against somebody ? 
Has not Madame de Chevreuse been to pay you a visit , mother ? '' 
`` Monsieur , you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy I am listening to your father . '' 
`` My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse , and had good reason for not liking her , '' said the prince . 
`` For my part , I like her no better than he did , and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did , to sow divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money - why - '' `` Well ! 
what ? '' 
said Anne of Austria , proudly , herself provoking the storm . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied the young man firmly , `` I will drive Madame de Chevreuse out of my kingdom - and with her all who meddle with its secrets and mysteries . '' 
He had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech , or perhaps he wished to judge the effect of it , like those who , suffering from a chronic pain , and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering , touch their wound to procure a sharper pang . 
Anne of Austria was nearly fainting ; her eyes , open but meaningless , ceased to see for several seconds ; she stretched out her arms towards her other son , who supported and embraced her without fear of irritating the king . 
`` Sire , '' murmured she , `` you are treating your mother very cruelly . '' 
`` In what respect , madame ? '' 
replied he . 
`` I am only speaking of Madame de Chevreuse ; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security of the state and of my person ? 
Well , then , madame , I tell you Madame de Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money , and that she addressed herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret . '' 
`` A certain secret ! '' 
cried Anne of Austria . 
`` Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had committed , which is false , '' added Philippe . 
`` M. Fouquet rejected her offers with indignation , preferring the esteem of the king to complicity with such intriguers . 
Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M. Colbert , and as she is insatiable , and was not satisfied with having extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state , she has taken a still bolder flight , in search of surer sources of supply . 
Is that true , madame ? '' 
`` You know all , sire , '' said the queen , more uneasy than irritated . 
`` Now , '' continued Philippe , `` I have good reason to dislike this fury , who comes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others . 
If Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed , and has concealed them in the shadow of its clemency , I will not permit Madame de Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate . '' 
The latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother , that her son had pity on her . 
He took her hand and kissed it tenderly ; she did not feel that in that kiss , given in spite of repulsion and bitterness of the heart , there was a pardon for eight years of suffering . 
Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed themselves . 
Then , with a cheerful smile : `` We will not go to-day , '' said he , `` I have a plan . '' 
And , turning towards the door , he hoped to see Aramis , whose absence began to alarm him . 
The queen-mother wished to leave the room . 
`` Remain where you are , mother , '' said he , `` I wish you to make your peace with M. Fouquet . '' 
`` I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will ; I only dreaded his prodigalities . '' 
`` We will put that to rights , and will take nothing of the superintendent but his good qualities . '' 
`` What is your majesty looking for ? '' 
said Henrietta , seeing the king 's eyes constantly turned towards the door , and wishing to let fly a little poisoned arrow at his heart , supposing he was so anxiously expecting either La Valliere or a letter from her . 
`` My sister , '' said the young man , who had divined her thought , thanks to that marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to allow him the exercise , `` my sister , I am expecting a most distinguished man , a most able counselor , whom I wish to present to you all , recommending him to your good graces . 
Ah ! 
come in , then , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` What does your majesty wish ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , appearing . 
`` Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes , your friend ? '' 
`` Why , sire - '' `` I am waiting for him , and he does not come . 
Let him be sought for . '' 
D'Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied ; but soon , reflecting that Aramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king , he concluded that the king wished to preserve the secret . 
`` Sire , '' replied he , `` does your majesty absolutely require M. d'Herblay to be brought to you ? '' 
`` Absolutely is not the word , '' said Philippe ; `` I do not want him so particularly as that ; but if he can be found - '' `` I thought so , '' said D'Artagnan to himself . 
`` Is this M. d'Herblay the bishop of Vannes ? '' 
`` Yes , madame . '' 
`` A friend of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` Yes , madame ; an old musketeer . '' 
Anne of Austria blushed . 
`` One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies . '' 
The old queen repented of having wished to bite ; she broke off the conversation , in order to preserve the rest of her teeth . 
`` Whatever may be your choice , sire , '' said she , `` I have no doubt it will be excellent . '' 
All bowed in support of that sentiment . 
`` You will find in him , '' continued Philippe , `` the depth and penetration of M. de Richelieu , without the avarice of M. de Mazarin ! '' 
`` A prime minister , sire ? ''
