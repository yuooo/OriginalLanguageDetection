Come , tell us your story , '' Grushenka cried to Maximov . 
`` Why are you all silent ? '' 
`` There 's nothing to tell , it 's all so foolish , '' answered Maximov at once , with evident satisfaction , mincing a little . 
`` Besides , all that 's by way of allegory in Gogol , for he 's made all the names have a meaning . 
Nozdryov was really called Nosov , and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name , he was called Shkvornev . 
Fenardi really was called Fenardi , only he was n't an Italian but a Russian , and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights , and she had a little short skirt with spangles , and she kept turning round and round , only not for four hours but for four minutes only , and she bewitched everyone ... '' `` But what were you beaten for ? '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` For Piron ! '' 
answered Maximov . 
`` What Piron ? '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` The famous French writer , Piron . 
We were all drinking then , a big party of us , in a tavern at that very fair . 
They 'd invited me , and first of all I began quoting epigrams . 
` Is that you , Boileau ? 
What a funny get-up ! ' 
and Boileau answers that he 's going to a masquerade , that is to the baths , he he ! 
And they took it to themselves , so I made haste to repeat another , very sarcastic , well known to all educated people : Yes , Sappho and Phaon are we ! 
But one grief is weighing on me . 
You do n't know your way to the sea ! 
`` They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it . 
And as ill-luck would have it , to set things right , I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron , how he was not accepted into the French Academy , and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph : Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien , Pas meme academicien , * * Here lies Piron , who was nothing , not even an Academician . 
They seized me and thrashed me . '' 
`` But what for ? 
What for ? '' 
`` For my education . 
People can thrash a man for anything , '' Maximov concluded , briefly and sententiously . 
`` Eh , that 's enough ! 
That 's all stupid , I do n't want to listen . 
I thought it would be amusing , '' Grushenka cut them short , suddenly . 
Mitya started , and at once left off laughing . 
The tall Pole rose upon his feet , and with the haughty air of a man , bored and out of his element , began pacing from corner to corner of the room , his hands behind his back . 
`` Ah , he ca n't sit still , '' said Grushenka , looking at him contemptuously . 
Mitya began to feel anxious . 
He noticed besides , that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression . 
`` Panie ! '' 
cried Mitya , `` Let 's drink ! 
and the other pan , too ! 
Let us drink . '' 
In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him , and filled them with champagne . 
`` To Poland , Panovie , I drink to your Poland ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I shall be delighted , panie , '' said the Pole on the sofa , with dignity and affable condescension , and he took his glass . 
`` And the other pan , what 's his name ? 
Drink , most illustrious , take your glass ! '' 
Mitya urged . 
`` Pan Vrublevsky , '' put in the Pole on the sofa . 
Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table , swaying as he walked . 
`` To Poland , Panovie ! '' 
cried Mitya , raisin , his glass . 
`` Hurrah ! '' 
All three drank . 
Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses . 
`` Now to Russia , Panovie , and let us be brothers ! '' 
`` Pour out some for us , '' said Grushenka ; `` I 'll drink to Russia , too ! '' 
`` So will I , '' said Kalganov . 
`` And I would , too ... to Russia , the old grandmother ! '' 
tittered Maximov . 
`` All ! 
All ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Trifon Borissovitch , some more bottles ! '' 
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table . 
Mitya filled the glasses . 
`` To Russia ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
he shouted again . 
All drank the toast except the Poles , and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once . 
The Poles did not touch theirs . 
`` How 's this , Panovie ? '' 
cried Mitya , `` wo n't you drink it ? '' 
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass , raised it and said with a resonant voice : `` To Russia as she was before 1772 . '' 
`` Come , that 's better ! '' 
cried the other Pole , and they both emptied their glasses at once . 
`` You 're fools , you Panovie , '' broke suddenly from Mitya . 
`` Panie ! '' 
shouted both the Poles , menacingly , setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks . 
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious . 
`` Can one help loving one 's own country ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Be silent ! 
Do n't quarrel ! 
I wo n't have any quarrelling ! '' 
cried Grushenka imperiously , and she stamped her foot on the floor . 
Her face glowed , her eyes were shining . 
The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent . 
Mitya was terribly alarmed . 
`` Panovie , forgive me ! 
It was my fault , I 'm sorry . 
Vrublevsky , panie Vrublevsky , I 'm sorry . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , you , anyway ! 
Sit down , you stupid ! '' . 
Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance . 
Everyone sat down , all were silent , looking at one another . 
`` Gentlemen , I was the cause of it all , '' Mitya began again , unable to make anything of Grushenka 's words . 
`` Come , why are we sitting here ? 
What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again ? '' 
`` Ach , it 's certainly anything but amusing ! '' 
Kalgonov mumbled lazily . 
`` Let 's play faro again , as we did just now , '' Maximov tittered suddenly . 
`` Faro ? 
Splendid ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` If only the panovie - '' `` It 's lite , panovie , '' the Pole on the sofa responded , as it were unwillingly . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Lite ? 
What do you mean by ` lite ' ? '' 
asked Grushenka . 
`` Late , pani ! ' 
A late hour ' I mean , '' the Pole on the sofa explained . 
`` It 's always late with them . 
They can never do anything ! '' 
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger . 
`` They 're dull themselves , so they want others to be dull . 
Before came , Mitya , they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me . '' 
`` My goddess ! '' 
cried the Pole on the sofa , `` I see you 're not well-disposed to me , that 's why I 'm gloomy . 
I 'm ready , panie , '' added he , addressing Mitya . 
`` Begin , panie , '' Mitya assented , pulling his notes out of his pocket , and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table . 
`` I want to lose a lot to you . 
Take your cards . 
Make the bank . '' 
`` We 'll have cards from the landlord , panie , '' said the little Pole , gravely and emphatically . 
`` That 's much the best way , '' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` From the landlord ? 
Very good , I understand , let 's get them from him . 
Cards ! '' 
Mitya shouted to the landlord . 
The landlord brought in a new , unopened pack , and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready , and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon ; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived . 
Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders , but only three girls had arrived , and Marya was not there yet . 
And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out . 
He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls , the sweets , the toffee and the fondants . 
`` And vodka for Andrey , vodka for Andrey ! '' 
he cried in haste . 
`` I was rude to Andrey ! '' 
Suddenly Maximov , who had followed him out , touched him on the shoulder . 
`` Give me five roubles , '' he whispered to Mitya . 
`` I 'll stake something at faro , too , he he ! '' 
`` Capital ! 
Splendid ! 
Take ten , here ! '' 
Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles . 
`` And if you lose that , come again , come again . '' 
`` Very good , '' Maximov whispered joyfully , and he ran back again . 
Mitya , too , returned , apologising for having kept them waiting . 
The Poles had already sat down , and opened the pack . 
They looked much more amiable , almost cordial . 
The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw . 
He wore an air of solemnity . 
`` To your places , gentlemen , '' cried Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` No , I 'm not going to play any more , '' observed Kalganov , `` I 've lost fifty roubles to them just now . '' 
`` The pan had no luck , perhaps he 'll be lucky this time , '' the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction . 
`` How much in the bank ? 
To correspond ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` That 's according , panie , maybe a hundred , maybe two hundred , as much as you will stake . '' 
`` A million ! '' 
laughed Mitya . 
`` The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky , perhaps ? '' 
`` What Podvysotsky ? '' 
`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . ' 
The banker throws the dice . 
Podvysotsky wins . 
` Take it , panie , ' says the banker , and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million . 
` Take it , panie , this is your gain . ' 
There was a million in the bank . ' 
I did n't know that , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` Panie Podvysotsky , ' said the banker , ` you pledged your honour and we pledged ours . ' 
Podvysotsky took the million . '' 
`` That 's not true , '' said Kalganov . 
`` Panie Kalganov , in gentlemanly society one does n't say such things . '' 
`` As if a Polish gambler would give away a million ! '' 
cried Mitya , but checked himself at once . 
`` Forgive me , panie , it 's my fault again ; he would , he would give away a million , for honour , for Polish honour . 
You see how I talk Polish , ha ha ! 
Here , I stake ten roubles , the knave leads . '' 
`` And I put a rouble on the queen , the queen of hearts , the pretty little panienotchka * he ! 
he ! '' 
laughed Maximov , pulling out his queen , and , as though trying to conceal it from everyone , he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table . 
Mitya won . 
The rouble won , too . 
* Little miss . 
`` A corner ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I 'll bet another rouble , a ` single ' stake , '' Maximov muttered gleefully , hugely delighted at having won a rouble . 
`` Lost ! '' 
shouted Mitya . 
`` A ` double ' on the seven ! '' 
The seven too was trumped . 
`` Stop ! '' 
cried Kalganov suddenly . 
`` Double ! 
Double ! '' 
Mitya doubled his stakes , and each time he doubled the stake , the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles . 
The rouble stakes kept winning . 
`` On the double ! '' 
shouted Mitya furiously . 
`` You 've lost two hundred , panie . 
Will you stake another hundred ? '' 
the Pole on the sofa inquired . 
`` What ? 
Lost two hundred already ? 
Then another two hundred ! 
All doubles ! '' 
And pulling his money out of his pocket , Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen , but Kalgonov covered it with his hand . 
`` That 's enough ! '' 
he shouted in his ringing voice . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
Mitya stared at him . 
`` That 's enough ! 
I do n't want you to play anymore . 
Do n't ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because I do n't . 
Hang it , come away . 
That 's why . 
I wo n't let you go on playing . '' 
Mitya gazed at him in astonishment . 
`` Give it up , Mitya . 
He may be right . 
You 've lost a lot as it is , '' said Grushenka , with a curious note in her voice . 
Both the Poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air . 
`` Are you joking , panie ? '' 
said the short man , looking severely at Kalganov . 
`` How dare you ! '' 
Pan Vrublevsky , too , growled at Kalganov . 
`` Do n't dare to shout like that , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` Ah , you turkey-cocks ! '' 
Mitya looked at each of them in turn . 
But something in Grushenka 's face suddenly struck him , and at the same instant something new flashed into his mind - a strange new thought ! 
`` Pani Agrippina , '' the little Pole was beginning , crimson with anger , when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder . 
`` Most illustrious , two words with you . 
`` cried Grushenka . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
`` In the next room , I 've two words to say to you , something pleasant , very pleasant . 
You 'll be glad to hear it . '' 
The little pan was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya . 
He agreed at once , however , on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them . 
`` The bodyguard ? 
Let him come , and I want him , too . 
I must have him ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` March , panovie ! '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
asked Grushenka , anxiously . 
`` We 'll be back in one moment , '' answered Mitya . 
There was a sort of boldness , a sudden confidence shining in his eyes . 
His face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before . 
He led the Poles , not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid , but into the bedroom on the right , where the trunks and packages were kept , and there were two large beds , with pyramids of cotton pillows on each . 
There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner . 
The small man and Mitya sat down to this table , facing each other , while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them , his hands behind his back . 
The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive . 
`` What can I do for you , panie ? '' 
lisped the little Pole . 
`` Well , look here , panie , I wo n't keep you long . 
There 's money for you , '' he pulled out his notes . 
`` Would you like three thousand ? 
Take it and go your way . '' 
The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya , with a searching look . 
`` Three thousand , panie ? '' 
He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky . 
`` Three , panovie , three ! 
Listen , panie , I see you 're a sensible man . 
Take three thousand and go to the devil , and Vrublevsky with you d'you hear ? 
But , at once , this very minute , and for ever . 
You understand that , panie , for ever . 
Here 's the door , you go out of it . 
What have you got there , a great-coat , a fur coat ? 
I 'll bring it out to you . 
They 'll get the horses out directly , and then-good-bye , panie ! '' 
Mitya awaited an answer with assurance . 
He had no doubts . 
An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole 's face . 
`` And the money , panie ? '' 
`` The money , panie ? 
Five hundred roubles I 'll give you this moment for the journey , and as a first instalment , and two thousand five hundred to-morrow , in the town - I swear on my honour , I 'll get it , I 'll get it at any cost ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
The Poles exchanged glances again . 
The short man 's face looked more forbidding . 
`` Seven hundred , seven hundred , not five hundred , at once , this minute , cash down ! '' 
Mitya added , feeling something wrong . 
`` What 's the matter , panie ? 
Do n't you trust me ? 
I ca n't give you the whole three thousand straight off . 
If I give it , you may come back to her to-morrow ... . 
Besides , I have n't the three thousand with me . 
I 've got it at home in the town , '' faltered Mitya , his spirit sinking at every word he uttered . 
`` Upon my word , the money 's there , hidden . '' 
In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man 's face . 
`` What next ? '' 
he asked ironically . 
`` For shame ! '' 
and he spat on the floor . 
Pan Vrublevsky spat too . 
`` You do that , panie , '' said Mitya , recognising with despair that all was over , `` because you hope to make more out of Grushenka ? 
You 're a couple of capons , that 's what you are ! '' 
`` This is a mortal insult ! '' 
The little Pole turned as red as a crab , and he went out of the room , briskly , as though unwilling to hear another word . 
Vrublevsky swung out after him , and Mitya followed , confused and crestfallen . 
He was afraid of Grushenka , afraid that the Pan would at once raise an outcry . 
And so indeed he did . 
The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka . 
`` Pani Agrippina , I have received a mortal insult ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience , as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot . 
`` Speak Russian ! 
Speak Russian ! '' 
she cried , `` not another word of Polish ! 
You used to talk Russian . 
You ca n't have forgotten it in five years . '' 
She was red with passion . 
`` Pani Agrippina - '' `` My name 's Agrafena , Grushenka , speak Russian or I wo n't listen ! '' 
The Pole gasped with offended dignity , and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian : `` Pani Agrafena , I came here to forget the past and forgive it , to forget all that has happened till to-day - '' `` Forgive ? 
Came here to forgive me ? '' 
Grushenka cut him short , jumping up from her seat . 
`` Just so , Pani , I 'm not pusillanimous , I 'm magnanimous . 
But I was astounded when I saw your lovers . 
Pan Mitya offered me three thousand , in the other room to depart . 
I spat in the pan 's face . '' 
`` What ? 
He offered you money for me ? '' 
cried Grushenka , hysterically . 
`` Is it true , Mitya ? 
How dare you ? 
Am I for sale ? '' 
`` Panie , panie ! '' 
yelled Mitya , `` she 's pure and shining , and I have never been her lover ! 
That 's a lie ... '' `` How dare you defend me to him ? '' 
shrieked Grushenka . 
`` It was n't virtue kept me pure , and it was n't that I was afraid of Kuzma , but that I might hold up my head when I met him , and tell him he 's a scoundrel . 
And he did actually refuse the money ? '' 
`` He took it ! 
He took it ! '' 
cried Mitya ; `` only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once , and I could only give him seven hundred straight off . '' 
`` I see : he heard I had money , and came here to marry me ! '' 
`` Pani Agrippina ! '' 
cried the little Pole . 
`` I 'm - a knight , I 'm - a nobleman , and not a lajdak . 
I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman , perverse and shameless . '' 
`` Oh , go back where you came from ! 
I 'll tell them to turn you out and you 'll be turned out , '' cried Grushenka , furious . 
`` I 've been a fool , a fool , to have been miserable these five years ! 
And it was n't for his sake , it was my anger made me miserable . 
And this is n't he at all ! 
Was he like this ? 
It might be his father ! 
Where did you get your wig from ? 
He was a falcon , but this is a gander . 
He used to laugh and sing to me ... . 
And I 've been crying for five years , damned fool , abject , shameless I was ! 
She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands . 
At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left - a rollicking dance song . 
`` A regular Sodom ! '' 
Vrublevsky roared suddenly . 
`` Landlord , send the shameless hussies away ! '' 
The landlord , who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door , hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarrelling , at once entered the room . 
`` What are you shouting for ? 
D'you want to split your throat ? '' 
he said , addressing Vrublevsky , with surprising rudeness . 
`` Animal ! '' 
bellowed Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Animal ? 
And what sort of cards were you playing with just now ? 
I gave you a pack and you hid it . 
You played with marked cards ! 
I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards , d'you know that , for it 's just the same as false banknotes ... And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion , and pulled out an unopened pack of cards . 
`` Here 's my pack unopened ! '' 
He held it up and showed it to all in the room . 
`` From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away , and put his in place of it - you 're a cheat and not a gentleman ! '' 
`` And I twice saw the pan change a card ! '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` How shameful ! 
How shameful ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , clasping her hands , and blushing for genuine shame . 
`` Good Lord , he 's come to that ! '' 
`` I thought so , too ! '' 
said Mitya . 
But before he had uttered the words , Vrublevsky , with a confused and infuriated face , shook his fist at Grushenka , shouting : `` You low harlot ! '' 
Mitya flew at him at once , clutched him in both hands , lifted him in the air , and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right , from which they had just come . 
`` I 've laid him on the floor , there , '' he announced , returning at once , gasping with excitement . 
`` He 's struggling , the scoundrel ! 
But he wo n't come back , no fear of that ! 
... '' He closed one half of the folding doors , and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole : `` Most illustrious , will you please to retire as well ? '' 
`` My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' said Trifon Borissovitch , `` make them give you back the money you lost . 
It 's as good as stolen from you . '' 
`` I do n't want my fifty roubles back , '' Kalgonov declared suddenly . 
`` I do n't want my two hundred , either , '' cried Mitya , `` I would n't take it for anything ! 
Let him keep it as a consolation . '' 
`` Bravo , Mitya ! 
You 're a trump , Mitya ! '' 
cried Grushenka , and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation . 
The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity , was making for the door , but he stopped short and said suddenly , addressing Grushenka : `` Pani , if you want to come with me , come . 
If not , good-bye . '' 
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door . 
This was a man of character : he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed , he still expected that she would marry him . 
Mitya slammed the door after him . 
`` Lock it , '' said Kalganov . 
But the key clicked on the other side , they had locked it from within . 
`` That 's capital ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly . 
`` Serve them right ! '' 
Delirium WHAT followed was almost an orgy , a feast to which all were welcome . 
Grushenka was the first to call for wine . 
`` I want to drink . 
I want to be quite drunk , as we were before . 
Do you remember , Mitya , do you remember how we made friends here last time ! '' 
Mitya himself was almost delirious , feeling that his happiness was at hand . 
But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her . 
`` Go and enjoy yourself . 
Tell them to dance , to make merry , ` let the stove and cottage dance ' ; as we had it last time , '' she kept exclaiming . 
She was tremendously excited . 
And Mitya hastened to obey her . 
The chorus were in the next room . 
The room in which they had been sitting till that moment was too small , and was divided in two by cotton curtains , behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows . 
In the four rooms for visitors there were beds . 
Grushenka settled herself just at the door . 
Mitya set an easy chair for her . 
She had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing `` the time before , '' when they had made merry there . 
All the girls who had come had been there then ; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come , too , and at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions . 
Mitya bustled about . 
All sorts of people began coming into the room to look on , peasants and their women , who had been roused from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvellous entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before . 
Mitya remembered their faces , greeting and embracing everyone he knew . 
He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for everyone who presented himself . 
Only the girls were very eager for the champagne . 
The men preferred rum , brandy , and , above all , hot punch . 
Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls , and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself . 
An absurd chaotic confusion followed , but Mitya was in his natural element , and the more foolish it became , the more his spirits rose . 
If the peasants had asked him for money at that moment , he would have pulled out his notes and given them away right and left . 
This was probably why the landlord , Trifon Borissovitch , kept hovering about Mitya to protect him . 
He seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night ; but he drank little , only one glass of punch , and kept a sharp look-out on Mitya 's interests after his own fashion . 
He intervened in the nick of time , civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away `` cigars and Rhine wine , '' and , above all , money to the peasants as he had done before . 
He was very indignant , too , at the peasant girls drinking liqueur , and eating sweets . 
`` They 're a lousy lot , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' he said . 
`` I 'd give them a kick , every one of them , and they 'd take it as an honour - that 's all they 're worth ! '' 
Mitya remembered Andrey again , and ordered punch to be sent out to him . 
`` I was rude to him just now , '' he repeated with a sinking , softened voice . 
Kalgonov did to drink , and at first did not care for the girls singing ; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became extraordinarily lively , strolling about the room , laughing and praising the music and the songs , admiring everyone and everything . 
Maximov , blissfully drunk , never left his side . 
Grushenka , too , was beginning to get drunk . 
Pointing to Kalganov , she said to Mitya : `` What a dear , charming boy he is ! '' 
And Mitya , delighted , ran to kiss Kalgonov and Maximov . 
Oh , great were his hopes ! 
She had said nothing yet , and seemed , indeed , purposely to refrain from speaking . 
But she looked at him from time to time with caressing and passionate eyes . 
At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her . 
She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the door . 
`` How was it you came just now , eh ? 
Have you walked in ! 
... I was frightened . 
So you wanted to give me up to him , did you ? 
Did you really want to ? '' 
`` I did n't want to spoil your happiness ! '' 
Mitya faltered blissfully . 
But she did not need his answer . 
`` Well , go and enjoy yourself ... '' she sent him away once more . 
`` Do n't cry , I 'll call you back again . '' 
He would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at the dancing , though her eyes followed him wherever he went . 
But in another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run back to her . 
`` Come , sit beside me , tell me , how did you hear about me , and my coming here yesterday ? 
From whom did you first hear it ? '' 
And Mitya began telling her all about it , disconnectedly , incoherently , feverishly . 
He spoke strangely , often frowning , and stopping abruptly . 
`` What are you frowning at ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Nothing ... . 
I left a man ill there . 
I 'd give ten years of my life for him to get well , to know he was all right ! '' 
`` Well , never mind him , if he 's ill . 
So you meant to shoot yourself to-morrow ! 
What a silly boy ! 
What for ? 
I like such reckless fellows as you , '' she lisped , with a rather halting tongue . 
`` So you would go any length for me , eh ? 
Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow , you stupid ? 
No , wait a little . 
To-morrow I may have something to say to you ... . 
I wo n't say it to-day , but to-morrow . 
You 'd like it to be to-day ? 
No , I do n't want to to-day . 
Come , go along now , go and amuse yourself . '' 
Once , however , she called him , as it were , puzzled and uneasy . 
`` Why are you sad ? 
I see you 're sad ... . 
Yes , I see it , '' she added , looking intently into his eyes . 
`` Though you keep kissing the peasants and shouting , I see something . 
No , be merry . 
I 'm merry ; you be merry , too ... . 
I love somebody here . 
Guess who it is . 
Ah , look , my boy has fallen asleep , poor dear , he 's drunk . '' 
She meant Kalganov . 
He was , in fact , drunk , and had dropped asleep for a moment , sitting on the sofa . 
But he was not merely drowsy from drink ; he felt suddenly dejected , or , as he said , `` bored . '' 
He was intensely depressed by the girls ' songs , which , as the drinking went on , gradually became coarse and more reckless . 
And the dances were as bad . 
Two girls dressed up as bears , and a lively girl , called Stepanida , with a stick in her hand , acted the part of keeper , and began to `` show them . ''
