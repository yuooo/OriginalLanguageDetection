And Tikhon , purposely writhing and making faces , pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses . 
The only effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners . 
He was the bravest and most useful man in the party . 
No one found more opportunities for attacking , no one captured or killed more Frenchmen , and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role . 
Now he had been sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a `` tongue . '' 
But whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night , he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and , as Denisov had witnessed from above , had been detected by them . 
After talking for some time with the esaul about next day 's attack , which now , seeing how near they were to the French , he seemed to have definitely decided on , Denisov turned his horse and rode back . 
`` Now , my lad , we 'll go and get dwy , '' he said to Petya . 
As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped , peering into the forest . 
Among the trees a man with long legs and long , swinging arms , wearing a short jacket , bast shoes , and a Kazan hat , was approaching with long , light steps . 
He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle . 
When he espied Denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes , removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim , and approached his commander . 
It was Tikhon . 
His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment . 
He lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh . 
`` Well , where did you disappear to ? '' 
inquired Denisov . 
`` Where did I disappear to ? 
I went to get Frenchmen , '' answered Tikhon boldly and hurriedly , in a husky but melodious bass voice . 
`` Why did you push yourself in there by daylight ? 
You ass ! 
Well , why have n't you taken one ? '' 
`` Oh , I took one all right , '' said Tikhon . 
`` Where is he ? '' 
`` You see , I took him first thing at dawn , '' Tikhon continued , spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes . 
`` I took him into the forest . 
Then I see he 's no good and think I 'll go and fetch a likelier one . '' 
`` You see ? 
... What a wogue -- it 's just as I thought , '' said Denisov to the esaul . 
`` Why did n't you bwing that one ? '' 
`` What was the good of bringing him ? '' 
Tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily -- `` that one would n't have done for you . 
As if I do n't know what sort you want ! '' 
`` What a bwute you are ! 
... Well ? '' 
`` I went for another one , '' Tikhon continued , `` and I crept like this through the wood and lay down . '' 
-LRB- He suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it . -RRB- 
`` One turned up and I grabbed him , like this . '' 
-LRB- He jumped up quickly and lightly . -RRB- '' 
` Come along to the colonel , ' I said . 
He starts yelling , and suddenly there were four of them . 
They rushed at me with their little swords . 
So I went for them with my ax , this way : ` What are you up to ? ' 
says I. ` Christ be with you ! ' '' 
shouted Tikhon , waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest . 
`` Yes , we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles ! '' 
said the esaul , screwing up his glittering eyes . 
Petya badly wanted to laugh , but noticed that they all refrained from laughing . 
He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon 's face to the esaul 's and Denisov 's , unable to make out what it all meant . 
`` Do n't play the fool ! '' 
said Denisov , coughing angrily . 
`` Why did n't you bwing the first one ? '' 
Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other , then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming , foolish grin , disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth -LRB- that was why he was called Shcherbaty -- the gap-toothed -RRB- . 
Denisov smiled , and Petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined . 
`` Oh , but he was a regular good-for-nothing , '' said Tikhon . 
`` The clothes on him -- poor stuff ! 
How could I bring him ? 
And so rude , your honor ! 
Why , he says : ` I 'm a general 's son myself , I wo n't go ! ' 
he says . '' 
`` You are a bwute ! '' 
said Denisov . 
`` I wanted to question ... '' `` But I questioned him , '' said Tikhon . 
`` He said he did n't know much . 
` There are a lot of us , ' he says , ` but all poor stuff -- only soldiers in name , ' he says . 
` Shout loud at them , ' he says , ` and you 'll take them all , ' '' Tikhon concluded , looking cheerfully and resolutely into Denisov 's eyes . 
`` I 'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes -- that 'll teach you to play the fool ! '' 
said Denisov severely . 
`` But why are you angry ? '' 
remonstrated Tikhon , `` just as if I 'd never seen your Frenchmen ! 
Only wait till it gets dark and I 'll fetch you any of them you want -- three if you like . '' 
`` Well , let 's go , '' said Denisov , and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily . 
Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing with him and at him , about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes . 
When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon 's words and smile had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this Tikhon had killed a man , he felt uneasy . 
He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart . 
But this uneasiness lasted only a moment . 
He felt it necessary to hold his head higher , to brace himself , and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow 's undertaking , that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself . 
The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with the news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him . 
Denisov at once cheered up and , calling Petya to him , said : `` Well , tell me about yourself . '' 
Petya , having left his people after their departure from Moscow , joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment . 
From the time he received his commission , and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of Vyazma , Petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic . 
He was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army , but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be . 
And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not . 
When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send somebody to Denisov 's detachment , Petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse . 
But when dispatching him he recalled Petya 's mad action at the battle of Vyazma , where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent , he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his pistol . 
So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of Denisov 's . 
That was why Petya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov asked him whether he could stay . 
Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once . 
But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night , he decided , with the rapidity with which young people change their views , that the general , whom he had greatly respected till then , was a rubbishy German , that Denisov was a hero , the esaul a hero , and Tikhon a hero too , and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty . 
It was already growing dusk when Denisov , Petya , and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse . 
In the twilight saddled horses could be seen , and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French could not see the smoke . 
In the passage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton . 
In the room three officers of Denisov 's band were converting a door into a tabletop . 
Petya took off his wet clothes , gave them to be dried , and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table . 
In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it . 
On the table were vodka , a flask of rum , white bread , roast mutton , and salt . 
Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands , down which the grease trickled , Petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men , and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way . 
`` So then what do you think , Vasili Dmitrich ? '' 
said he to Denisov . 
`` It 's all right my staying a day with you ? '' 
And not waiting for a reply he answered his own question : `` You see I was told to find out - well , I am finding out ... . 
Only do let me into the very ... into the chief ... I do n't want a reward ... But I want ... '' Petya clenched his teeth and looked around , throwing back his head and flourishing his arms . 
`` Into the vewy chief ... '' Denisov repeated with a smile . 
`` Only , please let me command something , so that I may really command ... '' Petya went on . 
`` What would it be to you ? 
... Oh , you want a knife ? '' 
he said , turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton . 
And he handed him his clasp knife . 
The officer admired it . 
`` Please keep it . 
I have several like it , '' said Petya , blushing . 
`` Heavens ! 
I was quite forgetting ! '' 
he suddenly cried . 
`` I have some raisins , fine ones ; you know , seedless ones . 
We have a new sutler and he has such capital things . 
I bought ten pounds . 
I am used to something sweet . 
Would you like some ? 
... '' and Petya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins . 
`` Have some , gentlemen , have some ! '' 
`` You want a coffeepot , do n't you ? '' 
he asked the esaul . 
`` I bought a capital one from our sutler ! 
He has splendid things . 
And he 's very honest , that 's the chief thing . 
I 'll be sure to send it to you . 
Or perhaps your flints are giving out , or are worn out -- that happens sometimes , you know . 
I have brought some with me , here they are '' - and he showed a bag -- `` a hundred flints . 
I bought them very cheap . 
Please take as many as you want , or all if you like ... '' Then suddenly , dismayed lest he had said too much , Petya stopped and blushed . 
He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish . 
And running over the events of the day he remembered the French drummer boy . 
`` It 's capital for us here , but what of him ? 
Where have they put him ? 
Have they fed him ? 
Have n't they hurt his feelings ? '' 
he thought . 
But having caught himself saying too much about the flints , he was now afraid to speak out . 
`` I might ask , '' he thought , `` but they 'll say : ` He 's a boy himself and so he pities the boy . ' 
I 'll show them tomorrow whether I 'm a boy . 
Will it seem odd if I ask ? '' 
Petya thought . 
`` Well , never mind ! '' 
and immediately , blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical , he said : `` May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat ? 
... Perhaps ... '' `` Yes , he 's a poor little fellow , '' said Denisov , who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder . 
`` Call him in . 
His name is Vincent Bosse . 
Have him fetched . '' 
`` I 'll call him , '' said Petya . 
`` Yes , yes , call him . 
A poor little fellow , '' Denisov repeated . 
Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this . 
He slipped in between the officers , came close to Denisov , and said : `` Let me kiss you , dear old fellow ! 
Oh , how fine , how splendid ! '' 
And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut . 
`` Bosse ! 
Vincent ! '' 
Petya cried , stopping outside the door . 
`` Who do you want , sir ? '' 
asked a voice in the darkness . 
Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that day . 
`` Ah , Vesenny ? '' 
said a Cossack . 
Vincent , the boy 's name , had already been changed by the Cossacks into Vesenny -LRB- vernal -RRB- and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers . 
In both these adaptations the reference to spring -LRB- vesna -RRB- matched the impression made by the young lad . 
`` He is warming himself there by the bonfire . 
Ho , Vesenya ! 
Vesenya ! 
-- Vesenny ! '' 
laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness . 
`` He 's a smart lad , '' said an hussar standing near Petya . 
`` We gave him something to eat a while ago . 
He was awfully hungry ! '' 
The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness , and the drummer boy came to the door . 
`` Ah , c'est vous ! '' 
said Petya . 
`` Voulez-vous manger ? 
N'ayez pas peur , on ne vous fera pas de mal , '' * he added shyly and affectionately , touching the boy 's hand . 
`` Entrez , entrez . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- * `` Ah , it 's you ! 
Do you want something to eat ? 
Do n't be afraid , they wo n't hurt you . '' 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` Come in , come in . '' 
`` Merci , monsieur , '' * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice , and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold . 
* `` Thank you , sir . '' 
There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy , but did not dare to . 
He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage . 
Then in the darkness he took the boy 's hand and pressed it . 
`` Come in , come in ! '' 
he repeated in a gentle whisper . 
`` Oh , what can I do for him ? '' 
he thought , and opening the door he let the boy pass in first . 
When the boy had entered the hut , Petya sat down at a distance from him , considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him . 
But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy . 
The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya 's attention from the drummer boy , to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given , and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners . 
Petya had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov 's extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the French , so from the moment he entered the hut Petya did not take his eyes from him , but braced himself up more and more and held his head high , that he might not be unworthy even of such company . 
Dolokhov 's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity . 
Denisov wore a Cossack coat , had a beard , had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder-Worker on his breast , and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position . 
But Dolokhov , who in Moscow had worn a Persian costume , had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the Guards . 
He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman 's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head . 
He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room , and without greeting anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand . 
Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport , of the message Petya had brought , and his own replies to both generals . 
Then he told him all he knew of the French detachment . 
`` That 's so . 
But we must know what troops they are and their numbers , '' said Dolokhov . 
`` It will be necessary to go there . 
We ca n't start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are . 
I like to work accurately . 
Here now -- would n't one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the French camp with me ? 
I have brought a spare uniform . '' 
`` I , I. . . 
I 'll go with you ! '' 
cried Petya . 
`` There 's no need for you to go at all , '' said Denisov , addressing Dolokhov , `` and as for him , I wo n't let him go on any account . '' 
`` I like that ! '' 
exclaimed Petya . 
`` Why should n't I go ? '' 
`` Because it 's useless . '' 
`` Well , you must excuse me , because ... because ... I shall go , and that 's all . 
You 'll take me , wo n't you ? '' 
he said , turning to Dolokhov . 
`` Why not ? '' 
Dolokhov answered absently , scrutinizing the face of the French drummer boy . 
`` Have you had that youngster with you long ? '' 
he asked Denisov . 
`` He was taken today but he knows nothing . 
I 'm keeping him with me . '' 
`` Yes , and where do you put the others ? '' 
inquired Dolokhov . 
`` Where ? 
I send them away and take a weceipt for them , '' shouted Denisov , suddenly flushing . 
`` And I say boldly that I have not a single man 's life on my conscience . 
Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort , instead of staining - I speak bluntly -- staining the honor of a soldier ? '' 
`` That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen , '' said Dolokhov with cold irony , `` but it 's time for you to drop it . '' 
`` Why , I 've not said anything ! 
I only say that I 'll certainly go with you , '' said Petya shyly . 
`` But for you and me , old fellow , it 's time to drop these amenities , '' continued Dolokhov , as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated Denisov . 
`` Now , why have you kept this lad ? '' 
he went on , swaying his head . 
`` Because you are sorry for him ! 
Do n't we know those ` receipts ' of yours ? 
You send a hundred men away , and thirty get there . 
The rest either starve or get killed . 
So is n't it all the same not to send them ? '' 
The esaul , screwing up his light-colored eyes , nodded approvingly . 
`` That 's not the point . 
I 'm not going to discuss the matter . 
I do not wish to take it on my conscience . 
You say they 'll die . 
All wight . 
Only not by my fault ! '' 
Dolokhov began laughing . 
`` Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over ? 
But if they did catch me they 'd string me up to an aspen tree , and with all your chivalry just the same . '' 
He paused . 
`` However , we must get to work . 
Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit . 
I have two French uniforms in it . 
Well , are you coming with me ? '' 
he asked Petya . 
`` I ? 
Yes , yes , certainly ! '' 
cried Petya , blushing almost to tears and glancing at Denisov . 
While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done with prisoners , Petya had once more felt awkward and restless ; but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about . 
`` If grown-up , distinguished men think so , it must be necessary and right , '' thought he . 
`` But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine that I 'll obey him and that he can order me about . 
I will certainly go to the French camp with Dolokhov . 
If he can , so can I ! '' 
And to all Denisov 's persuasions , Petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow , and that he never considered personal danger . 
`` For you 'll admit that if we do n't know for sure how many of them there are ... hundreds of lives may depend on it , while there are only two of us . 
Besides , I want to go very much and certainly will go , so do n't hinder me , '' said he . 
`` It will only make things worse ... '' Having put on French greatcoats and shakos , Petya and Dolokhov rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French camp , and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow . 
On reaching the bottom , Dolokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge . 
Petya , his heart in his mouth with excitement , rode by his side . 
`` If we 're caught , I wo n't be taken alive ! 
I have a pistol , '' whispered he . 
`` Do n't talk Russian , '' said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper , and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge : `` Qui vive ? '' 
* and the click of a musket . 
* `` Who goes there ? '' 
The blood rushed to Petya 's face and he grasped his pistol . 
`` Lanciers du 6-me , '' * replied Dolokhov , neither hastening nor slackening his horse 's pace . 
* `` Lancers of the 6th Regiment . '' 
The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge . 
`` Mot d'ordre . '' 
* * `` Password . '' 
Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk . 
`` Dites donc , le colonel Gerard est ici ? '' 
* he asked . 
* `` Tell me , is Colonel Gerard here ? '' 
`` Mot d'ordre , '' repeated the sentinel , barring the way and not replying . 
`` Quand un officier fait sa ronde , les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d'ordre ... '' cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel . 
`` Je vous demande si le colonel est ici . '' 
* * `` When an officer is making his round , sentinels do n't ask him for the password ... . 
I am asking you if the colonel is here . '' 
And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel , who had stepped aside , Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk . 
Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road , Dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were . 
The man , a soldier with a sack over his shoulder , stopped , came close up to Dolokhov 's horse , touched it with his hand , and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm , as he called the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden up the road , on both sides of which French talk could be heard around the campfires , Dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner 's house . 
Having ridden in , he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire , around which sat several men talking noisily . 
Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat , lit up by the fire , was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod . 
`` Oh , he 's a hard nut to crack , '' said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire . 
`` He 'll make them get a move on , those fellows ! '' 
said another , laughing . 
Both fell silent , peering out through the darkness at the sound of Dolokhov 's and Petya 's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses . 
`` Bonjour , messieurs ! '' 
* said Dolokhov loudly and clearly . 
* `` Good day , gentlemen . '' 
There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire , and one tall , long-necked officer , walking round the fire , came up to Dolokhov . 
`` Is that you , Clement ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Where the devil ... ? '' 
But , noticing his mistake , he broke off short and , with a frown , greeted Dolokhov as a stranger , asking what he could do for him . 
Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment , and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th Regiment . 
None of them knew anything , and Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dolokhov with hostility and suspicion . 
For some seconds all were silent . 
`` If you were counting on the evening soup , you have come too late , '' said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh . 
Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night . 
He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck . 
That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged . 
Dolokhov , as if he had not heard the question , did not reply , but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from Cossacks . 
`` Those brigands are everywhere , '' replied an officer from behind the fire . 
Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself , `` but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments ? '' 
he added inquiringly . 
No one replied . 
`` Well , now he 'll come away , '' Petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk . 
But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion , how many battalions , and how many prisoners . 
Asking about the Russian prisoners with that detachment , Dolokhov said : `` A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one ! 
It would be better to shoot such rabble , '' and burst into loud laughter , so strange that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise , and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire . 
No one replied a word to Dolokhov 's laughter , and a French officer whom they could not see -LRB- he lay wrapped in a greatcoat -RRB- rose and whispered something to a companion . 
Dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses . 
`` Will they bring our horses or not ? '' 
thought Petya , instinctively drawing nearer to Dolokhov . 
The horses were brought . 
`` Good evening , gentlemen , '' said Dolokhov . 
Petya wished to say `` Good night '' but could not utter a word . 
The officers were whispering together . 
Dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still , then he rode out of the yard at a footpace . 
Petya rode beside him , longing to look round to see whether or no the French were running after them , but not daring to . 
Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the open country , but through the village . 
At one spot he stopped and listened . 
`` Do you hear ? '' 
he asked . 
Petya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires . 
When they had descended to the bridge Petya and Dolokhov rode past the sentinel , who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it , then they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them . 
`` Well now , good-by . 
Tell Denisov , ` at the first shot at daybreak , ' '' said Dolokhov and was about to ride away , but Petya seized hold of him . 
`` Really ! '' 
he cried , `` you are such a hero ! 
Oh , how fine , how splendid ! 
How I love you ! '' 
`` All right , all right ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
But Petya did not let go of him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him . 
Dolokhov kissed him , laughed , turned his horse , and vanished into the darkness . 
Having returned to the watchman 's hut , Petya found Denisov in the passage . 
He was awaiting Petya 's return in a state of agitation , anxiety , and self-reproach for having let him go . 
`` Thank God ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Yes , thank God ! '' 
he repeated , listening to Petya 's rapturous account . 
`` But , devil take you , I have n't slept because of you ! 
Well , thank God . 
Now lie down . 
We can still get a nap before morning . '' 
`` But ... no , '' said Petya , `` I do n't want to sleep yet . 
Besides I know myself , if I fall asleep it 's finished . 
And then I am used to not sleeping before a battle . '' 
He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day . 
Then , noticing that Denisov was asleep , he rose and went out of doors . 
It was still quite dark outside . 
The rain was over , but drops were still falling from the trees . 
Near the watchman 's hut the black shapes of the Cossacks ' shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen . 
Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible , and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red . 
Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep ; here and there , amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by , could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering . 
Petya came out , peered into the darkness , and went up to the wagons . 
Someone was snoring under them , and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats . 
In the dark Petya recognized his own horse , which he called `` Karabakh '' though it was of Ukranian breed , and went up to it . 
`` Well , Karabakh ! 
We 'll do some service tomorrow , '' said he , sniffing its nostrils and kissing it . 
`` Why are n't you asleep , sir ? '' 
said a Cossack who was sitting under a wagon . 
`` No , ah ... Likhachev -- is n't that your name ? 
Do you know I have only just come back ! 
We 've been into the French camp . '' 
And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object , and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act `` just anyhow . '' 
`` Well , you should get some sleep now , '' said the Cossack . 
`` No , I am used to this , '' said Petya . 
`` I say , are n't the flints in your pistols worn out ? 
I brought some with me . 
Do n't you want any ? 
You can have some . '' 
The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at Petya . 
`` Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately , '' said Petya . 
`` Some fellows do things just anyhow , without preparation , and then they 're sorry for it afterwards . 
I do n't like that . '' 
`` Just so , '' said the Cossack . 
`` Oh yes , another thing ! 
Please , my dear fellow , will you sharpen my saber for me ? 
It 's got bl ... '' -LRB- Petya feared to tell a lie , and the saber never had been sharpened . -RRB- 
`` Can you do it ? '' 
`` Of course I can . '' 
Likhachev got up , rummaged in his pack , and soon Petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone . 
He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge . 
The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon . 
`` I say ! 
Are the lads asleep ? '' 
asked Petya . 
`` Some are , and some are n't -- like us . '' 
`` Well , and that boy ? '' 
`` Vesenny ? 
Oh , he 's thrown himself down there in the passage . 
Fast asleep after his fright . 
He was that glad ! '' 
After that Petya remained silent for a long time , listening to the sounds . 
He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared . 
`` What are you sharpening ? '' 
asked a man coming up to the wagon . 
`` Why , this gentleman 's saber . '' 
`` That 's right , '' said the man , whom Petya took to be an hussar . 
`` Was the cup left here ? '' 
`` There , by the wheel ! '' 
The hussar took the cup . 
`` It must be daylight soon , '' said he , yawning , and went away . 
Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov 's guerrilla band , less than a mile from the road , sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which horses were tethered , that under it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him , that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman 's hut , and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire , that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink ; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this . 
He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality . 
The big dark blotch might really be the watchman 's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth . 
Perhaps the red spot was a fire , or it might be the eye of an enormous monster . 
Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon , but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which , if he fell , he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month , or go on falling and never reach the bottom . 
Perhaps it was just the Cossack , Likhachev , who was sitting under the wagon , but it might be the kindest , bravest , most wonderful , most splendid man in the world , whom no one knew of . 
It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow , but perhaps he had simply vanished -- disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness . 
Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him . 
He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible . 
He looked up at the sky . 
And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth . 
It was clearing , and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars . 
Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing , and a clear black sky appeared . 
Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds . 
Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high , high overhead , and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one 's hand . 
Petya 's eyes began to close and he swayed a little . 
The trees were dripping . 
Quiet talking was heard . 
The horses neighed and jostled one another . 
Someone snored . 
`` Ozheg-zheg , Ozheg-zheg ... '' hissed the saber against the whetstone , and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown , sweetly solemn hymn . 
Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than Nicholas , but had never learned music or thought about it , and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive . 
The music became more and more audible . 
The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another . 
And what was played was a fugue -- though Petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is . 
Each instrument -- now resembling a violin and now a horn , but better and clearer than violin or horn - played its own part , and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air , and then with a third and a fourth ; and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended , now into solemn church music , now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant . 
`` Oh -- why , that was in a dream ! '' 
Petya said to himself , as he lurched forward . 
`` It 's in my ears . 
But perhaps it 's music of my own . 
Well , go on , my music ! 
Now ! 
... '' He closed his eyes , and , from all sides as if from a distance , sounds fluttered , grew into harmonies , separated , blended , and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn . 
`` Oh , this is delightful ! 
As much as I like and as I like ! '' 
said Petya to himself . 
He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra . 
`` Now softly , softly die away ! '' 
and the sounds obeyed him . 
`` Now fuller , more joyful . 
Still more and more joyful ! '' 
And from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds . 
`` Now voices join in ! '' 
ordered Petya . 
And at first from afar he heard men 's voices and then women 's . 
The voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength , and Petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy . 
With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song , the drip from the trees , and the hissing of the saber , `` Ozheg-zheg-zheg ... '' and again the horses jostled one another and neighed , not disturbing the choir but joining in it . 
Petya did not know how long this lasted : he enjoyed himself all the time , wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it . 
He was awakened by Likhachev 's kindly voice . 
`` It 's ready , your honor ; you can split a Frenchman in half with it ! '' 
Petya woke up . 
`` It 's getting light , it 's really getting light ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails , and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches . 
Petya shook himself , jumped up , took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to Likhachev ; then he flourished the saber , tested it , and sheathed it . 
The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths . 
`` And here 's the commander , '' said Likhachev . 
Denisov came out of the watchman 's hut and , having called Petya , gave orders to get ready . 
The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness , tightened their saddle girths , and formed companies . 
Denisov stood by the watchman 's hut giving final orders . 
The infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn , hundreds of feet splashing through the mud . 
The esaul gave some orders to his men . 
Petya held his horse by the bridle , impatiently awaiting the order to mount . 
His face , having been bathed in cold water , was all aglow , and his eyes were particularly brilliant . 
Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically . 
`` Well , is ev ` wything weady ? '' 
asked Denisov . 
`` Bwing the horses . '' 
The horses were brought . 
Denisov was angry with the Cossack because the saddle girths were too slack , reproved him , and mounted . 
Petya put his foot in the stirrup . 
His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg , but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and , turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him , rode up to Denisov . 
`` Vasili Dmitrich , entrust me with some commission ! 
Please ... for God 's sake ... ! '' 
said he . 
Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya 's very existence .
