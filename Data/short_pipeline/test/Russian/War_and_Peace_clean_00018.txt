Vera 's remark was correct , as her remarks always were , but , like most of her observations , it made everyone feel uncomfortable , not only Sonya , Nicholas , and Natasha , but even the old countess , who - dreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant match -- blushed like a girl . 
Denisov , to Rostov 's surprise , appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair , perfumed , and in a new uniform , looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle , and he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see him . 
On his return to Moscow from the army , Nicholas Rostov was welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons , a hero , and their darling Nikolenka ; by his relations as a charming , attractive , and polite young man ; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars , a good dancer , and one of the best matches in the city . 
The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow . 
The old count had money enough that year , as all his estates had been remortgaged , and so Nicholas , acquiring a trotter of his own , very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut , such as no one else yet had in Moscow , and boots of the latest fashion , with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs , passed his time very gaily . 
After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life , Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again . 
He felt that he had grown up and matured very much . 
His despair at failing in a Scripture examination , his borrowing money from Gavril to pay a sleigh driver , his kissing Sonya on the sly -- he now recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind . 
Now he was a lieutenant of hussars , in a jacket laced with silver , and wearing the Cross of St. George , awarded to soldiers for bravery in action , and in the company of well-known , elderly , and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race . 
He knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening . 
He led the mazurka at the Arkharovs ' ball , talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski , visited the English Club , and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had introduced nim . 
His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow . 
But still , as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him , he often spoke about him and about his love for him , letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand , and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor , who was spoken of as the `` angel incarnate . '' 
During Rostov 's short stay in Moscow , before rejoining the army , he did not draw closer to Sonya , but rather drifted away from her . 
She was very pretty and sweet , and evidently deeply in love with him , but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things . 
When he thought of Sonya , during this stay in Moscow , he said to himself , `` Ah , there will be , and there are , many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know . 
There will be time enough to think about love when I want to , but now I have no time . '' 
Besides , it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood . 
He went to balls and into ladies ' society with an affectation of doing so against his will . 
The races , the English Club , sprees with Denisov , and visits to a certain house -- that was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar ! 
At the beginning of March , old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club . 
The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown , giving orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist , the Club 's head cook , about asparagus , fresh cucumbers , strawberries , veal , and fish for this dinner . 
The count had been a member and on the committee of the Club from the day it was founded . 
To him the Club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration , for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed , hospitable scale , and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete . 
The club cook and the steward listened to the count 's orders with pleased faces , for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles . 
`` Well then , mind and have cocks ' comb in the turtle soup , you know ! '' 
`` Shall we have three cold dishes then ? '' 
asked the cook . 
The count considered . 
`` We ca n't have less -- yes , three ... the mayonnaise , that 's one , '' said he , bending down a finger . 
`` Then am I to order those large sterlets ? '' 
asked the steward . 
`` Yes , it ca n't be helped if they wo n't take less . 
Ah , dear me ! 
I was forgetting . 
We must have another entree . 
Ah , goodness gracious ! '' 
he clutched at his head . 
`` Who is going to get me the flowers ? 
Dmitri ! 
Eh , Dmitri ! 
Gallop off to our Moscow estate , '' he said to the factotum who appeared at his call . 
`` Hurry off and tell Maksim , the gardener , to set the serfs to work . 
Say that everything out of the hothouses must be brought here well wrapped up in felt . 
I must have two hundred pots here on Friday . '' 
Having given several more orders , he was about to go to his `` little countess '' to have a rest , but remembering something else of importance , he returned again , called back the cook and the club steward , and again began giving orders . 
A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door , and the young count , handsome , rosy , with a dark little mustache , evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow , entered the room . 
`` Ah , my boy , my head 's in a whirl ! '' 
said the old man with a smile , as if he felt a little confused before his son . 
`` Now , if you would only help a bit ! 
I must have singers too . 
I shall have my own orchestra , but should n't we get the gypsy singers as well ? 
You military men like that sort of thing . '' 
`` Really , Papa , I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less before the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now , '' said his son with a smile . 
The old count pretended to be angry . 
`` Yes , you talk , but try it yourself ! '' 
And the count turned to the cook , who , with a shrewd and respectful expression , looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son . 
`` What have the young people come to nowadays , eh , Feoktist ? '' 
said he . 
`` Laughing at us old fellows ! '' 
`` That 's so , your excellency , all they have to do is to eat a good dinner , but providing it and serving it all up , that 's not their business ! '' 
`` That 's it , that 's it ! '' 
exclaimed the count , and gaily seizing his son by both hands , he cried , `` Now I 've got you , so take the sleigh and pair at once , and go to Bezukhob 's , and tell him ` Count Ilya has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples . ' 
We ca n't get them from anyone else . 
He 's not there himself , so you 'll have to go in and ask the princesses ; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay -- the coachman Ipatka knows -- and look up the gypsy Ilyushka , the one who danced at Count Orlov 's , you remember , in a white Cossack coat , and bring him along to me . '' 
`` And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him ? '' 
asked Nicholas , laughing . 
`` Dear , dear ! 
... '' At that moment , with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike , preoccupied , yet meekly Christian look which never left her face , Anna Mikhaylovna entered the hall . 
Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day , he invariably became confused and begged her to excuse his costume . 
`` No matter at all , my dear count , '' she said , meekly closing her eyes . 
`` But I 'll go to Bezukhov 's myself . 
Pierre has arrived , and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses . 
I have to see him in any case . 
He has forwarded me a letter from Boris . 
Thank God , Boris is now on the staff . '' 
The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna 's taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her . 
`` Tell Bezukhov to come . 
I 'll put his name down . 
Is his wife with him ? '' 
he asked . 
Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes , and profound sadness was depicted on her face . 
`` Ah , my dear friend , he is very unfortunate , '' she said . 
`` If what we hear is true , it is dreadful . 
How little we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness ! 
And such a lofty angelic soul as young Bezukhov ! 
Yes , I pity him from my heart , and shall try to give him what consolation I can . '' 
`` Wh-what is the matter ? '' 
asked both the young and old Rostov . 
Anna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply . 
`` Dolokhov , Mary Ivanovna 's son , '' she said in a mysterious whisper , `` has compromised her completely , they say . 
Pierre took him up , invited him to his house in Petersburg , and now ... she has come here and that daredevil after her ! '' 
said Anna Mikhaylovna , wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre , but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the `` daredevil , '' as she called Dolokhov . 
`` They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune . '' 
`` Dear , dear ! 
But still tell him to come to the Club -- it will all blow over . 
It will be a tremendous banquet . '' 
Next day , the third of March , soon after one o'clock , two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign , Prince Bagration , to dinner . 
On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz , Moscow had been bewildered . 
At that time , the Russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it , while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event . 
In the English Club , where all who were distinguished , important , and well informed forgathered when the news began to arrive in December , nothing was said about the war and the last battle , as though all were in a conspiracy of silence . 
The men who set the tone in conversation -- Count Rostopchin , Prince Yuri Dolgorukov , Valuev , Count Markov , and Prince Vyazemski -- did not show themselves at the Club , but met in private houses in intimate circles , and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others -- Ilya Rostov among them -- remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders . 
The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult , and so it was best to be silent . 
But after a while , just as a jury comes out of its room , the bigwigs who guided the Club 's opinion reappeared , and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely . 
Reasons were found for the incredible , unheard-of , and impossible event of a Russian defeat , everything became clear , and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be said . 
These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians , a defective commissariat , the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and of the Frenchman Langeron , Kutuzov 's incapacity , and -LRB- it was whispered -RRB- the youth and inexperience of the sovereign , who had trusted worthless and insignificant people . 
But the army , the Russian army , everyone declared , was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor . 
The soldiers , officers , and generals were heroes . 
But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration , distinguished by his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz , where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own . 
What also conduced to Bagration 's being selected as Moscow 's hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there . 
In his person , honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues , and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov . 
Moreover , paying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of Kutuzov . 
`` Had there been no Bagration , it would have been necessary to invent him , '' said the wit Shinshin , parodying the words of Voltaire . 
Kutuzov no one spoke of , except some who abused him in whispers , calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr . 
All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov 's saying : `` If you go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay , '' suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories ; and the words of Rostopchin , that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words , and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance , but that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back ! 
On all sides , new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz . 
One had saved a standard , another had killed five Frenchmen , a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded . 
Berg was mentioned , by those who did not know him , as having , when wounded in the right hand , taken his sword in the left , and gone forward . 
Of Bolkonski , nothing was said , and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young , leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father . 
On that third of March , all the rooms in the English Club were filled with a hum of conversation , like the hum of bees swarming in springtime . 
The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and thither , sat , stood , met , and separated , some in uniform and some in evening dress , and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans . 
Powdered footmen , in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings , stood at every door anxiously noting visitors ' every movement in order to offer their services . 
Most of those present were elderly , respected men with broad , self-confident faces , fat fingers , and resolute gestures and voices . 
This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups . 
A minority of those present were casual guests -- chiefly young men , among whom were Denisov , Rostov , and Dolokhov -- who was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment . 
The faces of these young people , especially those who were militarymen , bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation , `` We are prepared to respect and honor you , but all the same remember that the future belongs to us . '' 
Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club . 
Pierre , who at his wife 's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles , went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull . 
Here , as elsewhere , he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth , and being in the habit of lording it over these people , he treated them with absent-minded contempt . 
By his age he should have belonged to the younger men , but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored guests , and so he went from one group to another . 
Some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men . 
The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin , Valuev , and Naryshkin . 
Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets . 
Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz . 
In the third circle , Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals . 
Shinshin , standing close by , tried to make a joke , saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed to learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock , but the elder members glanced severely at the wit , making him feel that in that place and on that day , it was improper to speak so of Kutuzov . 
Count Ilya Rostov , hurried and preoccupied , went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms , hastily greeting the important and unimportant , all of whom he knew , as if they were all equals , while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son , resting on him and winking joyfully at him . 
Young Rostov stood at a window with Dolokhov , whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued . 
The old count came up to them and pressed Dolokhov 's hand . 
`` Please come and visit us ... you know my brave boy ... been together out there ... both playing the hero ... Ah , Vasili Ignatovich ... How d'ye do , old fellow ? '' 
he said , turning to an old man who was passing , but before he had finished his greeting there was a general stir , and a footman who had run in announced , with a frightened face : `` He 's arrived ! '' 
Bells rang , the stewards rushed forward , and -- like rye shaken together in a shovel -- the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom . 
Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword , which , in accord with the Club custom , he had given up to the hall porter . 
He had no lambskin cap on his head , nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder , as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz , but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders , and the Star of St. George on his left breast . 
Evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed , which changed his appearance for the worse . 
There was something naively festive in his air , which , in conjunction with his firm and virile features , gave him a rather comical expression . 
Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov , who had arrived with him , paused at the doorway to allow him , as the guest of honor , to enter first . 
Bagration was embarrassed , not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy , and this caused some delay at the doors , but after all he did at last enter first . 
He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room , not knowing what to do with his hands ; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire , as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern -- and he would have found that easier . 
The committeemen met him at the first door and , expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest , took possession of him as it were , without waiting for his reply , surrounded him , and led him to the drawing room . 
It was at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration over each other 's shoulders , as if he were some rare animal . 
Count Ilya Rostov , laughing and repeating the words , `` Make way , dear boy ! 
Make way , make way ! '' 
pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone , led the guests into the drawing room , and seated them on the center sofa . 
The bigwigs , the most respected members of the Club , beset the new arrivals . 
Count Ilya , again thrusting his way through the crowd , went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman , carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagration . 
On the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero 's honor . 
Bagration , on seeing the salver , glanced around in dismay , as though seeking help . 
But all eyes demanded that he should submit . 
Feeling himself in their power , he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him . 
Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration -LRB- or he would , it seemed , have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it -RRB- and drew his attention to the verses . 
`` Well , I will read them , then ! '' 
Bagration seemed to say , and , fixing his weary eyes on the paper , began to read them with a fixed and serious expression . 
But the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud . 
Bagration bowed his bead and listened : Bring glory then to Alexander 's reign And on the throne our Titus shield . 
A dreaded foe be thou , kindhearted as a man , A Rhipheus at home , a Caesar in the field ! 
E'en fortunate Napoleon Knows by experience , now , Bagration , And dare not Herculean Russians trouble ... But before he had finished reading , a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner was ready ! 
The door opened , and from the dining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise : Conquest 's joyful thunder waken , Triumph , valiant Russians , now ! 
... and Count Rostov , glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his verses , bowed to Bagration . 
Everyone rose , feeling that dinner was more important than verses , and Bagration , again preceding all the rest , went in to dinner . 
He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders -- Bekleshev and Naryshkin -- which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign . 
Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room , according to their rank and importance : the more important nearer to the honored guest , as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest . 
Just before dinner , Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to Bagration , who recognized him and said a few words to him , disjointed and awkward , as were all the words he spoke that day , and Count Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son . 
Nicholas Rostov , with Denisov and his new acquaintance , Dolokhov , sat almost at the middle of the table . 
Facing them sat Pierre , beside Prince Nesvitski . 
Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of the committee sat facing Bagration and , as the very personification of Moscow hospitality , did the honors to the prince . 
His efforts had not been in vain . 
The dinner , both the Lenten and the other fare , was splendid , yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the meal . 
He winked at the butler , whispered directions to the footmen , and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety . 
Everything was excellent . 
With the second course , a gigantic sterlet -LRB- at sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with self-conscious pleasure -RRB- , the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses . 
After the fish , which made a certain sensation , the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen . 
`` There will be many toasts , it 's time to begin , '' he whispered , and taking up his glass , he rose . 
All were silent , waiting for what he would say . 
`` To the health of our Sovereign , the Emperor ! '' 
he cried , and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm . 
The band immediately struck up `` Conquest 's joyful thunder waken ... '' All rose and cried `` Hurrah ! '' 
Bagration also rose and shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon Grabern . 
Young Rostov 's ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred others . 
He nearly wept . 
`` To the health of our Sovereign , the Emperor ! '' 
he roared , `` Hurrah ! '' 
and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor . 
Many followed his example , and the loud shouting continued for a long time . 
When the voices subsided , the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again , smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks . 
The old count rose once more , glanced at a note lying beside his plate , and proposed a toast , `` To the health of the hero of our last campaign , Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration ! '' 
and again his blue eyes grew moist . 
`` Hurrah ! '' 
cried the three hundred voices again , but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov : Russians ! 
O'er all barriers on ! 
Courage conquest guarantees ; Have we not Bagration ? 
He brings foe men to their knees , ... etc. . 
As soon as the singing was over , another and another toast was proposed and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved , more glass was smashed , and the shouting grew louder . 
They drank to Bekleshev , Naryshkin , Uvarov , Dolgorukov , Apraksin , Valuev , to the committee , to all the Club members and to all the Club guests , and finally to Count Ilya Rostov separately , as the organizer of the banquet . 
At that toast , the count took out his handkerchief and , covering his face , wept outright . 
Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov . 
As usual , he ate and drank much , and eagerly . 
But those who knew him intimately noticed that some great change had come over him that day . 
He was silent all through dinner and looked about , blinking and scowling , or , with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness , kept rubbing the bridge of his nose . 
His face was depressed and gloomy . 
He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem . 
The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess , his cousin , at Moscow , concerning Dolokhov 's intimacy with his wife , and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning , which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles , but that his wife 's connection with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself . 
Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess ' hints and the letter , but he feared now to look at Dolokhov , who was sitting opposite him . 
Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov 's handsome insolent eyes , Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away . 
Involuntarily recalling his wife 's past and her relations with Dolokhov , Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true , or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife . 
He involuntarily remembered how Dolokhov , who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign , had returned to Petersburg and come to him . 
Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion , Dolokhov had come straight to his house , and Pierre had put him up and lent him money . 
Pierre recalled how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov 's living at their house , and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife 's beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day . 
`` Yes , he is very handsome , '' thought Pierre , `` and I know him . 
It would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me , just because I have exerted myself on his behalf , befriended him , and helped him . 
I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of deceiving me , if it really were true . 
Yes , if it were true , but I do not believe it . 
I have no right to , and ca n't , believe it . '' 
He remembered the expression Dolokhov 's face assumed in his moments of cruelty , as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water , or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason , or shot a post-boy 's horse with a pistol . 
That expression was often on Dolokhov 's face when looking at him . 
`` Yes , he is a bully , '' thought Pierre , `` to kill a man means nothing to him . 
It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him , and that must please him . 
He must think that I , too , am afraid of him -- and in fact I am afraid of him , '' he thought , and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul . 
Dolokhov , Denisov , and Rostov were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay . 
Rostov was talking merrily to his two friends , one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake , and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre , whose preoccupied , absent-minded , and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner . 
Rostov looked inimically at Pierre , first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian , the husband of a beauty , and in a word -- an old woman ; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had not responded to his greeting . 
When the Emperor 's health was drunk , Pierre , lost in thought , did not rise or lift his glass . 
`` What are you about ? '' 
shouted Rostov , looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation . 
`` Do n't you hear it 's His Majesty the Emperor 's health ? '' 
Pierre sighed , rose submissively , emptied his glass , and , waiting till all were seated again , turned with his kindly smile to Rostov . 
`` Why , I did n't recognize you ! '' 
he said . 
But Rostov was otherwise engaged ; he was shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
`` Why do n't you renew the acquaintance ? '' 
said Dolokhov to Rostov . 
`` Confound him , he 's a fool ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` One should make up to the husbands of pretty women , '' said Denisov . 
Pierre did not catch what they were saying , but knew they were talking about him . 
He reddened and turned away . 
`` Well , now to the health of handsome women ! '' 
said Dolokhov , and with a serious expression , but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth , he turned with his glass to Pierre . 
`` Here 's to the health of lovely women , Peterkin -- and their lovers ! '' 
he added . 
Pierre , with downcast eyes , drank out of his glass without looking at Dolokhov or answering him . 
The footman , who was distributing leaflets with Kutuzov 's cantata , laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests . 
He was just going to take it when Dolokhov , leaning across , snatched it from his hand and began reading it . 
Pierre looked at Dolokhov and his eyes dropped , the something terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him . 
He leaned his whole massive body across the table . 
`` How dare you take it ? '' 
he shouted . 
Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed , Nesvitski and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov . 
`` Do n't ! 
Do n't ! 
What are you about ? '' 
whispered their frightened voices . 
Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear , mirthful , cruel eyes , and that smile of his which seemed to say , `` Ah ! 
This is what I like ! '' 
`` You sha n't have it ! '' 
he said distinctly . 
Pale , with quivering lips , Pierre snatched the copy . 
`` You ... ! 
you ... scoundrel ! 
I challenge you ! '' 
he ejaculated , and , pushing back his chair , he rose from the table . 
At the very instant he did this and uttered those words , Pierre felt that the question of his wife 's guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative . 
He hated her and was forever sundered from her . 
Despite Denisov 's request that he would take no part in the matter , Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov 's second , and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesvitski , Bezukhov 's second . 
Pierre went home , but Rostov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed on at the Club till late , listening to the gypsies and other singers . 
`` Well then , till tomorrow at Sokolniki , '' said Dolokhov , as he took leave of Rostov in the Club porch . 
`` And do you feel quite calm ? '' 
Rostov asked . 
Dolokhov paused . 
`` Well , you see , I 'll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words . 
If you are going to fight a duel , and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents , and if you think you may be killed , you are a fool and are lost for certain . 
But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible , and then all will be right , as our bear huntsman at Kostroma used to tell me . 
` Everyone fears a bear , ' he says , ` but when you see one your fear 's all gone , and your only thought is not to let him get away ! ' 
And that 's how it is with me . 
A demain , mon cher . '' 
* * Till tomorrow , my dear fellow . 
Next day , at eight in the morning , Pierre and Nesvitski drove to the Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov , Denisov , and Rostov already there . 
Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand . 
His haggard face was yellow . 
He had evidently not slept that night . 
He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun . 
He was entirely absorbed by two considerations : his wife 's guilt , of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt , and the guiltlessness of Dolokhov , who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him ... `` I should perhaps have done the same thing in his place , '' thought Pierre . 
`` It 's even certain that I should have done the same , then why this duel , this murder ? 
Either I shall kill him , or he will hit me in the head , or elbow , or knee . 
Ca n't I go away from here , run away , bury myself somewhere ? '' 
passed through his mind . 
But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him , he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way , which inspired the respect of the onlookers , `` Will it be long ? 
Are things ready ? '' 
When all was ready , the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers , and the pistols loaded , Nesvitski went up to Pierre . 
`` I should not be doing my duty , Count , '' he said in timid tones , `` and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second , if at this grave , this very grave , moment I did not tell you the whole truth . 
I think there is no sufficient ground for this affair , or for blood to be shed over it ... . 
You were not right , not quite in the right , you were impetuous ... '' `` Oh yes , it is horribly stupid , '' said Pierre . 
`` Then allow me to express your regrets , and I am sure your opponent will accept them , '' said Nesvitski -LRB- who like the others concerned in the affair , and like everyone in similar cases , did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel -RRB- . 
`` You know , Count , it is much more honorable to admit one 's mistake than to let matters become irreparable . 
There was no insult on either side . 
Allow me to convey ... '' `` No ! 
What is there to talk about ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` It 's all the same ... . 
Is everything ready ? '' 
he added . 
`` Only tell me where to go and where to shoot , '' he said with an unnaturally gentle smile . 
He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger , as he had not before held a pistol in his hand -- a fact that he did not to confess . 
`` Oh yes , like that , I know , I only forgot , '' said he . 
`` No apologies , none whatever , '' said Dolokhov to Denisov -LRB- who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation -RRB- , and he also went up to the appointed place . 
The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road , where the sleighs had been left , in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow , the frost having begun to break up during the last few days . 
The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing . 
The seconds , measuring the paces , left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvitski 's and Dolokhov 's sabers , which were stuck intothe ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier . 
It was thawing and misty ; at forty paces ' distance nothing could be seen . 
For three minutes all had been ready , but they still delayed and all were silent . 
`` Well begin ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
`` All right , '' said Pierre , still smiling in the same way . 
A feeling of dread was in the air . 
It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of men 's will . 
Denisov first went to the barrier and announced : `` As the adve ` sawies have wefused a weconciliation , please pwoceed . 
Take your pistols , and at the word thwee begin to advance . 
`` O-ne ! 
T-wo ! 
Thwee ! '' 
he shouted angrily and stepped aside . 
The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks , nearer and nearer to one another , beginning to see one another through the mist . 
They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier . 
Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol , looking intently with his bright , sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist 's face . 
His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile . 
`` So I can fire when I like ! '' 
said Pierre , and at the word `` three , '' he went quickly forward , missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow . 
He held the pistol in his right hand at arm 's length , apparently afraid of shooting himself with it . 
His left hand he held carefully back , because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so . 
Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow , Pierre looked down at his feet , then quickly glanced at Dolokhov and , bending his finger as he had been shown , fired . 
Not at all expecting so loud a report , Pierre shuddered at the sound and then , smiling at his own sensations , stood still . 
The smoke , rendered denser by the mist , prevented him from seeing anything for an instant , but there was no second report as he had expected . 
He only heard Dolokhov 's hurried steps , and his figure came in view through the smoke . 
He was pressing one hand to his left side , while the other clutched his drooping pistol . 
His face was pale . 
Rostov ran toward him and said something . 
`` No-o-o ! '' 
muttered Dolokhov through his teeth , `` no , it 's not over . '' 
And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber , he sank on the snow beside it . 
His left hand was bloody ; he wiped it on his coat and supported himself with it . 
His frowning face was pallid and quivered . 
`` Plea ... '' began Dolokhov , but could not at first pronounce the word . 
`` Please , '' he uttered with an effort . 
Pierre , hardly restraining his sobs , began running toward Dolokhov and was about to cross the space between the barriers , when Dolokhov cried : `` To your barrier ! '' 
and Pierre , grasping what was meant , stopped by his saber . 
Only ten paces divided them . 
Dolokhov lowered his head to the snow , greedily bit at it , again raised his head , adjusted himself , drew in his legs and sat up , seeking a firm center of gravity . 
He sucked and swallowed the cold snow , his lips quivered but his eyes , still smiling , glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength . 
He raised his pistol and aimed . 
`` Sideways ! 
Cover yourself with your pistol ! '' 
ejaculated Nesvitski . 
`` Cover yourself ! '' 
even Denisov cried to his adversary . 
Pierre , with a gentle smile of pity and remorse , his arms and legs helplessly spread out , stood with his broad chest directly facing Dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him . 
Denisov , Rostov , and Nesvitski closed their eyes . 
At the same instant they heard a report and Dolokhov 's angry cry . 
`` Missed ! '' 
shouted Dolokhov , and he lay helplessly , face downwards on the snow . 
Pierre clutched his temples , and turning round went into the forest , trampling through the deep snow , and muttering incoherent words : `` Folly ... folly ! 
Death ... lies ... '' he repeated , puckering his face . 
Nesvitski stopped him and took him home . 
Rostov and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dolokhov . 
The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him . 
But on entering Moscow he suddenly came to and , lifting his head with an effort , took Rostov , who was sitting beside him , by the hand . 
Rostov was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dolokhov 's face . 
`` Well ? 
How do you feel ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Bad ! 
But it 's not that , my friend - '' said Dolokhov with a gasping voice . 
`` Where are we ? 
In Moscow , I know . 
I do n't matter , but I have killed her , killed ... She wo n't get over it ! 
She wo n't survive ... '' `` Who ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` My mother ! 
My mother , my angel , my adored angel mother , '' and Dolokhov pressed Rostov 's hand and burst into tears . 
When he had become a little quieter , he explained to Rostov that he was living with his mother , who , if she saw him dying , would not survive it . 
He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her . 
Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked , and to his great surprise learned that Dolokhov the brawler , Dolokhov the bully , lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister , and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers . 
Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone . 
Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors . 
The night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but , as he often did , remained in his father 's room , that huge room in which Count Bezukhov had died . 
He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had happened to him , but could not do so . 
Such a storm of feelings , thoughts , and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep , nor even remain in one place , but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps . 
Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage , with bare shoulders and a languid , passionate look on her face , and then immediately he saw beside her Dolokhov 's handsome , insolent , hard , and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet , and then that same face pale , quivering , and suffering , as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow . 
`` What has happened ? '' 
he asked himself . 
`` I have killed her lover , yes , killed my wife 's lover . 
Yes , that was it ! 
And why ? 
How did I come to do it ? '' 
-- `` Because you married her , '' answered an inner voice . 
`` But in what was I to blame ? '' 
he asked . 
`` In marrying her without loving her ; in deceiving yourself and her . '' 
And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vasili 's , when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter : `` I love you . '' 
`` It all comes from that ! 
Even then I felt it , '' he thought . 
`` I felt then that it was not so , that I had no right to do it . 
And so it turns out . '' 
He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection . 
Particularly vivid , humiliating , and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there , who , bowing respectfully , looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly , as if expressing respectful understanding of his employer 's happiness . 
`` But how often I have felt proud of her , proud of her majestic beauty and social tact , '' thought he ; `` been proud of my house , in which she received all Petersburg , proud of her unapproachability and beauty . 
So this is what I was proud of ! 
I then thought that I did not understand her . 
How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her , for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires , and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman . 
Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear . 
`` Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders . 
She did not give him the money , but let herself be kissed . 
Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy , and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous : ` Let him do what he pleases , ' she used to say of me . 
One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy . 
She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children , and that she was not going to have any children by me . '' 
Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her , though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles . 
`` I 'm not such a fool ... . 
Just you try it on ... . 
Allez-vous promener , '' * she used to say . 
Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her . 
* `` You clear out of this . '' 
`` Yes , I never loved her , '' said he to himself ; `` I knew she was a depraved woman , '' he repeated , `` but dared not admit it to myself . 
And now there 's Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying , while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado ! '' 
Pierre was one of those people who , in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character , do not seek a confidant in their troubles . 
He digested his sufferings alone . 
`` It is all , all her fault , '' he said to himself ; `` but what of that ? 
Why did I bind myself to her ? 
Why did I say ` Je vous aime ' * to her , which was a lie , and worse than a lie ? 
I am guilty and must endure ... what ? 
A slur on my name ? 
A misfortune for life ? 
Oh , that 's nonsense , '' he thought . 
`` The slur on my name and honor -- that 's all apart from myself . 
* I love you . 
`` Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal , '' came into Pierre 's head , `` and from their point of view they were right , as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr 's death for his sake . 
Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot . 
Who is right and who is wrong ? 
No one ! 
But if you are alive - live : tomorrow you 'll die as I might have died an hour ago . 
And is it worth tormenting oneself , when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity ? '' 
But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections , she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her , and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his hand . 
`` Why did I tell her that ` Je vous aime ' ? '' 
he kept repeating to himself . 
And when he had said it for the tenth time , Molibre 's words : `` Mais que diable alloit-il faire dans cette galere ? '' 
occurred to him , and he began to laugh at himself . 
In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to Petersburg . 
He could not imagine how he could speak to her now . 
He resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from her forever . 
Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee , Pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand . 
He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression , unable to realize where he was . 
`` The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home , '' said the valet . 
But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send , the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair -LRB- two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet -RRB- entered the room , calm and majestic , except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow . 
With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet . 
She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it . 
She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room . 
Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles , and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies , he tried to continue reading . 
But feeling this to be senseless and impossible , he again glanced timidly at her . 
She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile , waiting for the valet to go . 
`` Well , what 's this now ? 
What have you been up to now , I should like to know ? '' 
she asked sternly . 
`` I ? 
What have I. . . ? '' 
stammered Pierre . 
`` So it seems you 're a hero , eh ? 
Come now , what was this duel about ? 
What is it meant to prove ? 
What ? 
I ask you . '' 
Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth , but could not reply . 
`` If you wo n't answer , I 'll tell you ... '' Helene went on . 
`` You believe everything you 're told . 
You were told ... '' Helene laughed , `` that Dolokhov was my lover , '' she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech , uttering the word amant as casually as any other word , `` and you believed it ! 
Well , what have you proved ? 
What does this duel prove ? 
That you 're a fool , que vous etes un sot , but everybody knew that . 
What will be the result ? 
That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow , that everyone will say that you , drunk and not knowing what you were about , challenged a man you are jealous of without cause . '' 
Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited , `` A man who 's a better man than you in every way ... '' `` Hm ... Hm ... ! '' 
growled Pierre , frowning without looking at her , and not moving a muscle . 
`` And how could you believe he was my lover ? 
Why ? 
Because I like his company ? 
If you were cleverer and more agreeable , I should prefer yours . '' 
`` Do n't speak to me ... I beg you , '' muttered Pierre hoarsely . 
`` Why should n't I speak ? 
I can speak as I like , and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers -LRB- des amants -RRB- , but I have not done so , '' said she . 
Pierre wished to say something , looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she did not understand , and lay down again . 
He was suffering physically at that moment , there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe . 
He knew that he must do something to put an end to this suffering , but what he wanted to do was too terrible .
