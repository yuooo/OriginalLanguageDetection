Princess Mary lowered her eyes and , tripping over her skirt , came close up to them . 
So many different eyes , old and young , were fixed on her , and there were so many different faces , that she could not distinguish any of them and , feeling that she must speak to them all at once , did not know how to do it . 
But again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage , and she boldly began her speech . 
`` I am very glad you have come , '' she said without raising her eyes , and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently . 
`` Dronushka tells me that the war has ruined you . 
That is our common misfortune , and I shall grudge nothing to help you . 
I am myself going away because it is dangerous here ... the enemy is near ... because ... I am giving you everything , my friends , and I beg you to take everything , all our grain , so that you may not suffer want ! 
And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here -- that is not true . 
On the contrary , I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow , and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing . 
You shall be given food and lodging . '' 
The princess stopped . 
Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd . 
`` I am not doing this on my own account , '' she continued , `` I do it in the name of my dead father , who was a good master to you , and of my brother and his son . '' 
Again she paused . 
No one broke the silence . 
`` Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together . 
All that is mine is yours , '' she concluded , scanning the faces before her . 
All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression . 
She could not fathom whether it was curiosity , devotion , gratitude , or apprehension and distrust -- but the expression on all the faces was identical . 
`` We are all very thankful for your bounty , but it wo n't do for us to take the landlord 's grain , '' said a voice at the back of the crowd . 
`` But why not ? '' 
asked the princess . 
No one replied and Princess Mary , looking round at the crowd , found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped . 
`` But why do n't you want to take it ? '' 
she asked again . 
No one answered . 
The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone 's eye . 
`` Why do n't you speak ? '' 
she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick . 
`` If you think something more is wanted , tell me ! 
I will do anything , '' said she , catching his eye . 
But as if this angered him , he bent his head quite low and muttered : `` Why should we agree ? 
We do n't want the grain . '' 
`` Why should we give up everything ? 
We do n't agree . 
Do n't agree ... . 
We are sorry for you , but we 're not willing . 
Go away yourself , alone ... '' came from various sides of the crowd . 
And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression , though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude , but of angry resolve . 
`` But you ca n't have understood me , '' said Princess Mary with a sad smile . 
`` Why do n't you want to go ? 
I promise to house and feed you , while here the enemy would ruin you ... '' But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd . 
`` We 're not willing . 
Let them ruin us ! 
We wo n't take your grain . 
We do n't agree . '' 
Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone 's eye , but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her ; evidently they were all trying to avoid her look . 
She felt strange and awkward . 
`` Oh yes , an artful tale ! 
Follow her into slavery ! 
Pull down your houses and go into bondage ! 
I dare say ! 
` I 'll give you grain , indeed ! ' 
she says , '' voices in the crowd were heard saying . 
With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the house . 
Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning , she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts . 
For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants ' voices that reached her from the village , but it was not of them she was thinking . 
She felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them . 
She thought only of one thing , her sorrow , which , after the break caused by cares for the present , seemed already to belong to the past . 
Now she could remember it and weep or pray . 
After sunset the wind had dropped . 
The night was calm and fresh . 
Toward midnight the voices began to subside , a cock crowed , the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees , a fresh white dewy mist began to rise , and stillness reigned over the village and the house . 
Pictures of the near past -- her father 's illness and last moments - rose one after another to her memory . 
With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images , repelling with horror only the last one , the picture of his death , which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night . 
And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present , now past , and now future . 
She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills , muttering something with his helpless tongue , twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her . 
`` Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died , '' she thought . 
`` He had always thought what he said then . '' 
And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke , when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will . 
She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe , and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door . 
In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to Tikhon , speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress . 
Evidently he had wanted to talk . 
`` And why did n't he call me ? 
Why did n't he let me be there instead of Tikhon ? '' 
Princess Mary had thought and thought again now . 
`` Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul . 
Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say , and not Tikhon but I might have heard and understood him . 
Why did n't I enter the room ? '' 
she thought . 
`` Perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died . 
While talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice . 
He wanted to see me , and I was standing close by , outside the door . 
It was sad and painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him . 
I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive -- he had forgotten she was dead -- and Tikhon reminded him that she was no more , and he shouted , ` Fool ! ' 
He was greatly depressed . 
From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed , ` My God ! ' 
Why did n't I go in then ? 
What could he have done to me ? 
What could I have lost ? 
And perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me . '' 
And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death . 
`` Dear-est ! '' 
she repeated , and began sobbing , with tears that relieved her soul . 
She now saw his face before her . 
And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance , but the timid , feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely , with all its wrinkles and details , when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said . 
`` Dear-est ! '' 
she repeated again . 
`` What was he thinking when he uttered that word ? 
What is he thinking now ? '' 
This question suddenly presented itself to her , and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief . 
And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he , but something mysterious and horrible , seized her again . 
She tried to think of something else and to pray , but could do neither . 
With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows , expecting every moment to see his dead face , and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast . 
`` Dunyasha , '' she whispered . 
`` Dunyasha ! '' 
she screamed wildly , and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants ' quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her . 
On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin , accompanied by Lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly , left their quarters at Yankovo , ten miles from Bogucharovo , and went for a ride -- to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages . 
For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile armies , so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as for the French vanguard ; Rostov , as a careful squadron commander , wished to take such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo before the French could get them . 
Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods . 
On the way to Bogucharovo , a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls , they questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories , and raced one another to try Ilyin 's horse . 
Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister . 
Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching Bogucharovo , and Rostov , outstripping Ilyin , was the first to gallop into the village street . 
`` You 're first ! '' 
cried Ilyin , flushed . 
`` Yes , always first both on the grassland and here , '' answered Rostov , stroking his heated Donets horse . 
`` And I 'd have won on my Frenchy , your excellency , '' said Lavrushka from behind , alluding to his shabby cart horse , `` only I did n't wish to mortify you . '' 
They rode at a footpace to the barn , where a large crowd of peasants was standing . 
Some of the men bared their heads , others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps . 
Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern , smiling , staggering , and singing some incoherent song , and approached the officers . 
`` Fine fellows ! '' 
said Rostov laughing . 
`` Is there any hay here ? '' 
`` And how like one another , '' said Ilyin . 
`` A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa ... ! '' 
sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile . 
One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov . 
`` Who do you belong to ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The French , '' replied Ilyin jestingly , `` and here is Napoleon himself '' -- and he pointed to Lavrushka . 
`` Then you are Russians ? '' 
the peasant asked again . 
`` And is there a large force of you here ? '' 
said another , a short man , coming up . 
`` Very large , '' answered Rostov . 
`` But why have you collected here ? '' 
he added . 
`` Is it a holiday ? '' 
`` The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune , '' replied the peasant , moving away . 
At that moment , on the road leading from the big house , two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers . 
`` The one in pink is mine , so keep off ! '' 
said Ilyin on seeing Dunyasha running resolutely toward him . 
`` She 'll be ours ! '' 
said Lavrushka to Ilyin , winking . 
`` What do you want , my pretty ? '' 
said Ilyin with a smile . 
`` The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name . '' 
`` This is Count Rostov , squadron commander , and I am your humble servant . '' 
`` Co-o-om-pa-ny ! '' 
roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl . 
Following Dunyasha , Alpatych advanced to Rostov , having bared his head while still at a distance . 
`` May I make bold to trouble your honor ? '' 
said he respectfully , but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom . 
`` My mistress , daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month , finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people '' -- he pointed to the peasants -- `` asks you to come up to the house ... . 
Wo n't you , please , ride on a little farther , '' said Alpatych with a melancholy smile , `` as it is not convenient in the presence of ... ? '' 
He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse . 
`` Ah ! 
... Alpatych ... Ah , Yakov Alpatych ... Grand ! 
Forgive us for Christ 's sake , eh ? '' 
said the peasants , smiling joyfully at him . 
Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled . 
`` Or perhaps they amuse your honor ? '' 
remarked Alpatych with a staid air , as he pointed at the old men with his free hand . 
`` No , there 's not much to be amused at here , '' said Rostov , and rode on a little way . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here do n't wish to let the mistress leave the estate , and threaten to unharness her horses , so that though everything has been packed up since morning , her excellency can not get away . '' 
`` Impossible ! '' 
exclaimed Rostov . 
`` I have the honor to report to you the actual truth , '' said Alpatych . 
Rostov dismounted , gave his horse to the orderly , and followed Alpatych to the house , questioning him as to the state of affairs . 
It appeared that the princess ' offer of corn to the peasants the previous day , and her talk with Dron and at the meeting , had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent for him ; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey , the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village : that there was an order not to move , and that they would unharness the horses . 
Alpatych had gone out to admonish them , but was told -LRB- it was chiefly Karp who did the talking , Dron not showing himself in the crowd -RRB- that they could not let the princess go , that there was an order to the contrary , but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything . 
At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road , Princess Mary , despite the dissuasions of Alpatych , her nurse , and the maids , had given orders to harness and intended to start , but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen , the coachman ran away , and the women in the house began to wail . 
`` Father ! 
Benefactor ! 
God has sent you ! '' 
exclaimed deeply moved voices as Rostov passed through the anteroom . 
Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room , when Rostov was shown in . 
She could not grasp who he was and why he had come , or what was happening to her . 
When she saw his Russian face , and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class , she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion . 
This meeting immediately struck Rostov as a romantic event . 
`` A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief , left to the mercy of coarse , rioting peasants ! 
And what a strange fate sent me here ! 
What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression ! '' 
thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story . 
When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father 's funeral , her voiced trembled . 
She turned away , and then , as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity , looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry . 
There were tears in Rostov 's eyes . 
Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten . 
`` I can not express , Princess , how glad I am that I happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you , '' said Rostov , rising . 
`` Go when you please , and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort . '' 
And bowing respectfully , as if to a lady of royal blood , he moved toward the door . 
Rostov 's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her , he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her . 
Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy . 
`` I am very , very grateful to you , '' she said in French , `` but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it . '' 
She suddenly began to cry . 
`` Excuse me ! '' 
she said . 
Rostov , knitting his brows , left the room with another low bow . 
`` Well , is she pretty ? 
Ah , friend -- my pink one is delicious ; her name is Dunyasha ... '' But on glancing at Rostov 's face Ilyin stopped short . 
He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought . 
Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village . 
`` I 'll show them ; I 'll give it to them , the brigands ! '' 
said he to himself . 
Alpatych at a gliding trot , only just managing not to run , kept up with him with difficulty . 
`` What decision have you been pleased to come to ? '' 
said he . 
Rostov stopped and , clenching his fists , suddenly and sternly turned on Alpatych . 
`` Decision ? 
What decision ? 
Old dotard ! 
... '' cried he . 
`` What have you been about ? 
Eh ? 
The peasants are rioting , and you ca n't manage them ? 
You 're a traitor yourself ! 
I know you . 
I 'll flay you all alive ! 
... '' And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger , he left Alpatych and went rapidly forward . 
Alpatych , mastering his offended feelings , kept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views . 
He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to `` overresist '' them without an armed force , and would it not be better first to send for the military ? 
`` I 'll give them armed force ... I 'll ` overresist ' them ! '' 
uttered Rostov meaninglessly , breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it . 
Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick , resolute steps toward the crowd . 
And the nearer he drew to it the more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results . 
The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rostov 's rapid , firm steps and resolute , frowning face . 
After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see the princess , a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd . 
Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained . 
Dron was of this opinion , but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder . 
`` How many years have you been fattening on the commune ? '' 
Karp shouted at him . 
`` It 's all one to you ! 
You 'll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you ... . 
What does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not ? '' 
`` We 've been told to keep order , and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain , and that 's all about it ! '' 
cried another . 
`` It was your son 's turn to be conscripted , but no fear ! 
You begrudged your lump of a son , '' a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron -- `` and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier ! 
But we all have to die . '' 
`` To be sure , we all have to die . 
I 'm not against the commune , '' said Dron . 
`` That 's it -- not against it ! 
You 've filled your belly ... '' The two tall peasants had their say . 
As soon as Rostov , followed by Ilyin , Lavrushka , and Alpatych , came up to the crowd , Karp , thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little , walked to the front . 
Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together . 
`` Who is your Elder here ? 
Hey ? '' 
shouted Rostov , coming up to the crowd with quick steps . 
`` The Elder ? 
What do you want with him ? 
... '' asked Karp . 
But before the words were well out of his mouth , his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side . 
`` Caps off , traitors ! '' 
shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
he cried furiously . 
`` The Elder ... . 
He wants the Elder ! 
... Dron Zakharych , you ! '' 
meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads . 
`` We do n't riot , we 're following the orders , '' declared Karp , and at that moment several voices began speaking together . 
`` It 's as the old men have decided -- there 's too many of you giving orders . '' 
`` Arguing ? 
Mutiny ! 
... Brigands ! 
Traitors ! '' 
cried Rostov unmeaningly in a voice not his own , gripping Karp by the collar . 
`` Bind him , bind him ! '' 
he shouted , though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych . 
Lavrushka , however , ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind . 
`` Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill ? '' 
he called out . 
Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp . 
The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts . 
`` Where 's the Elder ? '' 
demanded Rostov in a loud voice . 
With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd . 
`` Are you the Elder ? 
Bind him , Lavrushka ! '' 
shouted Rostov , as if that order , too , could not possibly meet with any opposition . 
And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron , who took off his own belt and handed it to them , as if to aid them . 
`` And you all listen to me ! '' 
said Rostov to the peasants . 
`` Be off to your houses at once , and do n't let one of your voices be heard ! '' 
`` Why , we 've not done any harm ! 
We did it just out of foolishness . 
It 's all nonsense ... I said then that it was not in order , '' voices were heard bickering with one another . 
`` There ! 
What did I say ? '' 
said Alpatych , coming into his own again . 
`` It 's wrong , lads ! '' 
`` All our stupidity , Yakov Alpatych , '' came the answers , and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village . 
The two bound men were led off to the master 's house . 
The two drunken peasants followed them . 
`` Aye , when I look at you ! 
... '' said one of them to Karp . 
`` How can one talk to the masters like that ? 
What were you thinking of , you fool ? '' 
added the other -- `` A real fool ! '' 
Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the Bogucharovo house . 
The peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor 's goods and packing them on the carts , and Dron , liberated at Princess Mary 's wish from the cupboard where he had been confined , was standing in the yard directing the men . 
`` Do n't put it in so carelessly , '' said one of the peasants , a man with a round smiling face , taking a casket from a housemaid . 
`` You know it has cost money ! 
How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it 'll get rubbed ? 
I do n't like that way of doing things . 
Let it all be done properly , according to rule . 
Look here , put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay -- that 's the way ! '' 
`` Eh , books , books ! '' 
said another peasant , bringing out Prince Andrew 's library cupboards . 
`` Do n't catch up against it ! 
It 's heavy , lads -- solid books . '' 
`` Yes , they worked all day and did n't play ! '' 
remarked the tall , round-faced peasant gravely , pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top . 
Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess , Rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure . 
When her carriage drove out of the house , he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops . 
At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her , for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand . 
`` How can you speak so ! '' 
he blushingly replied to Princess Mary 's expressions of gratitude for her deliverance , as she termed what had occurred . 
`` Any police officer would have done as much ! 
If we had had only peasants to fight , we should not have let the enemy come so far , '' said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject . 
`` I am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance . 
Good-by , Princess . 
I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances . 
If you do n't want to make me blush , please do n't thank me ! '' 
But the princess , if she did not again thank him in words , thanked him with the whole expression of her face , radiant with gratitude and tenderness . 
She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for . 
On the contrary , it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French , and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her , and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul , able to understand her position and her sorrow . 
His kind , honest eyes , with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss , did leave her memory . 
When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears , and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her : did she love him ? 
On the rest of the way to Moscow , though the princess ' position was not a cheerful one , Dunyasha , who went with her in the carriage , more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow . 
`` Well , supposing I do love him ? '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her , she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if , without ever speaking of it to anyone , she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life . 
Sometimes when she recalled his looks , his sympathy , and his words , happiness did not appear impossible to her . 
It was at those moments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window . 
`` Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo , and at that very moment ? '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
`` And that caused his sister to refuse my brother ? '' 
And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence . 
The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one . 
To remember her gave him pleasure , and when his comrades , hearing of his adventure at Bogucharovo , rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia , he grew angry . 
It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary , who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune , had against his will more than once entered his head . 
For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife : by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy , would be able to put his father 's affairs in order , and would even -- he felt it - ensure Princess Mary 's happiness . 
But Sonya ? 
And his plighted word ? 
That was why Rostov grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya . 
On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters . 
Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day and at the very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time . 
He stopped in the village at the priest 's house in front of which stood the commander in chief 's carriage , and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness , as everyone now called Kutuzov . 
From the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
to the new commander in chief . 
Two orderlies , a courier and a major-domo , stood near by , some ten paces from Prince Andrew , availing themselves of Kutuzov 's absence and of the fine weather . 
A short , swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and , glancing at Prince Andrew , inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back . 
Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness ' staff but was himself a new arrival . 
The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly , who , with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief 's orderly speaks to officers , replied : `` What ? 
His Serene Highness ? 
I expect he 'll be here soon . 
What do you want ? '' 
The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly 's tone , dismounted , gave his horse to a dispatch runner , and approached Bolkonski with a slight bow . 
Bolkonski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him . 
`` You 're also waiting for the commander in chief ? '' 
said he . 
`` They say he weceives evewyone , thank God ! 
... It 's awful with those sausage eaters ! 
Ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German ! 
Now p ` waps Wussians will get a look in . 
As it was , devil only knows what was happening . 
We kept wetweating and wetweating . 
Did you take part in the campaign ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I had the pleasure , '' replied Prince Andrew , `` not only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear -- not to mention the estate and home of my birth -- my father , who died of grief . 
I belong to the province of Smolensk . '' 
`` Ah ? 
You 're Pwince Bolkonski ? 
Vewy glad to make your acquaintance ! 
I 'm Lieutenant Colonel Denisov , better known as ` Vaska , ' '' said Denisov , pressing Prince Andrew 's hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention . 
`` Yes , I heard , '' said he sympathetically , and after a short pause added : `` Yes , it 's Scythian warfare . 
It 's all vewy well -- only not for those who get it in the neck . 
So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkonski ? '' 
He swayed his head . 
`` Vewy pleased , Pwince , to make your acquaintance ! '' 
he repeated again , smiling sadly , and he again pressed Prince Andrew 's hand . 
Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her first suitor . 
This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately , but which still found place in his soul . 
Of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions -- such as the retreat from Smolensk , his visit to Bald Hills , and the recent news of his father 's death -- and had experienced so many emotions , that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind , and now that they did , they did not act on him with nearly their former strength . 
For Denisov , too , the memories awakened by the name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant , romantic past , when after supper and after Natasha 's singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing . 
He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for Natasha , and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively . 
This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat . 
He had proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kutuzov . 
The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation was too extended , and it proposed that instead of , or concurrently with , action on the front to bar the advance of the French , we should attack their line of communication . 
He began explaining his plan to Prince Andrew . 
`` They ca n't hold all that line . 
It 's impossible . 
I will undertake to bweak thwough . 
Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line , that 's certain ! 
There 's only one way -- guewilla warfare ! '' 
Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to Bolkonski . 
In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army , growing more incoherent and more diffused , mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held . 
Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village . 
`` He 's coming ! 
He 's coming ! '' 
shouted a Cossack standing at the gate . 
Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate , at which a knot of soldiers -LRB- a guard of honor -RRB- was standing , and they saw Kutuzov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse . 
A huge suite of generals rode behind him . 
Barclay was riding almost beside him , and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting , `` Hurrah ! '' 
His adjutants galloped into the yard before him . 
Kutuzov was impatiently urging on his horse , which ambled smoothly under his weight , and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard 's cap with a red band and no peak , nodding his head continually . 
When he came up to the guard of honor , a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations , who were giving him the salute , he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him . 
Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression , he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity . 
`` And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat ! 
Well , good-by , General , '' he added , and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and Denisov . 
`` Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
shouted those behind him . 
Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still more corpulent , flaccid , and fat . 
But the bleached eyeball , the scar , and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same . 
He was wearing the white Horse Guard 's cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap . 
He sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse . 
`` Whew ... whew ... whew ! '' 
he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard . 
His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony . 
He drew his left foot out of the stirrup and , lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort , raised it with difficulty onto the saddle , leaned on his knee , groaned , and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him . 
He pulled himself together , looked round , screwing up his eyes , glanced at Prince Andrew , and , evidently not recognizing him , moved with his waddling gait to the porch . 
`` Whew ... whew ... whew ! '' 
he whistled , and again glanced at Prince Andrew . 
As often occurs with old men , it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew 's face linked itself up with Kutuzov 's remembrance of his personality . 
`` Ah , how do you do , my dear prince ? 
How do you do , my dear boy ? 
Come along ... '' said he , glancing wearily round , and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight . 
He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch . 
`` And how 's your father ? '' 
`` I received news of his death , yesterday , '' replied Prince Andrew abruptly . 
Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself : `` May the kingdom of Heaven be his ! 
God 's will be done to us all ! '' 
He sighed deeply , his whole chest heaving , and was silent for a while . 
`` I loved him and respected him , and sympathize with you with all my heart . '' 
He embraced Prince Andrew , pressing him to his fat breast , and for some time did not let him go . 
When he released him Prince Andrew saw that Kutuzov 's flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes . 
He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself . 
`` Come ! 
Come with me , we 'll have a talk , '' said he . 
But at that moment Denisov , no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy , came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch , despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him . 
Kutuzov , his hands still pressed on the seat , glanced at him glumly . 
Denisov , having given his name , announced that he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their country 's welfare . 
Kutuzov looked wearily at him and , lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance , folded them across his stomach , repeating the words : `` For our country 's welfare ? 
Well , what is it ? 
Speak ! '' 
Denisov blushed like a girl -LRB- it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy , bibulous , time-worn face -RRB- and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy 's lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma . 
Denisov came from those parts and knew the country well . 
His plan seemed decidedly a good one , especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke . 
Kutuzov looked down at his own legs , occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it . 
And from that hut , while Denisov was speaking , a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear . 
`` What ? '' 
said Kutuzov , in the midst of Denisov 's explanations , `` are you ready so soon ? '' 
`` Ready , your Serene Highness , '' replied the general . 
Kutuzov swayed his head , as much as to say : `` How is one man to deal with it all ? '' 
and again listened to Denisov . 
`` I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer , '' said Denisov , `` that I can bweak Napoleon 's line of communication ! '' 
`` What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich Denisov ? '' 
asked Kutuzov , interrupting him . 
`` He is my uncle , your Sewene Highness . '' 
`` Ah , we were friends , '' said Kutuzov cheerfully . 
`` All right , all right , friend , stay here at the staff and tomorrow we 'll have a talk . '' 
With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers Konovnitsyn had brought him . 
`` Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside ? '' 
said the general on duty in a discontented voice , `` the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed . '' 
An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within . 
But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged . 
He made a grimace ... `` No , tell them to bring a small table out here , my dear boy . 
I 'll look at them here , '' said he . 
`` Do n't go away , '' he added , turning to Prince Andrew , who remained in the porch and listened to the general 's report . 
While this was being given , Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman 's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door . 
Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump , rosy , handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head , holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief . 
Kutuzov 's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was , and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt . 
`` Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church , and she intends to welcome him in the house ... . 
She 's very pretty , '' added the adjutant with a smile . 
At those words Kutuzov looked round . 
He was listening to the general 's report -- which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche -- as he had listened to Denisov , and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war . 
He evidently listened only because he had ears which , though there was a piece of tow in one of them , could not help hearing ; but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him , that he knew all that would be said beforehand , and heard it all only because he had to , as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer . 
All that Denisov had said was clever and to the point . 
What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point , but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness , and knew of something else that would decide the matter -- something independent of cleverness and knowledge . 
Prince Andrew watched the commander in chief 's face attentively , and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom , curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door , and a desire to observe propriety . 
It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov , but despised them not because of his own intellect , feelings , or knowledge -- he did not try to display any of these -- but because of something else . 
He despised them because of his old age and experience of life . 
The only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops . 
At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers , when landowners lodged petitions for compensation . 
After hearing the matter , Kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook his head . 
`` Into the stove ... into the fire with it ! 
I tell you once for all , my dear fellow , '' said he , `` into the fire with all such things ! 
Let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts ' content . 
I do n't order it or allow it , but I do n't exact compensation either . 
One ca n't get on without it . 
` When wood is chopped the chips will fly . ' '' 
He looked at the paper again . 
`` Oh , this German precision ! '' 
he muttered , shaking his head . 
`` Well , that 's all ! ''
