And let me in this place movingly admonish you , ye ship-owners of Nantucket ! 
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head . 
Beware of such an one , I say : your whales must be seen before they can be killed ; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world , and never make you one pint of sperm the richer . 
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded . 
For nowadays , the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent-minded young men , disgusted with the corking care of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber . 
Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship , and in moody phrase ejaculates : -- `` Roll on , thou deep and dark blue ocean , roll ! 
Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain . '' 
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient `` interest '' in the voyage ; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise . 
But all in vain ; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect ; they are short-sighted ; what use , then , to strain the visual nerve ? 
They have left their opera-glasses at home . 
`` Why , thou monkey , '' said a harpooneer to one of these lads , `` we 've been cruising now hard upon three years , and thou hast not raised a whale yet . 
Whales are scarce as hen 's teeth whenever thou art up here . '' 
Perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half-seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly-discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it . 
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer 's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over . 
There is no life in thee , now , except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship ; by her , borrowed from the sea ; by the sea , from the inscrutable tides of God . 
But while this sleep , this dream is on ye , move your foot or hand an inch ; slip your hold at all ; and your identity comes back in horror . 
Over Descartian vortices you hover . 
And perhaps , at midday , in the fairest weather , with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea , no more to rise for ever . 
Heed it well , ye Pantheists ! 
The Quarter-Deck -LRB- Enter Ahab : Then , all -RRB- It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck . 
There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour , as country gentlemen , after the same meal , take a few turns in the garden . 
Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk . 
Did you fixedly gaze , too , upon that ribbed and dented brow ; there also , you would see still stranger foot-prints -- the foot-prints of his one unsleeping , ever-pacing thought . 
But on the occasion in question , those dents looked deeper , even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark . 
And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement . 
`` D'ye mark him , Flask ? '' 
whispered Stubb ; `` the chick that 's in him pecks the shell . 
` Twill soon be out . '' 
The hours wore on ; -- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect . 
It drew near the close of day . 
Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks , and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there , and with one hand grasping a shroud , he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft . 
`` Sir ! '' 
said the mate , astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case . 
`` Send everybody aft , '' repeated Ahab . 
`` Mast-heads , there ! 
come down ! '' 
When the entire ship 's company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck . 
With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat . 
But this did not last long . 
Vehemently pausing , he cried : -- `` What do ye do when ye see a whale , men ? '' 
`` Sing out for him ! '' 
was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices . 
`` Good ! '' 
cried Ahab , with a wild approval in his tones ; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them . 
`` And what do ye next , men ? '' 
`` Lower away , and after him ! '' 
`` And what tune is it ye pull to , men ? '' 
`` A dead whale or a stove boat ! '' 
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions . 
But , they were all eagerness again , as Ahab , now half-revolving in his pivot-hole , with one hand reaching high up a shroud , and tightly , almost convulsively grasping it , addressed them thus : -- `` All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale . 
Look ye ! 
d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold ? '' 
-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun -- `` it is a sixteen dollar piece , men . 
D'ye see it ? 
Mr. Starbuck , hand me yon top-maul . '' 
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him . 
Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : `` Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys ! '' 
`` Huzza ! 
huzza ! '' 
cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast . 
`` It 's a white whale , I say , '' resumed Ahab , as he threw down the topmaul : `` a white whale . 
Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out . '' 
All this while Tashtego , Daggoo , and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest , and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection . 
`` Captain Ahab , '' said Tashtego , `` that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick . '' 
`` Moby Dick ? '' 
shouted Ahab . 
`` Do ye know the white whale then , Tash ? '' 
`` Does he fan-tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ? '' 
said the Gay-Header deliberately . 
`` And has he a curious spout , too , '' said Daggoo , `` very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ? '' 
`` And he have one , two , tree -- oh ! 
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain , '' cried Queequeg disjointedly , `` all twiske-tee be-twisk , like him -- him - '' faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle -- `` like him -- him - '' `` Corkscrew ! '' 
cried Ahab , `` aye , Queequeg , the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him ; aye , Daggoo , his spout is a big one , like a whole shock of wheat , and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing ; aye , Tashtego , and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall . 
Death and devils ! 
men , it is Moby Dick ye have seen -- Moby Dick -- Moby Dick ! '' 
`` Captain Ahab , '' said Starbuck , who , with Stubb and Flask , had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise , but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder . 
`` Captain Ahab , I have heard of Moby Dick -- but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg ? '' 
`` Who told thee that ? '' 
cried Ahab ; then pausing , `` Aye , Starbuck ; aye , my hearties all round ; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me ; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now . 
Aye , aye , '' he shouted with a terrific , loud , animal sob , like that of a heart-stricken moose ; `` Aye , aye ! 
it was that accursed white whale that razeed me ; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day ! '' 
Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : `` Aye , aye ! 
and I 'll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition 's flames before I give him up . 
And this is what ye have shipped for , men ! 
to chase that white whale on both sides of land , and over all sides of earth , till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out . 
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ? 
I think ye do look brave . '' 
`` Aye , aye ! '' 
shouted the harpooneers and seamen , running closer to the excited old man : `` A sharp eye for the White Whale ; a sharp lance for Moby Dick ! '' 
`` God bless ye , '' he seemed to half sob and half shout . 
`` God bless ye , men . 
Steward ! 
go draw the great measure of grog . 
But what 's this long face about , Mr. Starbuck ; wilt thou not chase the white whale ! 
art not game for Moby Dick ? '' 
`` I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander 's vengeance . 
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it , Captain Ahab ? 
it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market . '' 
`` Nantucket market ! 
Hoot ! 
But come closer , Starbuck ; thou requirest a little lower layer . 
If money 's to be the measurer , man , and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe , by girdling it with guineas , one to every three parts of an inch ; then , let me tell thee , that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here ! '' 
`` He smites his chest , '' whispered Stubb , `` what 's that for ? 
methinks it rings most vast , but hollow . '' 
`` Vengeance on a dumb brute ! '' 
cried Starbuck , `` that simply smote thee from blindest instinct ! 
Madness ! 
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous . '' 
`` Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer . 
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks . 
But in each event -- in the living act , the undoubted deed -- there , some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask . 
If man will strike , strike through the mask ! 
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ? 
To me , the white whale is that wall , shoved near to me . 
Sometimes I think there 's naught beyond . 
But 't is enough . 
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it . 
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate ; and be the white whale agent , or be the white whale principal , I will wreak that hate upon him . 
Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I 'd strike the sun if it insulted me . 
For could the sun do that , then could I do the other ; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein , jealousy presiding over all creations . 
But not my master , man , is even that fair play . 
Who 's over me ? 
Truth hath no confines . 
Take off thine eye ! 
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare ! 
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow . 
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself . 
There are men from whom warm words are small indignity . 
I meant not to incense thee . 
Let it go . 
Look ! 
see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn -- living , breathing pictures painted by the sun . 
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel ! 
The crew , man , the crew ! 
Are they not one and all with Ahab , in this matter of the whale ? 
See Stubb ! 
he laughs ! 
See yonder Chilian ! 
he snorts to think of it . 
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling can not , Starbuck ! 
And what is it ? 
Reckon it . 
'T is but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck . 
What is it more ? 
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone . 
Ah ! 
constrainings seize thee ; I see ! 
the billow lifts thee ! 
Speak , but speak ! 
-- Aye , aye ! 
thy silence , then , that voices thee . 
-LRB- Aside -RRB- Something shot from my dilated nostrils , he has inhaled it in his lungs . 
Starbuck now is mine ; can not oppose me now , without rebellion . '' 
`` God keep me ! 
-- keep us all ! '' 
murmured Starbuck , lowly . 
But in his joy at the enchanted , tacit acquiescence of the mate , Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation ; nor yet the low laugh from the hold ; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage ; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts , as for a moment their hearts sank in . 
For again Starbuck 's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before . 
Ah , ye admonitions and warnings ! 
why stay ye not when ye come ? 
But rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows ! 
Yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the fore-going things within . 
For with little external to constrain us , the innermost necessities in our being , these still drive us on . 
`` The measure ! 
the measure ! '' 
cried Ahab . 
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . 
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship 's company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . 
But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian . 
`` Drink and pass ! '' 
he cried , handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman . 
`` The crew alone now drink . 
Round with it , round ! 
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; 't is hot as Satan 's hoof . 
So , so ; it goes round excellently . 
It spiralizes in ye ; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye . 
Well done ; almost drained . 
That way it went , this way it comes . 
Hand it me -- here 's a hollow ! 
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone . 
Steward , refill ! 
`` Attend now , my braves . 
I have mustered ye all round this capstan ; and ye mates , flank me with your lances ; and ye harpooneers , stand there with your irons ; and ye , stout mariners , ring me in , that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me . 
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha ! 
boy , come back ? 
bad pennies come not sooner . 
Hand it me . 
Why , now , this pewter had run brimming again , wert not thou St. Vitus ' imp -- away , thou ague ! 
`` Advance , ye mates ! 
Cross your lances full before me . 
Well done ! 
Let me touch the axis . '' 
So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask . 
It seemed as though , by some nameless , interior volition , he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life . 
The three mates quailed before his strong , sustained , and mystic aspect . 
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright . 
`` In vain ! '' 
cried Ahab ; `` but , maybe , 't is well . 
For did ye three but once take the full-forced shock , then mine own electric thing , that had perhaps expired from out me . 
Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead . 
Perchance ye need it not . 
Down lances ! 
And now , ye mates , I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there -- yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen , my valiant harpooneers . 
Disdain the task ? 
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ? 
Oh , my sweet cardinals ! 
your own condescension , that shall bend ye to it . 
I do not order ye ; ye will it . 
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers ! '' 
Silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons , some three feet long , held , barbs up , before him . 
`` Stab me not with that keen steel ! 
Cant them ; cant them over ! 
know ye not the goblet end ? 
Turn up the socket ! 
So , so ; now , ye cup-bearers , advance . 
The irons ! 
take them ; hold them while I fill ! '' 
Forthwith , slowly going from one officer to the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter . 
`` Now , three to three , ye stand . 
Commend the murderous chalices ! 
Bestow them , ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league . 
Ha ! 
Starbuck ! 
but the deed is done ! 
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it . 
Drink , ye harpooneers ! 
drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat 's bow -- Death to Moby Dick ! 
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death ! '' 
The long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss . 
Starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered . 
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin . 
Sunset The cabin ; by the stern windows ; Ahab sitting alone , and gazing out . 
I leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where'er I sail . 
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass . 
Yonder , by the ever-brimming goblet 's rim , the warm waves blush like wine . 
The gold brow plumbs the blue . 
The diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up ! 
she wearies with her endless hill . 
Is , then , the crown too heavy that I wear ? 
this Iron Crown of Lombardy . 
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds . 
'T is iron -- that I know -- not gold . 
'T is split , too -- that I feel ; the jagged edge galls me so , my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ; aye , steel skull , mine ; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight ! 
Dry heat upon my brow ? 
Oh ! 
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed . 
No more . 
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne'er enjoy . 
Gifted with the high perception , I lack the low , enjoying power ; damned , most subtly and most malignantly ! 
damned in the midst of Paradise ! 
Good night -- good night ! 
-LRB- waving his hand , he moves from the window . -RRB- 
'T was not so hard a task . 
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve . 
Or , if you will , like so many ant-hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match . 
Oh , hard ! 
that to fire others , the match itself must needs be wasting ! 
What I 've dared , I 've willed ; and what I 've willed , I 'll do ! 
They think me mad -- Starbuck does ; but I 'm demoniac , I am madness maddened ! 
That wild madness that 's only calm to comprehend itself ! 
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye ! 
I lost this leg . 
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer . 
Now , then , be the prophet and the fulfiller one . 
That 's more than ye , ye great gods , ever were . 
I laugh and hoot at ye , ye cricket-players , ye pugilists , ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes ! 
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies -- Take some one of your own size ; do n't pommel me ! 
No , ye 've knocked me down , and I am up again ; but ye have run and hidden . 
Come forth from behind your cotton bags ! 
I have no long gun to reach ye . 
Come , Ahab 's compliments to ye ; come and see if ye can swerve me . 
Swerve me ? 
ye can not swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves ! 
man has ye there . 
Swerve me ? 
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run . 
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! 
Naught 's an obstacle , naught 's an angle to the iron way ! 
Dusk By the Mainmast ; Starbuck leaning against it . 
My soul is more than matched ; she 's over-manned ; and by a madman ! 
Insufferable sting , that sanity should ground arms on such a field ! 
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me ! 
I think I see his impious end ; but feel that I must help him to it . 
Will I , nill I , the ineffable thing has tied me to him ; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut . 
Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it . 
Yet is there hope . 
Time and tide flow wide . 
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe . 
His heaven-insulting purpose , God may wedge aside . 
I would up heart , were it not like lead . 
But my whole clock 's run down ; my heart the all-controlling weight , I have no key to lift again . 
-LSB- A burst of revelry from the forecastle . -RSB- 
Oh , God ! 
to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them ! 
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea . 
The white whale is their demigorgon . 
Hark ! 
the infernal orgies ! 
that revelry is forward ! 
mark the unfaltering silence aft ! 
Methinks it pictures life . 
Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay , embattled , bantering bow , but only to drag dark Ahab after it , where he broods within his sternward cabin , builded over the dead water of the wake , and further on , hunted by its wolfish gurglings . 
The long howl thrills me through ! 
Peace ! 
ye revellers , and set the watch ! 
Oh , life ! 
't is in an hour like this , with soul beat down and held to knowledge , -- as wild , untutored things are forced to feed -- Oh , life ! 
't is now that I do feel the latent horror in thee ! 
but 't is not me ! 
that horror 's out of me , and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures ! 
Stand by me , hold me , bind me , O ye blessed influences ! 
First Night Watch -LRB- Stubb solus , and mending a brace . -RRB- 
Ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
ha ! 
hem ! 
clear my throat ! 
-- I 've been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha 's the final consequence . 
Why so ? 
Because a laugh 's the wisest , easiest answer to all that 's queer ; and come what will , one comfort 's always left -- that unfailing comfort is , it 's all predestinated . 
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt . 
Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him , too . 
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it . 
Well , Stubb , wise Stubb -- that 's my title -- well , Stubb , what of it , Stubb ? 
Here 's a carcase . 
I know not all that may be coming , but be it what it will , I 'll go to it laughing . 
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles ! 
I feel funny . 
Fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
What 's my juicy little pear at home doing now ? 
Crying its eyes out ? 
-- Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers , I dare say , gay as a frigate 's pennant , and so am I -- fa , la ! 
lirra , skirra ! 
Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- Aside -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming . 
Midnight , Forecastle HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS -LRB- Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing , lounging , leaning , and lying in various attitudes , all singing in chorus . -RRB- 
Farewell and adieu to you , Spanish ladies ! 
Farewell and adieu to you , ladies of Spain ! 
Our captain 's commanded . 
-- 1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR Oh , boys , do n't be sentimental . 
it 's bad for the digestion ! 
Take a tonic , follow me ! 
-LRB- Sings , and all follow -RRB- Our captain stood upon the deck , A spy-glass in his hand , A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand . 
Oh , your tubs in your boats , my boys , And by your braces stand , And we 'll have one of those fine whales , Hand , boys , over hand ! 
So , be cheery , my lads ! 
may your hearts never fail ! 
While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale ! 
MATE 'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK Eight bells there , forward ! 
2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR Avast the chorus ! 
Eight bells there ! 
d'ye hear , bell-boy ? 
Strike the bell eight , thou Pip ! 
thou blackling ! 
and let me call the watch . 
I 've the sort of mouth for that -- the hogshead mouth . 
So , so , -LRB- thrusts his head down the scuttle , -RRB- Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s , a-h-o-y ! 
Eight bells there below ! 
Tumble up ! 
DUTCH SAILOR Grand snoozing to-night , maty ; fat night for that . 
I mark this in our old Mogul 's wine ; it 's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others . 
We sing ; they sleep -- aye , lie down there , like ground-tier butts . 
At 'em again ! 
There , take this copper-pump , and hail 'em through it . 
Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lassies . 
Tell 'em it 's the resurrection ; they must kiss their last , and come to judgment . 
That 's the way -- that 's it ; thy throat ai n't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter . 
FRENCH SAILOR Hist , boys ! 
let 's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay . 
What say ye ? 
There comes the other watch . 
Stand by all legs ! 
Pip ! 
little Pip ! 
hurrah with your tambourine ! 
PIP -LRB- Sulky and sleepy -RRB- Do n't know where it is . 
FRENCH SAILOR Beat thy belly , then , and wag thy ears . 
Jig it , men , I say ; merry 's the word ; hurrah ! 
Damn me , wo n't you dance ? 
Form , now , Indian-file , and gallop into the double-shuffle ? 
Throw yourselves ! 
Legs ! 
legs ! 
ICELAND SAILOR I do n't like your floor , maty ; it 's too springy to my taste . 
I 'm used to ice-floors . 
I 'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject ; but excuse me . 
MALTESE SAILOR Me too ; where 's your girls ? 
Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right , and say to himself , how d'ye do ? 
Partners ! 
I must have partners ! 
SICILIAN SAILOR Aye ; girls and a green ! 
-- then I 'll hop with ye ; yea , turn grasshopper ! 
LONG-ISLAND SAILOR Well , well , ye sulkies , there 's plenty more of us . 
Hoe corn when you may , say I. All legs go to harvest soon . 
Ah ! 
here comes the music ; now for it ! 
AZORE SAILOR -LRB- Ascending , and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle . -RRB- 
Here you are , Pip ; and there 's the windlass-bits ; up you mount ! 
Now , boys ! 
-LRB- The half of them dance to the tambourine ; some go below ; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging . 
Oaths a-plenty . -RRB- 
AZORE SAILOR -LRB- Dancing -RRB- Go it , Pip ! 
Bang it , bell-boy ! 
Rig it , dig it , stig it , quig it , bell-boy ! 
Make fire-flies ; break the jinglers ! 
PIP Jinglers , you say ? 
-- there goes another , dropped off ; I pound it so . 
CHINA SAILOR Rattle thy teeth , then , and pound away ; make a pagoda of thyself . 
FRENCH SAILOR Merry-mad ! 
Hold up thy hoop , Pip , till I jump through it ! 
Split jibs ! 
tear yourselves ! 
Tashtego -LRB- Quietly smoking . -RRB- 
That 's a white man ; he calls that fun : humph ! 
I save my sweat . 
OLD MANX SAILOR I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over . 
I 'll dance over your grave , I will -- that 's the bitterest threat of your night-women , that beat head-winds round corners . 
O Christ ! 
to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews ! 
Well , well ; belike the whole world 's a ball , as you scholars have it ; and so 't is right to make one ballroom of it . 
Dance on , lads , you 're young ; I was once . 
3D NANTUCKET SAILOR Spell oh ! 
-- whew ! 
this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm -- give us a whiff , Tash . 
-LRB- They cease dancing , and gather in clusters . 
Meantime the sky darkens -- the wind rises . -RRB- 
LASCAR SAILOR By Brahma ! 
boys , it 'll be douse sail soon . 
The sky-born , high-tide Ganges turned to wind ! 
Thou showest thy black brow , Seeva ! 
MALTESE SAILOR -LRB- Reclining and shaking his cap -RRB- It 's the waves -- the snow 's caps turn to jig it now . 
They 'll shake their tassels soon . 
Now would all the waves were women , then I 'd go drown , and chassee with them evermore ! 
There 's naught so sweet on earth -- heaven may not match it ! 
-- as those swift glances of warm , wild bosoms in the dance , when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe , bursting grapes . 
SICILIAN SAILOR -LRB- Reclining -RRB- Tell me not of it ! 
Hark ye , lad -- fleet interlacings of the limbs -- lithe swayings -- coyings -- flutterings ! 
lip ! 
heart ! 
hip ! 
all graze : unceasing touch and go ! 
not taste , observe ye , else come satiety . 
Eh , Pagan ? 
-LRB- Nudging . -RRB- 
TAHITAN SAILOR -LRB- Reclining on a mat -RRB- Hail , holy nakedness of our dancing girls ! 
-- the Heeva-Heeva ! 
Ah ! 
low veiled , high palmed Tahiti ! 
I still rest me on thy mat , but the soft soil has slid ! 
I saw thee woven in the wood , my mat ! 
green the first day I brought ye thence ; now worn and wilted quite . 
Ah me ! 
-- not thou nor I can bear the change ! 
How then , if so be transplanted to yon sky ? 
Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee 's peak of spears , when they leap down the crags and drown the villages ? 
-- The blast , the blast ! 
Up , spine , and meet it ! 
-LRB- Leaps to his feet . -RRB- 
PORTUGUESE SAILOR How the sea rolls swashing ` gainst the side ! 
Stand by for reefing , hearties ! 
the winds are just crossing swords , pell-mell they 'll go lunging presently . 
DANISH SAILOR Crack , crack , old ship ! 
so long as thou crackest , thou holdest ! 
Well done ! 
The mate there holds ye to it stiffly . 
He 's no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat , put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns , on which the sea-salt cakes ! 
4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR He has his orders , mind ye that . 
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall , something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol -- fire your ship right into it ! 
ENGLISH SAILOR Blood ! 
but that old man 's a grand old cove ! 
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale ! 
ALL Aye ! 
aye ! 
OLD MANX SAILOR How the three pines shake ! 
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil , and here there 's none but the crew 's cursed clay . 
Steady , helmsman ! 
steady . 
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore , and keeled hulls split at sea . 
Our captain has his birthmark ; look yonder , boys , there 's another in the sky lurid -- like , ye see , all else pitch black . 
DAGGOO What of that ? 
Who 's afraid of black 's afraid of me ! 
I 'm quarried out of it ! 
SPANISH SAILOR -LRB- Aside . -RRB- 
He wants to bully , ah ! 
-- the old grudge makes me touchy -LRB- Advancing . -RRB- 
Aye , harpooneer , thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind -- devilish dark at that . 
No offence . 
DAGGOO -LRB- Grimly -RRB- None . 
ST. JAGO 'S SAILOR That Spaniard 's mad or drunk . 
But that ca n't be , or else in his one case our old Mogul 's fire-waters are somewhat long in working . 
5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR What 's that I saw -- lightning ?
