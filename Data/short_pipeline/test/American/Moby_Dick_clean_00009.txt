` Aye ? 
Well then , Don , refill my cup . 
Your chicha 's very fine ; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are ; for such information may throw side-light upon my story . ' 
`` For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard-room and bar-room ; through the holy-of-holies of great forests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow-white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life . 
There 's your true Ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long-flung shadow , and the snug patronizing lee of churches . 
For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities . '' 
` Is that a friar passing ? ' 
said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern . '' 
` Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella 's Inquisition wanes in Lima , ' laughed Don Sebastian . 
` Proceed , Senor . ' '' ' 
A moment ! 
Pardon ! ' 
cried another of the company . 
` In the name of all us Limeese , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison . 
Oh ! 
do not bow and look surprised : you know the proverb all along this coast -- `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
It but bears out your saying , too ; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables , and for ever open-and `` Corrupt as Lima . '' 
So , too , Venice ; I have been there ; the holy city of the blessed evangelist , St. Mark ! 
-- St. Dominic , purge it ! 
Your cup ! 
Thanks : here I refill ; now , you pour out again . ' 
`` Freely depicted in his own vocation , gentlemen , the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero , so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he . 
Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green-turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck . 
But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed . 
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features . 
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats ; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities . 
Once a vagabond on his own canal , I have received good turns from one of these Canallers ; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful ; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence , that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait , as to plunder a wealthy one . 
In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains . 
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter , that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line , the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field , and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas . '' ' 
I see ! 
I see ! ' 
impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro , spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles . 
` No need to travel ! 
The world 's one Lima . 
I had thought , now , that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills . 
-- But the story . ' 
`` I had left off , gentlemen , where the Lakeman shook the backstay . 
Hardly had he done so , when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers , who all crowded him to the deck . 
But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets , the two Canallers rushed into the uproar , and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle . 
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt , and a twisted turmoil ensued ; while standing out of harm 's way , the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike , calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel , and smoke him along to the quarter-deck . 
At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment . 
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade . '' 
` Come out of that , ye pirates ! ' 
roared the captain , now menacing them with a pistol in each hand , just brought to him by the steward . 
` Come out of that , ye cut-throats ! ' 
`` Steelkilt leaped on the barricade , and striding up and down there , defied the worst the pistols could do ; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his -LRB- Steelkilt 's -RRB- death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands . 
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true , the captain a little desisted , but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty . '' 
` Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ? ' 
demanded their ringleader . '' 
` Turn to ! 
turn to ! 
-- I make no promise ; to your duty ! 
Do you want to sink the ship , by knocking off at a time like this ? 
Turn to ! ' 
and he once more raised a pistol . '' 
` Sink the ship ? ' 
cried Steelkilt . 
` Aye , let her sink . 
Not a man of us turns to , unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us . 
What say ye , men ? ' 
turning to his comrades . 
A fierce cheer was their response . 
`` The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade , all the while keeping his eye on the Captain , and jerking out such sentences as these : -- ` It 's not our fault ; we did n't want it ; I told him to take his hammer away ; it was boy 's business ; he might have known me before this ; I told him not to prick the buffalo ; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw ; ai n't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there , men ? 
look to those handspikes , my hearties . 
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; do n't be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we 're your men ; but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! 
I make no promises , turn to , I say ! ' '' 
` Look ye , now , ' cried the Lakeman , flinging out his arm towards him , ` there are a few of us here -LRB- and I am one of them -RRB- who have shipped for the cruise , d'ye see ; now as you well know , sir , we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down ; so we do n't want a row ; it 's not our interest ; we want to be peaceable ; we are ready to work , but we wo n't be flogged . ' '' 
` Turn to ! ' 
roared the Captain . 
`` Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said : -- ' I tell you what it is now , Captain , rather than kill ye , and be hung for such a shabby rascal , we wo n't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us ; but till you say the word about not flogging us , we do n't do a hand 's turn . ' '' 
` Down into the forecastle then , down with ye , I 'll keep ye there till ye 're sick of it . 
Down ye go . ' '' 
` Shall we ? ' 
cried the ringleader to his men . 
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave . 
`` As the Lakeman 's bare head was just level with the planks , the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade , and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle , planted their group of hands upon it , and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway . 
Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral . 
`` All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers , forward and aft , especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway ; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge , after breaking through the bulkhead below . 
But the hours of darkness passed in peace ; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps , whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship . 
`` At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused . 
Water was then lowered down to them , and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it ; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it , the Captain returned to the quarter-deck . 
Twice every day for three days this was repeated ; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling , and then a scuffling was heard , as the customary summons was delivered ; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle , saying they were ready to turn to . 
The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion . 
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged . 
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them . 
Only three were left . '' 
` Better turn to , now ? ' 
said the Captain with a heartless jeer . '' 
` Shut us up again , will ye ! ' 
cried Steelkilt . 
`` Oh ! 
certainly , '' said the Captain , and the key clicked . 
`` It was at this point , gentlemen , that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates , and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him , and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers , thus far apparently of one mind with him , to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison ; and armed with their keen mincing knives -LRB- long , crescentic , heavy implements with a handle at each end -RRB- run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail ; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible , seize the ship . 
For himself , he would do this , he said , whether they joined him or not . 
That was the last night he should spend in that den . 
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two ; they swore they were ready for that , or for any other mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender . 
And what was more , they each insisted upon being the first man on deck , when the time to make the rush should come . 
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time . 
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out . 
`` Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be the foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit . 
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight . 
`` Thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle . 
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened , and , bound hand and foot , the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies , who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder . 
But all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning . 
` Damn ye , ' cried the Captain , pacing to and fro before them , ` the vultures would not touch ye , ye villains ! ' 
`` At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the while , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular . '' 
` But as for you , ye carrion rogues , ' turning to the three men in the rigging -- ` for you , I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots ; ' and , seizing a rope , he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors , till they yelled no more , but lifelessly hung their heads sideways , as the two crucified thieves are drawn . '' 
` My wrist is sprained with ye ! ' 
he cried , at last ; ` but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that would n't give up . 
Take that gag from his mouth , and let us hear what he can say for himself . ' 
`` For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ` What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you ! ' '' 
` Say ye so ? 
then see how ye frighten me ' -- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike . '' 
` Best not , ' hissed the Lakeman . '' 
` But I must , ' -- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke . 
`` Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I wo n't do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d'ye hear ? ' 
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man , with a bandaged head , arrested them -- Radney the chief mate . 
Ever since the blow , he had lain in his berth ; but that morning , hearing the tumult on the deck , he had crept out , and thus far had watched the whole scene . 
Such was the state of his mouth , that he could hardly speak ; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt , he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe . '' 
` You are a coward ! ' 
hissed the Lakeman . '' 
` So I am , but take that . ' 
The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm . 
He paused : and then pausing no more , made good his word , spite of Steelkilt 's threat , whatever that might have been . 
The three men were then cut down , all hands were turned to , and , sullenly worked by the moody seamen , the iron pumps clanged as before . 
`` Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew . 
Entreaties , cuffs , and kicks could not drive them back , so at their own instance they were put down in the ship 's run for salvation . 
Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest . 
On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt 's instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body . 
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered . 
For , spite of her leak , and spite of all her other perils , the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads , and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment , as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground ; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat , and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale . 
`` But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel -LRB- at least till all was over -RRB- concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart . 
He was in Radney the chief mate 's watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night . 
Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge . 
`` During the night , Radney had an unseaman-like way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship 's side . 
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed . 
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea . 
Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed . 
At his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below . '' 
` What are you making there ? ' 
said a shipmate . '' 
` What do you think ? 
what does it look like ? ' '' 
` Like a lanyard for your bag ; but it 's an odd one , seems to me . ' 
` Yes , rather oddish , ' said the Lakeman , holding it at arm 's length before him ; ` but I think it will answer . 
Shipmate , I have n't enough twine , -- have you any ? ' 
`` But there was none in the forecastle . '' 
` Then I must get some from old Rad ; ' and he rose to go aft . '' 
` You do n't mean to go a begging to him ! ' 
said a sailor . '' 
` Why not ? 
Do you think he wo n't do me a turn , when it 's to help himself in the end , shipmate ? ' 
and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock . 
It was given him -- neither twine nor lanyard were seen again ; but the next night an iron ball , closely netted , partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman 's monkey jacket , as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow . 
Twenty-four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman 's hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in . 
`` But , gentlemen , a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned . 
Yet complete revenge he had , and without being the avenger . 
For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done . 
`` It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day , when they were washing down the decks , that a stupid Teneriffe man , drawing water in the main-chains , all at once shouted out , ` There she rolls ! 
there she rolls ! ' 
Jesu , what a whale ! 
It was Moby Dick . '' 
` Moby Dick ! ' 
cried Don Sebastian ; ` St. Dominic ! 
Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ? 
Whom call you Moby Dick ? ' '' ' 
A very white , and famous , and most deadly immortal monster , Don ; -- but that would be too long a story . ' '' 
` How ? 
how ? ' 
cried all the young Spaniards , crowding . '' 
` Nay , Dons , Dons -- nay , nay ! 
I can not rehearse that now . 
Let me get more into the air , Sirs . ' '' 
` The chicha ! 
the chicha ! ' 
cried Don Pedro ; ` our vigorous friend looks faint ; -- fill up his empty glass ! ' 
`` No need , gentlemen ; one moment , and I proceed . 
-- Now , gentlemen , so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship -- forgetful of the compact among the crew -- in the excitement of the moment , the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads . 
All was now a phrensy . 
` The White Whale -- the White Whale ! ' 
was the cry from captain , mates , and harpooneers , who , undeterred by fearful rumours , were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish ; while the dogged crew eyed askance , and with curses , the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass , that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun , shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea . 
Gentlemen , a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events , as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted . 
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command . 
Moreover , when the four boats were lowered , the mate 's got the start ; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt , as he strained at his oar . 
After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow . 
He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat . 
And now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale 's topmost back . 
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate . 
That instant , as he fell on the whale 's slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale . 
He struck out through the spray , and , for an instant , was dimly seen through that veil , wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick . 
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom ; seized the swimmer between his jaws ; and rearing high up with him , plunged headlong again , and went down . 
`` Meantime , at the first tap of the boat 's bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts . 
But a sudden , terrific , downward jerking of the boat , quickly brought his knife to the line . 
He cut it ; and the whale was free . 
But , at some distance , Moby Dick rose again , with some tatters of Radney 's red woollen shirt , caught in the teeth that had destroyed him . 
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared . 
`` In good time , the Town-Ho reached her port -- a savage , solitary place -- where no civilized creature resided . 
There , headed by the Lakeman , all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms ; eventually , as it turned out , seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages , and setting sail for some other harbor . 
`` The ship 's company being reduced to but a handful , the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak . 
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel . 
After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale-boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew . 
`` On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals . 
He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water . 
The captain presented a pistol . 
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam . '' 
` What do you want of me ? ' 
cried the captain . '' 
` Where are you bound ? 
and for what are you bound ? ' 
demanded Steelkilt ; ` no lies . ' '' ' 
I am bound to Tahiti for more men . ' '' 
` Very good . 
Let me board you a moment -- I come in peace . ' 
With that he leaped from the canoe , swam to the boat ; and climbing the gunwale , stood face to face with the captain . '' 
` Cross your arms , sir ; throw back your head . 
Now , repeat after me . 
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me , I swear to beach this boat on yonder island , and remain there six days . 
If I do not , may lightning strike me ! ' '' ' 
A pretty scholar , ' laughed the Lakeman . 
` Adios , Senor ! ' 
and leaping into the sea , he swam back to his comrades . 
`` Watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of destination . 
There , luck befriended him ; two ships were about to sail for France , and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed . 
They embarked , and so for ever got the start of their former captain , had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution . 
`` Some ten days after the French ships sailed , the whale-boat arrived , and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians , who had been somewhat used to the sea . 
Chartering a small native schooner , he returned with them to his vessel ; and finding all right there , again resumed his cruisings . 
`` Where Steelkilt now is , gentlemen , none know ; but upon the island of Nantucket , the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead ; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him . '' 
` Are you through ? ' 
said Don Sebastian , quietly . '' ' 
I am , Don . ' '' 
` Then I entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ? 
It is so passing wonderful ! 
Did you get it from an unquestionable source ? 
Bear with me if I seem to press . ' '' 
` Also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian 's suit , ' cried the company , with exceeding interest . '' 
` Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ? ' '' 
` Nay , ' said Don Sebastian ; ` but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me . 
I go for it ; but are you well advised ? 
this may grow too serious . ' '' 
` Will you be so good as to bring the priest also , Don ? ' '' 
` Though there are no Auto-da-Fe 's in Lima now , ' said one of the company to another ; ' I fear our sailor friend runs risks of the archiepiscopacy . 
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight . 
I see no need of this . ' '' 
` Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can . ' 
` This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists , ' said Don Sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure . '' 
` Let me remove my hat . 
Now , venerable priest , further into the light , and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it . '' 
` So help me Heaven , and on my honor the story I have told ye , gentlemen , is in substance and its great items , true . 
I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney . '' 
Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there . 
It may be worth while , therefore , previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman . 
It is time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong . 
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and Grecian sculptures . 
For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples , the pedestals of statues , and on shields , medallions , cups , and coins , the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin 's , and a helmeted head like St. George 's ; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed , not only in most popular pictures of the whale , but in many scientific presentations of him . 
Now , by all odds , the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale 's , is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants , in India . 
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being . 
No wonder then , that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth . 
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar . 
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is all wrong . 
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale 's majestic flukes . 
But go to the old Galleries , and look now at a great Christian painter 's portrait of this fish ; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo . 
It is Guido 's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale . 
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ? 
Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own `` Perseus Descending , '' make out one whit better . 
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water . 
It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower . 
Then , there are the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah 's whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers . 
What shall be said of these ? 
As for the book-binder 's whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases . 
Though universally denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this book-binder 's fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced . 
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the Revival of Learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan . 
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d'eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden-Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain . 
In the title-page of the original edition of the `` Advancement of Learning '' you will find some curious whales . 
But quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know . 
In old Harris 's collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages , A.D. 1671 , entitled `` A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale , Peter Peterson of Friesland , master . '' 
In one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice-isles , with white bears running over their living backs . 
In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes . 
Then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one Captain Colnett , a Post Captain in the English navy , entitled `` A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas , for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries . '' 
In this book is an outline purporting to be a `` Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck . '' 
I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . 
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long . 
Ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye ! 
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . 
Look at that popular work `` Goldsmith 's Animated Nature . '' 
In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged `` whale '' and a `` narwhale . '' 
I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys . 
Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan . 
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale -LRB- that is to say the Right whale -RRB- , even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature . 
But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron . 
In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale . 
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket . 
In a word , Frederick Cuvier 's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash . 
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage -LRB- such men seldom have -RRB- , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ? 
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing . 
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us . 
As for the sign-painters ' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers , what shall be said of them ? 
They are generally Richard III . 
whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint . 
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all . 
Consider ! 
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . 
Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . 
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . 
And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship 's deck , such is then the outlandish , eel-like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch . 
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form . 
Not at all . 
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape . 
Though Jeremy Bentham 's skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy 's other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan 's articulated bones . 
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it . 
This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown . 
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb . 
This fin has four regular bone-fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger . 
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering . 
`` However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , '' said humorous Stubb one day , `` he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens . '' 
For all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last . 
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness . 
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like . 
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him . 
Wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan . 
Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in Pliny , Purchas , Hackluyt , Harris , Cuvier , & c . 
But I pass that matter by . 
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett 's , Huggins 's , Frederick Cuvier 's , and Beale 's . 
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to . 
Huggins 's is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale 's is the best . 
All Beale 's drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . 
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect . 
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . 
That is not his fault though . 
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression . 
He has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters . 
But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one Garnery . 
Respectively , they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale . 
In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the . 
air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks . 
The prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster 's spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice . 
The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true . 
The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene . 
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , I could not draw so good a one . 
In the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs . 
His jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below . 
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell-fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back . 
And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer . 
Thus , the fore-ground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole . 
Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not . 
But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman . 
The French are the lads for painting action . 
Go and gaze upon all the paintings in Europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell-mell , through the consecutive great battles of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ? 
Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery . 
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes . 
With not one tenth of England 's experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt . 
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid . 
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals . 
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager -LRB- I honor him for a veteran -RRB- , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace . 
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself `` H. Durand . '' 
One of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts . 
It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific ; a French whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air . 
The effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose . 
The other engraving is quite a different affair : the ship hove-to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life , with a Right Whale alongside ; the vessel -LRB- in the act of cutting-in -RRB- hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance . 
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half-erect out of the water , like a rearing horse . 
From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen . 
Of Whales in Paint ; in Teeth ; in Wood ; in Sheet-Iron ; in Stone ; in Mountains ; in Stars On Tower-hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar -LRB- or kedger , as the sailors say -RRB- holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg . 
There are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats -LRB- presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity -RRB- is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale . 
Any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world . 
But the time of his justification has now come . 
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings . 
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation . 
Throughout the Pacific , and also in Nantucket , and New Bedford , and Sag Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth , or ladies ' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure . 
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business . 
But , in general , they toil with their jack-knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner 's fancy . 
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him , i.e. what is called savagery . 
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois . 
I myself am a savage , owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals ; and ready at any moment to rebel against him . 
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry . 
An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon . 
For , with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark 's tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application . 
As with the Hawaiian savage , so with the white sailor-savage . 
With the same marvellous patience , and with the same single shark 's tooth , of his one poor jack-knife , he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture , not quite as workmanlike , but as close packed in its maziness of design , as the Greek savage , Achilles 's shield ; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness , as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage , Albert Durer . 
Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers . 
Some of them are done with much accuracy . 
At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door . 
When the porter is sleepy , the anvil-headed whale would be best . 
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . 
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weathercocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with `` Hands off ! '' 
you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit . 
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges . 
Then , again , in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights ; here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges . 
But you must be a thorough whaleman , to see these sights ; and not only that , but if you wish to return to such a sight again , you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point , else so chance-like are such observations of the hills , that your precise , previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery ; like the Solomon islands , which still remain incognita , though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them . 
Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject , can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens , and boats in pursuit of them ; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds . 
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me . 
And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis , and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish . 
With a frigate 's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs , would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies , to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight ! 
Brit Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds . 
For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat . 
On the second day , numbers of Right Whales were seen , who , secure from the attack of a Sperm-Whaler like the Pequod , with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit , which , adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths , was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lips . 
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea . 
* * That part of the sea known among whalemen as the `` Brazil Banks '' does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do , because of there being shallows and soundings there , but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance , caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes , where the Right Whale is often chased . 
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers . 
Seen from the mast-heads , especially when they paused and were stationary for a while , their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else . 
And as in the great hunting countries of India , the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such , taking them for bare , blackened elevations of the soil ; even so , often , with him , who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea . 
And even when recognized at last , their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct , in all parts , with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse . 
Indeed . 
in other respects , you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore . 
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ? 
The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him . 
But though , to landsmen in general , the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling ; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita , so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one ; though , by vast odds , the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters ; though but a moment 's consideration will teach that , however baby man may brag of his science and skill , and however much , in a flattering future , that science and skill may augment ; yet for ever and for ever , to the crack of doom , the sea will insult and murder him , and pulverize the stateliest , stiffest frigate he can make ; nevertheless , by the continual repetition of these very impressions , man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it . 
The first boat we read of , floated on an ocean , that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow . 
That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year . 
Yea , foolish mortals , Noah 's flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers . 
Wherein differ the sea and the land , that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other ? 
Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews . 
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned . 
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships . 
No mercy , no power but its own controls it . 
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe . 
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure . 
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks . 
Consider once more , the universal cannibalism of the sea ; all whose creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began . 
Consider all this ; and then turn to this green , gentle , and most docile earth ; consider them both , the sea and the land ; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself ? 
For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land , so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti , full of peace and joy , but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life . 
God keep thee ! 
Push not off from that isle , thou canst never return ! 
Squid Slowly wading through the meadows of brit , the Pequod still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of Java ; a gentle air impelling her keel , so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze , as three mild palms on a plain . 
And still , at wide intervals in the silvery night , the lonely , alluring jet would be seen . 
But one transparent blue morning , when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea , however unattended with any stagnant calm ; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them , enjoining some secrecy ; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on ; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head . 
In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide , new slid from the hills . 
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank . 
Then once more arose , and silently gleamed . 
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ? 
thought Daggoo . 
Again the phantom went down , but on re-appearing once more , with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out -- `` There ! 
there again ! 
there she breaches ! 
right ahead ! 
The White Whale , the White Whale ! '' 
Upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard-arms , as in swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs . 
Bare-headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo . 
Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering . 
The four boats were soon on the water ; Ahab 's in advance , and all swiftly pulling towards their prey . 
Soon it went down , and while , with oars suspended , we were awaiting its reappearance , lo ! 
in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose . 
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick , we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind . 
A vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream-color , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach . 
No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance-like apparition of life . 
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed -- `` Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost ! '' 
`` What was it , Sir ? '' 
said Flask . 
`` The great live squid , which , they say , few whale-ships ever beheld , and returned to their ports to tell of it . '' 
But Ahab said nothing ; turning his boat , he sailed back to the vessel ; the rest as silently following . 
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness . 
So rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food . 
For though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists . 
At times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length . 
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it . 
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid . 
The manner in which the Bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond . 
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it . 
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle-fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the Anak of the tribe . 
The Line With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale-line . 
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapored with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope 's durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss . 
Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and I will add -LRB- since there is an aesthetics in all things -RRB- , is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp . 
Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold . 
The whale-line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness . 
At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is . 
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons . 
In length , the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms . 
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm-pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded `` sheaves , '' or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the `` heart , '' or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese . 
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody 's arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub . 
Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists . 
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs . 
There is some advantage in this ; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one-half inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one . 
When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales . 
Both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything . 
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts . 
First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon . 
In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort . 
Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety 's sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again . 
Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man 's oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out . 
From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms -LRB- called box-line -RRB- being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short-warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail . 
Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction . 
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as Indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs . 
Nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he can not be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly . 
Yet habit -- strange thing ! 
what can not habit accomplish ? 
-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whaleboat , when thus hung in hangman 's nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say . 
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost . 
For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you . 
It is worse ; for you can not sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out . 
Again : as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play -- this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair . 
But why say more ? 
All men live enveloped in whale-lines . 
All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , everpresent perils of life . 
And if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale-boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side . 
Stubb Kills a Whale If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents , to Queequeg it was quite a different object . 
`` When you see him ` quid , '' said the savage , honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat , `` then you quick see him ` parm whale . '' 
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod 's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea . 
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying-fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in-shore ground off Peru . 
It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air . 
No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn . 
Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen mast-heads were already drowsy .
