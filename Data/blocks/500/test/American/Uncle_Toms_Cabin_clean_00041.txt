sister? And can you blame him?

But, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and
recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy. They are now
seated around the social board, and are getting decidedly companionable;
only that Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her lap, occasionally
squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather astonishes her, and
obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent
the little one desires,--alleging, what the child rather wonders at,
that she has got something better than cake, and doesn't want it.

And, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over Cassy,
that our readers would scarcely know her. The despairing, haggard
expression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust. She seemed
to sink, at once, into the bosom of the family, and take the little ones
into her heart, as something for which it long had waited. Indeed, her
love seemed to flow more naturally to the little Eliza than to her own
daughter; for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she
had lost. The little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter,
through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection. Eliza's steady,
consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the sacred
word, made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her
mother. Cassy yielded at once, and with her whole soul, to every good
influence, and became a devout and tender Christian.

After a day or two, Madame de Thoux told her brother more particularly
of her affairs. The death of her husband had left her an ample fortune,
which she generously offered to share with the family. When she asked
George what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, "Give me
an education, Emily; that has always been my heart's desire. Then, I can
do all the rest."

On mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go,
for some years, to France; whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with
them.

The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the
vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife.

George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself
with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.

Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an
asylum in this country.

George's feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed
in a letter to one of his friends.

"I feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you
have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this
country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family
scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell
you the truth, I have no wish to.

"My sympathies are not for my father's race, but for my mother's. To him
I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken mother
I was a _child_; and, though I never saw her, after the cruel sale that
separated us, till she died, yet I _know_ she always loved me dearly.
I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of my own
early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of
my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,--though I hope to have
no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no
wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.

"It is with the oppressed, enslaved African race that I cast in my lot;
and, if I wished anything, I would wish myself two shades darker, rather
than one lighter.

"The desire and yearning of my soul is for an African _nationality_. I
want a people that shall have a tangible, separate existence of its
own; and where am I to look for it? Not in Hayti; for in Hayti they had
nothing to start with. A stream cannot rise above its fountain. The race
that formed the character of the Haytiens was a worn-out, effeminate
one; and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in rising to
anything.

"Where, then, shall I look? On the shores of Africa I see a republic,--a
republic formed of picked men, who, by energy and self-educating force,
have, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition
of slavery. Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this
republic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the
earth,--acknowledged by both France and England. There it is my wish to
go, and find myself a people.

"I am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me; but, before
you strike, hear me. During my stay in France, I have followed up, with
intense interest, the history of my people in America. I have noted the
struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist, and have received
some impressions, as a distant spectator, which could never have
occurred to me as a participator.

"I grant that this Liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes, by
being played off, in the hands of our oppressors, against us. Doubtless
the scheme may have been used, in unjustifiable ways, as a means of
retarding our emancipation. But the question to me is, Is there not a
God above all man's schemes? May He not have over-ruled their designs,
and founded for us a nation by them?

"In these days, a nation is born in a day. A nation starts, now, with
all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out
to its hand;--it has not to discover, but only to apply. Let us, then,
all take hold together, with all our might, and see what we can do with
this new enterprise, and the whole splendid continent of Africa
opens before us and our children. _Our nation_ shall roll the tide of
civilization and Christianity along its shores, and plant there mighty
republics, that, growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation, shall
be for all coming ages.

"Do you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren? I think not. If I
forget them one hour, one moment of my life, so may God forget me! But,
what can I do for them, here? Can I break their chains? No, not as an
individual; but, let me go and form part of a nation, which shall have a
voice in the councils of nations, and then we can speak. A nation has
a right to argue, remonstrate, implore, and present the cause of its
race,--which an individual has not.

"If Europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations,--as I trust in
God it will,--if, there, serfdom, and all unjust and oppressive social
inequalities, are done away; and if they, as France and England have
done, acknowledge our position,--then, in the great congress of nations,
we will make our appeal, and present the cause of our enslaved and
suffering race; and it cannot be that free, enlightened America will
not then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which
disgraces her among nations, and is as truly a curse to her as to the
enslaved.

"But, you will tell me, our race have equal rights to mingle in the
American republic as the Irishman, the German, the Swede. Granted,
they have. We _ought_ to be free to meet and mingle,--to rise by our
individual worth, without any consideration of caste or color; and they
who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of
human equality. We ought, in particular, to be allowed _here_. We have
_more_ than the rights of common men;--we have the claim of an injured
race for reparation. But, then, _I do not want it_; I want a country, a
nation, of my own. I think that the African race has peculiarities, yet
to be unfolded in the light of civilization and Christianity, which, if
not the same with those of the Anglo-Saxon, may prove to be, morally, of
even a higher type.

"To the Anglo-Saxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world,
during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict. To that mission
its stern, inflexible, energetic elements, were well adapted; but, as
a Christian, I look for another era to arise. On its borders I trust we
stand; and the throes that now convulse the nations are, to my hope, but
the birth-pangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood.

"I trust that the development of Africa is to be essentially a Christian
one. If not a dominant and commanding race, they are, at least, an
affectionate, magnanimous, and forgiving one. Having been called in the
furnace of injustice and oppression, they have need to bind closer to
their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness, through
which alone they are to conquer, which it is to be their mission to
spread over the continent of Africa.

"In myself, I confess, I am feeble for this,--full half the blood in my
veins is the hot and hasty Saxon; but I have an eloquent preacher of
the Gospel ever by my side, in the person of my beautiful wife. When I
wander, her gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes
the Christian calling and mission of our race. As a Christian patriot,
as a teacher of Christianity, I go to _my country_,--my chosen, my
glorious Africa!--and to her, in my heart, I sometimes apply those
splendid words of prophecy: 'Whereas thou hast been forsaken and
hated, so that no man went through thee; _I_ will make thee an eternal
excellence, a joy of many generations!'

"You will call me an enthusiast: you will tell me that I have not well
considered what I am undertaking. But I have considered, and counted
the cost. I go to _Liberia_, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to _a
field of work_. I expect to work with both hands,--to work _hard_; to
work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work
till I die. This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall
not be disappointed.

"Whatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from your
confidence; and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart wholly
given to my people.

"GEORGE HARRIS."


George, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for Africa,
some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.

Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to George Shelby.

Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under
the term "_Our folks_." "Our folks," at first, thought it an odd and
unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but,
so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor
to do her duty by her _élève_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and
in favor with the family and neighborhood. At the age of womanhood, she
was, by her own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian
church in the place; and showed so much intelligence, activity and zeal,
and desire to do good in the world, that she was at last recommended,
and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in Africa; and we
have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child,
made her so multiform and restless in her developments, is now employed,
in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her own
country.

P.S.--It will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that
some inquiries, which were set on foot by Madame de Thoux, have resulted
recently in the discovery of Cassy's son. Being a young man of energy,
he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received and
educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. He will soon follow
his family to Africa.




The Liberator


George Shelby had written to his mother merely a line, stating the day
that she might expect him home. Of the death scene of his old friend
he had not the heart to write. He had tried several times, and only
succeeded in half choking himself; and invariably finished by tearing up
the paper, wiping his eyes, and rushing somewhere to get quiet.

There was a pleased bustle all though the Shelby mansion, that day, in
expectation of the arrival of young Mas'r George.

Mrs. Shelby was seated in her comfortable parlor, where a cheerful
hickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening. A
supper-table, glittering with plate and cut glass, was set out, on whose
arrangements our former friend, old Chloe, was presiding.

Arrayed in a new calico dress, with clean, white apron, and high,
well-starched turban, her black polished face glowing with satisfaction,
she lingered, with needless punctiliousness, around the arrangements of
the table, merely as an excuse for talking a little to her mistress.

"Laws, now! won't it look natural to him?" she said. "Thar,--I set his
plate just whar he likes it round by the fire. Mas'r George allers
wants de warm seat. O, go way!--why didn't Sally get out de _best_
tea-pot,--de little new one, Mas'r George got for Missis, Christmas?
I'll have it out! And Missis has heard from Mas'r George?" she said,
inquiringly.

"Yes, Chloe; but only a line, just to say he would be home tonight, if
he could,--that's all."

"Didn't say nothin' 'bout my old man, s'pose?" said Chloe, still
fidgeting with the tea-cups.

"No, he didn't. He did not speak of anything, Chloe. He said he would
tell all, when he got home."

"Jes like Mas'r George,--he's allers so ferce for tellin' everything
hisself. I allers minded dat ar in Mas'r George. Don't see, for my part,
how white people gen'lly can bar to hev to write things much as they do,
writin' 's such slow, oneasy kind o' work."

Mrs. Shelby smiled.

"I'm a thinkin' my old man won't know de boys and de baby. Lor'! she's
de biggest gal, now,--good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. She's out
to the house, now, watchin' de hoe-cake. I 's got jist de very pattern
my old man liked so much, a bakin'. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin'
he was took off. Lord bless us! how I felt, dat ar morning!"

Mrs. Shelby sighed, and felt a heavy weight on her heart, at this
allusion. She had felt uneasy, ever since she received her son's letter,
lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of silence
which he had drawn.

"Missis has got dem bills?" said Chloe, anxiously.

"Yes, Chloe."

"'Cause I wants to show my old man dem very bills de _perfectioner_
gave me. 'And,' say he, 'Chloe, I wish you'd stay longer.' 'Thank
you, Mas'r,' says I, 'I would, only my old man's coming home, and
Missis,--she can't do without me no longer.' There's jist what I telled
him. Berry nice man, dat Mas'r Jones was."

Chloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her wages
had been paid should be preserved, to show her husband, in memorial of
her capability. And Mrs. Shelby had readily consented to humor her in
the request.

"He won't know Polly,--my old man won't. Laws, it's five year since they
tuck him! She was a baby den,--couldn't but jist stand. Remember how
tickled he used to be, cause she would keep a fallin' over, when she sot
out to walk. Laws a me!"

The rattling of wheels now was heard.

"Mas'r George!" said Aunt Chloe, starting to the window.

Mrs. Shelby ran to the entry door, and was folded in the arms of
her son. Aunt Chloe stood anxiously straining her eyes out into the
darkness.

"O, _poor_ Aunt Chloe!" said George, stopping compassionately, and
taking her hard, black hand between both his; "I'd have given all my
fortune to have brought him with me, but he's gone to a better country."

There was a passionate exclamation from Mrs. Shelby, but Aunt Chloe said
nothing.

The party entered the supper-room. The money, of which Chloe was so
proud, was still lying on the table.

"Thar," said she, gathering it up, and holding it, with a trembling
hand, to her mistress, "don't never want to see nor hear on 't
again. Jist as I knew 't would be,--sold, and murdered on dem ar' old
plantations!"

Chloe turned, and was walking proudly out of the room. Mrs. Shelby
followed her softly, and took one of her hands, drew her down into a
chair, and sat down by her.

"My poor, good Chloe!" said she.

Chloe leaned her head on her mistress' shoulder, and sobbed out, "O
Missis! 'scuse me, my heart's broke,--dat's all!"

"I know it is," said Mrs. Shelby, as her tears fell fast; "and _I_
cannot heal it, but Jesus can. He healeth the broken hearted, and
bindeth up their wounds."

There was a silence for some time, and all wept together. At last,
George, sitting down beside the mourner, took her hand, and, with simple
pathos, repeated the triumphant scene of her husband's death, and his
last messages of love.

About a month after this, one morning, all the servants of the Shelby
estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the
house, to hear a few words from their young master.

To the surprise of all, he appeared among them with a bundle of papers
in his hand, containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the
place, which he read successively, and presented, amid the sobs and
tears and shouts of all present.

Many, however, pressed around him, earnestly begging him not to send
them away; and, with anxious faces, tendering back their free papers.

"We don't want to be no freer than we are. We's allers had all we
wanted. We don't want to leave de ole place, and Mas'r and Missis, and
de rest!"

"My good friends," said George, as soon as he could get a silence,
"there'll be no need for you to leave me. The place wants as many hands
to work it as it did before. We need the same about the house that we
did before. But, you are now free men and free women. I shall pay you
wages for your work, such as we shall agree on. The advantage is, that
in case of my getting in debt, or dying,--things that might happen,--you
cannot now be taken up and sold. I expect to carry on the estate, and
to teach you what, perhaps, it will take you some time to learn,--how
to use the rights I give you as free men and women. I expect you to be
good, and willing to learn; and I trust in God that I shall be faithful,
and willing to teach. And now, my friends, look up, and thank God for
the blessing of freedom."

An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate,
now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, "Let us give thanks unto
the Lord!" As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty _Te
Deum_ never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell
and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.

On rising, another struck up a Methodist hymn, of which the burden was,

     "The year of Jubilee is come,--
     Return, ye ransomed sinners, home."

"One thing more," said George, as he stopped the congratulations of the
throng; "you all remember our good old Uncle Tom?"

George here gave a short narration of the scene of his death, and of his
loving farewell to all on the place, and added,

"It was on his grave, my friends, that I resolved, before God, that I
would never own another slave, while it was possible to free him; that
nobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home
and friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he died. So, when you
rejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul,
and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children. Think of your
freedom, every time you see UNCLE TOM'S CABIN; and let it be a memorial
to put you all in mind to follow in his steps, and be honest and
faithful and Christian as he was."




Concluding Remarks


The writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different
parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one; and to these
inquiries she will give one general answer.

The separate incidents that compose the narrative are, to a very
great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her own
observation, or that of her personal friends. She or her friends
have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here
introduced; and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself,
or reported to her.

The personal appearance of Eliza, the character ascribed to her, are
sketches drawn from life. The incorruptible fidelity, piety and honesty,
of Uncle Tom, had more than one development, to her personal knowledge.
Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the most terrible
incidents, have also their parallels in reality. The incident of the
mother's crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a well-known fact. The
story of "old Prue," in the second volume, was an incident that
fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then
collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in New Orleans. From the
same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. Of him her
brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his plantation, on a
collecting tour; "He actually made me feel of his fist, which was like
a blacksmith's hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was
'calloused with knocking down niggers.' When I left the plantation, I
drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogre's den."

That the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its
parallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify.
Let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of
jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit
against a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur,
wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests, and a
slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will. There is,
actually, nothing to protect the slave's life, but the _character_ of
the master. Facts too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force
their way to the public ear, and the comment that one often hears made
on them is more shocking than the thing itself. It is said, "Very likely
such cases may now and then occur, but they are no sample of general
practice." If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master
could _now and then_ torture an apprentice to death, would it be
received with equal composure? Would it be said, "These cases are rare,
and no samples of general practice"? This injustice is an _inherent_ one
in the slave system,--it cannot exist without it.

The public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girls
has acquired a notoriety, from the incidents following the capture of
the Pearl. We extract the following from the speech of Hon. Horace Mann,
one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case. He says: "In
that company of seventy-six persons, who attempted, in 1848, to escape
from the District of Columbia in the schooner Pearl, and whose officers
I assisted in defending, there were several young and healthy girls, who
had those peculiar attractions of form and feature which connoisseurs
prize so highly. Elizabeth Russel was one of them. She immediately
fell into the slave-trader's fangs, and was doomed for the New Orleans
market. The hearts of those that saw her were touched with pity for
her fate. They offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her; and some
there were who offered to give, that would not have much left after the
gift; but the fiend of a slave-trader was inexorable. She was despatched
to New Orleans; but, when about half way there, God had mercy on her,
and smote her with death. There were two girls named Edmundson in the
same company. When about to be sent to the same market, an older sister
went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch who owned them, for the
love of God, to spare his victims. He bantered her, telling what fine
dresses and fine furniture they would have. 'Yes,' she said, 'that may
do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?'
They too were sent to New Orleans; but were afterwards redeemed, at an
enormous ransom, and brought back." Is it not plain, from this, that the
histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts?

Justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and
generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel, as
the following anecdote will show. A few years since, a young southern
gentleman was in Cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his
personal attendant from a boy. The young man took advantage of this
opportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of
a Quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind. The owner
was exceedingly indignant. He had always treated the slave with such
indulgence, and his confidence in his affection was such, that he
believed he must have been practised upon to induce him to revolt from
him. He visited the Quaker, in high anger; but, being possessed of
uncommon candor and fairness, was soon quieted by his arguments and
representations. It was a side of the subject which he never had
heard,--never had thought on; and he immediately told the Quaker that,
if his slave would, to his own face, say that it was his desire to be
free, he would liberate him. An interview was forthwith procured, and
Nathan was asked by his young master whether he had ever had any reason
to complain of his treatment, in any respect.

"No, Mas'r," said Nathan; "you've always been good to me."

"Well, then, why do you want to leave me?"

"Mas'r may die, and then who get me?--I'd rather be a free man."

After some deliberation, the young master replied, "Nathan, in your
place, I think I should feel very much so, myself. You are free."

He immediately made him out free papers; deposited a sum of money in the
hands of the Quaker, to be judiciously used in assisting him to start
in life, and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to the young
man. That letter was for some time in the writer's hands.

The author hopes she has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and
humanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South.
Such instances save us from utter despair of our kind. But, she asks any
person, who knows the world, are such characters _common_, anywhere?
