First they camped gaily before Vilna , making acquaintance with the Polish landowners , preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders . 
Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them . 
Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp , a name the whole army gave to their encampment there , and because many complaints were made against the troops , who , taking advantage of the order to collect provisions , took also horses , carriages , and carpets from the Polish proprietors . 
Rostov remembered Sventsyani , because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who , unknown to him , had appropriated five barrels of old beer . 
From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to Drissa , and thence again beyond Drissa , drawing near to the frontier of Russia proper .
