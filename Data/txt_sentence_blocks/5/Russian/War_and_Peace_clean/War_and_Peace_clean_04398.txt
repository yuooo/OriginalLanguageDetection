Crowds of wounded -- some known to Pierre and some unknown -- Russians and French , with faces distorted by suffering , walked , crawled , and were carried on stretchers from the battery . 
Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour , and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not find a single one . 
There were many dead whom he did not know , but some he recognized . 
The young officer still sat in the same way , bent double , in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall . 
The red-faced man was still twitching , but they did not carry him away .
