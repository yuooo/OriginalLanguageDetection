The discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur . 
One after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him . 
The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek the great man 's mercy ; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter the Caesars into his bed ; the Pope , the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred , utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man . 
It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role , so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen . 
There is no step , no crime or petty fraud he commits , which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed .
