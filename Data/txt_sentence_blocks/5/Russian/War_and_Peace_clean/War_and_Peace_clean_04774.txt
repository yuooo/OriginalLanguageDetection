Instead of a neatly glued floor , swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings , there is a floor littered with bits of wax , excrement , dying bees scarcely moving their legs , and dead ones that have not been cleared away . 
The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super . 
Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm , he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs , but no longer in their former state of purity . 
All is neglected and foul . 
Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs , and the short home bees , shriveled and listless as if they were old , creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers , having lost all motive and all sense of life .
