It is disgraceful , a stain on our army , and as for him , he ought , it seems to me , not to live . 
If he reports that our losses were great , it is not true ; perhaps about four thousand , not more , and not even that ; but even were they ten thousand , that 's war ! 
But the enemy has lost masses ... What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days ? 
They would have had to retire of their own accord , for they had no water for men or horses . 
He gave me his word he would not retreat , but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night .
