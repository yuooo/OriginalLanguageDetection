I flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him . 
He became silent , and I recollected myself only when it was too late . 
My God , I can not get on with him at all . 
The cause of this is my egotism . 
I set myself above him and so become much worse than he , for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him .
