Rostov dismounted , gave his horse to the orderly , and followed Alpatych to the house , questioning him as to the state of affairs . 
It appeared that the princess ' offer of corn to the peasants the previous day , and her talk with Dron and at the meeting , had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent for him ; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey , the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village : that there was an order not to move , and that they would unharness the horses . 
Alpatych had gone out to admonish them , but was told -LRB- it was chiefly Karp who did the talking , Dron not showing himself in the crowd -RRB- that they could not let the princess go , that there was an order to the contrary , but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything . 
At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road , Princess Mary , despite the dissuasions of Alpatych , her nurse , and the maids , had given orders to harness and intended to start , but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen , the coachman ran away , and the women in the house began to wail . 
`` Father !
