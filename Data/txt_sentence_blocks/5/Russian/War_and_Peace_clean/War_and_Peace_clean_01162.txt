Hippolyte is her brother ... Prince Vasili is her father ... It 's bad ... '' he reflected , but while he was thinking this -LRB- the reflection was still incomplete -RRB- , he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up , and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife , how she would love him become quite different , and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false . 
And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasili , but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress . 
`` But no ! 
Why did this thought never occur to me before ? ''
