You command only my advance guard , and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order . 
You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign . 
Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy . 
Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so , and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right . 
If , however , the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention , I will ratify it ; but it is only a trick .
