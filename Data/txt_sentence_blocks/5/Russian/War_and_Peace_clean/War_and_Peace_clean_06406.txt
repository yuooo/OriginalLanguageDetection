Man 's free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it , but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force . 
The forces of gravitation , electricity , or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason . 
Just so the force of man 's free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it . 
Freedom , apart from necessity , that is , apart from the laws of reason that define it , differs in no way from gravitation , or heat , or the force that makes things grow ; for reason , it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life . 
And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies , the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity , or of chemical affinity , or of the vital force , forms the content of astronomy , physics , chemistry , botany , zoology , and so on , just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history .
