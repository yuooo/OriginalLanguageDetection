What would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government -- an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent ? 
Their activity would not have existed : there would have been no life , there would have been nothing . 
If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason , the possibility of life is destroyed . 
If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends -- the greatness of Russia or of France , the balance of power in Europe , the diffusion of the ideas of the Revolution general progress or anything else -- then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius . 
If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of Russia , that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion .
