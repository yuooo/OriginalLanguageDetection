In the regiment , everything was definite : who was lieutenant , who captain , who was a good fellow , who a bad one , and most of all , who was a comrade . 
The canteenkeeper gave one credit , one 's pay came every four months , there was nothing to think out or decide , you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and , when given an order , to do what was clearly , distinctly , and definitely ordered -- and all would be well . 
Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life , Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest . 
Life in the regiment , during this campaign , was all the pleasanter for him , because , after his loss to Dolokhov -LRB- for which , in spite of all his family 's efforts to console him , he could not forgive himself -RRB- , he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving , not as he had done before , but really well , and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer -- in a word , a splendid man altogether , a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world , but so possible in the regiment . 
After his losses , he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years .
