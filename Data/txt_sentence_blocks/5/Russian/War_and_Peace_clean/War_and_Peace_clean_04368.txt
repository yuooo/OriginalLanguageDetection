When ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot , on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing , was the most important point of the battle . 
On the contrary , just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field . 
Having reached the knoll , Pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile . 
Occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile , trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading , hauling the guns , and continually running past him with bags and charges . 
The guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar , enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke .
