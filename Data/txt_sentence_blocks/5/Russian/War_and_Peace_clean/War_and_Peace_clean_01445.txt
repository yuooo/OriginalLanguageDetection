The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait . 
At midday he was admitted to the Emperor , and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army . 
It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon . 
To the joy and pride of the whole army , a personal interview was refused , and instead of the Sovereign , Prince Dolgorukov , the victor at Wischau , was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if , contrary to expectations , these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace . 
Toward evening Dolgorukov came back , went straight to the Tsar , and remained alone with him for a long time .
