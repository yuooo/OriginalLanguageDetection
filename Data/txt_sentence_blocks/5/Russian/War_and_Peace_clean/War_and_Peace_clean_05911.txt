Kutuzov had received the Order of St. George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors , but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him . 
The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example , but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good-for-nothing .
