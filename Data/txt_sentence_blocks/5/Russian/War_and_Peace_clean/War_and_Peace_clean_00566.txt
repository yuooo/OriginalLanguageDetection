Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father . 
She is very good-natured , and my father likes her way of reading . 
She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly . '' 
`` To be quite frank , Mary , I expect Father 's character sometimes makes things trying for you , does n't it ? ''
