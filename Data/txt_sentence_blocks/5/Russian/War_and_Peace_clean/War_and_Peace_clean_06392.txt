But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime , or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act , or the freedom of the apparently original action . 
That a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes . 
The self-sacrifice of a father or mother , or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward , is more comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice , and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will . 
The founder of a sect or party , or an inventor , impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity . 
If we have a large range of examples , if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people 's actions , their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes .
