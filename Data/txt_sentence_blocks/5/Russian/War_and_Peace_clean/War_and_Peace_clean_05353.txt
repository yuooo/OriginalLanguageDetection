Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares , but he continued to speak , surprising them by empty witticisms . 
Gradually , unnoticed , all these persons began to disappear and a single question , that of the closed door , superseded all else . 
He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it .

He went , and tried to hurry , but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers .
