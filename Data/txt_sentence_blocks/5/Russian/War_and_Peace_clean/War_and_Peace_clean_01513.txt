NAPOLEON At five in the morning it was still quite dark . 
The troops of the center , the reserves , and Bagration 's right flank had not yet moved , but on the left flank the columns of infantry , cavalry , and artillery , which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan , were already up and astir . 
The smoke of the campfires , into which they were throwing everything superfluous , made the eyes smart . 
It was cold and dark . 
The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting , the soldiers , munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves , gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds , chairs , tables , wheels , tubs , and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them .
