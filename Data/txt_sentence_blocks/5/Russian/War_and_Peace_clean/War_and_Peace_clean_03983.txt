I should be given a small room as a favor , the soldiers would violate my father 's newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars , they would tell me of their victories over the Russians , and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow ... '' thought Princess Mary , not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother . 
For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her , but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew . 
Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings . 
What they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do . 
She went into Prince Andrew 's study , trying to enter completely into his ideas , and considered her position .
