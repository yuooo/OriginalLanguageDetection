`` Young man , you will go far ! '' 
Prince Andrew , who had also been brought forward before the Emperor 's eyes to complete the show of prisoners , could not fail to attract his attention . 
Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and , addressing him , again used the epithet `` young man '' that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you , young man , '' said he . 
`` How do you feel , mon brave ? ''
