To us , the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon 's refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg ; for had he not wished to serve , and had a second , a third , and a thousandth corporal and private also refused , there would have been so many less men in Napoleon 's army and the war could not have occurred . 
Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula , and not ordered his troops to advance , there would have been no war ; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war . 
Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg , and had Alexander not felt insulted , and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia , or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire , or all the things that produced the French Revolution , and so on . 
Without each of these causes nothing could have happened . 
So all these causes -- myriads of causes -- coincided to bring it about .
