The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds , but changed to the cry of ulyulyu , and above the others rose Daniel 's voice , now a deep bass , now piercingly shrill . 
His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field . 
After listening a few moments in silence , the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs : the sound of the larger pack , eagerly giving tongue , began to die away in the distance , the other pack rushed by the wood past the count , and it was with this that Daniel 's voice was heard calling ulyulyu . 
The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again , but both were becoming more distant . 
Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled ; the count too sighed and , noticing the snuffbox in his hand , opened it and took a pinch .
