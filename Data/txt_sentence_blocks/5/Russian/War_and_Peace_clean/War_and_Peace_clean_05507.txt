At the battle of Borodino , when Bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was directed against it , the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning Dokhturov -- Kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first . 
And the quiet little Dokhturov rode thither , and Borodino became the greatest glory of the Russian army . 
Many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose , but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said . 
It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there to Malo-Yaroslavets , the place where the last battle with the French was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began ; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign , but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously . 
And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit .
