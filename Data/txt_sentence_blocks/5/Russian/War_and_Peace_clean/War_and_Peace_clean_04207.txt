Following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments -- one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers . 
Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large , dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover . 
This was the icon that had been brought from and had since accompanied the army . 
Behind , before , and on both sides , crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked , ran , and bowed to the ground . 
At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon ; the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others , the chanters relit their censers , and service began .
