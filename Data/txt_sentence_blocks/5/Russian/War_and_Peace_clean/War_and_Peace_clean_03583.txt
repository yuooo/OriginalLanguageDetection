Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests , arguments , and passions at headquarters . 
For the Pavlograd hussars , however , the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business . 
It was only at headquarters that there was depression , uneasiness , and intriguing ; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why . 
If they regretted having to retreat , it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to , or some pretty young Polish lady . 
If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone 's head , he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs , but only of the task nearest to hand .
