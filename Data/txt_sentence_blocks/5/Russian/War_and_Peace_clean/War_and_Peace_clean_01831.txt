`` Inform the prince that labor has begun , '' said Mary Bogdanovna , giving the messenger a significant look . 
Tikhon went and told the prince . 
`` Very good ! '' 
said the prince closing the door behind him , and Tikhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that . 
After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles , and , seeing the prince was lying on the sofa , looked at him , noticed his perturbed face , shook his head , and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered .
