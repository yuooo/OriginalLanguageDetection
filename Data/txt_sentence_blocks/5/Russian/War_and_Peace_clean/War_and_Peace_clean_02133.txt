What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter 's day , and that the richest peasants -LRB- who formed the deputation -RRB- had begun the chantry long before , but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty . 
He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land , they did still harder work on their own land . 
He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions , and that the pupils ' parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments . 
He did not know that the brick buildings , built to plan , were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased , though lessened on paper .
