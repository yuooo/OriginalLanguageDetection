Kutuzov even imagined that Napoleon 's army might turn back through Medyn and Yukhnov , but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened -- the insane , convulsive stampede of Napoleon 's army during its first eleven days after leaving Moscow : a stampede which made possible what Kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of -- the complete extermination of the French . 
Dorokhov 's report about Broussier 's division , the guerrillas ' reports of distress in Napoleon 's army , rumors of preparations for leaving Moscow , all confirmed the supposition that the French army was beaten and preparing for flight . 
But these were only suppositions , which seemed important to the younger men but not to Kutuzov . 
With his sixty years ' experience he knew what value to attach to rumors , knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire , and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary . 
And the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it .
