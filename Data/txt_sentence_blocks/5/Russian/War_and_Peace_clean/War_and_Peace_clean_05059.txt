Two girls of about ten and twelve , dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks , were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces . 
The youngest child , a boy of about seven , who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own , was crying in his old nurse 's arms . 
A dirty , barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk , and , having undone her pale-colored plait , was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair . 
The woman 's husband , a short , round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official , with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples , with expressionless face was moving the trunks , which were placed one on another , and was dragging some garments from under them . 
As soon as she saw Pierre , the woman almost threw herself at his feet .
