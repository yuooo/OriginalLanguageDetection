By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking , the wood crackled , the snow was melting , and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down . 
Axes and choppers were plied all around . 
Everything was done without any orders being given . 
Stores of wood were brought for the night , shelters were rigged up for the officers , caldrons were being boiled , and muskets and accouterments put in order . 
The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the Eighth Company as a shelter from the north , propped up by musket rests , and a campfire was built before it .
