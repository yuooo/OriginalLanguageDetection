For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability , history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with , that for history this question does not refer to the essence of man 's free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions . 
In regard to this question , history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science . 
The subject for history is not man 's will itself but our presentation of it . 
And so for history , the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology , ethics , and philosophy . 
History surveys a presentation of man 's life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place .
