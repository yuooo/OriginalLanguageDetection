And all this was found in Alexander I ; all this had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life : his education , his early liberalism , the advisers who surrounded him , and by Austerlitz , and Tilsit , and Erfurt . 
During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed . 
But as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and , uniting the nations of Europe , led them to the goal . 
The goal is reached . 
After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all possible power .
