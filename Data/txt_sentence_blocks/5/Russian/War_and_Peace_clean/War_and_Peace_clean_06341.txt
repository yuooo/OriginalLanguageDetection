They say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them . 
But in that case , if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves , what significance have those leaders ? 
The leaders , these historians tell us , express the will of the people : the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people . 
But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people 's will or only some part of it . 
If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people 's will , as some historians suppose , then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation , which is evident nonsense ; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people 's life , as other so-called `` philosophical '' historians believe , then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation 's life , we have first of all to know in what the nation 's life consists .
