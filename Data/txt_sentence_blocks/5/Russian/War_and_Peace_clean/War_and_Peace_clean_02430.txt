Freemasonry , at any rate as he saw it here , sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals . 
He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself , but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles . 
And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order . 
In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg . 
Our Freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons , had been initiated into many mysteries , had been raised to a higher grade , and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia .
