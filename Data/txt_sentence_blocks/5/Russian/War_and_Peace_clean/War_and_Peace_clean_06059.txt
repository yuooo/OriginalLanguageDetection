I do not know why a certain event occurs ; I think that I can not know it ; so I do not try to know it and I talk about chance . 
I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies ; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of genius . 
To a herd of rams , the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius . 
And it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram , who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats -- that this very ram , swelling with fat , is killed for meat . 
But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims ; they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken , and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened .
