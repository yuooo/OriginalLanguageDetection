Involuntarily recalling his wife 's past and her relations with Dolokhov , Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true , or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife . 
He involuntarily remembered how Dolokhov , who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign , had returned to Petersburg and come to him . 
Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion , Dolokhov had come straight to his house , and Pierre had put him up and lent him money . 
Pierre recalled how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov 's living at their house , and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife 's beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day . 
`` Yes , he is very handsome , '' thought Pierre , `` and I know him .
