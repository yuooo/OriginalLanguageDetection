History examines the manifestations of man 's free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause , that is , it defines this freedom by the laws of reason , and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws . 
The recognition of man 's free will as something capable of influencing historical events , that is , as not subject to laws , is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy . 
That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws , that is , of any science whatever . 
If there is even a single body moving freely , then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists . 
If any single action is due to free will , then not a single historical law can exist , nor any conception of historical events .
