There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease . 
It was the state of the soldiers ' boots . 
More than half the men 's boots were in holes . 
But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander , for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat , and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles . 
The commander of the regiment was an elderly , choleric , stout , and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers , and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders .
