Oh , my friend ! 
Religion , and religion alone , can -- I will not say comfort us -- but save us from despair . 
Religion alone can explain to us what without its help man can not comprehend : why , for what cause , kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life -- not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others -- are called away to God , while cruel , useless , harmful persons , or such as are a burden to themselves and to others , are left living . 
The first death I saw , and one I shall never forget -- that of my dear sister-in-law -- left that impression on me . 
Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die , so I asked why that angel Lise , who not only never wronged anyone , but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts , had to die .
