Another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit , and feeding the horses . 
A third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers , carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts , and dragging away boards , dry wood , and thatch from the roofs , for the campfires , or wattle fences to serve for shelter . 
Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed , the roof of which had already been removed . 
`` Now then , all together -- shove ! '' 
cried the voices , and the huge surface of the wall , sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost , was seen swaying in the gloom of the night .
