A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls ' voices came from the adjoining room . 
The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue , of ribbons , black hair , and merry faces . 
It was Natasha , Sonya , and Petya , who had come to see whether they were getting up . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Get up ! ''
