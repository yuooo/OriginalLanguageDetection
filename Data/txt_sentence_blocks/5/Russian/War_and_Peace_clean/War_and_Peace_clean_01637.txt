His head was burning , he felt himself bleeding to death , and he saw above him the remote , lofty , and everlasting sky . 
He knew it was Napoleon -- his hero -- but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small , insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it . 
At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him , or what was said of him ; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life , which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently . 
He collected all his strength , to stir and utter a sound . 
He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak , sickly groan which aroused his own pity .
