He knew that she had not sung since her illness , and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him . 
He opened the door softly and saw her , in the lilac dress she had worn at church , walking about the room singing .

`` I want to try to sing again , '' she said , adding as if by way of excuse , `` it is , at least , something to do . '' 
`` That 's capital ! ''
