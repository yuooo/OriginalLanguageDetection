In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm -- news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor 's return -- was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly , though with much caution . 
Anna Pavlovna 's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients . 
Prince Vasili , who still occupied his former important posts , formed a connecting link between these two circles . 
He visited his `` good friend Anna Pavlovna '' as well as his daughter 's `` diplomatic salon , '' and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at Helene 's what he should have said at Anna Pavlovna 's and vice versa . 
Soon after the Emperor 's return Prince Vasili in a conversation about the war at Anna Pavlovna 's severely condemned Barclay de Tolly , but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief .
