Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed the refined Polish ladies by her massive , so called Russian type of beauty . 
The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance . 
Boris Drubetskoy , having left his wife in Moscow and being for the present en garcon -LRB- as he phrased it -RRB- , was also there and , though not an aide-de-camp , had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses . 
Boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age . 
He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past , but as Helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only recently married , they met as good friends of long standing .
