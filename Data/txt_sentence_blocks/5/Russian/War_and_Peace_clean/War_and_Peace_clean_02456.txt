I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers . 
In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about B. , and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it . 
I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind . 
Great God , help me to walk in Thy paths , -LRB- 1 -RRB- to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation , -LRB- 2 -RRB- to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion , -LRB- 3 -RRB- to withdraw from worldliness , but not avoid -LRB- a -RRB- the service of the state , -LRB- b -RRB- family duties , -LRB- c -RRB- relations with my friends , and the management of my affairs . 
27th November I got up late .
