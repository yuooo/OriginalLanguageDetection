Popes , kings , and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land ; but the people did not go , for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed . 
The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples . 
And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers , but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown . 
Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples . 
The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer .
