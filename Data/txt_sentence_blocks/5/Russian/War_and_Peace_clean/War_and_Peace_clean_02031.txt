`` Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion ? '' 
`` No , I considered it erroneous and did not follow it , '' said Pierre , so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying . 
`` I have been an atheist , '' answered Pierre . 
`` You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life , therefore you seek wisdom and virtue . 
Is that not so ? ''
