The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals , gentlemen-in-waiting , and Polish magnates -- several of whom Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia -- were waiting . 
Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride . 
After some minutes , the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and , bowing politely , asked Balashev to follow him . 
Balashev went into a small reception room , one door of which led into a study , the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission . 
He stood a minute or two , waiting .
