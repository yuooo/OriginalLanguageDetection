Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen . 
But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there , only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds . 
He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds , but the farther he went the more disorganized they were . 
The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches , carriages of all sorts , and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms , some wounded and some not . 
This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights .
