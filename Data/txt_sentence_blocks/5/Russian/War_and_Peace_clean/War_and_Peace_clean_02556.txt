Some ladies , with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum , pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets . 
The men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise . 
Everyone moved back , and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music . 
The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina ; then came ambassadors , ministers , and various generals , whom Peronskaya diligently named . 
More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up , or preparing to take up , their positions for the polonaise .
