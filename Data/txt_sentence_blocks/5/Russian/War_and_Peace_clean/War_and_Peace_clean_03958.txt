For some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the village Elder , Dron , whom the old prince called by the diminutive `` Dronushka . '' 
Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy , without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth , as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty . 
Soon after the migration to the `` warm rivers , '' in which he had taken part like the rest , Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Bogucharovo , and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years . 
The peasants feared him more than they did their master . 
The masters , both the old prince and the young , and the steward respected him and jestingly called him `` the Minister . ''
