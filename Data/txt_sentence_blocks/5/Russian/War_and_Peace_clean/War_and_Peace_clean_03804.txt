Quicker , quicker -- and that they should leave me in peace ! '' 
Bald Hills , Prince Nicholas Bolkonski 's estate , lay forty miles east from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow . 
The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpatych , Dessalles , having asked to see Princess Mary , told her that , as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety , though from Prince Andrew 's letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous , he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at Smolensk , asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed . 
Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary , she signed it , and it was given to Alpatych with instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger . 
Having received all his orders Alpatych , wearing a white beaver hat - a present from the prince -- and carrying a stick as the prince did , went out accompanied by his family .
