The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow , and the most diverse people met at their suppers . 
Country neighbors from Otradnoe , impoverished old squires and their daughters , Peronskaya a maid of honor , Pierre Bezukhov , and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg . 
Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostovs ' house in Petersburg were Boris , Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him , and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs ' and paid the eldest daughter , Countess Vera , the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose . 
Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left . 
He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed , and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz .
