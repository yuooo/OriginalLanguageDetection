That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron 's officers in Denisov 's quarters . 
`` And I tell you , Rostov , that you must apologize to the colonel ! '' 
said a tall , grizzly-haired staff captain , with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features , to Rostov who was crimson with excitement . 
The staff captain , Kirsten , had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission . 
`` I will allow no one to call me a liar ! ''
