In reality , however , it was not , and could not be , possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual , or any group of people , responsible for it . 
Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn , quite apart from whether it had , or had not , a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines . 
Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days . 
A town built of wood , where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present , can not help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes , make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square , and cook themselves meals twice a day . 
In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases .
