As a result of this , he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by `` Uncle 's '' borzois . 
Daniel galloped up silently , holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail . 
Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut , breathing heavily , panted past him , and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel lying on the wolf 's back among the dogs , trying to seize her by the ears . 
It was evident to the dogs , the hunters , and to the wolf herself that all was now over . 
The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise , but the borzois stuck to her .
