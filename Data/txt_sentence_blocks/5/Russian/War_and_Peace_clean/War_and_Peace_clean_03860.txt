The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain . 
The marshes dried up . 
The cattle lowed from hunger , finding no food on the sun-parched meadows . 
Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness . 
But on the road , the highroad along which the troops marched , there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest ; the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep .
