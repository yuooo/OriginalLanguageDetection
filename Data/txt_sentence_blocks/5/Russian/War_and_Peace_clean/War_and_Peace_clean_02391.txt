Count Arakcheev 's anteroom had quite a special character . 
The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility ; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness , covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves , their situation , and the person for whom they were waiting . 
Some walked thoughtfully up and down , others whispered and laughed . 
Prince Andrew heard the nickname `` Sila Andreevich '' and the words , `` Uncle will give it to us hot , '' in reference to Count Arakcheev . 
One general -LRB- an important personage -RRB- , evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long , sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself .
