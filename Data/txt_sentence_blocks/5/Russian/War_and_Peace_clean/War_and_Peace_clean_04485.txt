The European system was already founded ; all that remained was to organize it . 
Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere , I too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance .

Europe would in this way soon have been , in fact , but one people , and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland .
