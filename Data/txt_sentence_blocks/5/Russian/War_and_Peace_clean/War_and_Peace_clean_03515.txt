Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track . 
Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia . 
While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov , his former commander who was always well disposed toward him , and Kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia , to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief . 
So Prince Andrew , having received an appointment on the headquarters staff , left for Turkey .
