Denisov , flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief , sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening . 
For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own or at Dolokhov 's home : on the third day he received a note from him : As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of , and am going to rejoin my regiment , I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friends -- come to the English Hotel . 
About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the theater , where he had been with his family and Denisov . 
He was at once shown to the best room , which Dolokhov had taken for that evening . 
Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat between two candles .
