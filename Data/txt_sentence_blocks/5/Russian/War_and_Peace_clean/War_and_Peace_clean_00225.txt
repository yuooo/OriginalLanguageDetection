When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory . 
There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room , waiting for Boris to come out . 
She was already growing impatient , and stamped her foot , ready to cry at his not coming at once , when she heard the young man 's discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly . 
At this Natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there . 
Boris paused in the middle of the room , looked round , brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform , and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face .
