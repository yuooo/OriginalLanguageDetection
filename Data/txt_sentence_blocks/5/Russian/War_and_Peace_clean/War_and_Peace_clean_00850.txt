The snow was thawing in the sunshine , the horses galloped quickly , and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds , fields , and villages . 
At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded . 
The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart , shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse . 
In each of the long German carts six or more pale , dirty , bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road . 
Some of them were talking -LRB- he heard Russian words -RRB- , others were eating bread ; the more severely wounded looked silently , with the languid interest of sick children , at the envoy hurrying past them .
