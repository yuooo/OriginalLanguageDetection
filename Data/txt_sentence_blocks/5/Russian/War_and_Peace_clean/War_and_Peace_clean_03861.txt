As soon as day dawned the march began . 
The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels , and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft , choking , hot dust that never cooled even at night . 
Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels , while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops , settling in eyes , ears , hair , and nostrils , and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road . 
The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust , and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun , which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky . 
There was no wind , and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere .
