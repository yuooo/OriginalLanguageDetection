That is our common misfortune , and I shall grudge nothing to help you . 
I am myself going away because it is dangerous here ... the enemy is near ... because ... I am giving you everything , my friends , and I beg you to take everything , all our grain , so that you may not suffer want ! 
And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here -- that is not true . 
On the contrary , I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow , and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing . 
You shall be given food and lodging . ''
