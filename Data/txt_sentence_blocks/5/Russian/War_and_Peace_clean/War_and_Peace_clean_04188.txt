`` I 'm galloping to the commander of the corps . 
How do matters stand ? 
... You know , Count , there 'll be a battle tomorrow . 
Out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded , and we have n't stretchers , or bunks , or dressers , or doctors enough for six thousand . 
We have ten thousand carts , but we need other things as well -- we must manage as best we can ! ''
