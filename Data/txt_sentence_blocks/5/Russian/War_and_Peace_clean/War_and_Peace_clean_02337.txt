Napoleon , without looking , pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them . 
Then he approached Lazarev -LRB- who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch -RRB- , looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally , and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lazarev 's buttons . 
It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier 's breast for the soldier to be forever happy , rewarded , and distinguished from everyone else in the world . 
Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev 's breast and , dropping his hand , turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there . 
And it really did .
