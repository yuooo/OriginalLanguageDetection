He had a dim perception of the following budget : About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank , about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow , the town house , and the allowance to the three princesses ; about 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums ; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess ; about 70,00 went for interest on debts . 
The building of a new church , previously begun , had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years , and he did not know how the rest , about 100,000 rubles , was spent , and almost every year he was obliged to borrow . 
Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests , or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops . 
So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination -- practical business . 
He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward .
