And since it had to be so , Nicholas Rostov , as was natural to him , felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life . 
On his return from his furlough Nicholas , having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades , was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders . 
During his absence he had been promoted captain , and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers , he was again allotted his old squadron . 
The campaign began , the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay , new officers arrived , new men and horses , and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war , and Rostov , conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment , devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service , though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them . 
The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of state , political and strategic .
