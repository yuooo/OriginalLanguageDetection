`` Well , lad , '' and a smile changed the tone of his voice `` we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing ! 
If it had not been for my sin , my brother would have had to go as a soldier . 
But he , my younger brother , had five little ones , while I , you see , only left a wife behind . 
We had a little girl , but God took her before I went as a soldier . 
I come home on leave and I 'll tell you how it was , I look and see that they are living better than before .
