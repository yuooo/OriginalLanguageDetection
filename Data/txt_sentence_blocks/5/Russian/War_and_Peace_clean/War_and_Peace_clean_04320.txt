The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodino not because of Napoleon 's orders but by their own volition . 
The whole army -- French , Italian , German , Polish , and Dutch -- hungry , ragged , and weary of the campaign , felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk . 
Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians , they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable . 
When they heard Napoleon 's proclamation offering them , as compensation for mutilation and death , the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before Moscow , they cried `` Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
just as they had cried `` Vive l'Empereur ! ''
