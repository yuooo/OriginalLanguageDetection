As this Apsheron battalion marched by , the red-faced Miloradovich , without his greatcoat , with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back , galloped strenuously forward , and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the Emperor . 
`` God be with you , general ! '' 
said the Emperor . 
`` Ma foi , sire , nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite , sire , '' * he answered gaily , raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the Tsar 's suite by his poor French . 
* `` Indeed , Sire , we shall do everything it is possible to do , Sire . ''
