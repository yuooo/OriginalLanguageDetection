To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement . 
Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse , Praskovya Savishna , who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it , appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head . 
`` I 've come to sit with you a bit , Masha , '' said the nurse , `` and here I 've brought the prince 's wedding candles to light before his saint , my angel , '' she said with a sigh . 
`` Oh , nurse , I 'm so glad ! '' 
`` God is merciful , birdie . ''
