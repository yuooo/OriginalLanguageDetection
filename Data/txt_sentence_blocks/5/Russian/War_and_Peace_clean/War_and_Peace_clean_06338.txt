Recognizing the falsity of this view of history , another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers , and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them . 
But what this program consists in these historians do not say , or if they do they continually contradict one another . 
Each historian , according to his view of what constitutes a nation 's progress , looks for these conditions in the greatness , wealth , freedom , or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country . 
But not to mention the historians ' contradictions as to the nature of this program -- or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists -- the facts of history almost always contradict that theory . 
If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth , freedom , and enlightenment of the people , how is it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly , while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people ?
