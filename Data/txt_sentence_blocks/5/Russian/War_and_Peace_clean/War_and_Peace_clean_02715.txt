Not only do we know this ourselves , but Christ , the Son of God , came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation ; yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it . 
`` How is it that no one realizes this ? '' 
thought Princess Mary . 
`` No one except these despised God 's folk who , wallet on back , come to me by the back door , afraid of being seen by the prince , not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him to sin . 
To leave family , home , and all the cares of worldly welfare , in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name , doing no one any harm but praying for all - for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one : higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth !
