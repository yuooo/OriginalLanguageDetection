And before Rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog , there was a flash , followed by a report , and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing . 
Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan . 
Rostov turned his horse and galloped back . 
Four more reports followed at intervals , and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones . 
Rostov reined in his horse , whose spirits had risen , like his own , at the firing , and went back at a footpace .
