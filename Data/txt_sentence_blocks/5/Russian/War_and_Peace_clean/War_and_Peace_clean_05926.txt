As before he was absent-minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own . 
The difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him , he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance . 
At present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes , but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said , though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different . 
Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man , and so people had been inclined to avoid him . 
Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips , and sympathy for others , shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was , and people felt pleased by his presence .
