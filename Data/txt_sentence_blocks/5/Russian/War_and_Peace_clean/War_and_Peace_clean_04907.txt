How much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned , wooden town where foreign troops are quartered . 
`` Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine '' and the barbarity of the French were not to blame in the matter . 
Moscow was set on fire by the soldiers ' pipes , kitchens , and campfires , and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own . 
Even if there was any arson -LRB- which is very doubtful , for no one had any reason to burn the houses -- in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do -RRB- , arson can not be regarded as the cause , for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism . 
* To Rostopchin 's ferocious patriotism .
