I am , etc. , -LRB- signed -RRB- Alexander At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June , the Emperor , having sent for Balashev and read him his letter to Napoleon , ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor . 
When dispatching Balashev , the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon . 
Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon , because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made , but he definitely instructed Balashev to repeat them personally to Napoleon . 
Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth , accompanied by a bugler and two Cossacks , Balashev reached the French outposts at the village of Rykonty , on the Russian side of the Niemen , by dawn . 
There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels .
