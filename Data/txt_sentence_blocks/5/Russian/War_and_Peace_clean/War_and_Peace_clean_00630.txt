shouted the signaler at that moment . 
The regimental commander , flushing , ran to his horse , seized the stirrup with trembling hands , threw his body across the saddle , righted himself , drew his saber , and with a happy and resolute countenance , opening his mouth awry , prepared to shout . 
The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless . 
`` Att-ention ! '' 
shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself , severity for the regiment , and welcome for the approaching chief .
