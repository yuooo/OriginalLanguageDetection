I will tell you the truth . 
In the first place I like her very much , I feel drawn to her ; and then , after I met her under such circumstances -- so strangely , the idea often occurred to me : ` This is fate . ' 
Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it ; but I had never happened to meet her before , somehow it had always happened that we did not meet . 
And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her . 
And it must needs happen that I should meet her just when Natasha 's engagement had been broken off ... and then everything ... So you see ... I never told this to anyone and never will , only to you . ''
