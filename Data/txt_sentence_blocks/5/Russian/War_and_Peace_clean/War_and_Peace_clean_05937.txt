He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters , but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done . 
The first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner , a colonel , came to him and , after talking a great deal about his exploits , concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children . 
Pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort , and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult . 
At the same time that he refused the colonel 's demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving Orel , to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need . 
A further proof to Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his wife 's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow .
