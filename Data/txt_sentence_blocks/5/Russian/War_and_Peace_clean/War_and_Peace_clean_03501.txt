When Balashev had ended , Napoleon again took out his snuffbox , sniffed at it , and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal . 
The door opened , a gentleman-in-waiting , bending respectfully , handed the Emperor his hat and gloves ; another brought him a pocket handkerchief . 
Napoleon , without giving them a glance , turned to Balashev : `` Assure the Emperor Alexander from me , '' said he , taking his hat , `` that I am as devoted to him as before : I know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities . 
I will detain you no longer , General ; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor . '' 
And Napoleon went quickly to the door .
