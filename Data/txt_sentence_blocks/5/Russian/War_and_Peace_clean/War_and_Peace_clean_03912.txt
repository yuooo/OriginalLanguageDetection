Napoleon rode on , dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination , and `` the bird restored to its native fields '' galloped to our outposts , inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades . 
What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling . 
He found the Cossacks , inquired for the regiment operating with Platov 's detachment and by evening found his master , Nicholas Rostov , quartered at Yankovo . 
Rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin ; he let Lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him . 
Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed .
