All that struck the eye was a strong , handsome , and fertile woman . 
The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now . 
That happened only when , as was the case that day , her husband returned home , or a sick child was convalescent , or when she and Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew -LRB- she never mentioned him to her husband , who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew 's memory -RRB- , or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing , a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage . 
At the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome , fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days . 
Since their marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow , in Petersburg , on their estate near Moscow , or with her mother , that is to say , in Nicholas ' house .
