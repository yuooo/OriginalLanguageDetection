He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments , carts , guns , artillery , and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road , three and sometimes four abreast . 
From all sides , behind and before , as far as ear could reach , there were the rattle of wheels , the creaking of carts and gun carriages , the tramp of horses , the crack of whips , shouts , the urging of horses , and the swearing of soldiers , orderlies , and officers . 
All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen , some flayed , some not , and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something , and again soldiers straggling from their companies , crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages , or returned from them dragging sheep , fowls , hay , and bulging sacks . 
At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant . 
Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves .
