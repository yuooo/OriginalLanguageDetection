Princess Mary , having learned of her brother 's wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of him , prepared -LRB- so Nicholas heard , he had not seen her again himself -RRB- to set off in search of Prince Andrew . 
When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the abandonment of Moscow , Rostov was not seized with despair , anger , the desire for vengeance , or any feeling of that kind , but everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome , and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness . 
The conversations he heard seemed to him insincere ; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him . 
He made haste to finish buying the horses , and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster . 
A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving , at which Nicholas was present , was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory .
