A husband was given her and he gave her a family . 
And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband , but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family , she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different . 
Natasha did not care for society in general , but prized the more the society of her relatives -- Countess Mary , and her brother , her mother , and Sonya . 
She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown , and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby 's napkin , and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better . 
To such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair , her ill-chosen words , and her jealousy - she was jealous of Sonya , of the governess , and of every woman , pretty or plain -- were habitual subjects of jest to those about her .
