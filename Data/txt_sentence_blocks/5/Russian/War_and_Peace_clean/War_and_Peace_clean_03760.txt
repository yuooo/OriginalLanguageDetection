Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia , and this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel , others to a certain Frenchman , others to Toll , and others again to Alexander himself - pointing to notes , projects , and letters which contain hints of such a line of action . 
But all these hints at what happened , both from the French side and the Russian , are advanced only because they fit in with the event . 
Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten , as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them . 
There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say : `` I said then that it would be so , '' quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect . 
Conjectures as to Napoleon 's awareness of the danger of extending his line , and -LRB- on the Russian side -RRB- as to luring the enemy into the depths of Russia , are evidently of that kind , and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals , or such plans to the Russian commanders .
