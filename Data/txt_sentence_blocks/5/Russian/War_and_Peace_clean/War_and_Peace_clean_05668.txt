Petya wished to say `` Good night '' but could not utter a word . 
The officers were whispering together . 
Dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still , then he rode out of the yard at a footpace . 
Petya rode beside him , longing to look round to see whether or no the French were running after them , but not daring to . 
Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the open country , but through the village .
