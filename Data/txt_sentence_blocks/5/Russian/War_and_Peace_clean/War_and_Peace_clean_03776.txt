We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor . 
`` My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns , but the news which I have inspires me yet more . 
`` You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski , embracing his two sons and saying : ' I will perish with them but we will not be shaken ! ' 
And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we , we were unshakable . 
We pass the time as we can , but in war as in war !
