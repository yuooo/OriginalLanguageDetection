After a while `` Uncle '' came in , in a Cossack coat , blue trousers , and small top boots . 
And Natasha felt that this costume , the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe , was just the right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat . 
`` Uncle '' too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brother 's and sister 's laughter -LRB- it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life -RRB- he himself joined in the merriment . 
`` That 's right , young countess , that 's it , come on ! 
I never saw anyone like her ! ''
