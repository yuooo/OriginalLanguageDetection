The man who had devastated France returns to France alone , without any conspiracy and without soldiers . 
Any guard might arrest him , but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later . 
This man is still needed to justify the final collective act . 
That act is performed . 
The last role is played .
