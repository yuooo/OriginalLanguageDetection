Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked . 
He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class , and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid . 
The whole summer , from spring sowing to harvest , he was busy with the work on his farm . 
In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness -- leaving home for a month , or even two , with his hunt . 
In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading .
