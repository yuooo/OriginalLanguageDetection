The morning was bright , he had a good horse under him , and his heart was full of joy and happiness . 
On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line . 
At first he rode along the line of Bagration 's troops , which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless ; then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov 's cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle ; having passed Uvarov 's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him . 
The firing grew louder and louder . 
In the fresh morning air were now heard , not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before , followed by one or two cannon shots , but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen , interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar .
