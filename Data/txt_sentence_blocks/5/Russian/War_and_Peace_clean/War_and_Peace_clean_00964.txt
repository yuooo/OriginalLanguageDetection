Bagration was to make this march without resting , and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear , and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible . 
Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim . 
Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills , with his hungry , ill-shod soldiers , and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way , Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from Vienna . 
Kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim . 
Hence Bagration with his four thousand hungry , exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn , which was clearly impossible .
