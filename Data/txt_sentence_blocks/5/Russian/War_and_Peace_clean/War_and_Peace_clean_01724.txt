On all sides , new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz . 
One had saved a standard , another had killed five Frenchmen , a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded . 
Berg was mentioned , by those who did not know him , as having , when wounded in the right hand , taken his sword in the left , and gone forward . 
Of Bolkonski , nothing was said , and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young , leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father . 
On that third of March , all the rooms in the English Club were filled with a hum of conversation , like the hum of bees swarming in springtime .
