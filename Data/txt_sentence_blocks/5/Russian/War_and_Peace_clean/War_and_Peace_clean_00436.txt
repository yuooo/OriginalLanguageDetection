As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy . 
He noticed that they whispered to one another , casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility . 
A deference such as he had never before received was shown him . 
A strange lady , the one who had been talking to the priests , rose and offered him her seat ; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped ; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by , and moved to make way for him . 
At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady , and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way ; but all at once he felt that this would not do , and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him , and that he was therefore bound to accept their services .
