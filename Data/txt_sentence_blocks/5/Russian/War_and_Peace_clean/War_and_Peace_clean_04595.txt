The troops were moving on , leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them . 
There were wounded in the yards , at the windows of the houses , and the streets were crowded with them . 
In the streets , around carts that were to take some of the wounded away , shouts , curses , and blows could be heard . 
Pierre offered the use of his carriage , which had overtaken him , to a wounded general he knew , and drove with him to Moscow . 
On the way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew .
