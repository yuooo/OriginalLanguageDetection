Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men , Kutuzov , with his suite diminished by more than half , rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by . 
Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives , Prince Andrew , trying to keep near Kutuzov , saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it . 
Higher up stood some Russian infantry , neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd . 
A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutuzov . 
Of Kutuzov 's suite only four remained .
