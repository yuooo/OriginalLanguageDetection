`` It 's because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles '' -LRB- that was how Petya described his namesake , the new Count Bezukhov -RRB- `` and now she 's in love with that singer '' -LRB- he meant Natasha 's Italian singing master -RRB- , `` that 's why she 's ashamed ! ''

`` Not more stupid than you , madam , '' said the nine-year-old Petya , with the air of an old brigadier .
