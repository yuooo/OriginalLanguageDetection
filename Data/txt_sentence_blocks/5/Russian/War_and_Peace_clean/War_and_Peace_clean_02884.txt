This match was with Julie Karagina , the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents , a girl the Rostovs had known from childhood , and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers . 
The countess had written direct to Julie 's mother in Moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her . 
Karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable , and everything depend on her daughter 's inclination . 
She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow . 
Several times the countess , with tears in her eyes , told her son that now both her daughters were settled , her only wish was to see him married .
