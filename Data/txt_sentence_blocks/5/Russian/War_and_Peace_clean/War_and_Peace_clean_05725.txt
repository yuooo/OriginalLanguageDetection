There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up -- head and all -- with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment , telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew . 
It was already past midnight , the hour when Karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively . 
When Pierre reached the fire and heard Platon 's voice enfeebled by illness , and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze , he felt a painful prick at his heart . 
His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away , but there was no other fire , and Pierre sat down , trying not to look at Platon . 
`` Well , how are you ? ''
