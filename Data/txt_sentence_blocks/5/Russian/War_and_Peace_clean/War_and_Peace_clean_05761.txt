After staggering into Smolensk which seemed to them a promised land , the French , searching for food , killed one another , sacked their own stores , and when everything had been plundered fled farther . 
They all went without knowing whither or why they were going . 
Still less did that genius , Napoleon , know it , for no one issued any orders to him . 
But still he and those about him retained their old habits : wrote commands , letters , reports , and orders of the day ; called one another sire , mon cousin , prince d'Eckmuhl , roi de Naples , and so on . 
But these orders and reports were only on paper , nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out , and though they entitled one another Majesties , Highnesses , or Cousins , they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay .
