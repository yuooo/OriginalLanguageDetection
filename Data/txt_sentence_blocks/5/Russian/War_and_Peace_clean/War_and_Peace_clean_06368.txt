-LRB- 2 -RRB- The movement of nations is caused not by power , nor by intellectual activity , nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed , but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events , and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa . 
Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event ; physically it is those who submit to the power . 
But as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical , the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two .

In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity -- that final limit to which in every domain of thought man 's reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject .
