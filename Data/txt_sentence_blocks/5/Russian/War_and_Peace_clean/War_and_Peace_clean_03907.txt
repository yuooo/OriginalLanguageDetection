`` Yes , a Cossack , your Honor . '' 
`` The Cossack , not knowing in what company he was , for Napoleon 's plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind the presence of a monarch , talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war , '' says Thiers , narrating this episode . 
In reality Lavrushka , having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless , had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens , where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner . 
Lavrushka was one of those coarse , bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things , consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way , are ready to render any sort of service to their master , and are keen at guessing their master 's baser impulses , especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness . 
Finding himself in the company of Napoleon , whose identity he had easily and surely recognized , Lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master 's favor .
