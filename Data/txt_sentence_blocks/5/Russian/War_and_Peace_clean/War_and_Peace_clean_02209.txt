And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said , ` Believe in me and I will make you whole . ' 
So he begged : ` Take me to her , take me to her . ' 
It 's the real truth I 'm telling you , I saw it myself . 
So he was brought , quite blind , straight to her , and he goes up to her and falls down and says , ` Make me whole , ' says he , ` and I 'll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me . ' 
I saw it myself , master , the star is fixed into the icon .
