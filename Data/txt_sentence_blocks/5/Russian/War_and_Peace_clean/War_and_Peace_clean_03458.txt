They rode through the village of Rykonty , past tethered French hussar horses , past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform , and came out at the other end of the village . 
The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashev and conduct him to his destination . 
The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure . 
They had hardly ridden up a hill , past a tavern , before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them . 
In front of the group , on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun , rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders .
