The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal . 
And the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head . 
When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror : substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes . 
But when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying , besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance , a spiritual wound , which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals , but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch . 
After Prince Andrew 's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt this .
