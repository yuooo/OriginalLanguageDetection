Rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses , their figures , and even their faces , more and more distinctly . 
They were our Horse Guards , advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them . 
The Horse Guards were galloping , but still holding in their horses . 
Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command : `` Charge ! '' 
shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed .
