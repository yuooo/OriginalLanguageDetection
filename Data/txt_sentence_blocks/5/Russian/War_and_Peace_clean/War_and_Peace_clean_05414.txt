Kutuzov did not reply , but when they reported to him that Murat 's troops were in retreat he ordered an advance , though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour . 
The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov 's Cossacks had done : the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly . 
In consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration , and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles , others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades , and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff . 
`` That 's how everything is done with us , all topsy-turvy ! '' 
said the Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle , letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so , just as people speak today .
