It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally , and in the cold , repellent glance the Emperor gave him , he now found further confirmation of this surmise . 
The courtiers explained the Emperor 's neglect of him by His Majesty 's displeasure at Bolkonski 's not having served since 1805 . 
`` I know myself that one can not help one 's sympathies and antipathies , '' thought Prince Andrew , `` so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally , but the project will speak for itself . '' 
He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal , a friend of his father 's . 
The field marshal made an appointment to see him , received him graciously , and promised to inform the Emperor .
