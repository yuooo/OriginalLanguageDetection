`` A forfeit ! '' 
cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called `` mon chevalier , '' and who was going with her to Nizhni . 
In Julie 's set , as in many other circles in Moscow , it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary Contributions . 
`` Another forfeit for a Gallicism , '' said a Russian writer who was present . '' 
` What pleasure is there to be ' is not Russian ! ''
