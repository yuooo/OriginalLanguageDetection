The column moved forward without knowing where and unable , from the masses around them , the smoke and the increasing fog , to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going . 
A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship . 
However far he has walked , whatever strange , unknown , and dangerous places he reaches , just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks , masts , and rigging of his ship , so the soldier always has around him the same comrades , the same ranks , the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich , the same company dog Jack , and the same commanders . 
The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing , but on the day of battle -- heaven knows how and whence -- a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army , announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn , and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity . 
On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment , they listen intently , look about , and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them .
