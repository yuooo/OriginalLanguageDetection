The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew , especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his domestic surroundings , but now he felt disinclined to go to it . 
At the appointed hour , however , he entered the modest house Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens . 
In the parqueted dining room this small house , remarkable for its extreme cleanliness -LRB- suggesting that of a monastery -RRB- , Prince Andrew , who was rather late , found the friendly gathering of Speranski 's intimate acquaintances already assembled at five o'clock . 
There were no ladies present except Speranski 's little daughter -LRB- long-faced like her father -RRB- and her governess . 
The other guests were Gervais , Magnitski , and Stolypin .
