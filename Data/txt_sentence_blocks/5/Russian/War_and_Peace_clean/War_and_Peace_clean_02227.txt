When returning from his leave , Rostov felt , for the first time , how close was the bond that united him to Denisov and and the whole regiment . 
On approaching it , Rostov felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow . 
When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment , when he recognized red-haired Dementyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses , when Lavrushka gleefully shouted to his master , `` The count has come ! '' 
and Denisov , who had been asleep on his bed , ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him , and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival , Rostov experienced the same feeling his mother , his father , and his sister had embraced him , and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak . 
The regiment was also a home , and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents ' house .
