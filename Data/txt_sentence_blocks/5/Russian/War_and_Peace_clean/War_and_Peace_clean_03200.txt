The count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle George 's performance was over . 
Anatole was at the door , evidently on the lookout for the Rostovs . 
Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and followed her . 
As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera -- gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them . 
Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress .
