O God , grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness , and behave so that he too may benefit . 
After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear , `` Thy day ! '' 
I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs , but I went on undismayed . 
Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go . 
I began to throttle it with my hands .
