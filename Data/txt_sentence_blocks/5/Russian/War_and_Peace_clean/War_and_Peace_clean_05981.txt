We were not an exemplary couple , '' he added quickly , glancing at Natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife , `` but her death shocked me terribly . 
When two people quarrel they are always both in fault , and one 's own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive . 
And then such a death ... without friends and without consolation ! 
I am very , very sorry for her , '' he concluded , and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Natasha 's face . 
`` Yes , and so you are once more an eligible bachelor , '' said Princess Mary .
