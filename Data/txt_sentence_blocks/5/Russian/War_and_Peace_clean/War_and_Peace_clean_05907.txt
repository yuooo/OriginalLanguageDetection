Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite - Count Tolstoy , Prince Volkonski , Arakcheev , and others -- the Emperor reached Vilna on the eleventh , and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle . 
In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle , as well as a guard of honor of the Semenov regiment . 
A courier who galloped to the castle in advance , in a troyka with three foam-flecked horses , shouted `` Coming ! '' 
and Konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform Kutuzov , who was waiting in the hall porter 's little lodge . 
A minute later the old man 's large stout figure in full-dress uniform , his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach , waddled out into the porch .
