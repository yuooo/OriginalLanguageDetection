The chief steward , who considered the young count 's attempts almost insane -- unprofitable to himself , to the count , and to the serfs -- made some concessions . 
Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable , he arranged for the erection of large buildings -- schools , hospitals , and asylums -- on all the estates before the master arrived . 
Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes -LRB- which he knew Pierre would not like -RRB- , but for just such gratefully religious ones , with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality , as , according to his understanding of his master , would touch and delude him . 
The southern spring , the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage , and the solitude of the road , all had a gladdening effect on Pierre . 
The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other ; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them .
