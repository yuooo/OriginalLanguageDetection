The whole meaning of life -- not for him alone but for the whole world -- seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her . 
At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only -- his future happiness . 
Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests . 
In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness . 
He often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them .
