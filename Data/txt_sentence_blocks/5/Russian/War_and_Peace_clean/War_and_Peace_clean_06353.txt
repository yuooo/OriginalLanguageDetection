But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another , to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the condition of all that takes place : the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command . 
Only the expression of the will of the Deity , not dependent on time , can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries , and only the Deity , independent of everything , can by His sole will determine the direction of humanity 's movement ; but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs . 
Reinstating the first condition omitted , that of time , we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible . 
No command ever appears spontaneously , or itself covers a whole series of occurrences ; but each command follows from another , and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event . 
When , for instance , we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war , we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another .
