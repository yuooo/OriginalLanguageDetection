These three groups traveling together -- the cavalry stores , the convoy of prisoners , and Junot 's baggage train -- still constituted a separate and united whole , though each of the groups was rapidly melting away . 
Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons , not more than sixty now remained ; the rest had been captured or left behind . 
Some of Junot 's wagons also had been captured or abandoned . 
Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from Davout 's corps . 
From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners , and that one of their comrades , a German soldier , had been shot by the marshal 's own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession .
