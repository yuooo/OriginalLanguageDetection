Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar . 
But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter ; there were no hawkers , nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers -- but only soldiers , in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets , entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles . 
Tradesmen and their assistants -LRB- of whom there were but few -RRB- moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered . 
They unlocked their shops and locked them up again , and themselves carried goods away with the help their assistants . 
On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call .
