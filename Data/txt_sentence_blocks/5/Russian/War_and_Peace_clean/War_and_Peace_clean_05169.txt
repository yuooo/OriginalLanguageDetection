On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov , Princess Mary had found her nephew there with his tutor , and a letter from Prince Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva at Voronezh . 
That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father 's illness , since his death , and especially since her meeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey , anxiety about her brother , settling in a new house , meeting new people , and attending to her nephew 's education .
