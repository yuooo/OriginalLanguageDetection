`` Do n't dare to think about it , '' she said to herself , and sat down again smilingly beside `` Uncle , '' begging him to play something more . 
`` Uncle '' played another song and a valse ; then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song : As 't was growing dark last night Fell the snow so soft and light ... `` Uncle '' sang as peasants sing , with full and naive conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself , and that apart from the words there is no tune , which exists only to give measure to the words . 
As a result of this the unconsidered tune , like the song of a bird , was extraordinarily good . 
Natasha was in ecstasies over `` Uncle 's '' singing .
