Natasha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral Rostov house and estate near Moscow . 
It was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal , and life at Otradnoe was quieter than in former years , but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day . 
These were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the family , or persons who were , it seemed , obliged to live in the count 's house . 
Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife , Vogel the dancing master and his family , Belova , an old maiden lady , an inmate of the house , and many others such as Petya 's tutors , the girls ' former governess , and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count 's house than at home . 
They had not as many visitors as before , but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged .
