`` Erza , darling ! '' 
Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own . 
Erza did not hearken to his appeal . 
At the very moment when she would have seized her prey , the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble . 
Again Erza and Milka were abreast , running like a pair of carriage horses , and began to overtake the hare , but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly .
