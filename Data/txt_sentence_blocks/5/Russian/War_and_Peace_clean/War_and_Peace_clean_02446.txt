My mother-in-law came to me in tears and said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her ; that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion , and much more . 
I knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted . 
In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek . 
Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do . 
I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexeevich 's letters and recalled my conversations with him , and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a suppliant , and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone -- especially to one so closely bound to me -- and that I must bear my cross .
