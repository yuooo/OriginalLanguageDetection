`` The island of Madagascar , '' she said , `` Ma-da-gas-car , '' she repeated , articulating each syllable distinctly , and , not replying to Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying , she went out of the room . 
Her brother Petya was upstairs too ; with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night . 
`` Petya ! 
Petya ! ''
