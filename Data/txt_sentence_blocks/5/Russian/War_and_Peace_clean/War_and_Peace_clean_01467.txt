Weyrother complied and Dohkturov noted them down . 
When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over , Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and , without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular , began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy 's position was assumed to be known , whereas it was perhaps not known , since the enemy was in movement . 
Langeron 's objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother -- who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children - that he had to do , not with fools , but with men who could teach him something in military matters . 
When the monotonous sound of Weyrother 's voice ceased , Kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted . 
He listened to what Langeron said , as if remarking , `` So you are still at that silly business ! ''
