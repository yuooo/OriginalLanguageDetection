There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the Rostov family , many fears that the invitation would not arrive , that the dresses would not be ready , or that something would not be arranged as it should be . 
Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya , a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the Dowager Empress , who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high society , was to accompany them to the ball . 
They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten o'clock , but it was already five minutes to ten , and the girls were not yet dressed . 
Natasha was going to her first grand ball . 
She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day .
