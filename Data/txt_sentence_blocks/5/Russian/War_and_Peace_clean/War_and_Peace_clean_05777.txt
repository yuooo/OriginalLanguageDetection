All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who , when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted , should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head . 
The only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry . 
But not even that could be said for those who drew up this project , for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds . 
But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have been senseless , it was impossible . 
It was impossible first because -- as experience shows that a three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans -- the probability of Chichagov , Kutuzov , and Wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility , as in fact thought Kutuzov , who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results .
