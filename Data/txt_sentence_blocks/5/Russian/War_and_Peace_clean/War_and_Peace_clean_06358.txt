A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone , of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file ; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army , and so on to the apex , the point of which will represent the commander in chief . 
The soldiers , of whom there are the most , form the lower section of the cone and its base . 
The soldier himself does the stabbing , hacking , burning , and pillaging , and always receives orders for these actions from men above him ; he himself never gives an order . 
The noncommissioned officers -LRB- of whom there are fewer -RRB- perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers , but they already give commands . 
An officer still less often acts directly himself , but commands still more frequently .
