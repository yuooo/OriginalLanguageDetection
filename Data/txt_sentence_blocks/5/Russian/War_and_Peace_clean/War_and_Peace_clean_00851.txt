Prince Andrew told his driver to stop , and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded . 
`` Day before yesterday , on the Danube , '' answered the soldier . 
Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces . 
`` That 's for them all , '' he said to the officer who came up . 
`` Get well soon , lads ! ''
