Ermolov , Kaysarov , and Toll , who had just arrived , sat down on this bench . 
In the foremost place , immediately under the icons , sat Barclay de Tolly , his high forehead merging into his bald crown . 
He had a St. George 's Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill . 
He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain . 
Beside him sat Uvarov , who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information , speaking in low tones as they all did .
