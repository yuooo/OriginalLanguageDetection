Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs . 
The price of weapons , of gold , of carts and horses , kept rising , but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling , so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods , such as cloth , and receiving in payment a half of what they carted , while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each , and furniture , mirrors , and bronzes were being given away for nothing .
