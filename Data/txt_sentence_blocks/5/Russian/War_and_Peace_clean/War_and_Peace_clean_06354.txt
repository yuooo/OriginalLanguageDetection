Napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so . 
Today he ordered such and such papers to be written to Vienna , to Berlin , and to Petersburg ; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army , the fleet , the commissariat , and so on and so on -- millions of commands , which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into Russia . 
If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort , and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia , with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance -LRB- a conviction he repeatedly expressed -RRB- -- this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case , but did so correspond in the latter . 
For an order to be certainly executed , it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed . 
But to know what can and what can not be executed is impossible , not only in the case of Napoleon 's invasion of Russia in which millions participated , but even in the simplest event , for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution .
