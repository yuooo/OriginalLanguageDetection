Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov , having received the dispatch and verbal instructions , galloped off to the General Staff accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses . 
It was a warm , dark , autumn night . 
It had been raining for four days . 
Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky , muddy road , Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka after one o'clock at night . 
Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard , GENERAL STAFF , and throwing down his reins , he entered a dark passage .
