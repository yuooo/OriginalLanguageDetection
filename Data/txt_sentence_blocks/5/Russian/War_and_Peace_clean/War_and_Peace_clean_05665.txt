Dolokhov , as if he had not heard the question , did not reply , but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from Cossacks . 
`` Those brigands are everywhere , '' replied an officer from behind the fire . 
Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself , `` but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments ? '' 
he added inquiringly . 
No one replied .
