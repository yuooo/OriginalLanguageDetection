Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society . 
In the President 's chair sat a young man he did not know , with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck . 
On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna 's two years before . 
There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins ' . 
All maintained a solemn silence , listening to the words of the President , who held a mallet in his hand .
