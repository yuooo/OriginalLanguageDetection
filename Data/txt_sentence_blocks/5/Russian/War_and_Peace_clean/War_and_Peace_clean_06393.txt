If we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation , our conception of their inevitability would be still greater . 
The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father , the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company , a drunkard 's relapse into drunkenness , and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause . 
If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development , like a child , a madman , or a simpleton -- then , knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question , we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result . 
On these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes . 
The responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged , and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation , and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action .
