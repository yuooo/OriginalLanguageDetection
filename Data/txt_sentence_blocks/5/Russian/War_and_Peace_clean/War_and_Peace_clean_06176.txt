Their way of life and place of residence , their acquaintances and ties , Natasha 's occupations , the children 's upbringing , were all selected not merely with regard to Pierre 's expressed wishes , but to what Natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be . 
And she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly , and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously . 
When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons . 
Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate , when they had to change the wet nurse three times and Natasha fell ill from despair , Pierre one day told her of Rousseau 's view , with which he quite agreed , that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful . 
When her next baby was born , despite the opposition of her mother , the doctors , and even of her husband himself -- who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself , a thing then unheard of and considered injurious - she insisted on having her own way , and after that nursed all her babies herself .
