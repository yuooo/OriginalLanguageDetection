But no : the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as `` the man who does not give his name , '' and under that appellation , which to Pierre seemed terrible , they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place . 
Pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well . 
He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin 's Field , to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent . 
This was Prince Shcherbitov 's house , where Pierre had often been in other days , and which , as he learned from the talk of the soldiers , was now occupied by the marshal , the Duke of Eckmuhl -LRB- Davout -RRB- . 
They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one .
