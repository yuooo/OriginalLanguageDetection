On Helene 's name day , a small party of just their own people -- as his wife said -- met for supper at Prince Vasili 's . 
All these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening . 
The visitors were seated at supper . 
Princess Kuragina , a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome , was sitting at the head of the table . 
On either side of her sat the more important guests -- an old general and his wife , and Anna Pavlovna Scherer .
