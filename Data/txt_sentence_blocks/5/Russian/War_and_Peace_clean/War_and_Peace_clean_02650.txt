Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings , or his fiancee 's , would not stand a year 's test , or that he -LRB- the old prince himself -RRB- would die before then , and he decided to conform to his father 's wish -- to propose , and postpone the wedding for a year . 
Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostovs , Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg . 
Next day after her talk with her mother Natasha expected Bolkonski all day , but he did not come . 
On the second and third day it was the same . 
Pierre did not come either and Natasha , not knowing that Prince Andrew had gone to see his father , could not explain his absence to herself .
