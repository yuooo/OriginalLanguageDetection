Pierre drank one glass after another , looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window , and listening to their chatter . 
Anatole kept on refilling Pierre 's glass while explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens , an English naval officer , that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out . 
`` Go on , you must drink it all , '' said Anatole , giving Pierre the last glass , `` or I wo n't let you go ! '' 
`` No , I wo n't , '' said Pierre , pushing Anatole aside , and he went up to the window . 
Dolokhov was holding the Englishman 's hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet , addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre .
