A few days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War , Count Arakcheev . 
On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev 's waiting room at nine in the morning . 
He did not know Arakcheev personally , had never seen him , and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man . 
`` He is Minister of War , a man trusted by the Emperor , and I need not concern myself about his personal qualities : he has been commissioned to consider my project , so he alone can get it adopted , '' thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev 's waiting room . 
During his service , chiefly as an adjutant , Prince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men , and the different types of such rooms were well known to him .
