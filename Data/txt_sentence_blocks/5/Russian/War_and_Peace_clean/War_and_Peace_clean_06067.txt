But the once proud and shrewd rulers of France , feeling that their part is played out , are even more bewildered than he , and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power . 
Chance , millions of chances , give him power , and all men as if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power . 
Chance forms the characters of the rulers of France , who submit to him ; chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government ; chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power . 
Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him -- thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right , since he had the might . 
Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against England -LRB- which would inevitably have ruined him -RRB- he never carries out that intention , but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians , who surrender without a battle .
