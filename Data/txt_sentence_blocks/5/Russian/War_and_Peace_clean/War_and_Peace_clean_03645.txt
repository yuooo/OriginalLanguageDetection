Before the end of the fast of St. Peter , Agrafena Ivanovna Belova , a country neighbor of the Rostovs , came to Moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints . 
She suggested that Natasha should fast and prepare for Holy Communion , and Natasha gladly welcomed the idea . 
Despite the doctor 's orders that she should not go out early in the morning , Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament , not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov family by attending three services in their own house , but as Agrafena Ivanovna did , by going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers , Matins , or Mass. . 
The countess was pleased with Natasha 's zeal ; after the poor results of the medical treatment , in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and , though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor , she agreed to Natasha 's wish and entrusted her to Belova . 
Agrafena Ivanovna used to come to wake Natasha at three in the morning , but generally found her already awake .
