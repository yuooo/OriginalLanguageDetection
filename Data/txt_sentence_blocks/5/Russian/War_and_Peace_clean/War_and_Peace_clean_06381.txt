They say this , not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers , but has never been denied . 
They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it . 
For the fact that , from the point of view of observation , reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain , and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time , only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories -- that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity ; but it does not advance by a hair 's breadth the solution of the question , which has another , opposite , side , based on the consciousness of freedom . 
If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time , that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time -LRB- in the first case the unknown quantity is the time , in the second case it is the origin -RRB- ; and the question of how man 's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject can not be solved by comparative physiology and zoology , for in a frog , a rabbit , or an ape , we can observe only the muscular nervous activity , but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity . 
The naturalists and their followers , thinking they can solve this question , are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who , availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work , should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows , icons , woodwork , and still unbuttressed walls , and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers , everything is now so smooth and regular .
