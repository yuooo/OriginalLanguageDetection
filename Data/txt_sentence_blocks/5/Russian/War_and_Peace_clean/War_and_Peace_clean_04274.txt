That 's what I was saying to you -- those German gentlemen wo n't win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can , because they have nothing in their German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and have n't in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow -- that which Timokhin has . 
They have yielded up all Europe to him , and have now come to teach us . 
Fine teachers ! '' 
and again his voice grew shrill . 
`` So you think we shall win tomorrow 's battle ? ''
