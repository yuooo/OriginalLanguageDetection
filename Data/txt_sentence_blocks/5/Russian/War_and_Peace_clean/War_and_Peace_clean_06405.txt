All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability , that is , of consciousness to the laws of reason . 
All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability , or of the essence of life to the laws of reason . 
The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them ; we call those forces gravitation , inertia , electricity , animal force , and so on , but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom . 
But just as the force of gravitation , incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man , is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject -LRB- from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight , up to Newton 's law -RRB- , so too the force of free will , incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious , is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject -LRB- from the fact that every man dies , up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws -RRB- . 
All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason .
