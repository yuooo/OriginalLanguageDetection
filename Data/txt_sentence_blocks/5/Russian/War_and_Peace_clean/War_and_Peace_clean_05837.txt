All along the road groups of French prisoners captured that day -LRB- there were seven thousand of them -RRB- were crowding to warm themselves at campfires . 
Near Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners , buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of , were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed French guns . 
At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who , wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders , moved slowly along the road on his white horse . 
One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured . 
Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying .
