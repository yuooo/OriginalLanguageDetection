The crowd ran after the Emperor , followed him to the palace , and began to disperse . 
It was already late , and Petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration , yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing , but still considerable , crowd before the palace while the Emperor dined -- looking in at the palace windows , expecting he knew not what , and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table , glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows . 
While the Emperor was dining , Valuev , looking out of the window , said : `` The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again . '' 
The dinner was nearly over , and the Emperor , munching a biscuit , rose and went out onto the balcony . 
The people , with Petya among them , rushed toward the balcony .
