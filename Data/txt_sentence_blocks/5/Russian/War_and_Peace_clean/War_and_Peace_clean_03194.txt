Natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman , who was so beautiful and so kind . 
Helene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha and wished to give her a good time . 
Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natasha together , and she was calling on the Rostovs for that purpose . 
The idea of throwing her brother and Natasha together amused her . 
Though at one time , in Petersburg , she had been annoyed with Natasha for drawing Boris away , she did not think of that now , and in her own way heartily wished Natasha well .
