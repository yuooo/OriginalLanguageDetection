Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat 's troops were entering Moscow . 
In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and behind them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite . 
About the middle of the Arbat Street , near the Church of the Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas , Murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel , le Kremlin . 
Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow . 
They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange , long-haired commander dressed up in feathers and gold .
