urged Prince Andrew . 
`` It is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong . 
Men always did and always will err , and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong . '' 
`` What does harm to another is wrong , '' said Pierre , feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused , had begun to talk , and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state .
