The French doctor held no taper ; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he , a foreigner , in spite of all differences of faith , understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it . 
He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life , with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free , and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment . 
The sick man was given something to drink , there was a stir around him , then the people resumed their places and the service continued . 
During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning , and -- with air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them -- did not go up to the dying man , but passed by him , joined the eldest princess , and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings . 
On leaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door , but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded .
