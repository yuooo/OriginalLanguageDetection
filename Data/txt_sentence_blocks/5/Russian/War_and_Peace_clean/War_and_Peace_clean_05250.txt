Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other . 
That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively , but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body .

But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post , and no one drove him away . 
When the pit had been filled up a command was given .
