Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy 's picket line to reconnoiter personally , and twice to the Emperors , Russian and Austrian , to report and explain , and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German , and now , much exhausted , he arrived at Kutuzov 's . 
He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief . 
He interrupted him , talked rapidly and indistinctly , without looking at the man he was addressing , and did not reply to questions put to him . 
He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful , weary , and distracted air , though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident . 
Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman 's castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz .
