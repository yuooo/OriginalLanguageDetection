This was the French drummer boy captured that morning . 
Behind them along the narrow , sodden , cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours , and then Cossacks : some in felt cloaks , some in French greatcoats , and some with horsecloths over their heads . 
The horses , being drenched by the rain , all looked black whether chestnut or bay . 
Their necks , with their wet , close-clinging manes , looked strangely thin . 
Steam rose from them .
