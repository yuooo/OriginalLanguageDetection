Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old maid , '' he would say . 
Or , turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne , he would ask her in Princess Mary 's presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them . 
He continually hurt Princess Mary 's feelings and tormented her , but it cost her no effort to forgive him . 
Could he be to blame toward her , or could her father , whom she knew loved her in spite of it all , be unjust ? 
And what is justice ?
