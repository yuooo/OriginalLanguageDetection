`` Nothing , '' said he and turned again to the horses . 
When they came out onto the beaten highroad -- polished by sleigh runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs , the marks of which were visible in the moonlight -- the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace . 
The near side horse , arching his head and breaking into a short canter , tugged at his traces . 
The shaft horse swayed from side to side , moving his ears as if asking : `` Is n't it time to begin now ? '' 
In front , already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off , the black horses driven by Zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow .
