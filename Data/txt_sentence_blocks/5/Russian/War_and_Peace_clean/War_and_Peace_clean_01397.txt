Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest , his tail extended , Bedouin , as if also conscious of the Emperor 's eye upon him , passed splendidly , lifting his feet with a high and graceful action , as if flying through the air without touching the ground . 
Rostov himself , his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse , rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face `` like a vewy devil , '' as Denisov expressed it . 
`` Fine fellows , the Pavlograds ! '' 
remarked the Emperor . 
`` My God , how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant ! ''
