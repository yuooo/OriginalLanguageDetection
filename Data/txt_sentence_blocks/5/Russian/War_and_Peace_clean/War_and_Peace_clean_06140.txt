He examined the bailiff 's accounts of the village in Ryazan which belonged to his wife 's nephew , wrote two business letters , and walked over to the granaries , cattle yards and stables before dinner . 
Having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint 's day , he returned to dinner , and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons , at which the whole household had assembled . 
At that table were his mother , his mother 's old lady companion Belova , his wife , their three children with their governess and tutor , his wife 's nephew with his tutor , Sonya , Denisov , Natasha , her three children , their governess , and old Michael Ivanovich , the late prince 's architect , who was living on in retirement at Bald Hills . 
Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table . 
When her husband took his place she concluded , from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him , that he was out of humor , as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm -- especially before the soup .
