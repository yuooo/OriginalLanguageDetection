That life of the salons is unchanging . 
Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again , but the salons of Anna Pavlovna Helene remained just as they had been -- the one seven and the other five years before . 
At Anna Pavlovna 's they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte 's successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy , the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna Pavlovna was the representative . 
And in Helene 's salon , which Rumyantsev himself honored with his visits , regarding Helene as a remarkably intelligent woman , they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the `` great nation '' and the `` great man , '' and regretted our rupture with France , a rupture which , according to them , ought to be promptly terminated by peace . 
Of late , since the Emperor 's return from the army , there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another , but each camp retained its own tendency .
