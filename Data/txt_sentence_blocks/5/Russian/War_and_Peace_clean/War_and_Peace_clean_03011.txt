Benefit performances , poor pictures , statues , benevolent societies , gypsy choirs , schools , subscription dinners , sprees , Freemasons , churches , and books -- no one and nothing met with a refusal from him , and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection , he would have given everything away . 
There was never a dinner or soiree at the Club without him . 
As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded , and talking , disputing , and joking began . 
When there were quarrels , his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists . 
The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there .
