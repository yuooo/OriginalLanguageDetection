It was very bitter , but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it , though they were ordered not to do so , as it was a noxious plant . 
That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers , a swelling of the arms , legs , and face , which the doctors attributed to eating this root . 
But in spite of all this , the soldiers of Denisov 's squadron fed chiefly on `` Mashka 's sweet root , '' because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen . 
The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin , though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair . 
Despite this destitution , the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual .
