And such was Natasha , with her surprise , her delight , her shyness , and even her mistakes in speaking French . 
With her he behaved with special care and tenderness , sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters ; he admired her shy grace . 
In the middle of the cotillion , having completed one of the figures , Natasha , still out of breath , was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her . 
She was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining , but immediately put her hand gaily on the man 's shoulder , smiling at Prince Andrew . 
`` I 'd be glad to sit beside you and rest : I 'm tired ; but you see how they keep asking me , and I 'm glad of it , I 'm happy and I love everybody , and you and I understand it all , '' and much , much more was said in her smile .
