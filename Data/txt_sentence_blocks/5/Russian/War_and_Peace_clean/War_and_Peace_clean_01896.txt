Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Denisov 's short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be . 
At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air , suddenly stamped with one foot , bounded from the floor like a ball , and flew round the room taking his partner with him . 
He glided silently on one foot half across the room , and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them , when suddenly , clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs , he stopped short on his heels , stood so a second , stamped on the spot clanking his spurs , whirled rapidly round , and , striking his left heel against his right , flew round again in a circle . 
Natasha guessed what he meant to do , and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how . 
First he spun her round , holding her now with his left , now with his right hand , then falling on one knee he twirled her round him , and again jumping up , dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath , and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps .
