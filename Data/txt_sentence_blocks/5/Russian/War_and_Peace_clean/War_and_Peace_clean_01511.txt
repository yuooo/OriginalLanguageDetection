Napoleon 's proclamation was as follows : Soldiers ! 
The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm . 
They are the same battalions you broke at Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place . 
The position we occupy is a strong one , and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me . 
Soldiers !
