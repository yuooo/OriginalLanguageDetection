On the sloping descent to the Dnieper Alpatych 's cart and that of the innkeeper 's wife , which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles , had to stop . 
In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped , a house and some shops were on fire . 
This fire was already burning itself out . 
The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke , now suddenly flared up again brightly , lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads . 
Black figures flitted about before the fire , and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard .
