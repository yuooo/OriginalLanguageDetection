`` Hey , Ignatka ! 
Go to Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak . 
I have heard what elopements are like , '' continued Dolokhov with a wink . 
`` Why , she 'll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing ; if you delay at all there 'll be tears and ` Papa ' and ` Mamma , ' and she 's frozen in a minute and must go back -- but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh . ''
