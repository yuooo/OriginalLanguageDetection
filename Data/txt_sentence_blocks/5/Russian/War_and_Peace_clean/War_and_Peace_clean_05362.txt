The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and because he was no more . 
The old count cried because he felt that before long , he , too , must take the same terrible step . 
Natasha and Princess Mary also wept now , but not because of their own personal grief ; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence . 
Man 's mind can not grasp the causes of events in their completeness , but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man 's soul . 
And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause , he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says : `` This is the cause ! ''
