Because it was summer , when it is so beautiful out in the fields , the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences , its foul streets , tattered inhabitants , and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about . 
The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces . 
Several bandaged soldiers , with pale swollen faces , were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard . 
Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air . 
On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar .
