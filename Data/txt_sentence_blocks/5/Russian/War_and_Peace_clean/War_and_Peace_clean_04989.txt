At the gate stood Gerasim , the cook , and two Frenchmen . 
Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard . 
They were looking at the glow seen in the town . 
There was nothing terrible in the one small , distant fire in the immense city . 
Gazing at the high starry sky , at the moon , at the comet , and at the glow from the fire , Pierre experienced a joyful emotion .
