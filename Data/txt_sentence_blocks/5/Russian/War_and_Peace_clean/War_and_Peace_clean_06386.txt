Religion , the common sense of mankind , the science of jurisprudence , and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom . 
All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds . 
-LRB- 2 -RRB- His relation to time . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- His relation to the causes leading to the action . 
The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man 's relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him .
