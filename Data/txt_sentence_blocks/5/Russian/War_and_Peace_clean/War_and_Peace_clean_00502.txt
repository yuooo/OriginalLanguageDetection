As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vasili , it is very sad for both . 
Ah , my dear friend , our divine Saviour 's words , that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God , are terribly true . 
I pity Prince Vasili but am still more sorry for Pierre . 
So young , and burdened with such riches -- to what temptations he will be exposed ! 
If I were asked what I desire most on earth , it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar .
