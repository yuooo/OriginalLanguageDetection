`` In our temples we recognize no other distinctions , '' read the Grand Master , `` but those between virtue and vice . 
Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality . 
Fly to a brother 's aid whoever he may be , exhort him who goeth astray , raise him that falleth , never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother . 
Be kindly and courteous . 
Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue .
