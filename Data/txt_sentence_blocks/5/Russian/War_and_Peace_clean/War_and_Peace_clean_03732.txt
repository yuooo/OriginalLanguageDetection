The Emperor 's manifesto was read , evoking enthusiasm , and then all moved about discussing it . 
Besides the ordinary topics of conversation , Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered , when a ball should be given in the Emperor 's honor , whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces ... and so on ; but as soon as the war was touched on , or what the nobility had been convened for , the talk became undecided and indefinite .

Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened .
