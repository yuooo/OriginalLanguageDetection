Some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men . 
The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin , Valuev , and Naryshkin . 
Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets . 
Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz . 
In the third circle , Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals .
