It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow , but perhaps he had simply vanished -- disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness . 
Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him . 
He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible . 
He looked up at the sky . 
And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth .
