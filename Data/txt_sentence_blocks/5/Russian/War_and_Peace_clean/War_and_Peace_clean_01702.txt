After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life , Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again . 
He felt that he had grown up and matured very much . 
His despair at failing in a Scripture examination , his borrowing money from Gavril to pay a sleigh driver , his kissing Sonya on the sly -- he now recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind . 
Now he was a lieutenant of hussars , in a jacket laced with silver , and wearing the Cross of St. George , awarded to soldiers for bravery in action , and in the company of well-known , elderly , and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race . 
He knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening .
