Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her father , and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas -LRB- as his grandfather called him -RRB- . 
The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse Savishna in the late princess ' rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery , taking a mother 's place to her little nephew as best she could . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne , too , seemed passionately fond of the boy , and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel -- as she called her nephew -- and playing with him . 
Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess , and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from Italy , representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards . 
The angel 's upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile , and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel 's face reminded them strangely of the little princess .
