`` How is it pointing ? '' 
asked Nicholas , riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare . 
But before the whip could reply , the hare , scenting the frost coming next morning , was unable to rest and leaped up . 
The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare , and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare . 
All the hunt , who had been moving slowly , shouted , `` Stop ! ''
