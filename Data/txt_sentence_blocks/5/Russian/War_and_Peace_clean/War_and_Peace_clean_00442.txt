By the chair stood the priests , their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments , with lighted tapers in their hands , slowly and solemnly conducting the service . 
A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes , and just in front of them their eldest sister , Catiche , with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons , as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round . 
Anna Mikhaylovna , with a meek , sorrowful , and all-forgiving expression on her face , stood by the door near the strange lady . 
Prince Vasili in front of the door , near the invalid chair , a wax taper in his left hand , was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose , and was crossing himself with his right hand , turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead . 
His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God .
