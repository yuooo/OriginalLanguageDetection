The old count 's troyka , with Dimmler and his party , started forward , squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow , its deep-toned bell clanging . 
The side horses , pressing against the shafts of the middle horse , sank in the snow , which was dry and glittered like sugar , and threw it up . 
Nicholas set off , following the first sleigh ; behind him the others moved noisily , their runners squeaking . 
At first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road . 
While they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight , but as soon as they were past the fence , the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows .
