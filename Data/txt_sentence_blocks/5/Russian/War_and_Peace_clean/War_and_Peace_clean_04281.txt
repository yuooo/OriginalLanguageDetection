And when there was a war , like this one , it would be war ! 
And then the determination of the troops would be quite different . 
Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia , and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why . 
War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life ; and we ought to understand that and not play at war . 
We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously .
