Kutuzov , with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping , was sitting almost asleep in a low chair , with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms . 
At the sound of Weyrother 's voice , he opened his one eye with an effort . 
`` Yes , yes , if you please ! 
It is already late , '' said he , and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye . 
If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was pretending to sleep , the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else -- he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep .
