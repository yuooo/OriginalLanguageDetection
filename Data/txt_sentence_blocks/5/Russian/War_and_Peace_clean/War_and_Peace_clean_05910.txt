When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait , he was arrested by someone 's voice saying : `` Your Serene Highness ! '' 
Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of Count Tolstoy , who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object . 
Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him . 
Suddenly he seemed to remember ; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face , and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver . 
It was the Order of St. George of the First Class .
