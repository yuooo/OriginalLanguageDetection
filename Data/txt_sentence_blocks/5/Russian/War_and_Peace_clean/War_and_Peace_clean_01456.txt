`` Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat , the glory of our Russian arms is secure . 
Except your Kutuzov , there is not a single Russian in command of a column ! 
The commanders are : Herr General Wimpfen , le Comte de Langeron , le Prince de Lichtenstein , le Prince , de Hohenlohe , and finally Prishprish , and so on like all those Polish names . '' 
`` Be quiet , backbiter ! '' 
said Dolgorukov .
