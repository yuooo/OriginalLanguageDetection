Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it . 
`` Thrice have they slain me , thrice have I risen from the dead . 
They stoned me , crucified me ... I shall rise ... shall rise ... shall rise . 
They have torn my body . 
The kingdom of God will be overthrown ... Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it ! ''
