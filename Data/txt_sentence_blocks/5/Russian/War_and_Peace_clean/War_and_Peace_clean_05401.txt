`` Now , remember , '' said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at parting , `` if you have been lying I 'll have you hanged like a dog ; but if it 's true you shall have a hundred gold pieces ! '' 
Without replying , the sergeant , with a resolute air , mounted and rode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled . 
They disappeared into the forest , and Count Orlov-Denisov , having seen Grekov off , returned , shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility , and began looking at the enemy camp , now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires . 
Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right . 
He looked in that direction , but though the columns would have been visible quite far off , they were not to be seen .
