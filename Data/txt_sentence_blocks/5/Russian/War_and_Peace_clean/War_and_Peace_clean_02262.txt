In answer to Rostov 's renewed questions , Denisov said , laughing , that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it , but that it was all nonsense and rubbish , and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial , and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget . 
Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter , but Rostov knew him too well not to detect that -LRB- while hiding it from others -RRB- at heart he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair , which was evidently taking a bad turn . 
Every day , letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived , and on the first of May , Denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office . 
On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars . 
Denisov , as was his wont , rode out in front of the outposts , parading his courage .
