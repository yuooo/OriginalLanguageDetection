Prince Bagration , having reached the highest point of our right flank , began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen . 
The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield . 
They began to meet wounded men . 
One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms . 
There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood .
