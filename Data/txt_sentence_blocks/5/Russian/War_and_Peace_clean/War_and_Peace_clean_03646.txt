She was afraid of being late for Matins . 
Hastily washing , and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla , Natasha , shivering in the fresh air , went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn . 
By Agrafena Ivanovna 's advice Natasha prepared herself not in their own parish , but at a church where , according to the devout Agrafena Ivanovna , the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life . 
There were never many people in the church ; Natasha always stood beside Belova in the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin , let into the screen before the choir on the left side , and a feeling , new to her , of humility before something great and incomprehensible , seized her when at that unusual morning hour , gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window , she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding . 
When she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own .
