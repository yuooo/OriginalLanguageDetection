Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around , and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams , he heard his voice , that kindly , calm , and majestic voice that was yet so simple ! 
And as if in accord with Rostov 's feeling , there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor 's voice . 
`` The Pavlograd hussars ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` The reserves , sire ! ''
