As they took the places vacated by the Uhlans , bullets came from the front , whining and whistling , but fell spent without taking effect . 
The sounds , which he had not heard for so long , had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous sounds of firing . 
Drawing himself up , he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill , and with his whole soul followed the movement of the Uhlans . 
They swooped down close to the French dragoons , something confused happened there amid the smoke , and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back , not to the place they had occupied but more to the left , and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them , in a large group , blue French dragoons on gray horses could be seen . 
Rostov , with his keen sportsman 's eye , was one of the first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans .
