On seeing the young master , the elder one frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree , not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped . 
Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste , unwilling to let them see that they had been observed . 
He was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl , was afraid of looking at her , and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so . 
A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when , seeing these girls , he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him . 
Evidently these girls passionately desired one thing -- to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught -- and Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise .
