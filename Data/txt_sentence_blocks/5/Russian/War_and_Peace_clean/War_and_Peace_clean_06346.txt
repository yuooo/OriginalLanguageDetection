The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people 's will can not be verified , for it never occurred . 
Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs , the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him . 
The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who , watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field , or to the driving of the herdsman , should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head . 
`` The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader . '' 
This is what historians of the first class say -- those who assume the unconditional transference of the people 's will .
