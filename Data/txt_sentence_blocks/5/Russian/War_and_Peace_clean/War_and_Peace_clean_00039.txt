Pierre had been educated abroad , and this reception at Anna Pavlovna 's was the first he had attended in Russia . 
He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and , like a child in a toyshop , did not know which way to look , afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard . 
Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound . 
At last he came up to Morio . 
Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views , as young people are fond of doing .
