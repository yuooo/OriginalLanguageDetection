Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by Morel , who came to say that some Wurttemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain 's horses were . 
This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in French . 
The captain had their senior sergeant called in , and in a stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged , who was his commanding officer , and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied . 
The German who knew little French , answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer , but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said , introducing broken French into his own German , that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another . 
Pierre , who knew German , translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain 's reply to the Wurttemberg hussar in German .
