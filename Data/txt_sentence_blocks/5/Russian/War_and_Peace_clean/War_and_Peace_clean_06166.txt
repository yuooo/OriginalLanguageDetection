Natasha had married in the early spring of 1813 , and in 1820 already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing . 
She had grown stouter and broader , so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust , motherly woman the slim , lively Natasha of former days . 
Her features were more defined and had a calm , soft , and serene expression . 
In her face there was none of the ever-glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm . 
Now her face and body were of all that one saw , and her soul was not visible at all .
