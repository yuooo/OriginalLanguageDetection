The small , muddy , green pond had risen visibly more than a foot , flooding the dam , because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands , necks , and faces , who were splashing about in it . 
All this naked white human flesh , laughing and shrieking , floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can , and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic . 
One fair-haired young soldier of the third company , whom Prince Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg , crossed himself , stepped back to get a good run , and plunged into the water ; another , a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy , stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists . 
There were sounds of men slapping one another , yelling , and puffing . 
Everywhere on the bank , on the dam , and in the pond , there was healthy , white , muscular flesh .
