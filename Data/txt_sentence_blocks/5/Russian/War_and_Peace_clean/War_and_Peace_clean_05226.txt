Pierre was the sixth to enter . 
He was conducted through a glass gallery , an anteroom , and a hall , which were familiar to him , into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant . 
Davout , spectacles on nose , sat bent over a table at the further end of the room . 
Pierre went close up to him , but Davout , evidently consulting a paper that lay before him , did not look up . 
Without raising his eyes , he said in a low voice : `` Who are you ? ''
