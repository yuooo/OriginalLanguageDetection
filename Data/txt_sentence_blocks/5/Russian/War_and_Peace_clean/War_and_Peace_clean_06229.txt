Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork ; Natasha did not take her eyes off her husband . 
Nicholas and Denisov rose , asked for their pipes , smoked , went to fetch more tea from Sonya -- who sat weary but resolute at the samovar -- and questioned Pierre . 
The curly-headed , delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner , starting every now and then and muttering something to himself , and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head , with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar , toward the place where Pierre sat . 
The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power , in which most people see the chief interest of home politics . 
Denisov , dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service , heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid , and made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them .
