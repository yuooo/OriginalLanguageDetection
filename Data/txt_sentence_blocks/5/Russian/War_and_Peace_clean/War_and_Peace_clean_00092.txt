Pierre chimed in , pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement . 
`` One must admit , '' continued Prince Andrew , `` that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola , and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken ; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify . '' 
Prince Andrew , who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre 's remarks , rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go . 
Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend , and asking them all to be seated began : `` I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it . 
Excuse me , Vicomte -- I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost ... '' And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia .
