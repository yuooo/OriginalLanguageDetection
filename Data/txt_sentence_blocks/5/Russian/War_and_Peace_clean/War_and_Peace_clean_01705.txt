At the beginning of March , old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club . 
The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown , giving orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist , the Club 's head cook , about asparagus , fresh cucumbers , strawberries , veal , and fish for this dinner . 
The count had been a member and on the committee of the Club from the day it was founded . 
To him the Club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration , for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed , hospitable scale , and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete . 
The club cook and the steward listened to the count 's orders with pleased faces , for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles .
