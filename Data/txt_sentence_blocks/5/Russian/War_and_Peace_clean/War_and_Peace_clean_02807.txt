At midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees . 
Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips . 
Facing him lay a field of winter rye , there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush . 
The hounds had scarcely been loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew , Voltorn , giving tongue at intervals ; other hounds joined in , now pausing and now again giving tongue . 
A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found , and the whole pack , joining together , rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas .
