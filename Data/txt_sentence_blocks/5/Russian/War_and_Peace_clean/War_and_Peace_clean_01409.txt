It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues . 
That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part . 
At that council , contrary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and Prince Schwartzenberg , it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte . 
The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace to find Dolgorukov . 
Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day 's council , at which the party of the young had triumphed .
