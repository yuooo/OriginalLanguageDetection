It was St. Natalia 's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs -- the mother and the youngest daughter -- both named Nataly . 
Ever since the morning , carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually , bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova 's big house on the Povarskaya , so well known to all Moscow . 
The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the visitors who came to congratulate , and who constantly succeeded one another in relays . 
The countess was a woman of about forty-five , with a thin Oriental type of face , evidently worn out with childbearing -- she had had twelve . 
A languor of motion and speech , resulting from weakness , gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect .
