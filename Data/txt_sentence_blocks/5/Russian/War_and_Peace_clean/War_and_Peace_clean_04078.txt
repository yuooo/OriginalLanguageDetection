This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately , but which still found place in his soul . 
Of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions -- such as the retreat from Smolensk , his visit to Bald Hills , and the recent news of his father 's death -- and had experienced so many emotions , that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind , and now that they did , they did not act on him with nearly their former strength . 
For Denisov , too , the memories awakened by the name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant , romantic past , when after supper and after Natasha 's singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing . 
He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for Natasha , and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively . 
This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat .
