When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to go away , but the officer would not hear of it . 
He was so very polite , amiable , good-natured , and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse , and sat down with him in the parlor -- the first room they entered . 
To Pierre 's assurances that he was not a Frenchman , the captain , evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation , shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so , but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life . 
Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others , and had he at all understood what Pierre 's feelings were , the latter would probably have left him , but the man 's animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre . 
`` A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito , '' said the officer , looking at Pierre 's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger .
