You know that sort of tradesman 's son , a dandy and lady-killer . 
He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him . 
That 's the sort of fellow he is . 
His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge , and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other . 
Well , he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do ?
