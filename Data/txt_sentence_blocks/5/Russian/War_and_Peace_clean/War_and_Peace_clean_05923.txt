All his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him , when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes . 
In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something . 
He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it . 
In everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited , petty , commonplace , and senseless . 
He had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space , where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen .
