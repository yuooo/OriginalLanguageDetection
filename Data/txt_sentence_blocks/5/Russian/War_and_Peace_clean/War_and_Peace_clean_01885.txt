Sometimes the best of the pupils , of whom Natasha , who was exceptionally graceful , was first , even danced the pas de chale , but at this last ball only the ecossaise , the anglaise , and the mazurka , which was just coming into fashion , were danced . 
Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezukhov 's house , and the ball , as everyone said , was a great success . 
There were many pretty girls and the Rostov girls were among the prettiest . 
They were both particularly happy and gay . 
That evening , proud of Dolokhov 's proposal , her refusal , and her explanation with Nicholas , Sonya twirled about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited , and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy .
