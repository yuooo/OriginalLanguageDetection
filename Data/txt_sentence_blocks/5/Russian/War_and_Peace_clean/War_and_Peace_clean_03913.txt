After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream . 
He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed , and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it , leaving to the commander in chief 's discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills , where one of Russia 's oldest generals would be captured or killed , and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills . 
But while himself remaining , he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Bogucharovo and thence to Moscow . 
Princess Mary , alarmed by her father 's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy , could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him . 
She refused to go away and her father 's fury broke over her in a terrible storm .
