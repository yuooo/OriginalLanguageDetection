`` Glad to do our best ! '' 
shouted the soldiers . 
The Emperor 's horse started at the sudden cry . 
This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz , enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress ' Field , not understanding the significance of the firing , nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis ' black cob , nor of all that was being said , thought , and felt that day by its rider . 
The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him , pointing to the gallant Apsherons .
