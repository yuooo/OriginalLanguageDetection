But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited . 
The armies were divided , there was no unity of command , and Barclay was unpopular ; but from this confusion , division , and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief , there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle -LRB- which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else , instead of Barclay , been in command -RRB- and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal . 
At last the Emperor left the army , and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war . 
And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled . 
He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief 's undivided control of the army , and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken , but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled .
