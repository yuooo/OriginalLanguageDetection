Count Ilya Rostov , though not at heart a keen sportsman , knew the rules of the hunt well , and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand , arranged his reins , settled himself in the saddle , and , feeling that he was ready , looked about with a smile .

Chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds , who had , however , grown fat like their master and his horse . 
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed .
