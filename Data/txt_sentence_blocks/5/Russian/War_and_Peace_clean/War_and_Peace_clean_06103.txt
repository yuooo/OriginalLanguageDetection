With Mademoiselle Bourienne 's help the princess had maintained the conversation very well , but at the very last moment , just when he rose , she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her , and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life , that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still , her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her , not noticing that he had risen . 
Nicholas glanced at her and , wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction , made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again looked at the princess . 
She still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face . 
He suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed . 
He wished to help her and say something pleasant , but could think of nothing to say .
