But the soldiers , crowded together shoulder to shoulder , their bayonets interlocking , moved over the bridge in a dense mass . 
Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw the rapid , noisy little waves of the Enns , which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along . 
Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers , shoulder straps , covered shakos , knapsacks , bayonets , long muskets , and , under the shakos , faces with broad cheekbones , sunken cheeks , and listless tired expressions , and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge .
