`` So there 's nothing ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' answered Princess Mary , looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in-law . 
She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement , which was expected within a few days . 
Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid their grief in their own way . 
The old prince would not cherish any hope : he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed , and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son , he ordered a monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his memory , and he told everybody that his son had been killed .
