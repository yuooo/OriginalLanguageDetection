From Vyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow . 
Moscou , la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire , la ville sacree des peuples d'Alexandre , Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de pagodes chinoises , * this Moscow gave Napoleon 's imagination no rest . 
On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards , his bodyguard , his pages , and aides-de-camp . 
Berthier , his chief of staff , dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry . 
Followed by Lelorgne d'Ideville , an interpreter , he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression .
