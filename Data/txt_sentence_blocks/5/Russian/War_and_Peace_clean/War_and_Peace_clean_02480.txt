Four years before , meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater , Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had said in German , `` das soll mein Weib werden , '' * and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her . 
Now in Petersburg , having considered the Rostovs ' position and his own , he decided that the time had come to propose . 
* `` That girl shall be my wife . '' 
Berg 's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him . 
At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostova ; but Berg 's chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing , since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good , indeed excellent .
