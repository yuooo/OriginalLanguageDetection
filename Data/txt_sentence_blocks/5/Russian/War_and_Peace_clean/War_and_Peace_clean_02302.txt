Only recently , talking with one of Platov 's Cossack officers , Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign , but as a criminal . 
Quite lately , happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road , Rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte . 
Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in Boris ' lodging , dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank . 
As soon as he noticed a French officer , who thrust his head out of the door , that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him . 
He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there .
