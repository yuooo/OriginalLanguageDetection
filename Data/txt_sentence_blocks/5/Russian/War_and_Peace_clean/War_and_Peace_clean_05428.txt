You , peaceful inhabitants of Moscow , artisans and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city , and you scattered tillers of the soil , still kept out in the fields by groundless fear , listen ! 
Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it . 
Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected . 
Any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished . 
His Majesty the Emperor and King protects them , and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders .
