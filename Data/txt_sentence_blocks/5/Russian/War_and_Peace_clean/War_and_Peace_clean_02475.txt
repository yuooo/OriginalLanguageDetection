And suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body ; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper ; I said , `` I drew that , '' and he answered by bowing his head . 
I opened the book , and on all the pages there were excellent drawings . 
And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved . 
And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body , flying up to the clouds . 
And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of Songs .
