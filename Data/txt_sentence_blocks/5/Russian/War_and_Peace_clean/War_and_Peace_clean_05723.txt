The dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow . 
All around lay the flesh of different animals -- from men to horses -- in various stages of decomposition ; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted . 
It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear , but after a short break it began raining harder than before . 
The saturated road no longer absorbed the water , which ran along the ruts in streams . 
Pierre walked along , looking from side to side , counting his steps in threes , and reckoning them off on his fingers .
