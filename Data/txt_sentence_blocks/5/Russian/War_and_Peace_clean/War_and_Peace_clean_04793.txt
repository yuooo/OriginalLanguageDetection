He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Ermolov , coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge , had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge . 
The crowd , crushing one another , upsetting carts , and shouting and squeezing desperately , had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward . 
Meanwhile , the city itself was deserted . 
There was hardly anyone in the streets . 
The gates and shops were all closed , only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard .
