Natasha was calmer but no happier . 
She not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure -- balls , promenades , concerts , and theaters - but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter . 
She could not sing . 
As soon as she began to laugh , or tried to sing by herself , tears choked her : tears of remorse , tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return , tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy . 
Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy , in face of her sorrow .
