Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room , but did not admit Mademoiselle Bourienne either . 
Tikhon alone attended him . 
At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life , devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
His looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say : `` There , you see ? 
You plotted against me , you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him , but you see I need neither her nor you ! ''
