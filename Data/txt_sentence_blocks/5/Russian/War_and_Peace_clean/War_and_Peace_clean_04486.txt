I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for everybody , that the seas should be common to all , and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns . 
On returning to France , to the bosom of the great , strong , magnificent , peaceful , and glorious fatherland , I should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable ; all future wars purely defensive , all aggrandizement antinational . 
I should have associated my son in the Empire ; my dictatorship would have been finished , and his constitutional reign would have begun . 
Paris would have been the capital of the world , and the French the envy of the nations ! 
My leisure then , and my old age , would have been devoted , in company with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son , to leisurely visiting , with our own horses and like a true country couple , every corner of the Empire , receiving complaints , redressing wrongs , and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere .
