`` I am afraid , '' said Pierre , smiling , and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs -- `` I am afraid I am very far from understanding -- how am I to put it ? 
-- I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another . '' 
`` I know your outlook , '' said the Mason , `` and the view of life you mention , and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts , is the one held by the majority of people , and is the invariable fruit of pride , indolence , and ignorance . 
Forgive me , my dear sir , but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you . 
Your view of life is a regrettable delusion . ''
