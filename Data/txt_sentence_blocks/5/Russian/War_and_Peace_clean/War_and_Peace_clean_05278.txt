Father , he says , ` All my children are the same to me : it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten . 
But if Platon had n't been shaved for a soldier , Michael would have had to go . '

` Michael , ' he says , ` come here and bow down to his feet ; and you , young woman , you bow down too ; and you , grandchildren , also bow down before him !
