A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke off , fell on the balcony parapet , and then to the ground . 
A coachman in a jerkin , who stood nearest , sprang forward and snatched it up . 
Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman . 
Seeing this the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony . 
Petya 's eyes grew bloodshot , and still more excited by the danger of being crushed , he rushed at the biscuits .
