It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing , but as if the army itself , rejoicing at the Emperors ' approach , had naturally burst into music . 
Amid these sounds , only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard . 
He gave the words of greeting , and the first regiment roared `` Hurrah ! '' 
so deafeningly , continuously , and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted . 
Rostov , standing in the front lines of Kutuzov 's army which the Tsar approached first , experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army : a feeling of self-forgetfulness , a proud consciousness of might , and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph .
