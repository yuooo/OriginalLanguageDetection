`` There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea , '' Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room . 
Around the table all who were at Count Bezukhov 's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves . 
Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables . 
During balls given at the house Pierre , who did not know how to dance , had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who , as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders , looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times . 
Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles .
