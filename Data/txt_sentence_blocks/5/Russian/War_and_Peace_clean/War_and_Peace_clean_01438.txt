The Emperor 's gratitude was announced to the vanguard , rewards were promised , and the men received a double ration of vodka . 
The campfires crackled and the soldiers ' songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night . 
Denisov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major , and Rostov , who had already drunk enough , at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor 's health . 
`` Not ` our Sovereign , the Emperor , ' as they say at official dinners , '' said he , `` but the health of our Sovereign , that good , enchanting , and great man ! 
Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French ! ''
