In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke , and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers , ordering them back . 
Bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there , drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command . 
The whole air reeked with smoke . 
The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it . 
Some were using their ramrods , others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches , while others were firing , though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away .
