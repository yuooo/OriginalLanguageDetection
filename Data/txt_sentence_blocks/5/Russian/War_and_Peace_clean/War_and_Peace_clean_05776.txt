So what was the use of performing various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they possibly could ? 
Secondly , it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight . 
Thirdly , it would have been senseless to sacrifice one 's own troops in order to destroy the French army , which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that , though its path was not blocked , it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in December , namely a hundredth part of the original army . 
Fourthly , it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the Emperor , kings , and dukes -- whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the Russians , as the most adroit diplomatists of the time -LRB- Joseph de Maistre and others -RRB- recognized . 
Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French , when our own army had melted away to half before reaching Krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners , and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger .
