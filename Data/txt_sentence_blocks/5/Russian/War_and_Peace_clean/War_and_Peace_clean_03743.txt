Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval ; several persons , briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase , said : `` That 's right , quite right ! 
Just so ! '' 
Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money , his serfs , or himself , only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it , but he was unable to speak . 
Many voices shouted and talked at the same time , so that Count Rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all , and the group increased , dispersed , re-formed , and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table . 
Not only was Pierre 's attempt to speak unsuccessful , but he was rudely interrupted , pushed aside , and people turned away from him as from a common enemy .
