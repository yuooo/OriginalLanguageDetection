Kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka , where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them . 
At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad , and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses . 
Anatole had a passport , an order for post horses , ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with Dolokhov 's help . 
Two witnesses for the mock marriage -- Khvostikov , a retired petty official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions , and Makarin , a retired hussar , a kindly , weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for Kuragin -- were sitting at tea in Dolokhov 's front room . 
In his large study , the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with Persian rugs , bearskins , and weapons , sat Dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots , at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money .
