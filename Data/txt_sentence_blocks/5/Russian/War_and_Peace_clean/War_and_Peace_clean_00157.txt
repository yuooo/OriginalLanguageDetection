Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections . 
Yet , though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles , Dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them , including Anatole himself , respected him more than they did Anatole . 
Dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won . 
However much he drank , he never lost his clearheadedness . 
Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg .
