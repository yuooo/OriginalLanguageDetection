Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and Tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army , is in danger . 
From General Wintzingerode 's reports , I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road . 
Another corps of several thousand men is moving on Dmitrov . 
A third has advanced along the Vladimir road , and a fourth , rather considerable detachment is stationed between Ruza and Mozhaysk . 
Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth .
