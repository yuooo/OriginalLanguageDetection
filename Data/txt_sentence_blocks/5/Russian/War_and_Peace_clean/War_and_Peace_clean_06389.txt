If I reflect on an action still more remote , ten years ago or more , then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed . 
The farther I go back in memory , or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment , the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action . 
In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity . 
A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants , but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible . 
And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear .
