`` If we are ordered to die , we must die . 
If we 're punished , it means that we have deserved it , it 's not for us to judge . 
If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him , it means that that is the right thing to do . 
If once we begin judging and arguing about everything , nothing sacred will be left ! 
That way we shall be saying there is no God -- nothing ! ''
