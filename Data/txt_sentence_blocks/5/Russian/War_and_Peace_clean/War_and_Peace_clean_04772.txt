The bees do not fly in the same way , the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same . 
To the beekeeper 's tap on the wall of the sick hive , instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed , and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound , the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive . 
From the alighting board , instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom , and the warm whiffs of crowded life , comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey . 
There are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised , and ready to die in defense of the hive . 
There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity , like the sound of boiling water , but diverse discordant sounds of disorder .
