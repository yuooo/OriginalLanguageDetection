Rostov 's share in Dolokhov 's duel with Bezukhov was hushed up by the efforts of the old count , and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of Moscow . 
As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family , but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties . 
Dolokhov recovered , and Rostov became very friendly with him during his convalescence . 
Dolokhov lay ill at his mother 's who loved him passionately and tenderly , and old Mary Ivanovna , who had grown fond of Rostov for his friendship to her Fedya , often talked to him about her son . 
`` Yes , Count , '' she would say , `` he is too noble and pure-souled for our present , depraved world .
