By disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies , but without disproving it , it would seem impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds . 
But even after the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time . 
From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws , and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions , and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples , the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence . 
By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained ; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of man 's free will . 
For if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic , ethnographic , or economic conditions , then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause .
