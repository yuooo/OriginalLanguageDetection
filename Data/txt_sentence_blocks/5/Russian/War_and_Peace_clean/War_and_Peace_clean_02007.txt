No ! 
You have spent your life in idleness . 
Then you married , my dear sir -- took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young woman ; and what have you done ? 
You have not helped her to find the way of truth , my dear sir , but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and misery . 
A man offended you and you shot him , and you say you do not know God and hate your life .
