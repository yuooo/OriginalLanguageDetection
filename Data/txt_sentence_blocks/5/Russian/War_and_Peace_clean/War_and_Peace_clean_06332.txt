The universal historians give contradictory replies to that question , while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different . 
And as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold , or among those who do not know the nature of gold , so universal historians and historians of culture , not answering humanity 's essential question , serve as currency for some purposes of their own , only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call `` serious reading .

'' 
A return to the first is impossible , the belief has been destroyed ; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power .
