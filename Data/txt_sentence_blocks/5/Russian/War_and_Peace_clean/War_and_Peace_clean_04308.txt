Let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride . 
Let it be said of each of you : `` He was in the great battle before Moscow ! '' 
`` Before Moscow ! '' 
repeated Napoleon , and inviting M. de Beausset , who was so fond of travel , to accompany him on his ride , he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled . 
`` Your Majesty is too kind ! ''
