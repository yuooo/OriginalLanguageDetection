`` For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us , '' prayed Natasha . 
When they prayed for the warriors , she thought of her brother and Denisov . 
When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea , she remembered Prince Andrew , prayed for him , and asked God to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him . 
When they prayed for those who love us , she prayed for the members of her own family , her father and mother and Sonya , realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them , and feeling all the strength of her love for them . 
When they prayed for those who hate us , she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her , in order to pray for them .
