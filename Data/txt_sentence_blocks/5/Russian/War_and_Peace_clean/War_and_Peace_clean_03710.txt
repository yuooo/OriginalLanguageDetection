But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in , and stop while carriages passed in , rumbling beneath the archway . 
Beside Petya stood a peasant woman , a footman , two tradesmen , and a discharged soldier . 
After standing some time in the gateway , Petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass , and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows , but the woman just in front of him , who was the first against whom he directed his efforts , angrily shouted at him : `` What are you shoving for , young lordling ? 
Do n't you see we 're all standing still ? 
Then why push ? ''
