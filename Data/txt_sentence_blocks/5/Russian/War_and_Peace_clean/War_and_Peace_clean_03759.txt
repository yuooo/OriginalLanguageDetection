The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us now . 
No one will deny that that cause was , on the one hand , its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and , on the other , the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people . 
But no one at the time foresaw -LRB- what now seems so evident -RRB- that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men -- the best in the world and led by the best general -- could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength , and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was . 
Not only did no one see this , but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save Russia , while on the French side , despite Napoleon 's experience and so-called military genius , every effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer , that is , to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction . 
In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line , that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk , and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood .
