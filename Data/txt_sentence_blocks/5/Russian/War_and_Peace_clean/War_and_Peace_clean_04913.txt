The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional , artificial , and human -- for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world . 
Pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace , when he had suddenly felt that wealth , power , and life -- all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard -- if it has any worth has so only by reason the joy with which it can all be renounced . 
It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink , and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses : the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane , to test , as it were , his personal power and strength , affirming the existence of a higher , nonhuman criterion of life . 
From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously under its influence , but only now found full satisfaction for it . 
Moreover , at this moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction .
