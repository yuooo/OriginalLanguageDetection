That year two marriages had come of these balls . 
The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances . 
What distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured Iogel , flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of his art , as he collected the tickets from all his visitors . 
There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time . 
With scarcely any exceptions they all were , or seemed to be , pretty -- so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes .
