`` Yes , I saw him , and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement , '' repeated Dolgorukov , evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon . 
`` If he were n't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview ? 
Why negotiate , and above all why retreat , when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war ? 
Believe me , he is afraid , afraid of a general battle . 
His hour has come !
