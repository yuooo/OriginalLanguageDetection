All was tranquil in the yard . 
Only someone 's orderly passed through the gateway , splashing through the mud , and talked to the innkeeper . 
Above Pierre 's head some pigeons , disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up , fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse . 
The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards , delightful to Pierre at that moment . 
He could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses .
