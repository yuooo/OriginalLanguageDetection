Besides his height and stoutness , and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure , the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong . 
The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre , unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity , paid no attention to them . 
At the gate of one house three Frenchmen , who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them , stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French . 
Pierre shook his head and went on . 
In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him , but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man 's musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street .
