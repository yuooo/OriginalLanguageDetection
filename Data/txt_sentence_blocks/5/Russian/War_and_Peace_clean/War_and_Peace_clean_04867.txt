Vereshchagin with a cry of horror , covering his head with his hands , rushed toward the crowd . 
The tall youth , against whom he stumbled , seized his thin neck with his hands and , yelling wildly , fell with him under the feet of the pressing , struggling crowd . 
Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin , others at the tall youth . 
And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd . 
It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth , beaten almost to death .
