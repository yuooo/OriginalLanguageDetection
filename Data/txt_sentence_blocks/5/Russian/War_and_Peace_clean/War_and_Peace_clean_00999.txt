Our infantry were stationed there , and at the farthest point the dragoons . 
In the center , where Tushin 's battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position , was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern . 
On the left our troops were close to a copse , in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood . 
The French line was wider than ours , and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides . 
Behind our position was a steep and deep dip , making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire .
