It was a hot July day . 
Even at ten o'clock , when the Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel , the sultry air , the shouts of hawkers , the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd , the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard , the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade , the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones , and the brilliant , hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor , that content and discontent with the present , which is most strongly felt on a bright , hot day in town .
