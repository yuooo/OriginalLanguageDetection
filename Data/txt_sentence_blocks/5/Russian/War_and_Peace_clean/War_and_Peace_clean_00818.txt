`` Colonel , '' he said , addressing Rostov 's enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades , `` there is an order to stop and fire the bridge . '' 
`` An order to who ? '' 
asked the colonel morosely . 
`` I do n't myself know ` to who , ' '' replied the cornet in a serious tone , `` but the prince told me to ` go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge . ' '' 
Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order .
