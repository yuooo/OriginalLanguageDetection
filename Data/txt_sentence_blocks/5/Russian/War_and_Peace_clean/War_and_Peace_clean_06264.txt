All that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him , and of course I am glad of it . 
He is a fine lad , a fine lad ! 
This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance , and fancy -- as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits , and he told me of it himself at once ! 
I never knew him to tell an untruth . 
A fine lad , a fine lad ! ''
