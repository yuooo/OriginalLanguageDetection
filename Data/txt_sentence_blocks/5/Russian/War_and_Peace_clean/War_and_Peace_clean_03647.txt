When she did not understand , it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride , that it is impossible to understand all , that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God , whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments . 
She crossed herself , bowed low , and when she did not understand , in horror at her own vileness , simply asked God to forgive her everything , everything , to have mercy upon her . 
The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance . 
On her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street , and everybody within the houses was still asleep , Natasha experienced a feeling new to her , a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults , the possibility of a new , clean life , and of happiness . 
During the whole week she spent in this way , that feeling grew every day .
