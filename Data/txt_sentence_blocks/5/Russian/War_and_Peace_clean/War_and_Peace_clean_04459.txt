`` Your excellency ! 
Eh , Prince ! '' 
said the trembling voice of Timokhin , who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher . 
Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped . 
The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to dressing station by the wood , where wagons were stationed .
