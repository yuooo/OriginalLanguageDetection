One adjutant , nearest the door , was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown , writing . 
Another , the red , stout Nesvitski , lay on a bed with his arms under his head , laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him . 
A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord , while a fourth , lying on the clavichord , sang the tune . 
Bolkonski was not there . 
None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Boris .
