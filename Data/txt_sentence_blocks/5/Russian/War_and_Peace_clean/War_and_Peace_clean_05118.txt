Prince Vasili continued . 
`` Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors ; humble Faith , the sling of the Russian David , shall suddenly smite his head in his blood-thirsty pride . 
This icon of the Venerable Sergius , the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country 's weal , is offered to Your Imperial Majesty . 
I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence . 
I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just , and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty . ''
