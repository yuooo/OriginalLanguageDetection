Denisov was moodily silent all the evening . 
Late in the evening , when Rostov was about to leave , he asked Denisov whether he had no commission for him . 
`` Yes , wait a bit , '' said Denisov , glancing round at the officers , and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window , where he had an inkpot , and sat down to write . 
`` It seems it 's no use knocking one 's head against a wall ! '' 
he said , coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope .
