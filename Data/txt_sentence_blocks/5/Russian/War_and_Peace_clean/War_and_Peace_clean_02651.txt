Three weeks passed in this way . 
Natasha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow , idle and listless ; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings . 
She blushed continually and was irritable . 
It seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her . 
Strong as was her inward grief , this wound to her vanity intensified her misery .
