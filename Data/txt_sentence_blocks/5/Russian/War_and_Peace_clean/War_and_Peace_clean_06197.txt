Countess Mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him , and little Nicholas did love his uncle , but loved him with just a shade of contempt .

He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas ; he wanted to be learned , wise , and kind like Pierre .
