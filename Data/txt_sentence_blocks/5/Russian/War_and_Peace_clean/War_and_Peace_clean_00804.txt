These were the French . 
A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot . 
All the officers and men of Denisov 's squadron , though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions , thought only of what was there on the hilltop , and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline , which they knew to be the enemy 's troops . 
The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it . 
It was calm , and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill .
