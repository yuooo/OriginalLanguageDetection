Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess , Rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure . 
When her carriage drove out of the house , he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops . 
At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her , for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand . 
`` How can you speak so ! '' 
he blushingly replied to Princess Mary 's expressions of gratitude for her deliverance , as she termed what had occurred .
