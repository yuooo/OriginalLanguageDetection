shouted Prince Andrew , and , scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard , he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him . 
And really he only ran a few steps alone . 
One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting `` Hurrah ! '' 
and overtook him . 
A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew 's hands , but he was immediately killed .
