Prince Bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval . 
He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French . 
But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground , as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly , and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood . 
`` Very good ! '' 
said Bagration .
