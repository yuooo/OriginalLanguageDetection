But the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment in which Rostov was serving , and a misunderstanding arose . 
The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and , long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already advancing , were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another . 
But the regiments , both cavalry and infantry , were by no means ready for the impending action . 
From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations , the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood . 
`` He higher iss dan I in rank , '' said the German colonel of the hussars , flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up , `` so let him do what he vill , but I can not sacrifice my hussars ... Bugler , sount ze retreat ! ''
