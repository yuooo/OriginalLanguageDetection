But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws , he does not and can not believe this . 
However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before , yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way , he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases . 
Every man , savage or sage , however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions , feels that without this irrational conception -LRB- which constitutes the essence of freedom -RRB- he can not imagine life . 
He feels that however impossible it may be , it is so , for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life , but he would be unable to live for a single moment . 
He could not live , because all man 's efforts , all his impulses to life , are only efforts to increase freedom .
