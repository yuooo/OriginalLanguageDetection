The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which -- ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena -- the old method of history is moving . 
All human sciences have traveled along that path . 
Arriving at infinitesimals , mathematics , the most exact of sciences , abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown , infinitely small , quantities . 
Abandoning the conception of cause , mathematics seeks law , that is , the property common to all unknown , infinitely small , elements . 
In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded .
