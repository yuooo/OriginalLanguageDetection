She saw his face , heard his voice , repeated his words and her own , and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken . 
There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak , leaning his head on his thin pale hand . 
His chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised . 
His lips are firmly closed , his eyes glitter , and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead . 
One of his legs twitches just perceptibly , but rapidly .
