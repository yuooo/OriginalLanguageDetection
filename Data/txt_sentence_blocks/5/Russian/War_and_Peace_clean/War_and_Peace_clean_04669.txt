It was a clear bright autumn day , a Sunday . 
The church bells everywhere were ringing for service , just as usual on Sundays .

An enormous crowd of factory hands , house serfs , and peasants , with whom some officials , seminarists , and gentry were mingled , had gone early that morning to the Three Hills .
