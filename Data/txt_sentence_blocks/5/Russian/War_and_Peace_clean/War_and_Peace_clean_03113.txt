The door opened and the old prince , in a dress , ing gown and a white nightcap , came in . 
`` Ah , madam ! '' 
he began . 
`` Madam , Countess ... Countess Rostova , if I am not mistaken ... I beg you to excuse me , to excuse me ... I did not know , madam . 
God is my witness , I did not know you had honored us with a visit , and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter .
