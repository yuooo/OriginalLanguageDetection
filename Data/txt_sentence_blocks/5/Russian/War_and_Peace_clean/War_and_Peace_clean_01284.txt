The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter . 
The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another , his daughter , whom he loved more than himself . 
He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act , but instead of that he only excited himself more and more . 
`` The first man that turns up -- she forgets her father and everything else , runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself ! 
Glad to throw her father over !
