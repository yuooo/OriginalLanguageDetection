In the tavern , before which stood the doctor 's covered cart , there were already some five officers . 
Mary Hendrikhovna , a plump little blonde German , in a dressing jacket and nightcap , was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner . 
Her husband , the doctor , lay asleep behind her . 
Rostov and Ilyin , on entering the room , were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter . 
`` Dear me , how jolly we are ! ''
