To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe , and a trial balloon that was to go up next day . 
The balloon was not yet ready , but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor 's desire . 
The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchin as follows : As soon as Leppich is ready , get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to let him know . 
I have informed him of the matter . 
Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time , that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy 's hands .
