Preserve his army , put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in Thy Name , and gird their loins with strength for the fight . 
Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us ; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us , may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind , and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight ; may they be ensnared when they know it not , and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them ; let them fall before Thy servants ' feet and be laid low by our hosts ! 
Lord , Thou art able to save both great and small ; Thou art God , and man can not prevail against Thee ! 
`` God of our fathers ! 
Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness which are from of old ; turn not Thy face from us , but be gracious to our unworthiness , and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities !
