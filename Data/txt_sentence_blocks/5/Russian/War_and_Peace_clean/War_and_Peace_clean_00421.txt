`` It 's that protege of yours , that sweet Princess Drubetskaya , that Anna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid ... the infamous , vile woman ! '' 
`` Do not let us lose any time ... '' `` Ah , do n't talk to me ! 
Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile , disgraceful things about us , especially about Sophie -- I ca n't repeat them -- that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight . 
I know it was then he wrote this vile , infamous paper , but I thought the thing was invalid . '' 
`` We 've got to it at last -- why did you not tell me about it sooner ? ''
