`` Why , so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy , '' said Prince Andrew with venomous irony . 
`` It is very sound : one ca n't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding . 
At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us , as they had larger forces . 
But he could not understand this , '' cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily : `` he could not understand that there , for the first time , we were fighting for Russian soil , and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before , that we had held the French for two days , and that that success had increased our strength tenfold . 
He ordered us to retreat , and all our efforts and losses went for nothing .
