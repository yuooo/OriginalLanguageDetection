Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch . 
There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog . 
Milka , a black-spotted , broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes , got up on seeing her master , stretched her hind legs , lay down like a hare , and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache . 
Another borzoi , a dog , catching sight of his master from the garden path , arched his back and , rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail , began rubbing himself against his legs . 
`` O-hoy ! ''
