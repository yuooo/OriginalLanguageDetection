Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt , and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face . 
Having looked in a mirror , and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it , he lifted a glass of wine . 
`` Well , good-by , Theodore . 
Thank you for everything and farewell ! '' 
said Anatole .
