And why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished ? 
But even if we admitted that Kutuzov , Chichagov , and others were the cause of the Russian failures , it is still incomprehensible why , the position of the Russian army being what it was at Krasnoe and at the Berezina -LRB- in both cases we had superior forces -RRB- , the French army with its marshals , kings , and Emperor was not captured , if that was what the Russians aimed at . 
The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military historians -LRB- to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack -RRB- is unfounded , for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at Vyazma and Tarutino . 
Why was the Russian army -- which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at Borodino -- defeated at Krasnoe and the Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically superior ? 
If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his marshals -- and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled -- then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a series of victories , and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian historians .
