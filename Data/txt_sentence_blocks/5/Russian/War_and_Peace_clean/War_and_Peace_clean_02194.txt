The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute . 
Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments , which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father 's house ; he himself went to the nursery . 
`` Let us go and see my sister , '' he said to Pierre when he returned . 
`` I have not found her yet , she is hiding now , sitting with her ` God 's folk . ' 
It will serve her right , she will be confused , but you will see her ` God 's folk . '
