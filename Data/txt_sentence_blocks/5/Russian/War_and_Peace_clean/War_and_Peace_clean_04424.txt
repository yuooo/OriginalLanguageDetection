It was no longer a battle : it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians . 
Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him . 
He could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him , and from its lack of success this affair , for the first time , seemed to him unnecessary and horrible . 
One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the Old Guard into action . 
Ney and Berthier , standing near Napoleon , exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general 's senseless offer .
