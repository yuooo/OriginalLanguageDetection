The little princess went round the table with quick , short , swaying steps , her workbag on her arm , and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar , as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her . 
`` I have brought my work , '' said she in French , displaying her bag and addressing all present . 
`` Mind , Annette , I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me , '' she added , turning to her hostess . 
`` You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception , and just see how badly I am dressed . '' 
And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted , lace-trimmed , dainty gray dress , girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast .
