Forgive my vanity as a relation , but I never doubted it . 
The good he has done to everybody here , from his peasants up to the gentry , is incalculable . 
On his arrival in Petersburg he received only his due . 
I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow , especially such false ones as that you write about -- I mean the report of my brother 's betrothal to the little Rostova . 
I do not think my brother will ever marry again , and certainly not her ; and this is why : first , I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost , the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother .
