He was that absent-minded crank , a grand seigneur husband who was in no one 's way , and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room , he served , by the contrast he presented to her , as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife . 
Pierre during the last two years , as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt for all else , had acquired in his wife 's circle , which did not interest him , that air of unconcern , indifference , and benevolence toward all , which can not be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect . 
He entered his wife 's drawing room as one enters a theater , was acquainted with everybody , equally pleased to see everyone , and equally indifferent to them all . 
Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and , regardless of whether any `` gentlemen of the embassy '' were present or not , lispingly expressed his views , which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment . 
But the general opinion concerning the queer husband of `` the most distinguished woman in Petersburg '' was so well established that no one took his freaks seriously .
