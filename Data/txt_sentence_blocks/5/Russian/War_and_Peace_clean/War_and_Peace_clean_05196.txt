In this letter the countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them ; his state was very critical , but the doctor said there was now more hope . 
Sonya and Natasha were nursing him . 
Next day Nicholas took his mother 's letter and went to see Princess Mary . 
Neither he nor she said a word about what `` Natasha nursing him '' might mean , but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations . 
The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yaroslavl , and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment .
