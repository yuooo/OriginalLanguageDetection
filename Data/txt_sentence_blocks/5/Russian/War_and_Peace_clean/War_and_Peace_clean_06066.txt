He alone -- with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and Egypt , his insane self-adulation , his boldness in crime and frankness in lying -- he alone could justify what had to be done . 
He is needed for the place that awaits him , and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision , his lack of a plan , and all his mistakes , he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success . 
He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature . 
In alarm he wishes to flee , considering himself lost . 
He pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him .
