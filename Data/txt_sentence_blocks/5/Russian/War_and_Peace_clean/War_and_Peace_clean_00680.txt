The general 's face clouded , his lips quivered and trembled . 
He took out a notebook , hurriedly scribbled something in pencil , tore out the leaf , gave it to Kozlovski , stepped quickly to the window , and threw himself into a chair , gazing at those in the room as if asking , `` Why do they look at me ? '' 
Then he lifted his head , stretched his neck as if he intended to say something , but immediately , with affected indifference , began to hum to himself , producing a queer sound which immediately broke off . 
The door of the private room opened and Kutuzov appeared in the doorway . 
The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger , and , making long , quick strides with his thin legs , went up to Kutuzov .
