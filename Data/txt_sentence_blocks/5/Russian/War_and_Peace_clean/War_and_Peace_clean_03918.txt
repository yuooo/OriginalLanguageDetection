For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo , ever in the same state , getting neither better nor worse . 
He was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse . 
He muttered unceasingly , his eyebrows and lips twitching , and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not . 
One thing was certain -- that he was suffering and wished to say something . 
But what it was , no one could tell : it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man , or it might relate to public affairs , or possibly to family concerns .
