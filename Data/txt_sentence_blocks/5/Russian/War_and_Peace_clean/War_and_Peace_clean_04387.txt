Suddenly something happened : the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing . 
Everything became strange , confused , and misty in Pierre 's eyes . 
One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork , a soldier , or a gun . 
Pierre , who had not noticed these sounds before , now heard nothing else . 
On the right of the battery soldiers shouting `` Hurrah ! ''
