The morning after little Nicholas had left , the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief . 
His caleche was already at the door . 
Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs . 
She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden . 
Suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces .
