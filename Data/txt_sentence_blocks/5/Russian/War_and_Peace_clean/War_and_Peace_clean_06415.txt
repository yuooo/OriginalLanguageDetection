So too , like Voltaire in his time , uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion , though the law of inevitability in history , like the law of Copernicus in astronomy , far from destroying , even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected . 
As in the question of astronomy then , so in the question of history now , the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute , serving as the measure of visible phenomena . 
In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth , in history it is the independence of personality -- free will . 
As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth 's fixity and of the motion of the planets , so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space , time , and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one 's own personality . 
But as in astronomy the new view said : `` It is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth , but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity , while by admitting its motion -LRB- which we do not feel -RRB- we arrive at laws , '' so also in history the new view says : `` It is true that we are not conscious of our dependence , but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity , while by admitting our dependence on the external world , on time , and on cause , we arrive at laws .
