The officer walked in front , leaning on a stick and slightly limping . 
When he had advanced a few steps he stopped , having apparently decided that these were good quarters , turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance , and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses . 
Having done that , the officer , lifting his elbow with a smart gesture , stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat . 
`` Bonjour , la compagnie ! '' 
* said he gaily , smiling and looking about him .
