In the evening Michael Ivanovich , sent by the prince , came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew 's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room . 
She gave it to him and , unpleasant as it was to her to do so , ventured to ask him what her father was doing . 
`` Always busy , '' replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale . 
`` He 's worrying very much about the new building . 
He has been reading a little , but now '' -- Michael Ivanovich went on , lowering his voice -- `` now he 's at his desk , busy with his will , I expect . ''
