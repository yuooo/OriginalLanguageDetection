Discussions and questions of that kind , which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from one 's dinner , did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords ; and the purpose of marriage is the family . 
If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body , a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose , for his stomach will not digest the two dinners . 
If the purpose of marriage is the family , the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure , but in that case will not have a family . 
If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family , the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest , and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family -- that is , one wife or one husband . 
Natasha needed a husband .
