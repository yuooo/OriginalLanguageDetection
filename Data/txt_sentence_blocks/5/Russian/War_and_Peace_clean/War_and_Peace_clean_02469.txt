I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden , and in the garden was a large and beautiful building . 
I woke up . 
O Lord , great Architect of Nature , help me to tear from myself these dogs -- my passions especially the last , which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones , and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream . 
7th December I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house , and that I was very glad and wished to entertain him . 
It seemed as if I chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him , and I wished to come close to him and embrace him .
