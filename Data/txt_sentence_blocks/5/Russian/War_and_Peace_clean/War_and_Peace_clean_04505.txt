As a bleeding , mortally wounded animal licks its wounds , they remained inert in Moscow for five weeks , and then suddenly , with no fresh reason , fled back : they made a dash for the Kaluga road , and -LRB- after a victory -- for at Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs -RRB- without undertaking a single serious battle , they fled still more rapidly back to Smolensk , beyond Smolensk , beyond the Berezina , beyond Vilna , and farther still . 
On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August , Kutuzov and the whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a victory . 
Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor .
