His head was aching , the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body , and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before . 
That something shameful was his yesterday 's conversation with Captain Ramballe . 
It was eleven by the clock , but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors . 
Pierre rose , rubbed his eyes , and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table , he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day . 
`` Am I not too late ? ''
