The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive -- the life of a people . 
They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people , and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation . 
The question : how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided ? 
the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man , and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined . 
For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs .
