To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment . 
But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the question . 
Time has gone by which I could not detain , the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting , nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me . 
The moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable , and at that moment I could make only one movement , and whatever movement I made would be the only one . 
That I did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then .
