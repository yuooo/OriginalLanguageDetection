The paper handed to him by the Governor said this : `` I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any . 
I from the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are marching to unite our forces before Smolensk , which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant , and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland , or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished . 
From this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolensk , for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory . ''
