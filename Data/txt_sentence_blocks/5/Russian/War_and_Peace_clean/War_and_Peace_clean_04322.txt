And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle , for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him . 
So the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by Napoleon 's will but occurred independently of him , in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action . 
It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his will . 
And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers . 
Moreover , the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former occasions , and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously , is quite baseless , which again shows that Napoleon 's cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant .
