We are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question : why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered certain words , seems to us senseless . 
He had the power and so what he ordered was done . 
This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by God . 
But as soon as we do not admit that , it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others . 
It can not be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one -- a domination based on the application or threat of physical force , like the power of Hercules ; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force , as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes , that is , men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius .
