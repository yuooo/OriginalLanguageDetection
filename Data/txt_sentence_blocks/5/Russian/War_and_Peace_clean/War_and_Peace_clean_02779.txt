`` The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform , Michael Sidorych ... '' Simon did not finish , for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue . 
He bent down his head and listened , shaking a warning finger at his master . 
`` They are on the scent of the cubs ... '' he whispered , `` straight to the Lyadov uplands . '' 
The count , forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face , looked into the distance straight before him , down the narrow open space , holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any . 
After the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel 's hunting horn ; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry , with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf .
