On October 22 , Denisov -LRB- who was one of the irregulars -RRB- was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm . 
Since early morning he and his party had been on the move . 
All day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army , which -- as was learned from spies and prisoners - was moving under a strong escort to Smolensk . 
Besides Denisov and Dolokhov -LRB- who also led a small party and moved in Denisov 's vicinity -RRB- , the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and , as Denisov expressed it , were sharpening their teeth for it . 
Two of the commanders of large parties -- one a Pole and the other a German -- sent invitations to Denisov almost simultaneously , requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy .
