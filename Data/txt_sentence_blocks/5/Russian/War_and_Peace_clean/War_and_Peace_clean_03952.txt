Then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table . 
Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when , but it all got done as if of its own accord . 
Toward night candles were burning round his coffin , a pall was spread over it , the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper , a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head , and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms . 
Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse , so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin -- the Marshal , the village Elder , peasant women -- and all with fixed and frightened eyes , crossing themselves , bowed and kissed the old prince 's cold and stiffened hand . 
Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had always been absentees , and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of Bald Hills .
