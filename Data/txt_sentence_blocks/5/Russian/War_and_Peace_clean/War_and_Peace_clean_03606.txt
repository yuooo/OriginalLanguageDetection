It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep , when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of Ostrovna . 
Still laughing and talking , the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar . 
But Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea . 
Day was breaking , the rain had ceased , and the clouds were dispersing . 
It felt damp and cold , especially in clothes that were still moist .
