All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures . 
During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country , but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them . 
And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line , but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns , but very lazily . 
At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided , and our sole aim was to unite them , though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country . 
Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat .
