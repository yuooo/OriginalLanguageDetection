In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald Hills with his wife , his mother , and Sonya . 
Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife 's property , and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well . 
In another three years , by 1820 , he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating to buy back Otradnoe -- that being his pet dream . 
Having started farming from necessity , he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation . 
Nicholas was a plain farmer : he did not like innovations , especially the English ones then coming into vogue .
