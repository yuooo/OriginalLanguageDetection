Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia , he had changed greatly during that period . 
In the expression of his face , in his movements , in his walk , scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence . 
He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others , but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work . 
His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him , his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive . 
Kutuzov , whom he had overtaken in Poland , had received him very kindly , promised not to forget him , distinguished him above the other adjutants , and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions .
