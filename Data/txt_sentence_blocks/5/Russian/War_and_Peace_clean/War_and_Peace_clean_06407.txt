But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics , even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space , in time , and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history , while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics . 
In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability , what is unknown to us we call vital force . 
Vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life . 
So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability , what is unknown we call free will . 
Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life .
