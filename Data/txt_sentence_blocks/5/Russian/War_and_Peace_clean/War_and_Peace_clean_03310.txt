I could n't hold them in , my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins -- ` Catch hold yourself , your excellency ! ' 
says I , and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there . 
It was n't a case of urging them on , there was no holding them in till we reached the place . 
The devils took us there in three hours ! 
Only the near one died of it . ''
