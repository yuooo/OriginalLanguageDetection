But what was still stranger , though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister , was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel 's face , Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife : `` Ah , why have you done this to me ? '' 
Soon after Prince Andrew 's return the old prince made over to him a large estate , Bogucharovo , about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills . 
Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills , partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father 's peculiarities , and partly because he needed solitude , Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo , began building and spent most of his time there . 
After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service , and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve , he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service . 
The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 .
