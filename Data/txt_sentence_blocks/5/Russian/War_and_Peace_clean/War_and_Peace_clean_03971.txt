The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward . 
She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall , fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion , and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject -- the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness , which she had not suspected , but which had shown itself during her father 's illness . 
She wished to pray but did not dare to , dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God . 
She lay for a long time in that position . 
The sun had reached the other side of the house , and its slanting rays shone into the open window , lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking .
