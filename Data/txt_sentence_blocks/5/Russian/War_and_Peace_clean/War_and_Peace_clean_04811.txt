Another smith tried to enter the doorway , pressing against the publican with his chest . 
The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly : `` They 're fighting us , lads ! '' 
At that moment the first smith got up and , scratching his bruised face to make it bleed , shouted in a tearful voice : `` Police ! 
Murder ! 
... They 've killed a man , lads ! ''
