The most suitable fete the Germans can devise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerstadt . 
Not only is he great , but so are his ancestors , his brothers , his stepsons , and his brothers-in-law . 
Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part . 
And when he is ready so too are the forces . 
The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal -- Moscow .
