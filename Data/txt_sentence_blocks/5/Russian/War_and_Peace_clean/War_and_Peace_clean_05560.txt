This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent -- such as the commands of the general , the equipment employed , and so on -- mistaking these for the real significance of the factor , and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger . 
Only then , expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor , can we hope to define the unknown . 
Ten men , battalions , or divisions , fighting fifteen men , battalions , or divisions , conquer -- that is , kill or take captive -- all the others , while themselves losing four , so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost . 
Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen , and therefore 4x = 15y . 
Consequently x/y = 15/4 .
