Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform , which he had not worn for a long time , he went into Bilibin 's study fresh , animated , and handsome , with his hand bandaged . 
In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps . 
With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin , who was a secretary to the embassy , Bolkonski was already acquainted . 
Bilibin introduced him to the others . 
The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin 's were young , wealthy , gay society men , who here , as in Vienna , formed a special set which Bilibin , their leader , called les notres .
