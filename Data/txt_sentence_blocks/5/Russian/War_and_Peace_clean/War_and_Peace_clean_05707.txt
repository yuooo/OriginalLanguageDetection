A gallant-looking Frenchman , in a blue overcoat , capless , and with a frowning red face , had been defending himself against the hussars . 
When Petya galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen . 
`` Too late again ! '' 
flashed through Petya 's mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard . 
The shots came from the yard of the landowner 's house he had visited the night before with Dolokhov .
