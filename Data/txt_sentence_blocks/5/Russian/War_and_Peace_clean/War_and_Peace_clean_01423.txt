Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood . 
At nine in the morning , he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah , and saw wounded being brought back -LRB- there were not many of them -RRB- , and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in , convoyed by a sontnya of Cossacks . 
Evidently the affair was over and , though not big , had been a successful engagement . 
The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory , of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron . 
The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost , and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed , not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it , but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers , officers , generals , and adjutants , as they passed Rostov going or coming .
