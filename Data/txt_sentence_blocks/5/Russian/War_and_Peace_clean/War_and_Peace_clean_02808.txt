He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine , he even saw the hounds , and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite . 
The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois , and Nicholas saw a queer , short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field . 
The borzois bore down on it ... . 
Now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves , trailing its brush , when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one , and everything was in confusion ; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure , scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group . 
Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs ; one in a red cap , the other , a stranger , in a green coat .
