* -LSB- 2 -RSB- `` When in doubt , my dear fellow , do nothing . '' 
`` Well , good-by , my dear fellow ; remember that with all my heart I share your sorrow , and that for you I am not a Serene Highness , nor a prince , nor a commander in chief , but a father ! 
If you want anything come straight to me . 
Good-by , my dear boy . ''
