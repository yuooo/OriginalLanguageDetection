Just before him , almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor , lay a sick man , probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair . 
The man lay on his back , his huge arms and legs outstretched . 
His face was purple , his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen , and on his bare legs and arms which were still red , the veins stood out like cords . 
He was knocking the back of his head against the floor , hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating . 
Rostov listened and made out the word .
