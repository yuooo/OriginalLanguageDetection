The black , hairy , snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov , and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber , looked just as it usually did , especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle ; he was only redder than usual . 
With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink , pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse , Bedouin , and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle , he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols . 
He rode up to Kirsten . 
The staff captain on his broad-backed , steady mare came at a walk to meet him . 
His face with its long mustache was serious as always , only his eyes were brighter than usual .
