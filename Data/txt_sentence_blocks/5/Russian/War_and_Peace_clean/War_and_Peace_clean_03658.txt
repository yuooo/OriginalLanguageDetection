`` Lord God , I submit myself to Thy will ! '' 
she thought . 
`` I want nothing , wish for nothing ; teach me what to do and how to use my will ! 
Take me , take me ! '' 
prayed Natasha , with impatient emotion in her heart , not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself , from her regrets , desires , remorse , hopes , and sins .
