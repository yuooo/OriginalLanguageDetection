The Archduke Karl does nothing , the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself . 
You abandon Vienna , give up its defense -- as much as to say : ` Heaven is with us , but heaven help you and your capital ! ' 
The one general whom we all loved , Schmidt , you expose to a bullet , and then you congratulate us on the victory ! 
Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived . 
It 's as if it had been done on purpose , on purpose .
