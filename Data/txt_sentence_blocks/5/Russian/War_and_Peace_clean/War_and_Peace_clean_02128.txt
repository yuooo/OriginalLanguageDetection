On the one hand , the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light , pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor , to which Pierre did not agree . 
On the other hand , Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs , which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank , and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation . 
The steward did not say it was quite impossible , but suggested selling the forests in the province of Kostroma , the land lower down the river , and the Crimean estate , in order to make it possible : all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measures -- the removal of injunctions , petitions , permits , and so on -- that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied : `` Yes , yes , do so . ''
