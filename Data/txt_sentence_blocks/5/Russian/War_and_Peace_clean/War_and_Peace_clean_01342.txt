The Rostovs supposed that The Russian Guards , Abroad , was quite a definite address , and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the Pavlograd regiment , which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood . 
And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke 's courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas . 
The letters were from the old count , the countess , Petya , Vera , Natasha , and Sonya , and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son . 
On the twelfth of November , Kutuzov 's active army , in camp before Olmutz , was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors -- the Russian and the Austrian . 
The Guards , just arrived from Russia , spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review , reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock .
