Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar . 
The horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh - beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing . 
The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides . 
Again checking his horses , Nicholas looked around him . 
They were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars .
