One morning , between seven and eight , returning after a sleepless night , he sent for embers , changed his rain-soaked underclothes , said his prayers , drank tea , got warm , then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner , and , his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt , lay down on his back , putting his arms under his head . 
He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition , and was awaiting Denisov , who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk . 
Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut , evidently much excited . 
Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to , and saw the quartermaster , Topcheenko . 
`` I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff ! ''
