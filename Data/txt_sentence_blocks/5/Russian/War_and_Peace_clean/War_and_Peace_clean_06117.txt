He kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible , not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households . 
He was hard alike on the lazy , the depraved , and the weak , and tried to get them expelled from the commune . 
He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants ' hay and corn as of his own , and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well , or got so good a return , as did Nicholas . 
He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs -- the `` drones '' as he called them -- and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity . 
When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf , especially if one had to be punished , he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house ; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation .
