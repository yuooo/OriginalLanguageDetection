We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it . 
In reality in all Napoleon 's activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish , but find a series of orders , or expressions of his will , very variously and indefinitely directed . 
Amid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon 's one series , for the campaign of 1812 , was carried out -- not because those orders differed in any way from the other , unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French army into Russia ; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way , but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil . 
So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events , we find that a command can never be the cause of the event , but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two . 
To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the Deity but from a man , which is , that the man who gives the command himself takes part in .
