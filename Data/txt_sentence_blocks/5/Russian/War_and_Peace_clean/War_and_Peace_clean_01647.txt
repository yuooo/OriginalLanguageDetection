`` It would be good , '' thought Prince Andrew , glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence , `` it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary . 
How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life , and what to expect after it beyond the grave ! 
How happy and calm I should be if I could now say : ` Lord , have mercy on me ! ' 
... But to whom should I say that ? 
Either to a Power indefinable , incomprehensible , which I not only can not address but which I can not even express in words -- the Great All or Nothing - '' said he to himself , `` or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary !
