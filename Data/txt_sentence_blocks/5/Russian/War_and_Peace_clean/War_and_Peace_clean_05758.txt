After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began , the flight of the French assumed a still more tragic character , with men freezing , or roasting themselves to death at the campfires , while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past , carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor , kings , and dukes ; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on essentially as before . 
From Moscow to Vyazma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not reckoning the Guards -LRB- who did nothing during the whole war but pillage -RRB- was reduced to thirty-six thousand , though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle . 
From this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically . 
The French army melted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyazma , from Vyazma to Smolensk , from Smolensk to the Berezina , and from the Berezina to Vilna -- independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold , the pursuit , the barring of the way , or any other particular conditions . 
Beyond Vyazma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass , and so went on to the end .
