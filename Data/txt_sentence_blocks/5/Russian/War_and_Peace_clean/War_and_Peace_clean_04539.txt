The first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and that during Napoleon 's occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians , and especially the Russian ladies , then liked so much . 
They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow . 
It was out of the question to be under French rule , it would be the worst thing that could happen . 
They went away even before the battle of Borodino and still more rapidly after it , despite Rostopchin 's calls to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight , or of the balloons that were to destroy the French , and despite all the nonsense Rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets . 
They knew that it was for the army to fight , and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon , and that they must go away , sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction .
