He had the air of a man oppressed by business , weary and suffering , who yet would not , for pity 's sake , leave this helpless youth who , after all , was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth , to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues . 
During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezukhov , he would call Pierre , or go to him himself , and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance , as if he were adding every time : `` You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you , and you also know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible . '' 
`` Well , my dear fellow , tomorrow we are off at last , '' said Prince Vasili one day , closing his eyes and fingering Pierre 's elbow , speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered . 
`` We start tomorrow and I 'm giving you a place in my carriage . 
I am very glad .
