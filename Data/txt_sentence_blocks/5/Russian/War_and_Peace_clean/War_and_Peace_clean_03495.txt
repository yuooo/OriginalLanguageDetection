You have not two hundred thousand men , and I have three times that number . 
I give you my word of honor , '' said Napoleon , forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight -- `` I give you my word of honor that I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula . 
The Turks will be of no use to you ; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you . 
As for the Swedes -- it is their fate to be governed by mad kings . 
Their king was insane and they changed him for another -- Bernadotte , who promptly went mad -- for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad . ''
