Create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us , strengthen us all in Thy faith , fortify our hope , inspire us with true love one for another , arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers , and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified . 
`` O Lord our God , in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust , let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy , and give us a token of Thy blessing , that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish , and may all the nations know that Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people . 
Show Thy mercy upon us this day , O Lord , and grant us Thy salvation ; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice in Thy mercy ; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants ! 
For Thou art the defense , the succor , and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee , and to Thee be all glory , to Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , now and forever , world without end . 
Amen . ''
