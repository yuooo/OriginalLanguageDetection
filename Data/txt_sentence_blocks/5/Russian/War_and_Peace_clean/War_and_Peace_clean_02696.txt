She felt that something had happened to him , but he said nothing to her about his love . 
Before he left he had a long talk with his father about something , and Princess Mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another . 
Soon after Prince Andrew had gone , Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Karagina in Petersburg , whom she had dreamed -LRB- as all girls dream -RRB- of marrying to her brother , and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother , killed in Turkey .
