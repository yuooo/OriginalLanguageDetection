`` You can give the message to His Majesty , '' said Dolgorukov , hurriedly interrupting Bagration . 
On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few hours ' sleep before morning and felt cheerful , bold , and resolute , with elasticity of movement , faith in his good fortune , and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible , pleasant , and easy . 
All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning : there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part , more than that , he was orderly to the bravest general , and still more , he was going with a message to Kutuzov , perhaps even to the sovereign himself .
