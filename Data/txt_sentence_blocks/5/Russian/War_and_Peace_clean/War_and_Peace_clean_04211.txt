Despite the presence of the commander in chief , who attracted the attention of all the superior officers , the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him . 
When the service was over , Kutuzov stepped up to the icon , sank heavily to his knees , bowed to the ground , and for a long time tried vainly to rise , but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight . 
His white head twitched with the effort . 
At last he rose , kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips , and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand . 
The other generals followed his example , then the officers , and after them with excited faces , pressing on one another , crowding , panting , and pushing , scrambled the soldiers and militiamen .
