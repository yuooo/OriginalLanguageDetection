Through these forests Denisov and his party rode all day , sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge , but never losing sight of the moving French . 
That morning , Cossacks of Denisov 's party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles , which had stuck in the mud not far from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road . 
Since then , and until evening , the party had the movements of the French without attacking . 
It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then , after joining Dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman 's hut in the forest less than a mile from Shamshevo , to surprise the French at dawn , falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides , and rout and capture them all at one blow . 
In their rear , more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest came right up to the road , six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of French should show themselves .
