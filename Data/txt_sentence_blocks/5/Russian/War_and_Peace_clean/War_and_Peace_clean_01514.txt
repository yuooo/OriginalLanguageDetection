Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance . 
As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer 's quarters , the regiment began to move : the soldiers ran from the fires , thrust their pipes into their boots , their bags into the carts , got their muskets ready , and formed rank . 
The officers buttoned up their coats , buckled on their swords and pouches , and moved along the ranks shouting . 
The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads . 
The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted , crossed themselves , gave final instructions , orders , and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind , and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded .
