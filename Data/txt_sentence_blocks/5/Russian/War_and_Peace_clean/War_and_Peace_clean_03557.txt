There was about him something of Weyrother , Mack , and Schmidt , and many other German theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805 , but he was more typical than any of them . 
Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent . 
Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned , of coarse , robust build , broad in the hips , and with prominent shoulder blades . 
His face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set . 
His hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples , but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts .
