Pierre stepped out of his carriage and , passing the toiling militiamen , ascended the knoll from which , according to the doctor , the battlefield could be seen . 
It was about eleven o'clock . 
The sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which , rising like an amphitheater , extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere . 
From above on the left , bisecting that amphitheater , wound the Smolensk highroad , passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it . 
This was Borodino .
