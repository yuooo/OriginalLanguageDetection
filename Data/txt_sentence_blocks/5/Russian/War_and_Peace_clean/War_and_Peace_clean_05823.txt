The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the French was to theirs . 
The only difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily , with no such threat of destruction as hung over the French , and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people . 
The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon 's army was the rapidity of its movement , and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army . 
Kutuzov as far as was in his power , instead of trying to check the movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian army generals , directed his whole activity here , as he had done at Tarutino and Vyazma , to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army . 
But besides this , since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident , another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutuzov .
