Natasha quieted herself for a moment , but again some instinct told her that though all this was true , and though nothing had happened , yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew had perished . 
And again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with Kuragin , and again saw the face , gestures , and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm . 
Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him away from Petersburg , where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash , besides running up debts for as much more , which his creditors demanded from his father . 
His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time , but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief -- a post his father had procured for him -- and would at last try to make a good match there . 
He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Karagina .
