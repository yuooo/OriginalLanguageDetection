I like him . 
He is kind , he is one of God 's chosen , he 's a benefactor , he once gave me ten rubles , I remember . 
When I was in Kiev , Crazy Cyril says to me -LRB- he 's one of God 's own and goes barefoot summer and winter -RRB- , he says , ` Why are you not going to the right place ? 
Go to Kolyazin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed . ' 
On hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went . ''
