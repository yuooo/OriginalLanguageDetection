`` You say you ca n't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth . 
Nor could I , and it can not be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything . 
On earth , here on this earth '' -LRB- Pierre pointed to the fields -RRB- , `` there is no truth , all is false and evil ; but in the universe , in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth , and we who are now the children of earth are -- eternally -- children of the whole universe . 
Do n't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole ? 
Do n't I feel that I form one link , one step , between the lower and higher beings , in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deity -- the Supreme Power if you prefer the term -- is manifest ?
