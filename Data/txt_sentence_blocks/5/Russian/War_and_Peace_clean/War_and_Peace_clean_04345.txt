Telling the groom to follow him with the horses , Pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before . 
A crowd of military men was assembled there , members of the staff could be heard conversing in French , and Kutuzov 's gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible , his gray nape sunk between his shoulders . 
He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him . 
Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him , spellbound by beauty .
