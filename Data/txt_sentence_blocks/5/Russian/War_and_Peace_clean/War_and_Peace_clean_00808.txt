All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander , awaiting the word of command . 
A second and a third cannon ball flew past . 
Evidently they were firing at the hussars , but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them . 
The hussars did not look round , but at the sound of each shot , as at the word of command , the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different , holding its breath while the ball flew past , rose in the stirrups and sank back again . 
The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another , curious to see their comrades ' impression .
