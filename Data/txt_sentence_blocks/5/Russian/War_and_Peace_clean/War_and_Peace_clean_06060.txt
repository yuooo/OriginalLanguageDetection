Even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened , they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally , and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius . 
Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us , and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken , may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce -LRB- incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities -RRB- , and then the words chance and genius become superfluous . 
We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European convulsions and that we know only the facts -- that is , the murders , first in France , then in Italy , in Africa , in Prussia , in Austria , in Spain , and in Russia -- and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events , and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander , but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men , and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were , but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable . 
By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose , we shall clearly perceive that just as one can not imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces , so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill , than Napoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents . 
The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west .
