Beyond that space there was , on the one side , a demonstration made by the Russians with Uvarov 's cavalry at midday , and on the other side , beyond Utitsa , Poniatowski 's collision with Tuchkov ; but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield . 
On the field between Borodino and the fleches , beside the wood , the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way . 
The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns . 
Then when the whole field was covered with smoke , two divisions , Campan 's and Dessaix 's , advanced from the French right , while Murat 's troops advanced on Borodino from their left . 
From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the fleches were two thirds of a mile away , and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodino , so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there , especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality .
