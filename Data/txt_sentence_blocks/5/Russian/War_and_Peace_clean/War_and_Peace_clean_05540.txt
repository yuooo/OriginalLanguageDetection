Dokhturov went to Malo-Yaroslavets , but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of Kaluga -- a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible . 
Everywhere Kutuzov retreated , but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction . 
Napoleon 's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarutino and Malo-Yaroslavets , and make conjectures as to what would have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces . 
But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces -LRB- for the Russian army did not bar his way -RRB- , the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army , for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin . 
How could that army -- which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them , and on arriving at Smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them -- how could that army recuperate in Kaluga province , which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in Moscow , and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze ?
