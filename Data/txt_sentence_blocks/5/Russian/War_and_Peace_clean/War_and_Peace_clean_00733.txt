There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented . 
Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin 's horse at the porch . 
In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine . 
`` Ah , you 've come here too , young man ! '' 
he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows .
