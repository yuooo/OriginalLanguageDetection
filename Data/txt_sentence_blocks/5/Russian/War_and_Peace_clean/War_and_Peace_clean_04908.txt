However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin 's ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte , or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people , it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire , for Moscow had to burn as every village , factory , or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge . 
Moscow was burned by its inhabitants , it is true , but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it . 
Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin , Vienna , and other towns , simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt , nor bring them the keys of the city . 
The absorption of the French by Moscow , radiating starwise as it did , only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the second of September . 
After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances , Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity .
