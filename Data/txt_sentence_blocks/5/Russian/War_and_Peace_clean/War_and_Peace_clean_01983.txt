With a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs , and keeping on a worn , nankeen-covered , sheepskin coat , the traveler sat down on the sofa , leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped hair , and looked at Bezukhov . 
The stern , shrewd , and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre . 
He felt a wish to speak to the stranger , but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads , the traveler had closed his eyes . 
His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death 's head . 
The stranger sat without stirring , either resting or , as it seemed to Pierre , sunk in profound and calm meditation .
