The candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted , as Pierre knew by the smell , and he was told that he would now see the lesser light . 
The bandage was taken off his eyes and , by the faint light of the burning spirit , Pierre , as in a dream , saw several men standing before him , wearing aprons like the Rhetor 's and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast . 
Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood . 
On seeing this , Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords , meaning them to pierce it .
