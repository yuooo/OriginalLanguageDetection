And Pierre began to feel in the same way toward Karataev . 
To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier . 
They called him `` little falcon '' or `` Platosha , '' chaffed him good-naturedly , and sent him on errands .

Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers .
