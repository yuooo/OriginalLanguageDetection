This officer , a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment , was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years before . 
Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done . 
Zdrzhinski , the officer with the long mustache , spoke grandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being `` a Russian Thermopylae , '' and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General Raevski . 
He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him . 
Rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski 's enthusiasm but , on the contrary , looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing , though with no intention of contradicting it .
