Prince Andrew recognized him at once , and felt a throb within him , as happens at critical moments of life . 
Whether it was from respect , envy , or anticipation , he did not know . 
Speranski 's whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable . 
In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance ; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed , rather humid eyes , or so firm a smile that expressed nothing ; nor had he heard such a refined , smooth , soft voice ; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands -- hands which were broad , but very plump , soft , and white . 
Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital .
