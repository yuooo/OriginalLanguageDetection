This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria , the only change being that the words `` Father Kamenski '' were replaced by `` Father Kutuzov . '' 
Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground , the drummer -- a lean , handsome soldier of forty -- looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes . 
Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him , he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and , holding it there for some seconds , suddenly flung it down and began : `` Oh , my bower , oh , my bower ... ! '' 
`` Oh , my bower new ... ! '' 
chimed in twenty voices , and the castanet player , in spite of the burden of his equipment , rushed out to the front and , walking backwards before the company , jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone .
