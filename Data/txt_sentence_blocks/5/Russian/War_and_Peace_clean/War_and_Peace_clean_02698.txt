And what do you think , dear friend ? 
Five years have passed since then , and already I , with my petty understanding , begin to see clearly why she had to die , and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator , whose every action , though generally incomprehensible to us , is but a manifestation of His infinite love for His creatures . 
Perhaps , I often think , she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother 's duties . 
As a young wife she was irreproachable ; perhaps she could not have been so as a mother . 
As it is , not only has she left us , and particularly Prince Andrew , with the purest regrets and memories , but probably she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself .
