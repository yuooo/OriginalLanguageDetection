On the twelfth of July , on the eve of that action , there was a heavy storm of rain and hail . 
In general , the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms . 
The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye , which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses . 
The rain was descending in torrents , and Rostov , with a young officer named Ilyin , his protege , was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter .
