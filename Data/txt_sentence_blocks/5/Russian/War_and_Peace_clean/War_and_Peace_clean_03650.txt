At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in Moscow ; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to the people , and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow . 
And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received , exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of Russia . 
It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger , it was said that Smolensk had surrendered , that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia . 
On the eleventh of July , which was Saturday , the manifesto was received but was not yet in print , and Pierre , who was at the Rostovs ' , promised to come to dinner next day , Sunday , and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal , which he would obtain from Count Rostopchin . 
That Sunday , the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis ' private chapel as usual .
