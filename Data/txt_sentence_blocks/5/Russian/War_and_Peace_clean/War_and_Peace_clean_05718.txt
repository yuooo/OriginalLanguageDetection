At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy , after locking the prisoners in a stable , had gone off to pillage their own stores , several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away , but were recaptured by the French and shot . 
The arrangement adopted when they started , that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest , had long since been abandoned . 
All who could walk went together , and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karataev for its master . 
On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow , and as he grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him . 
Pierre did not know why , but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him .
