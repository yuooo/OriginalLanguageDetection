At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell . 
He ate nothing and had slept badly that night , those around him reported . 
The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded . 
At daybreak on the seventeenth , a French officer who had come with a flag of truce , demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor , was brought into Wischau from our outposts . 
This officer was Savary .
