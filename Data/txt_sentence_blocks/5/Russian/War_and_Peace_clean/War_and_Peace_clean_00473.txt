In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre : `` Yes , my dear , this is a great loss for us all , not to speak of you . 
But God will support you : you are young , and are now , I hope , in command of an immense fortune . 
The will has not yet been opened . 
I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head , but it imposes duties on you , and you must be a man . '' 
Pierre was silent .
