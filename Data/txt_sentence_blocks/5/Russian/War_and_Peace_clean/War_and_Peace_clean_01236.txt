Princess Mary was left alone . 
She did not comply with Lise 's request , she not only left her hair as it was , but did not even look in her glass . 
Letting her arms fall helplessly , she sat with downcast eyes and pondered . 
A husband , a man , a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination , and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own . 
She fancied a child , her own -- such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse 's daughter -- at her own breast , the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child .
