The soldiers of Dessaix 's division advancing against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fleches . 
As soon as they had descended into that hollow , the smoke of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it . 
Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black -- probably men -- and at times the glint of bayonets . 
But whether they were moving or stationary , whether they were French or Russian , could not be discovered from the Shevardino Redoubt . 
The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into Napoleon 's face as , shading his eyes with his hand , he looked at the fleches .
