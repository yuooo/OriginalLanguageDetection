The French , the spy reported , having crossed the Vienna bridge , were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim , which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of Kutuzov 's retreat . 
If he reached Znaim before the French , there would be great hope of saving the army ; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm , or to utter destruction . 
But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible . 
The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim . 
The night he received the news , Kutuzov sent Bagration 's vanguard , four thousand strong , to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road .
