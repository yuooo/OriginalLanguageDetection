In spite of my wish to see you , I do not think so and do not want to do so . 
You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte ! 
The case is this : my father 's health is growing noticeably worse , he can not stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable . 
This irritability is , as you know , chiefly directed to political questions . 
He can not endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own , the grandson of the Great Catherine !
