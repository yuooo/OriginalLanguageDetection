Though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay , yet at first glance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse , while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse , but a man who was one with his horse , a being consequently possessed of twofold strength . 
A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide , wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap . 
A little behind , on a poor , small , lean Kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth , rode a young officer in a blue French overcoat . 
Beside him rode an hussar , with a boy in a tattered French uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse . 
The boy held on to the hussar with cold , red hands , and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise .
