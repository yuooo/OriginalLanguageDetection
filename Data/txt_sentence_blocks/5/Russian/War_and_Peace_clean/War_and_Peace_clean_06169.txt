Natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk , especially by the French , which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries , should not neglect her accomplishments , should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried , and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband . 
Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery , of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part . 
She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive . 
She took no pains with her manners or with of speech , or with her toilet , or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes , or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting . 
She acted in contradiction to all those rules .
