I nominated him and was the Rhetor . 
A strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber . 
I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to overcome .

It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge .
