And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy , and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe , the exhausted , wavering men felt comforted and inspirited . 
Prince Andrew 's regiment was among the reserves which till after one o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk , under heavy artillery fire . 
Toward two o'clock the regiment , having already lost more than two hundred men , was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery , where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense , concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o'clock . 
Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men . 
From in front and especially from the right , in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed , and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front , quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly .
