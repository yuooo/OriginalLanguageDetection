Pierre rode up to them . 
Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino , which the French -LRB- having occupied Borodino -RRB- were attacking in the first phase of the battle . 
Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow , among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before ; but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle . 
He did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side , or the projectiles that flew over him , did not see the enemy on the other side of the river , and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded , though many fell near him . 
He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face .
