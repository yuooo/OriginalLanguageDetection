When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction ; he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another , that is , leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies , he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small . 
The same is done by the natural sciences : leaving aside the question of cause , they seek for laws . 
History stands on the same path . 
And if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals , it too , setting aside the conception of cause , should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will . 
From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved , the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients .
