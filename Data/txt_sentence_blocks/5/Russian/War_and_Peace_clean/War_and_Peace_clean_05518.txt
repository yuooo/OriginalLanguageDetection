When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up , first blue and then red , Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle , from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away , and looked at the messenger . 
Bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve . 
`` Who gave the report ? ''
