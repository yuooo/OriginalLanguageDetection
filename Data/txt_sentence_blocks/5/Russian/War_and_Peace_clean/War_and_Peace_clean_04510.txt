A commander in chief 's business , it would seem , is simply to choose one of these projects . 
But even that he can not do . 
Events and time do not wait . 
For instance , on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the Kaluga road , but just then an adjutant gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire . 
An order must be given him at once , that instant .
