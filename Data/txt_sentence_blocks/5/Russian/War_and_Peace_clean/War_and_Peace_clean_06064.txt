The enemy 's fleet , which subsequently did not let a single boat pass , allows his entire army to elude it . 
In Africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants . 
And the men who commit these crimes , especially their leader , assure themselves that this is admirable , this is glory - it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and is therefore good . 
This ideal of glory and grandeur -- which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits , ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance -- that ideal , destined to guide this man and his associates , had scope for its development in Africa . 
Whatever he does succeeds .
