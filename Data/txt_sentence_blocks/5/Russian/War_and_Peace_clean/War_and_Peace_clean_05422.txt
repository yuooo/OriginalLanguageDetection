The absence of citizens and of a deputation , and even the burning of Moscow , did not disconcert him . 
He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy , or of the welfare of the people of Russia , or of the direction of affairs in Paris , or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace . 
With regard to military matters , Napoleon immediately on his entry into Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of the Russian army , sent army corps out along the different roads , and charged Murat to find Kutuzov . 
Then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the Kremlin , and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of Russia . 
With regard to diplomatic questions , Napoleon summoned Captain Yakovlev , who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of Moscow , minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity , and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopchin had managed affairs badly in Moscow , he dispatched Yakovlev to Petersburg .
