Every act of theirs , which appears to them an act of their own will , is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity . 
On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden , where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes , dukes , kings , and even an emperor . 
Before leaving , Napoleon showed favor to the emperor , kings , and princes who had deserved it , reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied , presented pearls and diamonds of his own -- that is , which he had taken from other kings - to the Empress of Austria , and having , as his historian tells us , tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise -- who regarded him as her husband , though he had left another wife in Paris -- left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear . 
Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end , and though the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander , calling him Monsieur mon frere , and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him -- yet he set off to join his army , and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east . 
He went in a traveling coach with six horses , surrounded by pages , aides-de-camp , and an escort , along the road to Posen , Thorn , Danzig , and Konigsberg .
