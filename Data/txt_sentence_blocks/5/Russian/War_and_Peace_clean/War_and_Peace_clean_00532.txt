`` What of Sweden ? 
How will they cross Pomerania ? '' 
Prince Andrew , seeing that his father insisted , began -- at first reluctantly , but gradually with more and more animation , and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on - to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign . 
He explained how an army , ninety thousand strong , was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war ; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund ; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians , with a hundred thousand Russians , were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine ; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples , and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides . 
The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation , but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about , and three times unexpectedly interrupted .
