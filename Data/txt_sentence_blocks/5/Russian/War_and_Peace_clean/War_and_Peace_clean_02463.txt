Human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it , and kill everything to examine it . 
In the holy science of our order all is one , all is known in its entirety and life . 
The Trinity -- the three elements of matter -- are sulphur , mercury , and salt . 
Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature ; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury , seizes it , holds it , and in combination produces other bodies . 
Mercury is a fluid , volatile , spiritual essence .
