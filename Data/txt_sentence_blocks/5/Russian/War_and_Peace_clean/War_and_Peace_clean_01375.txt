Having been sent with papers from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich , he looked in on Boris , hoping to find him alone . 
When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits -LRB- Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man -RRB- , he gave Boris a pleasant smile , frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at Rostov , bowed slightly and wearily , and sat down languidly on the sofa : he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company . 
Rostov flushed up on noticing this , but he did not care , this was a mere stranger . 
Glancing , however , at Boris , he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line . 
In spite of Prince Andrew 's disagreeable , ironical tone , in spite of the contempt with which Rostov , from his fighting army point of view , regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one , Rostov felt confused , blushed , and became silent .
