Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed : she is so kind-hearted that she ca n't look at blood , but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce . 
They talk to us of the rules of war , of chivalry , of flags of truce , of mercy to the unfortunate and so on . 
It 's all rubbish ! 
I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805 ; they humbugged us and we humbugged them . 
They plunder other people 's houses , issue false paper money , and worst of all they kill my children and my father , and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes !
