The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account , because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering ; `` besides , '' thought he , `` all such ` words of honor ' are conventional things with no definite meaning , especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead , or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same ! '' 
Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort , nullifying all his decisions and intentions . 
He went to Kuragin 's . 
Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards ' barracks , in which Anatole lived , Pierre entered the lighted porch , ascended the stairs , and went in at the open door . 
There was no one in the anteroom ; empty bottles , cloaks , and overshoes were lying about ; there was a smell of alcohol , and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance .
