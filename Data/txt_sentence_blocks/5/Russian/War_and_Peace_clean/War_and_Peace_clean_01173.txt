`` He is such a worthy and excellent man , our dear Vyazmitinov ... '' Everybody laughed a great deal . 
At the head of the table , where the honored guests sat , everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations . 
Only Pierre and Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table , a suppressed smile brightening both their faces , a smile that had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich -- a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings . 
But much as all the rest laughed , talked , and joked , much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine , saute , and ices , and however they avoided looking at the young couple , and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them , one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about Sergey Kuzmich , the laughter , and the food were all a pretense , and that the whole attention of that company was directed to -- Pierre and Helene . 
Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing of Sergey Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter , and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said : `` Yes ... it 's getting on , it will all be settled today . ''
