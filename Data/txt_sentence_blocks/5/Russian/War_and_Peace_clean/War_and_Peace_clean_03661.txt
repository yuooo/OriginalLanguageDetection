How long , O Lord , how long shall the wicked triumph ? 
How long shall they wield unlawful power ? 
`` Lord God ! 
Hear us when we pray to Thee ; strengthen with Thy might our most gracious sovereign lord , the Emperor Alexander Pavlovich ; be mindful of his uprightness and meekness , reward him according to his righteousness , and let it preserve us , Thy chosen Israel ! 
Bless his counsels , his undertakings , and his work ; strengthen his kingdom by Thine almighty hand , and give him victory over his enemy , even as Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek , Gideon over Midian , and David over Goliath .
