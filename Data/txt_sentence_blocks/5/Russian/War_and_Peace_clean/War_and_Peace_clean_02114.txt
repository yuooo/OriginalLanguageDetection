He does so . 
This is the battle of Pultusk , which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind . 
We civilians , as you know , have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost . 
Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say ; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk . 
In short , we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory , and General Bennigsen , hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory , does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden .
