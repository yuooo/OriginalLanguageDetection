The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French . 
At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt , but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops . 
The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines , the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men , poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up . 
Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter ; around the fires sat others , dressed and undressed , drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers . 
In one company dinner was ready , and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler , waiting till the sample , which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter , had been tasted .
