One night when the old countess , in nightcap and dressing jacket , without her false curls , and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap , knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer , her door creaked and Natasha , also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers , ran in . 
The countess -- her prayerful mood dispelled -- looked round and frowned . 
She was finishing her last prayer : `` Can it be that this couch will be my grave ? '' 
Natasha , flushed and eager , seeing her mother in prayer , suddenly checked her rush , half sat down , and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself . 
Seeing that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and , rapidly slipping one little foot against the other , pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave .
