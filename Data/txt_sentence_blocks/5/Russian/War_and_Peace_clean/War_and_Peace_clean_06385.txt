A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him ; or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby , who steals some food ; or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man -- seem less guilty , that is , less free and more subject to the law of necessity , to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed , and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning , that the mother was hungry , that the soldier was in the ranks , and so on . 
Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability , to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed . 
And in the same way every action of an insane , intoxicated , or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action , and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it . 
In all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased , according to the point of view from which the action is regarded . 
So that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa .
