they all understood that the war was not ended . 
Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia , but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained . 
He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops , spoke of the hardships already endured by the people , of the possibility of failure and so forth . 
This being the field marshal 's frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war .
