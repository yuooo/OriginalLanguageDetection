The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge , squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel . 
At last the baggage wagons had all crossed , the crush was less , and the last battalion came onto the bridge . 
Only Denisov 's squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy , who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge , for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away . 
At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving . 
Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground , artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen .
