Prince Andrew took out his notebook and , leaning on the cannon , sketched a plan of the position . 
He made some notes on two points , intending to mention them to Bagration . 
His idea was , first , to concentrate all the artillery in the center , and secondly , to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip . 
Prince Andrew , being always near the commander in chief , closely following the mass movements and general orders , and constantly studying historical accounts of battles , involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline . 
He imagined only important possibilities : `` If the enemy attacks the right flank , '' he said to himself , `` the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up .
