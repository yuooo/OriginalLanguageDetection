This battle , which consisted in the capture of a French squadron , was represented as a brilliant victory over the French , and so the Emperor and the whole army , especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield , believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will . 
A few minutes after the Emperor had passed , the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance . 
In Wischau itself , a petty German town , Rostov saw the Emperor again . 
In the market place , where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor 's arrival , lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move . 
The Emperor , surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers , was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare , a different one from that which he had ridden at the review , and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone , with blood on his uncovered head .
