The evening was ending , but the night had not yet come . 
Pierre got up and left his new companions , crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed . 
He wanted to talk to them . 
On the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back . 
Pierre turned back , not to his companions by the campfire , but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody .
