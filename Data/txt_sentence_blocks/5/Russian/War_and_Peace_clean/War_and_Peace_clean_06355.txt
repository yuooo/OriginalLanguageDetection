Every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted . 
All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted . 
Only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events , and are executed . 
Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed , we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be . 
Apart from that , the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable , diverse , and petty events , such for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia , is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events , and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will .
