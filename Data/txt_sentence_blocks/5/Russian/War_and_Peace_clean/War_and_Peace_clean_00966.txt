Count Nostitz , the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts , believed Murat 's emissary and retired , leaving Bagration 's division exposed . 
Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days ' truce . 
Bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer he had received . 
A truce was Kutuzov 's sole chance of gaining time , giving Bagration 's exhausted troops some rest , and letting the transport and heavy convoys -LRB- whose movements were concealed from the French -RRB- advance if but one stage nearer Znaim . 
The offer of a truce gave the only , and a quite unexpected , chance of saving the army .
