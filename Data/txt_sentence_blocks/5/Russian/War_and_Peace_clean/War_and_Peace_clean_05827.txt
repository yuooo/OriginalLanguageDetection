`` I give you that column , lads , '' he said , riding up to the troops and pointing out the French to the cavalry .

At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners , several hundred cannon , and a stick called a `` marshal 's staff , '' and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement -- though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon , or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort , and reproached one another and especially Kutuzov for having failed to do so .
