Rostov raised his saber , ready to strike , but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko , who was galloping ahead , shot away from him , and Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot . 
From behind him Bondarchuk , an hussar he knew , jolted against him and looked angrily at him . 
Bondarchuk 's horse swerved and galloped past .
