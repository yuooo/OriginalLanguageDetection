He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base . 
He was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be . 
He was convinced that , as a duck is so made that it must live in water , so God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society . 
He believed this so firmly that others , looking at him , were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money , which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay . 
He was not a gambler , at any rate he did not care about winning .
