The degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us . 
Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event , but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability . 
In every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability . 
And always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive , and the more inevitability the less freedom . 
The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded , but their relation is always one of inverse proportion .
