When men were killed or wounded , when rows of stretchers went past , when some troops retreated , and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke , no one paid any attention to these things . 
But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward , words of approval were heard on all sides . 
But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from , and unconnected with , the battle . 
It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday , commonplace occurrences . 
A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment .
