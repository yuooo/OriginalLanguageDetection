That day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris , telling him that the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him . 
Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops , after their active service , were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares . 
The Pavlograds held feast after feast , celebrating awards they had received for the campaign , and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian , who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses . 
Rostov , who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisov 's horse , Bedouin , was in debt all round , to his comrades and the sutlers . 
On receiving Boris ' letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz , dined there , drank a bottle of wine , and then set off alone to the Guards ' camp to find his old playmate .
