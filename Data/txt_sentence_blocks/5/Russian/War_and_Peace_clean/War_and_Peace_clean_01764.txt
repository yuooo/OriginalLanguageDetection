`` No apologies , none whatever , '' said Dolokhov to Denisov -LRB- who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation -RRB- , and he also went up to the appointed place . 
The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road , where the sleighs had been left , in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow , the frost having begun to break up during the last few days . 
The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing . 
The seconds , measuring the paces , left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvitski 's and Dolokhov 's sabers , which were stuck intothe ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier . 
It was thawing and misty ; at forty paces ' distance nothing could be seen .
