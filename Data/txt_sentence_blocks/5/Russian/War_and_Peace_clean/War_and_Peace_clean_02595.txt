The old count 's hospitality and good nature , which struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise , were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner . 
`` Yes , '' he thought , `` they are capital people , who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in Natasha ; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic , charming girl , overflowing with life ! '' 
In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him , a different world , that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him . 
Now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him , but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment . 
After dinner Natasha , at Prince Andrew 's request , went to the clavichord and began singing .
