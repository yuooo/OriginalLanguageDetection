From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs ' as Natasha 's affianced lover . 
No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha 's engagement to Bolkonski was not announced ; Prince Andrew insisted on that . 
He said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it ; that he had given his word and bound himself forever , but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom . 
If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him . 
Naturally neither Natasha nor her parents wished to hear of this , but Prince Andrew was firm .
