Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming . 
That inexorable , eternal , distant , and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life -- was now near to him and , by the strange lightness he experienced , almost comprehensible and palpable ... Formerly he had feared the end . 
He had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death -- the end -- but now he no longer understood that fear . 
He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him , and he looked at the fallow field , the bushes , and the sky , and knew that he was face to face with death . 
When he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal , unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it , he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it .
