Elohim is the name of the ruler of all . 
The third name is the name unutterable which means the All . 
Talks with Brother V. strengthen , refresh , and support me in the path of virtue . 
In his presence doubt has no place . 
The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me .
