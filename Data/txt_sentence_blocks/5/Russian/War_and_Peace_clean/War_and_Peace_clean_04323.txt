The dispositions cited above are not at all worse , but are even better , than previous dispositions by which he had won victories . 
His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly , but much the same as usual . 
These dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino was the first Napoleon did not win . 
The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad , and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance , when they relate to a battle that has been lost , and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good , and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits , when they relate to a battle that has been won . 
The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition , but still they were criticized -- criticized for their very perfection , for their excessive minuteness .
