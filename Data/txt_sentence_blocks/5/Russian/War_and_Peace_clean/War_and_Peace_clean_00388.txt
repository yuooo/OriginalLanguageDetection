While in the Rostovs ' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced , to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered , and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper , Count Bezukhov had a sixth stroke . 
The doctors pronounced recovery impossible . 
After a mute confession , communion was administered to the dying man , preparations made for the sacrament of unction , and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments . 
Outside the house , beyond the gates , a group of undertakers , who hid whenever a carriage drove up , waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral . 
The Military Governor of Moscow , who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count 's health , came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine 's court , Count Bezukhov .
