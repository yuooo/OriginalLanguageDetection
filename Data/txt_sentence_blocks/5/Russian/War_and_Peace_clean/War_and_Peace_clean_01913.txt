Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him , which he had reckoned up to ten thousand , but that now , as he vaguely supposed , must have risen to fifteen thousand . 
In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles . 
Dolokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them , but followed every movement of Rostov 's hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him . 
He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand . 
He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and Sonya 's joint ages .
