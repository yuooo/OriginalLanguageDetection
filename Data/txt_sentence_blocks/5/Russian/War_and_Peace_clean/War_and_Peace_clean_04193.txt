Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and , winding down and up , rose higher and higher to the village of Valuevo visible about four miles away , where Napoleon was then stationed . 
Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon . 
Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road , the cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the sun . 
Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse , to right and left of the forest and the road , smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops -- ours and the enemy 's . 
The ground to the right -- along the course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers -- was broken and hilly .
