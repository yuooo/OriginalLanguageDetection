This silence was broken by one of the brethren , who led Pierre up to the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it : the sun , the moon , a hammer , a plumb line , a trowel , a rough stone and a squared stone , a pillar , three windows , and so on . 
Then a place was assigned to Pierre , he was shown the signs of the Lodge , told the password , and at last was permitted to sit down . 
The Grand Master began reading the statutes . 
They were very long , and Pierre , from joy , agitation , and embarrassment , was not in a state to understand what was being read . 
He managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained in his mind .
