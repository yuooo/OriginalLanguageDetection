Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier 's account , as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence . 
`` I must make up for that in Moscow , '' said Napoleon . 
`` I 'll see you later , '' he added , and summoned de Beausset , who by that time had prepared the surprise , having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth . 
De Beausset bowed low , with that courtly French bow which only the old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make , and approached him , presenting an envelope . 
Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear .
