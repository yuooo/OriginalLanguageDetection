When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile , yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them , shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men . 
At balls he danced if a partner was needed . 
Young ladies , married and unmarried , liked him because without making love to any of them , he was equally amiable to all , especially after supper . 
`` Il est charmant ; il n ' a pas de sexe , '' * they said of him . 
* `` He is charming ; he has no sex . ''
