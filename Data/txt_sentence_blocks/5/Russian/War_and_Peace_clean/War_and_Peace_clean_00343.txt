Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha , who was sitting opposite . 
Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces , and ate a great deal . 
Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines . 
These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward , wrapped in a napkin , from behind the next man 's shoulders and whispered : `` Dry Madeira '' ... `` Hungarian '' ... or `` Rhine wine '' as the case might be . 
Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count 's monogram that stood before his plate , Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment , gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests .
