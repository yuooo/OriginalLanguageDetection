Anatole , who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance , sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness -- ever since the Naryshkins ' ball in fact , at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her . 
Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men .

Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage .
