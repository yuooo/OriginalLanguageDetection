Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree , the guests began to take their leave . 
Pierre was ungainly . 
Stout , about the average height , broad , with huge red hands ; he did not know , as the saying is , how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one ; that is , how to say something particularly agreeable before going away . 
Besides this he was absent-minded . 
When he rose to go , he took up instead of his own , the general 's three-cornered hat , and held it , pulling at the plume , till the general asked him to restore it .
