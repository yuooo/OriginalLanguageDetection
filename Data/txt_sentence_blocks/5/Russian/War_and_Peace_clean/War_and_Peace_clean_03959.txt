During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill , never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue , and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince , nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the Bogucharovo fields . 
Alpatych , arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate , sent for his Dron on the day of the prince 's funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess ' carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from Bogucharovo . 
Though the peasants paid quitrent , Alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order , for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in Bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do . 
But on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent . 
Alpatych named certain peasants he knew , from whom he told him to take the carts .
