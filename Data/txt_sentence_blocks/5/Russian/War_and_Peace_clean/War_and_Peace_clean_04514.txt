No jokes , or laughter , or smiles even , were seen among all these men . 
They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded . 
And all these groups , while talking among themselves , tried to keep near the commander in chief -LRB- whose bench formed the center of the gathering -RRB- and to speak so that he might overhear them .
