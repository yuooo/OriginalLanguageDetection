Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground . 
At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame , and immediately a deafening roar , crackling , and whistling made his ears tingle . 
When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands ; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed , only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass , and a horse , dangling fragments of its shaft behind it , galloped past , while another horse lay , like Pierre , on the ground , uttering prolonged and piercing cries . 
Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery , as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him . 
On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery .
