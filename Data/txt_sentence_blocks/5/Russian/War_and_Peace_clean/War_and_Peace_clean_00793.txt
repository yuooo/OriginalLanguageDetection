Nesvitski looked round and saw , some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry , Vaska Denisov , red and shaggy , with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder . 
`` Tell these devils , these fiends , to let me pass ! '' 
shouted Denisov evidently in a fit of rage , his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face . 
`` Ah , Vaska ! '' 
joyfully replied Nesvitski .
