was heard on all sides . 
For a moment the crowd stood still , but then it made another rush forward . 
Quite beside himself , Petya , clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously , pushed forward , elbowing his way and shouting `` hurrah ! '' 
as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else , but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted `` hurrah ! '' 
`` So this is what the Emperor is ! ''
