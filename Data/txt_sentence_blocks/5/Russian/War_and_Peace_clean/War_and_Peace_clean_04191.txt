When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street , he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps , who , talking and laughing loudly , animated and perspiring , were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road . 
Some of them were digging , others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks , while others stood about doing nothing . 
Two officers were standing on the knoll , directing the men . 
On seeing these peasants , who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers , Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said : `` They want the whole nation to fall on them . '' 
The sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield , with their queer , clumsy boots and perspiring necks , and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle , unfastened , exposing their sunburned collarbones , impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard .
