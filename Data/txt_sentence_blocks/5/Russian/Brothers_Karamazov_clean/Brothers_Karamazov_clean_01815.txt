`` I 'll be back directly , I have forgotten my purse . '' 
And I ran back alone , to Afanasy 's little room . 
`` Afanasy , '' I said , `` I gave you two blows on the face yesterday , forgive me , '' I said . 
He started as though he were frightened , and looked at me ; and I saw that it was not enough , and on the spot , in my full officer 's uniform , I dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground . 
`` Forgive me , '' I said .
