He had an independent property of about a thousand souls , to reckon in the old style . 
His splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery , with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit , almost as soon as he came into the estate , concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest , I do n't know exactly which . 
He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the `` clericals . '' 
Hearing all about Adelaida Ivanovna , whom he , of course , remembered , and in whom he had at one time been interested , and learning of the existence of Mitya , he intervened , in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch .
