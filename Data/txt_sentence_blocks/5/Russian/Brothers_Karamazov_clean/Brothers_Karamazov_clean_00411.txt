At first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns and in some other shady business , but now he has suddenly realised all she is and has gone wild about her . 
He keeps pestering her with his offers , not honourable ones , of course . 
And they 'll come into collision , the precious father and son , on that path ! 
But Grushenka favours neither of them , she 's still playing with them , and teasing them both , considering which she can get most out of . 
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he would n't marry her , and maybe he 'll turn stingy in the end , and keep his purse shut .
