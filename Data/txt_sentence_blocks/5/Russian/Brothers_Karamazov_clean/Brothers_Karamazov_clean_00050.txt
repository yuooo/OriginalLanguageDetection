In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov , a man very sensitive on the score of money and bourgeois honesty , pronounced the following judgment , after getting to know Alyosha : `` Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone without a penny , in the centre of an unknown town of a million inhabitants , and he would not come to harm , he would not die of cold and hunger , for he would be fed and sheltered at once ; and if he were not , he would find a shelter for himself , and it would cost him no effort or humiliation . 
And to shelter him would be no burden , but , on the contrary , would probably be looked on as a pleasure . ''
