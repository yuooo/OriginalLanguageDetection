This fateful visit , which was the first step leading to so many consequences , I never fully explained to myself . 
It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned , so proud , and apparently so cautious , should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life , hardly knew him , never thought of him , and would not under any circumstances have given him money , though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it . 
And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father , had been living with him for two months , and they were on the best possible terms . 
This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me . 
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miusov , of whom we have spoken already , the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's first wife , happened to be in the neighbourhood again on a visit to his estate .
