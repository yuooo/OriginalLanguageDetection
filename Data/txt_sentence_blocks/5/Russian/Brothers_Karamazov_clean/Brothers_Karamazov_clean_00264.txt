I shut my eyes and ask myself , ` Would you persevere long on that path ? 
And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude , but worried you with his whims , without valuing or remarking your charitable services , began abusing you and rudely commanding you , and complaining to the superior authorities of you -LRB- which often happens when people are in great suffering -RRB- - what then ? 
Would you persevere in your love , or not ? ' 
And do you know , I came with horror to the conclusion that , if anything could dissipate my love to humanity , it would be ingratitude . 
In short , I am a hired servant , I expect my payment at once - that is , praise , and the repayment of love with love .
