I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri , who was in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against him .

The younger brother , Alexey , had been a year already among us , having been the first of the three to arrive . 
It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction .
