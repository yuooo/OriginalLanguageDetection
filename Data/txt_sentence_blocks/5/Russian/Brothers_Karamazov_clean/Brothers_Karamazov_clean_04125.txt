Listen , in dreams and especially in nightmares , from indigestion or anything , a man sees sometimes such artistic visions , such complex and real actuality , such events , even a whole world of events , woven into such a plot , with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff , as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented . 
Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers , but by the most ordinary people , officials , journalists , priests ... . 
The subject is a complete enigma . 
A statesman confessed to me , indeed , that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep . 
Well , that 's how it is now , though I am your hallucination , yet just as in a nightmare , I say original things which had not entered your head before .
