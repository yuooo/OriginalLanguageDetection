Menacing with spear and arrow In the woods the hunter strayed ... . 
Woe to all poor wretches stranded On those cruel and hostile shores ! 
From the peak of high Olympus Came the mother Ceres down , Seeking in those savage regions Her lost daughter Proserpine . 
But the Goddess found no refuge , Found no kindly welcome there , And no temple bearing witness To the worship of the gods . 
From the fields and from the vineyards Came no fruits to deck the feasts , Only flesh of bloodstained victims Smouldered on the altar-fires , And where'er the grieving goddess Turns her melancholy gaze , Sunk in vilest degradation Man his loathsomeness displays Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha 's hand .
