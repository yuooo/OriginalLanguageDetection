The worst of it all was that , as I learned then , the young landowner had been a long while betrothed to her , and I had met him indeed many times in her house , but blinded by my conceit I had noticed nothing . 
And this particularly mortified me ; almost everybody had known all about it , while I knew nothing . 
I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury . 
With flushed face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring my love to her , and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me , she must , I concluded , have been laughing at me all the time . 
Later on , of course , I reflected and remembered that she had been very far from laughing at me ; on the contrary , she used to turn off any love-making on my part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects ; but at that moment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge .
