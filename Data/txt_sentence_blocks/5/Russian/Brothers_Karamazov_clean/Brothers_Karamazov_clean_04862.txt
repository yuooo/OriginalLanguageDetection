`` Karamazov , '' cried Kolya , `` can it be true what 's taught us in religion , that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each other again , all , Ilusha too ? '' 
`` Certainly we shall all rise again , certainly we shall see each other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened ! '' 
Alyosha answered , half laughing , half enthusiastic . 
`` Ah , how splendid it will be ! '' 
broke from Kolya .
