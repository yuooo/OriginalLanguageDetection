They suffer , of course ... but then they live , they live a real life , not a fantastic one , for suffering is life . 
Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it ? 
It would be transformed into an endless church service ; it would be holy , but tedious . 
But what about me ? 
I suffer , but still , I do n't live .
