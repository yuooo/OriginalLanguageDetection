And God gave up the just man He loved so , to the devil . 
And the devil smote his children and his cattle and scattered his wealth , all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven . 
And Job rent his mantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud , `` Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return into the earth ; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away . 
Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever . '' 
Fathers and teachers , forgive my tears now , for all my childhood rises up again before me , and I breathe now as I breathed then , with the breast of a little child of eight , and I feel as I did then , awe and wonder and gladness .
