Even if you do n't agree with me , I shall do my duty in the most important things . '' 
`` That 's right ; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters , but in everything . 
And I am ready to vow to do so now - in everything , and for all my life ! '' 
cried Lise fervently , `` and I 'll do it gladly , gladly ! 
What 's more , I 'll swear never to spy on you , never once , never to read one of your letters .
