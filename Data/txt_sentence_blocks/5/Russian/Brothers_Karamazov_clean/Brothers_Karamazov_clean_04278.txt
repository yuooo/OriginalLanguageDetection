Besides , my account would be to some extent superfluous , because in the speeches for the prosecution and for the defence the whole course of the evidence was brought together and set in a strong and significant light , and I took down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full , and will quote them in due course , together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected episode , which occurred before the final speeches , and undoubtedly influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial . 
I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all , that is , the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the arguments the defence had to rely upon . 
Everyone realised it from the first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single point , and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed . 
Everyone , perhaps , felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute , that there was no doubt about it , that there could be really no discussion , and that the defence was only a matter of form , and that the prisoner was guilty , obviously and conclusively guilty . 
I imagine that even the ladies , who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the interesting prisoner , were at the same time , without exception , convinced of his guilt .
