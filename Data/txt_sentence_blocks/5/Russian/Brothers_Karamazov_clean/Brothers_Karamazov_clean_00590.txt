From this field of corruption fouled by flies , let 's pass to my tragedy , also befouled by flies , that is , by every sort of vileness . 
Although the old man told lies about my seducing innocence , there really was something of the sort in my tragedy , though it was only once , and then it did not come off . 
The old man who has reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact ; I never told anyone about it . 
You 're the first , except Ivan , of course - Ivan knows everything . 
He knew about it long before you .
