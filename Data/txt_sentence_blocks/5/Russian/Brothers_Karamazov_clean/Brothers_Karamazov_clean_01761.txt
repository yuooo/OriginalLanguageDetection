My mother began weeping , and , careful not to alarm my brother , she entreated him to go to church , to confess and take the sacrament , as he was still able to move about . 
This made him angry , and he said something profane about the church . 
He grew thoughtful , however ; he guessed at once that he was seriously ill , and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament . 
He had been aware , indeed , for a long time past , that he was far from well , and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to your mother and me , `` My life wo n't be long among you , I may not live another year , '' which seemed now like a prophecy . 
Three days passed and Holy Week had come .
