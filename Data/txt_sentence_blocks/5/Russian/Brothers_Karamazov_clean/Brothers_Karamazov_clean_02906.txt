`` You should have asked me like that from the beginning , '' cried Mitya , laughing aloud , `` and , if you like , we wo n't begin from yesterday , but from the morning of the day before ; then you 'll understand how , why , and where I went . 
I went the day before yesterday , gentlemen , to a merchant of the town , called Samsonov , to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security . 
It was a pressing matter , gentlemen , it was a sudden necessity . '' 
`` Allow me to interrupt you , '' the prosecutor put in politely . 
`` Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum , three thousand ? ''
