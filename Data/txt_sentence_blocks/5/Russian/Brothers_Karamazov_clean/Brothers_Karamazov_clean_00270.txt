Well , now , after such a confession , I believe that you are sincere and good at heart . 
If you do not attain happiness , always remember that you are on the right road , and try not to leave it . 
Above all , avoid falsehood , every kind of falsehood , especially falseness to yourself . 
Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour , every minute . 
Avoid being scornful , both to others and to yourself .
