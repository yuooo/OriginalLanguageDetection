`` That anecdote about the quadrillion years , I made up myself ! 
I was seventeen then , I was at the high school . 
I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin , it was at Moscow ... . 
The anecdote is so characteristic that I could n't have taken it from anywhere . 
I thought I 'd forgotten it ... but I 've unconsciously recalled it - I recalled it myself - it was not you telling it !
