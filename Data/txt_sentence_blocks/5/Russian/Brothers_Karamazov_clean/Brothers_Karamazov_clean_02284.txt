`` Othello was not jealous , he was trustful , '' observed Pushkin . 
And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great poet . 
Othello 's soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply because his ideal was destroyed . 
But Othello did not begin hiding , spying , peeping . 
He was trustful , on the contrary .
