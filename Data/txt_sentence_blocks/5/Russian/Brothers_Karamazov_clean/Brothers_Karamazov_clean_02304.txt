Excuse me for the triviality of the expression , but I 'm in a fever - '' `` I know , I know that you 're in a fever . 
You could hardly fail to be , and whatever you may say to me , I know beforehand . 
I have long been thinking over your destiny , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I am watching over it and studying it ... . 
Oh , believe me , I 'm an experienced doctor of the soul , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Madam , if you are an experienced doctor , I 'm certainly an experienced patient , '' said Mitya , with an effort to be polite , `` and I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way , you will come to my help in my ruin , and so allow me , at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you ... .
