I 'll prove it ... . 
Would you believe it , holy Father , he has captivated the heart of the most honourable of young ladies of good family and fortune , daughter of a gallant colonel , formerly his superior officer , who had received many honours and had the Anna Order on his breast . 
He compromised the girl by his promise of marriage , now she is an orphan and here ; she is betrothed to him , yet before her very eyes he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress . 
And although this enchantress has lived in , so to speak , civil marriage with a respectable man , yet she is of an independent character , an unapproachable fortress for everybody , just like a legal wife - for she is virtuous , yes , holy Fathers , she is virtuous . 
Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a golden key , and that 's why he is insolent to me now , trying to get money from me , though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress already .
