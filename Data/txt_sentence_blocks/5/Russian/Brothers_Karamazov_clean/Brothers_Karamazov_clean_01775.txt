He was fully conscious though he could not talk ; up to his last hour he did not change . 
He looked happy , his eyes beamed and sought us , he smiled at us , beckoned us . 
There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his death . 
I was impressed by all this at the time , but not too much so , though I cried a good deal at his funeral . 
I was young then , a child , but a lasting impression , a hidden feeling of it all , remained in my heart , ready to rise up and respond when the time came .
