It 's that , that we must begin with . 
Oh , blind race of men who have no understanding ! 
As soon as men have all of them denied God - and I believe that period , analogous with geological periods , will come to pass - the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism , and , what 's more , the old morality , and everything will begin anew . 
Men will unite to take from life all it can give , but only for joy and happiness in the present world . 
Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man-god will appear .
