The furniture was of mahogany , covered with leather , in the old-fashioned style of 1820 the floor was not even stained , but everything was shining with cleanliness , and there were many choice flowers in the windows ; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was , of course , the beautifully decorated table . 
The cloth was clean , the service shone ; there were three kinds of well-baked bread , two bottles of wine , two of excellent mead , and a large glass jug of kvas - both the latter made in the monastery , and famous in the neighbourhood . 
There was no vodka . 
Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes : fish-soup made of sterlets , served with little fish patties ; then boiled fish served in a special way ; then salmon cutlets , ice pudding and compote , and finally , blanc-mange . 
Rakitin found out about all these good things , for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen , where he already had a footing .
