I began saving money , I became hardhearted , grew stout - grew wiser , would you say ? 
No , no one in the whole world sees it , no one knows it , but when night comes on , I sometimes lie as I did five years ago , when I was a silly girl , clenching my teeth and crying all night , thinking , ` I 'll pay him out , I 'll pay him out ! ' 
Do you hear ? 
Well then , now you understand me . 
A month ago a letter came to me - he was coming , he was a widower , he wanted to see me .
