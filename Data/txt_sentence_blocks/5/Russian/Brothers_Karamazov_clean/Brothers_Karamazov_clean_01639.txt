What made his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual , external character - he felt that . 
Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere , just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye , and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it , yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realises , and removes the offending object , often quite a trifling and ridiculous one - some article left about in the wrong place , a handkerchief on the floor , a book not replaced on the shelf , and so on . 
At last , feeling very cross and ill-humoured , Ivan arrived home , and suddenly , about fifteen paces from the garden gate , he guessed what was fretting and worrying him . 
On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening , and at the first glance at him Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind , and that it was this man that his soul loathed . 
It all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear .
