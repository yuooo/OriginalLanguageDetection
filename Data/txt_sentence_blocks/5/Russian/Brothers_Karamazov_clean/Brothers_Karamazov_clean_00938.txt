Look at the night . 
You see what a dark night , what clouds , what a wind has risen . 
I hid here under the willow waiting for you . 
And as God 's above , I suddenly thought , why go on in misery any longer , what is there to wait for ? 
Here I have a willow , a handkerchief , a shirt , I can twist them into a rope in a minute , and braces besides , and why go on burdening the earth , dishonouring it with my vile presence ?
