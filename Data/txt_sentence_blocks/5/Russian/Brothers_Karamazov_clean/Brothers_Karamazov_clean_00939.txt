And then I heard you coming - Heavens , it was as though something flew down to me suddenly . 
So there is a man , then , whom I love . 
Here he is , that man , my dear little brother , whom I love more than anyone in the world , the only one I love in the world . 
And I loved you so much , so much at that moment that I thought , ` I 'll fall on his neck at once . ' 
Then a stupid idea struck me , to have a joke with you and scare you .
