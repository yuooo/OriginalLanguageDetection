Most likely he killed him in anger , burning with resentment , as soon as he looked on his hated rival . 
But having killed him , probably with one blow of the brass pestle , and having convinced himself , after careful search , that she was not there , he did not , however , forget to put his hand under the pillow and take out the envelope , the torn cover of which lies now on the table before us . 
`` I mention this fact that you may note one , to my thinking , very characteristic circumstance . 
Had he been an experienced murderer and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only , would he have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found , beside the corpse ? 
Had it been Smerdyakov , for instance , murdering his master to rob him , he would have simply carried away the envelope with him , without troubling himself to open it over his victim 's corpse , for he would have known for certain that the notes were in the envelope - they had been put in and sealed up in his presence - and had he taken the envelope with him , no one would ever have known of the robbery .
