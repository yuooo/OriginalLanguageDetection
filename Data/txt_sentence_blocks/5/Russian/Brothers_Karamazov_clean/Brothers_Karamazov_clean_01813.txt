`` God , can that too be false ? '' 
I thought as I wept . 
`` In truth , perhaps , I am more than all others responsible for all , a greater sinner than all men in the world . '' 
And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared to me : what was I going to do ? 
I was going to kill a good , clever , noble man , who had done me no wrong , and by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life , I should be torturing and killing her too .
