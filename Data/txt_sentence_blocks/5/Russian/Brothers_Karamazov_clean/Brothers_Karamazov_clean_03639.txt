` It was I who wrote them , ' said he . ' 
I wrote them as a joke , ' he said , ` for I think it degrading to write verses ... . 
But they are good poetry . 
They want to put a monument to your Pushkin for writing about women 's feet , while I wrote with a moral purpose , and you , ' said he , ` are an advocate of serfdom . 
You 've no humane ideas , ' said he .
