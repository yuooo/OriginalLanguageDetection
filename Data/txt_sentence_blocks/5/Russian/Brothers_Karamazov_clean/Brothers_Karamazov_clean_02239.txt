He seized his six roubles and ran home . 
At home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the house , who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him , though it was all they had . 
Mitya in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided that day , and he described , in desperate haste , the whole scheme he had put before Samsonov , the latter 's decision , his own hopes for the future , and so on . 
These people had been told many of their lodger 's secrets before , and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud , and almost one of themselves . 
Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya sent for posting-horses to take him to the Volovya station .
