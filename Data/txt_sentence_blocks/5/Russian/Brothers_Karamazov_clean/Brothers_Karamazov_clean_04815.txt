It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha . 
He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced . 
At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys , Ilusha 's schoolfellows . 
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last . 
There were about twelve of them , they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders .
