I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman . 
He told me it was read at our mass from the Lives of the Saints ... he was a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in Russia ... . 
I have not read the Lives of the Saints myself , and I am not going to read them ... all sorts of things are said at dinner - we were dining then . '' 
`` Yes , you were dining then , and so I lost my faith ! '' 
said Fyodor Pavlovitch , mimicking him .
