A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book , so large that at the time I fancied he could scarcely carry it . 
He laid it on the reading desk , opened it , and began reading , and suddenly for the first time I understood something read in the church of God . 
In the land of Uz , there lived a man , righteous and God-fearing , and he had great wealth , so many camels , so many sheep and asses , and his children feasted , and he loved them very much and prayed for them . 
`` It may be that my sons have sinned in their feasting . '' 
Now the devil came before the Lord together with the sons of God , and said to the Lord that he had gone up and down the earth and under the earth .
