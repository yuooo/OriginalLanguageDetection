I wo n't be your mistress , I 'll be faithful to you , I 'll be your slave , I 'll work for you . 
We 'll go to the young lady and bow down to her together , so that she may forgive us , and then we 'll go away . 
And if she wo n't forgive us , we 'll go , anyway . 
Take her money and love me ... . 
Do n't love her ... .
