I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect , for I was so much more impressionable than my companions . 
By the time we left the school as officers , we were ready to lay down our lives for the honour of the regiment , but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of honour , and if anyone had known it , he would have been the first to ridicule it . 
Drunkenness , debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves on . 
I do n't say that we were bad by nature , all these young men were good fellows , but they behaved badly , and I worst of all . 
What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money , and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure , and plunged headlong into all the recklessness of youth .
