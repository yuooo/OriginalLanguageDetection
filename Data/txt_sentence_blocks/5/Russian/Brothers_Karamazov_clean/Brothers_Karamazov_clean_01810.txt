... And all at once I knew what it was : it was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before ! 
It all rose before my mind , it all was , as it were , repeated over again ; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was holding his arms stiffly down , his head erect , his eyes fixed upon me as though on parade . 
He staggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his hands to protect himself . 
That is what a man has been brought to , and that was a man beating a fellow creature ! 
What a crime !
