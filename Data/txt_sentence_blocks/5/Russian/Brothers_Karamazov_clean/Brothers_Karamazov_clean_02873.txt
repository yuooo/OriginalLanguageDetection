And the very same day , in the evening I beat my father . 
I nearly killed him , and I swore I 'd come again and kill him , before witnesses ... . 
Oh , a thousand witnesses ! 
I 've been shouting it aloud for the last month , anyone can tell you that ! 
... The fact stares you in the face , it speaks for itself , it cries aloud , but feelings , gentlemen , feelings are another matter .
