`` Yes , but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father , and two days before , on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter , he was quiet and only quarrelled with a shopman in the tavern , because a Karamazov could not help quarrelling , forsooth ! 
But my answer to that is , that , if he was planning such a murder in accordance with his letter , he certainly would not have quarrelled even with a shopman , and probably would not have gone into the tavern at all , because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement , seeks to efface himself , to avoid being seen and heard , and that not from calculation , but from instinct . 
Gentlemen of the jury , the psychological method is a two-edged weapon , and we , too , can use it . 
As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month , do n't we often hear children , or drunkards coming out of taverns shout , ` I 'll kill you ' ? 
but they do n't murder anyone .
