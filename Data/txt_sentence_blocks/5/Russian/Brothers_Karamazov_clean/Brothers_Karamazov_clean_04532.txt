The End of the Prosecutor 's Speech IPPOLIT KIRILLOVITCH had chosen the historial method of exposition , beloved by all nervous orators , who find in its limitation a check on their own eager rhetoric . 
At this moment in his speech he went off into a dissertation on Grushenka 's `` first lover , '' and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme . 
`` Karamazov , who had been frantically jealous of everyone , collapsed , so to speak , and effaced himself at once before this first lover . 
What makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this formidable rival . 
But he had looked upon him as a remote danger , and Karamazov always lives in the present .
