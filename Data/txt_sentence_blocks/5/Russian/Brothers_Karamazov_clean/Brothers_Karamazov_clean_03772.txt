Brother , these last two months I 've found in myself a new man . 
A new man has risen up in me . 
He was hidden in me , but would never have come to the surface , if it had n't been for this blow from heaven . 
I am afraid ! 
And what do I care if I spend twenty years in the mines , breaking ore with a hammer ?
