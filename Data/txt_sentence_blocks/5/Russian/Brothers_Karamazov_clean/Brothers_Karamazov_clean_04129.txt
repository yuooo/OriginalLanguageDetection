`` You are angry with me even for being able to catch cold , though it happened in a most natural way . 
I was hurrying then to a diplomatic soiree at the house of a lady of high rank in Petersburg , who was aiming at influence in the Ministry . 
Well , an evening suit , white tie , gloves , though I was God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth ... . 
Of course , it took only an instant , but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight minutes , and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat . 
Spirits do n't freeze , but when one 's in fleshly form , well ... in brief , I did n't think , and set off , and you know in those ethereal spaces , in the water that is above the firmament , there 's such a frost ... at least one ca n't call it frost , you fancy , 150 degrees below zero !
