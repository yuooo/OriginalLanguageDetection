`` You 're a most skilful lawyer , I see , Nikolay Parfenovitch , '' cried Mitya , laughing gaily , `` but I can help you now . 
Oh , gentlemen , I feel like a new man , and do n't be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly . 
I 'm rather drunk , too , I 'll tell you that frankly . 
I believe I 've had the honour and pleasure of meeting you , Nikolay Parfenovitch , at my kinsman Miusov 's . 
Gentlemen , gentlemen , I do n't pretend to be on equal terms with you .
