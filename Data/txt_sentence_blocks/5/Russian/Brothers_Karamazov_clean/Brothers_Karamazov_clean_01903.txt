All lamented the terrible illness that had cut short his days . 
But all the town was up in arms against me after the funeral , and people even refused to see me . 
Some , at first a few and afterwards more , began indeed to believe in the truth of his story , and they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness , for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous . 
But I held my tongue , and very shortly after , I left the town , and five months later by God 's grace I entered the safe and blessed path , praising the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it . 
But I remember in my prayer to this day , the servant of God , Mihail , who suffered so greatly .
