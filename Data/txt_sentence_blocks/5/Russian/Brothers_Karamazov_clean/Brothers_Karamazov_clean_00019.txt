But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch 's other two sons , and of their origin . 
The Second Marriage and the Second Family VERY shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time . 
His second marriage lasted eight years . 
He took this second wife , Sofya Ivanovna , also a very young girl , from another province , where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew . 
Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital , and managed his business affairs very successfully , though , no doubt , not over-scrupulously .
