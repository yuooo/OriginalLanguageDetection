And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner 's statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity . 
` No , ' he says , ` such sensibility is impossible at such a moment , that 's unnatural ; he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead or alive , and so showed that he had committed the murder , since he would not have run back for any other reason . ' 
`` Here you have psychology ; but let us take the same method and apply it to the case the other way round , and our result will be no less probable . 
The murderer , we are told , leapt down to find out , as a precaution , whether the witness was alive or not , yet he had left in his murdered father 's study , as the prosecutor himself argues , an amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope , with an inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it . 
` If he had carried that envelope away with him , no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the notes in it , and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner . '
