He 's a rascal ! 
Three weeks ago he began to tease me . 
` You 've got yourself into a mess , like a fool , for the sake of three thousand , but I 'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand . 
I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg . ' 
And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov .
