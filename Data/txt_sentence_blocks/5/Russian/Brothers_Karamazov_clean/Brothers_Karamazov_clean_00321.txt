His dark brown hair was cropped short , and combed forward on his temples . 
He had the long , determined stride of a military man . 
He stood still for a moment on the threshold , and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder , guessing him to be their host . 
He made him a low bow , and asked his blessing . 
Father Zossima , rising in his chair , blessed him .
