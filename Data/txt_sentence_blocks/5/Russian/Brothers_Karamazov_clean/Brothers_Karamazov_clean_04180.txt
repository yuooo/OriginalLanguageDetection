Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he desired evil , but did only good . 
Well , he can say what he likes , it 's quite the opposite with me . 
I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good . 
I was there when the Word , Who died on the Cross , rose up into heaven bearing on His bosom the soul of the penitent thief . 
I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which shook heaven and all creation , and I swear to you by all that 's sacred , I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all .
