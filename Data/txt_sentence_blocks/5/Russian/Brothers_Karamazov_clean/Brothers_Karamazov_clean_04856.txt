Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not . 
But I can not forget that Kartashov exists and that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of Troy , but is looking at me with his jolly , kind , dear little eyes . 
Boys , my dear boys , let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha , clever , brave and generous like Kolya -LRB- though he will be ever so much cleverer when he is grown up -RRB- , and let us all be as modest , as clever and sweet as Kartashov . 
But why am I talking about those two ? 
You are all dear to me , boys ; from this day forth , I have a place in my heart for you all , and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me !
