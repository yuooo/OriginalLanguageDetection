you hear ? 
though he is condemned to penal servitude for twenty years , he is still planning to be happy - is not that piteous ? 
Think - you must visit him ; though he is ruined , he is innocent , '' broke like a challenge from Alyosha . 
`` His hands are clean , there is no blood on them ! 
For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now .
