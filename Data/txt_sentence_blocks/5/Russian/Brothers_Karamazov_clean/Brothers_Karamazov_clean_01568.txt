Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men 's freedom of faith ; for it will be manifest as a miracle , and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago . 
Didst Thou not often say then , `` I will make you free '' ? 
But now Thou hast seen these `` free '' men , ' the old man adds suddenly , with a pensive smile . 
` Yes , we 've paid dearly for it , ' he goes on , looking sternly at Him , ` but at last we have completed that work in Thy name . 
For fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom , but now it is ended and over for good .
