This mourning she got up well ; she had slept all night . 
Look at her rosy cheeks , her bright eyes ! 
She used to be always crying , but now she laughs and is gay and happy . 
This morning she insisted on my letting her stand up , and she stood up for a whole minute without any support . 
She wagers that in a fortnight she 'll be dancing a quadrille .
