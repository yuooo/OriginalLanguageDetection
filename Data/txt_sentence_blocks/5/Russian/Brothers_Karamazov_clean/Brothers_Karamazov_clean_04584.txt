At the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly , without system , one may say , dealing with facts separately , though , at the end , these facts formed a whole . 
His speech might be divided into two parts , the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge , sometimes malicious and sarcastic . 
But in the second half he suddenly changed his tone , and even his manner , and at once rose to pathos . 
The audience seemed on the lookout for it , and quivered with enthusiasm . 
He went straight to the point , and began by saying that although he practised in Petersburg , he had more than once visited provincial towns to defend prisoners , of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least a preconceived idea .
