What I dream of is becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant 's wife weighing eighteen stone , and of believing all she believes . 
My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith , upon my word it is . 
Then there would be an end to my sufferings . 
I like being doctored too ; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a foundling hospital - if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that day . 
I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs !
