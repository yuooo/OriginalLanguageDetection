I 'll wait three hours - four , five , six , seven . 
Only remember you must go to Katerina Ivanovna to-day , if it has to be at midnight , with the money or without the money , and say , ` He sends his compliments to you . ' 
I want you to say that verse to her : ` He sends his compliments to you . ' '' 
`` Mitya ! 
And what if Grushenka comes to-day - if not to-day , or the next day ? ''
