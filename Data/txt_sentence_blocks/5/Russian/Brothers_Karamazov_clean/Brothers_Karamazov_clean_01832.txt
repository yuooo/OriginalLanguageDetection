My heart was filled with joy , but my attention was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others . 
I knew him by name already , but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening . 
-LRB- d -RRB- The Mysterious Visitor . 
He had long been an official in the town ; he was in a prominent position , respected by all , rich and had a reputation for benevolence . 
He subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum ; he was very charitable , too , in secret , a fact which only became known after his death .
