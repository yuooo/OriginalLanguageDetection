She was a rather tall woman , though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna , who was exceptionally tall . 
She had a full figure , with soft , as it were , noiseless , movements , softened to a peculiar over-sweetness , like her voice . 
She moved , not like Katerina Ivanovna , with a vigorous , bold step , but noiselessly . 
Her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor . 
She sank softly into a low chair , softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress , and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl .
