Grushenka had money , of course , but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride ; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself , at his own expense , not at hers . 
He could not conceive of taking her money , and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion . 
I wo n't enlarge on this fact or analyse it here , but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment . 
All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated . 
`` I 've been a scoundrel to one of them , and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly , '' was his feeling then , as he explained after : `` and when Grushenka knows , she wo n't care for such a scoundrel . ''
