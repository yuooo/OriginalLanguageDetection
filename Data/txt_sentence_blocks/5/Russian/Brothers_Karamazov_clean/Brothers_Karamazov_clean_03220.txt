But then Kolya 's mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy 's behalf , and in the end Dardanelov , a respected and influential teacher , exerted himself in his favour , and the affair was ignored . 
Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor , who had been passionately in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past , and had once already , about a year previously , ventured , trembling with fear and the delicacy of his sentiments , to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage . 
But she refused him resolutely , feeling that to accept him would be an act of treachery to her son , though Dardanelov had , to judge from certain mysterious symptoms , reason for believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow . 
Kolya 's mad prank seemed to have broken the ice , and Dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession by a suggestion of hope . 
The suggestion , it is true , was a faint one , but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy .
