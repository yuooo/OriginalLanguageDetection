What I have in my mind is this : there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner , and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism , if it is examined separately . 
As I followed the case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed , and I suddenly received from the prisoner 's relatives a request to undertake his defence . 
I at once hurried here , and here I became completely convinced . 
It was to break down this terrible chain of facts , and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic , that I undertook the case . '' 
So Fetyukovitch began .
