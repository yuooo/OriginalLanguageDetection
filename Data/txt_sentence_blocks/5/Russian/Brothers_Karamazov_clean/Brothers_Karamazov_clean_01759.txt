Something made him take a fancy to Markel , and he used to ask him to see him . 
The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter , till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his own request , as he had powerful friends . 
It was the beginning of Lent , and Markel would not fast , he was rude and laughed at it . 
`` That 's all silly twaddle , and there is no God , '' he said , horrifying my mother , the servants , and me too . 
For though I was only nine , I too was aghast at hearing such words .
