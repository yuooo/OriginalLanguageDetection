Of the elder , Ivan , I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved , though far from timid boy . 
At ten years old he had realised that they were living not in their own home but on other people 's charity , and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak . 
This boy began very early , almost in his infancy -LRB- so they say at least -RRB- , to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning . 
I do n't know precisely why , but he left the family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen , entering a Moscow gymnasium and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher , an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch . 
Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the `` ardour for good works '' of Yefim Petrovitch , who was captivated by the idea that the boy 's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius .
