Grushenka left that letter , too , unanswered . 
A whole series of letters had followed - one every day - all as pompous and rhetorical , but the loan asked for , gradually diminishing , dropped to a hundred roubles , than to twenty-five , to ten , and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both . 
Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them , and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging . 
She found the two Poles in great poverty , almost destitution , without food or fuel , without cigarettes , in debt to their landlady . 
The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared .
