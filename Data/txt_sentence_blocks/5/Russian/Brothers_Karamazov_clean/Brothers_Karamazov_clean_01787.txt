My life is ending , I know that well , but every day that is left me I feel how earthly life is in touch with a new infinite , unknown , but approaching life , the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture , my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy . 
Friends and teachers , I have heard more than once , and of late one may hear it more often , that the priests , and above all the village priests , are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their humiliating lot . 
They plainly state , even in print - I 've read it myself - that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people because of the smallness of their means , and if Lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray , they let them lead them astray because they have so little to live upon . 
May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them , for their complaint is just , too . 
But of a truth I say , if anyone is to blame in the matter , half the fault is ours .
