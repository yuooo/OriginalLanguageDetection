So our general , settled on his property of two thousand souls , lives in pomp , and domineers over his poor neighbours as though they were dependents and buffoons . 
He has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys - all mounted , and in uniform . 
One day a serf-boy , a little child of eight , threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general 's favourite hound . 
` Why is my favourite dog lame ? ' 
He is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog 's paw .
