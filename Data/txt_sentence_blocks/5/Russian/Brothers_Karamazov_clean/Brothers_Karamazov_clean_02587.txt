I suppose you were n't married in Poland , were you ? '' 
`` No , in the Province of Smolensk . 
Only , a Uhlan had brought her to Russia before that , my future wife , with her mamma and her aunt , and another female relation with a grown-up son . 
He brought her straight from Poland and gave her up to me . 
He was a lieutenant in our regiment , a very nice young man .
