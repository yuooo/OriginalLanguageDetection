`` You take too many sins on yourself , '' mother used to say , weeping . 
`` Mother , darling , it 's for joy , not for grief I am crying . 
Though I ca n't explain it to you , I like to humble myself before them , for I do n't know how to love them enough . 
If I have sinned against everyone , yet all forgive me , too , and that 's heaven . 
Am I not in heaven now ? ''
