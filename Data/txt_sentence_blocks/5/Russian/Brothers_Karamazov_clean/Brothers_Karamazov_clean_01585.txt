That is true . 
But what happened ? 
Instead of taking men 's freedom from them , Thou didst make it greater than ever ! 
Didst Thou forget that man prefers peace , and even death , to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil ? 
Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience , but nothing is a greater cause of suffering .
