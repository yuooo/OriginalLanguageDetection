`` You preach it and do n't believe it yourself . 
Believe me , this dream , as you call it , will come to pass without doubt ; it will come , but not now , for every process has its law . 
It 's a spiritual , psychological process . 
To transform the world , to recreate it afresh , men must turn into another path psychologically . 
Until you have become really , in actual fact , a brother to everyone , brotherhood will not come to pass .
