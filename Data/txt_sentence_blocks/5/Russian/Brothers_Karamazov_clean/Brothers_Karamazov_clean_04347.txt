On his asking Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father and that he might kill him , and whether he had heard it , for instance , at their last meeting before the catastrophe , Alyosha started as he answered , as though only just recollecting and understanding something . 
`` I remember one circumstance now which I 'd quite forgotten myself . 
It was n't clear to me at the time , but now - '' And , obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea , he recounted eagerly how , at his last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree , on the road to the monastery , Mitya had struck himself on the breast , `` the upper part of the breast , '' and had repeated several times that he had a means of regaining his honour , that that means was here , here on his breast . 
`` I thought , when he struck himself on the breast , he meant that it was in his heart , '' Alyosha continued , `` that he might find in his heart strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even to me . 
I must confess I did think at the time that he was speaking of our father , and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some violence to him .
