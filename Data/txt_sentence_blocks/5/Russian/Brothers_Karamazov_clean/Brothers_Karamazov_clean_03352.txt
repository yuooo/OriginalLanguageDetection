I did not sneak on him , of course , and I made them all keep quiet , so it should n't come to the ears of the masters . 
I did n't even tell my mother till it had healed up . 
And the wound was a mere scratch . 
And then I heard that the same day he 'd been throwing stones and had bitten your finger - but you understand now what a state he was in ! 
Well , it ca n't be helped : it was stupid of me not to come and forgive him - that is , to make it up with him - when he was taken ill .
