But , so be it , I assume that my client is guilty of parricide . 
Even so , hear what I have to say . 
I have it in my heart to say something more to you , for I feel that there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds ... . 
Forgive my referring to your hearts and minds , gentlemen of the jury , but I want to be truthful and sincere to the end . 
Let us all be sincere ! ''
