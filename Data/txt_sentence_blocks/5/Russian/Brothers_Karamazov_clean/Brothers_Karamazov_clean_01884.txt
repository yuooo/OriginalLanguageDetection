I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him , but I did not dare - his face was contorted add sombre . 
He went away . 
`` Good God , '' I thought , `` what has he gone to face ! '' 
I fell on my knees before the ikon and wept for him before the Holy Mother of God , our swift defender and helper . 
I was half an hour praying in tears , and it was late , about midnight .
