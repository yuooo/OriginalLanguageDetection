The audience , too , was uneasy . 
The public was restless : there were even exclamations of indignation . 
Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply ; he only mounted the tribune to lay his hand on his heart and , with an offended voice , utter a few words full of dignity . 
He only touched again , lightly and ironically , on `` romancing '' and `` psychology , '' and in an appropriate place quoted , `` Jupiter , you are angry , therefore you are wrong , '' which provoked a burst of approving laughter in the audience , for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like Jupiter . 
Then , a propos of the accusation that he was teaching the young generation to murder their fathers , Fetyukovitch observed , with great dignity , that he would not even answer .
