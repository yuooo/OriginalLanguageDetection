There was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called von Schmidt , who owned the house at that time . 
It was all in decay , the floor was rotting , the planks were loose , the woodwork smelled musty . 
In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed in the ground , and round it were some green benches upon which it was still possible to sit . 
Alyosha had at once observed his brother 's exhilarated condition , and on entering the arbour he saw half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table . 
`` That 's brandy , '' Mitya laughed .
