It 's me he 's afraid of , I thought , only me . 
So Fenya told you , you little stupid , how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I 'd loved Mityenka for one hour , and that I was going now to love ... another . 
Mitya , Mitya , how could I be such a fool as to think I could love anyone after you ? 
Do you forgive me , Mitya ? 
Do you forgive me or not ?
