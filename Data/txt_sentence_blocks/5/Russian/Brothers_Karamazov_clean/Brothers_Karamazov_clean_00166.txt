Father Zossima , lifting his eyes , looked at him , and said with a smile : `` You have known for a long time what you must do . 
You have sense enough : do n't give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech ; do n't give way to sensual lust ; and , above all , to the love of money . 
And close your taverns . 
If you ca n't close all , at least two or three . 
And , above all - do n't lie . ''
