It was almost a morbid condition . 
Corrupt and often cruel in his lust , like some noxious insect , Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes , in moments of drunkenness , overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form . 
`` My soul 's simply quaking in my throat at those times , '' he used to say . 
At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand , in the lodge if not in the room , a strong , faithful man , virtuous and unlike himself , who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his secrets , but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that , not to oppose him , above all , not to reproach him or threaten him with anything , either in this world or in the next , and , in case of need , to defend him - from whom ? 
From somebody unknown , but terrible and dangerous .
