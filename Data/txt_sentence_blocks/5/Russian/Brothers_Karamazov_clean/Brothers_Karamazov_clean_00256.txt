`` I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering . '' 
`` Oh , how thankful I am to you ! 
You see , I shut my eyes and ask myself if everyone has faith , where did it come from ? 
And then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature , and that none of it 's real . 
And I say to myself , ` What if I 've been believing all my life , and when I come to die there 's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave ? '
