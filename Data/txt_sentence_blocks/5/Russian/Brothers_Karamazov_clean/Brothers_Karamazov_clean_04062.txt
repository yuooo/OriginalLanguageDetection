I went out into the garden all of a tremble , straight to the apple-tree with a hollow in it - you know that hollow . 
I 'd marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it . 
I wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole . 
And there it stayed for over a fortnight . 
I took it out later , when I came out of the hospital .
