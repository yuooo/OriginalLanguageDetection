The tears of humanity rose up to Him as before , awaited His coming , loved Him , hoped for Him , yearned to suffer and die for Him as before . 
And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervour , ' O Lord our God , hasten Thy coming ' ; so many ages called upon Him , that in His infinite mercy He deigned to come down to His servants . 
Before that day He had come down , He had visited some holy men , martyrs , and hermits , as is written in their lives . 
Among us , Tyutchev , with absolute faith in the truth of his words , bore witness that Bearing the Cross , in slavish dress , Weary and worn , the Heavenly King Our mother , Russia , came to bless , And through our land went wandering . 
And that certainly was so , I assure you .
