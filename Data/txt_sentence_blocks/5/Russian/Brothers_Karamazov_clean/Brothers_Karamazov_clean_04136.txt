In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan . 
He sent me a book and some drops , bless him , and , only fancy , Hoff 's malt extract cured me ! 
I bought it by accident , drank a bottle and a half of it , and I was ready to dance , it took it away completely . 
I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him , I was prompted by a feeling of gratitude , and only fancy , it led to no end of a bother : not a single paper would take my letter . 
` It would be very reactionary , ' they said , ` none will believe it .
