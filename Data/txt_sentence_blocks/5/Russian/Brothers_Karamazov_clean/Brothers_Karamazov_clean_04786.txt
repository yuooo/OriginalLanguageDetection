If I run away , even with money and a passport , and even to America , I should be cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure , not for happiness , but to another exile as bad , perhaps , as Siberia . 
It is as bad , Alyosha , it is ! 
I hate that America , damn it , already . 
Even though Grusha will be with me . 
Just look at her ; is she an American ?
