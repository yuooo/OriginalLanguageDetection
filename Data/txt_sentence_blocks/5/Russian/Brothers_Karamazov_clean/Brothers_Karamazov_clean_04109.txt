By the way , I am listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for something real , not simply your fancy , as you persisted in declaring last time - '' `` Never for one minute have I taken you for reality , '' Ivan cried with a sort of fury . 
`` You are a lie , you are my illness , you are a phantom . 
It 's only that I do n't know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a time . 
You are my hallucination . 
You are the incarnation of myself , but only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings , but only the nastiest and stupidest of them .
