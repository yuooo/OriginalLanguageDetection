What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is that you 're all sensual , grasping and crazy ! 
Your brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke , for some idiotic , unknown motive of his own , though he 's an atheist , and he admits it 's a fraud himself - that 's your brother Ivan . 
He 's trying to get Mitya 's betrothed for himself , and I fancy he 'll succeed , too . 
And what 's more , it 's with Mitya 's consent . 
For Mitya will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her , and escape to Grushenka .
