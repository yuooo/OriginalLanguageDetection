But he rarely cared to speak of this memory to anyone . 
In his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive , and talked little indeed , but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability ; quite the contrary , from something different , from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people , but so important to him that he seemed , as it were , to forget others on account of it . 
But he was fond of people : he seemed throughout his life to put implicit trust in people : yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton or naive person . 
There was something about him which made one feel at once -LRB- and it was so all his life afterwards -RRB- that he did not care to be a judge of others that he would never take it upon himself to criticise and would never condemn anyone for anything . 
He seemed , indeed , to accept everything without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly : and this was so much so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth .
