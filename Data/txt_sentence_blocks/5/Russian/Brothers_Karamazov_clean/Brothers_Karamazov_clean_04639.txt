Oh , I fully share the court 's and the prosecutor 's conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever , that his statement may really be a desperate effort , planned in delirium , to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man . 
But again Smerdyakov 's name is pronounced , again there is a suggestion of mystery . 
There is something unexplained , incomplete . 
And perhaps it may one day be explained . 
But we wo n't go into that now .
