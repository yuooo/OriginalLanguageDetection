I 've forgotten the name . 
I must look it up . 
It was in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century , and long live the Liberator of the People ! 
There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections , the owner of great estates , one of those men - somewhat exceptional , I believe , even then - who , retiring from the service into a life of leisure , are convinced that they 've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects . 
There were such men then .
