Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls , we are no holier than those that are outside , but on the contrary , from the very fact of coming here , each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others , than all men on earth ... . 
And the longer the monk lives in his seclusion , the more keenly he must recognise that . 
Else he would have had no reason to come here . 
When he realises that he is not only worse than others , but that he is responsible to all men for all and everything , for all human sins , national and individual , only then the aim of our seclusion is attained . 
For know , dear ones , that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men - and everything on earth , not merely through the general sinfulness of creation , but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man .
