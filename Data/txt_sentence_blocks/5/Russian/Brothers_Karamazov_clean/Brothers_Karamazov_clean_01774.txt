`` Well , '' he said , `` run and play now , enjoy life for me too . '' 
I went out then and ran to play . 
And many times in my life afterwards I remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too . 
There were many other marvellous and beautiful sayings of his , though we did not understand them at the time . 
He died the third week after Easter .
