I do n't know whether he saw her , but in the evening he was at the Metropolis , where he got thoroughly drunk . 
Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself . 
It was a wordy , disconnected , frantic letter , a drunken letter , in fact . 
It was like the talk of a drunken man , who , on his return home , begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted , what a rascal had just insulted him , what a fine fellow he is on the other hand , and how he will pay that scoundrel out ; and all that at great length , with great excitement and incoherence , with drunken tears and blows on the table . 
The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind .
