Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna 's beauty when , three weeks before , Dmitri had first brought him , at Katerina Ivanovna 's special request , to be introduced to her . 
There had been no conversation between them at that interview , however . 
Supposing Alyosha to be very shy , Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him . 
Alyosha had been silent , but he had seen a great deal very clearly . 
He was struck by the imperiousness , proud ease , and self-confidence of the haughty girl .
