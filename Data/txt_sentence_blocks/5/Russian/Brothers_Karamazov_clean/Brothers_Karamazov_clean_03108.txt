Forgive me , gentlemen , I 'm making such an outcry because I 've had that thought in my mind so lately , only the day before yesterday , that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy , and afterwards yesterday , all day yesterday , I remember , till that happened ... '' `` Till what happened ? '' 
put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively , but Mitya did not hear it . 
`` I have made you an awful confession , '' Mitya said gloomily in conclusion . 
`` You must appreciate it , and what 's more , you must respect it , for if not , if that leaves your souls untouched , then you 've simply no respect for me , gentlemen , I tell you that , and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you ! 
Oh , I shall shoot myself !
