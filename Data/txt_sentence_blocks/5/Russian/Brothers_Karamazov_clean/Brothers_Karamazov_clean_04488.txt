He did not play billiards , he sat in a corner , talked to no one . 
He did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat , but that was done almost unconsciously , because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance . 
It is true that after he had taken the final decision , he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand , and that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards . 
But there was nothing for it ; he could not take his words back , but his luck had served him before , it would serve him again . 
He believed in his star , you know !
