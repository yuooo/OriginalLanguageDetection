They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps , that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard . 
My mother hesitated for a long time , it was awful to part with her only child , but she made up her mind to it at last , though not without many tears , believing she was acting for my happiness . 
She brought me to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps , and I never saw her again . 
For she too died three years afterwards . 
She spent those three years mourning and grieving for both of us .
