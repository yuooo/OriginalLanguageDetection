Rakitin , of course , was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner , to which Father Iosif , Father Paissy , and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited . 
They were already waiting when Miusov , Kalganov , and Ivan arrived . 
The other guest , Maximov , stood a little aside , waiting also . 
The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests . 
He was a tall , thin , but still vigorous old man , with black hair streaked with grey , and a long , grave , ascetic face .
