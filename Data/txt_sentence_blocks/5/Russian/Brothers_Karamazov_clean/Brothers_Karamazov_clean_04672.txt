We are not long on earth , we do many evil deeds and say many evil words . 
So let us all catch a favourable moment when we are all together to say a good word to each other . 
That 's what I am doing : while I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity . 
Not for nothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority - all Russia hears us ! 
I am not speaking only for the fathers here present , I cry aloud to all fathers : ` Fathers , provoke not your children to wrath . '
