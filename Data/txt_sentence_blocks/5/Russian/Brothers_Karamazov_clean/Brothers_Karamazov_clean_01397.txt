Can a Russian peasant be said to feel , in comparison with an educated man ? 
He ca n't be said to have feeling at all , in his ignorance . 
From my childhood up when I hear ' a wee bit , ' I am ready to burst with rage . 
I hate all Russia , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` If you 'd been a cadet in the army , or a young hussar , you would n't have talked like that , but would have drawn your sabre to defend all Russia . ''
