An absurd chaotic confusion followed , but Mitya was in his natural element , and the more foolish it became , the more his spirits rose . 
If the peasants had asked him for money at that moment , he would have pulled out his notes and given them away right and left . 
This was probably why the landlord , Trifon Borissovitch , kept hovering about Mitya to protect him . 
He seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night ; but he drank little , only one glass of punch , and kept a sharp look-out on Mitya 's interests after his own fashion . 
He intervened in the nick of time , civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away `` cigars and Rhine wine , '' and , above all , money to the peasants as he had done before .
