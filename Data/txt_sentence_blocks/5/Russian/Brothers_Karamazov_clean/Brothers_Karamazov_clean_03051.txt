... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night !
