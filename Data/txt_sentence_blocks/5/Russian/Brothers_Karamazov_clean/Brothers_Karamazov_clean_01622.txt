`` Why , it 's all nonsense , Alyosha . 
It 's only a senseless poem of a senseless student , who could never write two lines of verse . 
Why do you take it so seriously ? 
Surely you do n't suppose I am going straight off to the Jesuits , to join the men who are correcting His work ? 
Good Lord , it 's no business of mine .
