`` At that point one of the lawyers asked him , as it were incidentally , the most simple question , ` Was n't it Smerdyakov killed him ? ' 
Then , as we expected , he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught him unawares , before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov 's name . 
He rushed at once to the other extreme , as he always does , and began to assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him , was not capable of it . 
But do n't believe him , that was only his cunning ; he did n't really give up the idea of Smerdyakov ; on the contrary , he meant to bring him forward again ; for , indeed , he had no one else to bring forward , but he would do that later , because for the moment that line was spoiled for him . 
He would bring him forward perhaps next day , or even a few days later , choosing an opportunity to cry out to us , ` You know I was more sceptical about Smerdyakov than you , you remember that yourselves , but now I am convinced .
