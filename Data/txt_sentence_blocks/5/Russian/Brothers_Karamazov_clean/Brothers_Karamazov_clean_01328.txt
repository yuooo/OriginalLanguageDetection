I do n't know how to put it , but I have often seen it myself . 
And I feel like that myself , too . 
And the worst of it was that though he did not know , to the very last minute , that he would trample on the notes , he had a kind of presentiment of it , I am sure of that . 
That 's just what made him so ecstatic , that he had that presentiment ... . 
And though it 's so dreadful , it 's all for the best .
