All her right side aches at night , she is in agony , and , would you believe it , the angel bears it without groaning for fear of waking us . 
We eat what we can get , and she 'll only take the leavings , what you 'd scarcely give to a dog . ' 
I am not worth it , I am taking it from you , I am a burden on you , ' that 's what her angel eyes try to express . 
We wait on her , but she does n't like it . ' 
I am a useless cripple , no good to anyone . '
