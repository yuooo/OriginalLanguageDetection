`` If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow , '' he reflected with satisfaction , `` I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after the peasant , but should have passed by , without caring about his being frozen . 
I am quite capable of watching myself , by the way , '' he thought at the same instant , with still greater satisfaction , `` although they have decided that I am going out of my mind ! '' 
Just as he reached his own house he stopped short , asking himself suddenly had n't he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything . 
He decided the question by turning back to the house . 
`` Everything together to-morrow ! ''
