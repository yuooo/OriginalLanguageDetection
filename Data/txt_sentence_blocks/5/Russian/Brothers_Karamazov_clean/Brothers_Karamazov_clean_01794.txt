The people is lost without the Word of God , for its soul is athirst for the Word and for all that is good . 
In my youth , long ago , nearly forty years ago , I travelled all over Russia with Father Anfim , collecting funds for our monastery , and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen . 
A good looking peasant lad , about eighteen , joined us ; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant 's barge along the bank . 
I noticed him looking straight before him with clear and tender eyes . 
It was a bright , warm , still , July night , a cool mist rose from the broad river , we could hear the plash of a fish , the birds were still , all was hushed and beautiful , everything praying to God .
