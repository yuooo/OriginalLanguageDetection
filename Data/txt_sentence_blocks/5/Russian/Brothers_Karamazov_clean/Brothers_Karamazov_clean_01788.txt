For he may be short of time , he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while with work and services , but still it 's not all the time , even he has an hour a week to remember God . 
And he does not work the whole year round . 
Let him gather round him once a week , some hour in the evening , if only the children at first - the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin to come . 
There 's no need to build halls for this , let him take them into his own cottage . 
They wo n't spoil his cottage , they would only be there one hour .
