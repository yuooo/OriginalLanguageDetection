His remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the audience . 
All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor ; they knew , too , that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary conduct , he looked upon women as lofty creatures . 
And so his unexpected observation struck everyone as very queer . 
The Moscow doctor , being questioned in his turn , definitely and emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner 's mental condition abnormal in the highest degree . 
He talked at length and with erudition of `` aberration '' and `` mania , '' and argued that , from all the facts collected , the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several days before his arrest , and , if the crime had been committed by him , it must , even if he were conscious of it , have been almost involuntary , as he had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him .
