Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment ? 
Dmitri is not a stranger to him . 
Because they are all against me , while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me , and not a little , but some thousands of which I have documentary proof . 
The whole town is echoing with his debaucheries . 
And where he was stationed before , he several times spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some respectable girl ; we know all about that , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , in its most secret details .
