By the way , Pyotr Ilyitch , I wanted to ask you : have you ever stolen anything in your life ? '' 
`` What a question ! '' 
`` Oh , I did n't mean anything . 
From somebody 's pocket , you know . 
I do n't mean government money , everyone steals that , and no doubt you do , too ... '' `` You go to the devil . ''
