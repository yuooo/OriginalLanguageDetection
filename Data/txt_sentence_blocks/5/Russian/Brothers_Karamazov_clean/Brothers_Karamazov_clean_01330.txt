But now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant , though he knows he has ` ruined himself . ' 
So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by to-morrow , for he has already vindicated his honour , tossed away the money , and trampled it under foot ... . 
He could n't know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow , and yet he is in terrible need of that money . 
Though he is proud of himself now , yet even to-day he 'll be thinking what a help he has lost . 
He will think of it more than ever at night , will dream of it , and by to-morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness .
