Othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness - not incapable of forgiving it , but of making up his mind to it - though his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe 's . 
It is not so with the really jealous man . 
It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook , and what they can forgive ! 
The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive , and all women know it . 
The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly -LRB- though , of course , after a violent scene -RRB- , and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved , the very kisses and embraces he has seen , if only he can somehow be convinced that it has all been `` for the last time , '' and that his rival will vanish from that day forward , will depart to the ends of the earth , or that he himself will carry her away somewhere , where that dreaded rival will not get near her .
