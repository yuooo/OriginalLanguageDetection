But , if we are to believe the prisoner 's statement that he is not the murderer , then Smerdyakov must have been , for there is no other alternative , no one else can be found . 
That is what accounts for the artful , astounding accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday . 
Had a shadow of suspicion rested on anyone else , had there been any sixth person , I am persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov , and would have accused that sixth person , for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd . 
`` Gentlemen , let us lay aside psychology , let us lay aside medicine , let us even lay aside logic , let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts tell us . 
If Smerdyakov killed him , how did he do it ?
