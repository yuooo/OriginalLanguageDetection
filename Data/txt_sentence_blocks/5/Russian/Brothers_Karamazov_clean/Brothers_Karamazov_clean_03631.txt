Well , that poor young man , your friend , Rakitin -LRB- Mercy on us ! 
I ca n't be angry with him . 
I feel cross , but not very -RRB- , that frivolous young man , would you believe it , seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me . 
I only noticed it later . 
At first - a month ago - he only began to come oftener to see me , almost every day ; though , of course , we were acquainted before .
