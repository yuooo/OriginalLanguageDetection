I went away , and two days after I happened to be passing , and he shouted to me of himself , ` Uncle , Gott der Vater , Gott der Sohn , ' and he had only forgotten ` Gott der heilige Geist . ' 
But I reminded him of it and I felt very sorry for him again . 
But he was taken away , and I did not see him again . 
Twenty-three years passed . 
I am sitting one morning in my study , a white-haired old man , when there walks into the room a blooming young man , whom I should never have recognised , but he held up his finger and said , laughing , ` Gott der Vater , Gott der Sohn , and Gott der heilige Geist .
