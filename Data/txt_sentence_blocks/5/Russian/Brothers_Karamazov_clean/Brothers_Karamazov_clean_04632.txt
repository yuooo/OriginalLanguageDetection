`` With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful state of the prisoner 's mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him calling him to new life , while love was impossible for him because he had his father 's bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that corpse - retribution . 
And yet the prosecutor allowed him love , which he explained , according to his method , talking about this drunken condition , about a criminal being taken to execution , about it being still far off , and so on and so on . 
But again I ask , Mr. Prosecutor , have you not invented a new personality ? 
Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape punishment , if his hands were really stained with his father 's blood ? 
No , no , no !
