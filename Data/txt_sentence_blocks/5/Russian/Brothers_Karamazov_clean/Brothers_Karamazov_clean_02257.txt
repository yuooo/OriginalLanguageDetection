He was a lean , middle-aged peasant , with a very long face , flaxen curls , and a long , thin , reddish beard , wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat , from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch . 
Mitya looked at his face with intense hatred , and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly irritated him . 
What was insufferably humiliating was that , after leaving things of such importance and making such sacrifices , he , Mitya , utterly worn out , should with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole fate depended , while he snored as though there were nothing the matter , as though he 'd dropped from another planet . 
`` Oh , the irony of fate ! '' 
cried Mitya , and , quite losing his head , he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant .
