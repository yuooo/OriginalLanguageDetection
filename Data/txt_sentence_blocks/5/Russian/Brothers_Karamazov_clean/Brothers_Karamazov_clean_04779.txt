And you know that I would not tell you a lie . 
Listen : you are not ready , and such a cross is not for you . 
What 's more , you do n't need such a martyr 's cross when you are not ready for it . 
If you had murdered our father , it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment . 
But you are innocent , and such a cross is too much for you .
