`` Oh , I have been urgently begging for it , I have prayed for it ! 
I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until you let me in . 
We have come , great healer , to express our ardent gratitude . 
You have healed my Lise , healed her completely , merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her . 
We have hastened here to kiss those hands , to pour out our feelings and our homage . ''
