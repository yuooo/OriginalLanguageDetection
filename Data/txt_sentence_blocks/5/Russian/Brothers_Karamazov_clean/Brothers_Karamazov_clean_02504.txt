There was one moment when he felt an impulse to stop Andrey , to jump out of the cart , to pull out his loaded pistol , and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn . 
But that moment flew by like a spark . 
The horses galloped on , `` devouring space , '' and as he drew near his goal , again the thought of her , of her alone , took more and more complete possession of his soul , chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it . 
Oh , how he longed to look upon her , if only for a moment , if only from a distance ! 
`` She 's now with him , '' he thought , `` now I shall see what she looks like with him , her first love , and that 's all I want . ''
