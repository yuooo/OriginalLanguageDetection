Dost Thou not believe that it 's over for good ? 
Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me . 
But let me tell Thee that now , to-day , people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom , yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet . 
But that has been our doing . 
Was this what Thou didst ?
