Three days later , on the evening you came , he brought me a sealed envelope , which I was to open at once , if anything happened to him . 
Oh , he foresaw his illness ! 
He told me that the envelope contained the details of the escape , and that if he died or was taken dangerously ill , I was to save Mitya alone . 
Then he left me money , nearly ten thousand - those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his speech , having learnt from someone that he had sent them to be changed . 
I was tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up his idea of saving his brother , and was confiding this plan of escape to me , though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved Mitya .
