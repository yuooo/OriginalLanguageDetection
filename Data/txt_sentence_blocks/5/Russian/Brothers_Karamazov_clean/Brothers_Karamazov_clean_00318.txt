DMITRI FYODOROVITCH , a young man of eight and twenty , of medium height and agreeable countenance , looked older than his years . 
He was muscular , and showed signs of considerable physical strength . 
Yet there was something not healthy in his face . 
It was rather thin , his cheeks were hollow , and there was an unhealthy sallowness in their colour . 
His rather large , prominent , dark eyes had an expression of firm determination , and yet there was a vague look in them , too .
