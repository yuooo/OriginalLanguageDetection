inquired the prosecutor , and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence . 
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew , too , where that money had come from , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` And did you never , once , hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand , but less , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use ? '' 
`` No , I never heard that , '' answered Grushenka .
