If anyone is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up , annoyed at being waked , but instantly falls asleep again . 
Two hours later , again a groan , he wakes up and falls asleep again ; and the same thing again two hours later - three times altogether in the night . 
Next morning the sleeper wakes up and complains that someone has been groaning all night and keeping him awake . 
And it is bound to seem so to him : the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember , he only remembers the moments of waking , so he feels he has been waked up all night . 
`` But why , why , asks the prosecutor , did not Smerdyakov confess in his last letter ?
