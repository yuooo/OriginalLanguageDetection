I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me , and I began to notice things with surprise . 
You know , two months ago , that modest , charming , excellent young man , Ilyitch Perhotin , who 's in the service here , began to be a regular visitor at the house . 
You met him here ever so many times yourself . 
And he is an excellent , earnest young man , is n't he ? 
He comes once every three days , not every day -LRB- though I should be glad to see him every day -RRB- , and always so well dressed .
