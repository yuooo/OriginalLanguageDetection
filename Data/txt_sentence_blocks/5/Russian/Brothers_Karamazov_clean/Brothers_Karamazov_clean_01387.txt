There was a circle on the table , left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before . 
Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind , as they always do in a time of tedious waiting . 
He wondered , for instance , why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before , why not in the other seat . 
At last he felt very depressed - depressed by suspense and uncertainty . 
But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour , when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close .
