It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through . 
I stood as if I were struck dumb , while the sun was shining , the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the praise of God ... . 
I hid my face in my hands , fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears . 
And then I remembered by brother Markel and what he said on his death-bed to his servants : `` My dear ones , why do you wait on me , why do you love me , am I worth your waiting on me ? '' 
`` Yes , am I worth it ? ''
