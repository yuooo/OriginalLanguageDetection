`` You may laugh , '' I said to him , laughing too , `` but afterwards you will approve of me . '' 
`` Oh , I am ready to approve of you now , '' said he ; `` will you shake hands ? 
for I believe you are genuinely sincere . '' 
`` No , '' I said , `` not now , later on when I have grown worthier and deserve your esteem , then shake hands and you will do well . '' 
We went home , my second upbraiding me all the way , while I kissed him .
