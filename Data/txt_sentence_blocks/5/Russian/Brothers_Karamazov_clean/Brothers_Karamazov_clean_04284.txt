Grigory 's description of the scene at the dinner-table , when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his father , threatening to come back to kill him , made a sinister impression on the court , especially as the old servant 's composure in telling it , his parsimony of words , and peculiar phraseology were as effective as eloquence . 
He observed that he was not angry with Mitya for having knocked him down and struck him on the face ; he had forgiven him long ago , he said . 
Of the deceased Smerdyakov he observed , crossing himself , that he was a lad of ability , but stupid and afflicted , and , worse still , an infidel , and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch and his elder son who had taught him to be so . 
But he defended Smerdyakov 's honesty almost with warmth , and related how Smerdyakov had once found the master 's money in the yard , and , instead of concealing it , had taken it to his master , who had rewarded him with a `` gold piece '' for it , and trusted him implicitly from that time forward . 
He maintained obstinately that the door into the garden had been open .
