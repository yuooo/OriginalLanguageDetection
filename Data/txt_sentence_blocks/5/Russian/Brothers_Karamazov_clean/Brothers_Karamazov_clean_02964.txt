Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov . 
He told them exactly what every tap on the window meant , tapped the signals on the table , and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he supposed he , Mitya , had tapped the signal `` Grushenka has come , '' when he tapped to his father , he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal , that `` Grushenka had come . '' 
`` So now you can build up your tower , '' Mitya broke off , and again turned away from them contemptuously . 
`` So no one knew of the signals but your dead father , you , and the valet Smerdyakov ? 
And no one else ? ''
