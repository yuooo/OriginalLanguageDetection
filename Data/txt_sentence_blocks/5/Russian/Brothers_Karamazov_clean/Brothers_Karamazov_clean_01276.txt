` Father , ' he asked , ` are the rich people stronger than anyone else on earth ? ' 
` Yes , Ilusha , ' I said , ` there are no people on earth stronger than the rich . ' 
` Father , ' he said , ' I will get rich , I will become an officer and conquer everybody . 
The Tsar will reward me , I will come back here and then no one will dare - ' Then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling . 
` Father , ' he said , ` what a horrid town this is . '
