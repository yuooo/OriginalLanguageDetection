`` Listen , you miserable , contemptible creature ! 
Do n't you understand that if I have n't killed you , it 's simply because I am keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial . 
God sees , '' Ivan raised his hand , `` perhaps I , too , was guilty ; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father 's ... death , but I swear I was not as guilty as you think , and perhaps I did n't urge you on at all . 
No , no , I did n't urge you on ! 
But no matter , I will give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial .
