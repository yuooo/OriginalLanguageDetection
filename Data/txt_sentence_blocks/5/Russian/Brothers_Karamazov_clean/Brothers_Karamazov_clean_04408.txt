Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics . 
She sobbed , shrieking loudly , but refused to leave the court , struggled , and besought them not to remove her . 
Suddenly she cried to the President : `` There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once ! 
Here is a document , a letter ... take it , read it quickly , quickly ! 
It 's a letter from that monster ... that man there , there ! ''
