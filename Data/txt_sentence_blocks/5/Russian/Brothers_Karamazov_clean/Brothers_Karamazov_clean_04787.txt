She is Russian , Russian to the marrow of her bones ; she will be homesick for the mother country , and I shall see every hour that she is suffering for my sake , that she has taken up that cross for me . 
And what harm has she done ? 
And how shall I , too , put up with the rabble out there , though they may be better than I , every one of them ? 
I hate that America already ! 
And though they may be wonderful at machinery , every one of them , damn them , they are not of my soul .
