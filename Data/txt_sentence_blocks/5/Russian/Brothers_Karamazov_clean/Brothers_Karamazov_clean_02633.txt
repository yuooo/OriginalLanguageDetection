`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . '
