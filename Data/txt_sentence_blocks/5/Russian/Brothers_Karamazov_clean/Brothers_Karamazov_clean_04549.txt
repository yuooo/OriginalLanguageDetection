`` Gentlemen of the jury , there are moments in the execution of our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man , terrible on his account , too ! 
The moments of contemplating that animal fear , when the criminal sees that all is lost , but still struggles , still means to struggle , the moments when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes , studies you , your face , your thoughts , uncertain on which side you will strike , and his distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant , but he is still afraid to speak , afraid of giving himself away ! 
This purgatory of the spirit , this animal thirst for self-preservation , these humiliating moments of the human soul , are awful , and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even in the lawyer . 
And this was what we all witnessed then . 
`` At first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very compromising phrases .
