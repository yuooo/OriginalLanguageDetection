Without criticism it would be nothing but one ` hosannah . ' 
But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life , the hosannah must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on , in the same style . 
But I do n't meddle in that , I did n't create it , I am not answerable for it . 
Well , they 've chosen their scapegoat , they 've made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible . 
We understand that comedy ; I , for instance , simply ask for annihilation .
