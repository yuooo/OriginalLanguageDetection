For anyone to love a man , he must be hidden , for as soon as he shows his face , love is gone . '' 
`` Father Zossima has talked of that more than once , '' observed Alyosha ; `` he , too , said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practised in love , from loving him . 
But yet there 's a great deal of love in mankind , and almost Christ-like love . 
I know that myself , Ivan . ''
