And , if it had not been for the same servant Grigory , who by that time had aged considerably too , and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor , Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes . 
Alyosha 's arrival seemed to affect even his moral side , as though something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul . 
`` Do you know , '' he used often to say , looking at Alyosha , `` that you are like her , ` the crazy woman ' '' - that was what he used to call his dead wife , Alyosha 's mother . 
Grigory it was who pointed out the `` crazy woman 's '' grave to Alyosha . 
He took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone , cheap but decently kept , on which were inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death , and below a four-lined verse , such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class tombs .
