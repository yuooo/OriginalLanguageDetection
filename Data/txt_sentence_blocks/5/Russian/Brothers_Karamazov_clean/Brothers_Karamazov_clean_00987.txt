Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he said to them . 
But though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady , his speech was somewhat disconnected . 
He spoke of many things , he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life , and not simply for the sake of instructing them , but as though thirsting to share with all men and all creation his joy and ecstasy , and once more in his life to open his whole heart . 
`` Love one another , Fathers , '' said Father Zossima , as far as Alyosha could remember afterwards . 
`` Love God 's people .
