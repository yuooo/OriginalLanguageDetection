Allow me to introduce my family , my two daughters and my son - my litter . 
If I die , who will care for them , and while I live who but they will care for a wretch like me ? 
That 's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort , sir . 
For there must be someone able to love even a man like me . '' 
`` Ah , that 's perfectly true ! ''
