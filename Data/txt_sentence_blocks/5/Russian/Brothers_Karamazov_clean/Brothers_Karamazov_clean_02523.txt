`` Drive on , Andrey , I come ! '' 
Mitya exclaimed , feverishly . 
`` They 're not asleep , '' said Andrey again , pointing with his whip to the Plastunovs ' inn , which was at the entrance to the village . 
The six windows , looking on the street , were all brightly lighted up . 
`` They 're not asleep , '' Mitya repeated joyously .
