That 's what 's at the root of me , Alyosha ; that 's my creed . 
I am in earnest in what I say . 
I began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose , but I 've led up to my confession , for that 's all you want . 
You did n't want to hear about God , but only to know what the brother you love lives by . 
And so I 've told you . ''
