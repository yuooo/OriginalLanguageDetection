` Drive nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window , ' and , above all , let us not be afraid of words , but decide the question according to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas . 
How shall it be decided ? 
Why , like this . 
Let the son stand before his father and ask him , ` Father , tell me , why must I love you ? 
Father , show me that I must love you , ' and if that father is able to answer him and show him good reason , we have a real , normal , parental relation , not resting on mystical prejudice , but on a rational , responsible and strictly humanitarian basis .
