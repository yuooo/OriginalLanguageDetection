I took four dozen with me then , '' he added -LRB- suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch -RRB- ; `` they know all about it , do n't you trouble , Misha , '' he turned again to the boy . 
`` Stay , listen ; tell them to put in cheese , Strasburg pies , smoked fish , ham , caviare , and everything , everything they 've got , up to a hundred roubles , or a hundred and twenty as before ... . 
But wait : do n't let them forget dessert , sweets , pears , watermelons , two or three or four - no , one melon 's enough , and chocolate , candy , toffee , fondants ; in fact , everything I took to Mokroe before , three hundred roubles ' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the same again . 
And remember , Misha , if you are called Misha - His name is Misha , is n't it ? '' 
He turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again .
