And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time , for the triumph of some preconceived idea - oh no , not at all - what he saw before all was one figure - the figure of his beloved elder , the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration . 
The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for everyone and everything had , for the past year , been concentrated - and perhaps wrongly so - on one being , his beloved elder . 
It is true that being had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal , that all his young strength and energy could not but turn towards that ideal , even to the forgetting at the moment `` of everyone and everything . '' 
He remembered afterwards how , on that terrible day , he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri , about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before ; he had forgotten , too , to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha 's father , though he had so warmly intended to do so the preceding evening . 
But again it was not miracles he needed but only `` the higher justice '' which had been in his belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart .
