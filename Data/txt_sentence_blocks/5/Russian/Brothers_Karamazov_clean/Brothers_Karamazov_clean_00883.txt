He had n't sent the money , but I said nothing . 
Last week I learnt that he was still in need of money . 
My only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn , and who was his true friend . 
No , he wo n't recognise that I am his truest friend ; he wo n't know me , and looks on me merely as a woman . 
I 've been tormented all the week , trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand .
