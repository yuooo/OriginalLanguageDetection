`` Mother , do n't weep , darling , '' he would say , `` I 've long to live yet , long to rejoice with you , and life is glad and joyful . '' 
`` Ah , dear boy , how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night , coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces . '' 
`` Do n't cry , mother , '' he would answer , `` life is paradise , and we are all in paradise , but we wo n't see it ; if we would , we should have heaven on earth the next day . '' 
Everyone wondered at his words , he spoke so strangely and positively ; we were all touched and wept . 
Friends came to see us .
