People used to tell , laughing at Mitya , how he had given champagne to grimy-handed peasants , and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies . 
Though to laugh at Mitya to his face was rather a risky proceeding , there was much laughter behind his back , especially in the tavern , at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of Grushenka by this `` escapade '' was `` permission to kiss her foot , and that was the utmost she had allowed him . '' 
By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop , they found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells , and with Andrey , the driver , ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance . 
In the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions , and were only waiting for Mitya 's arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded .
