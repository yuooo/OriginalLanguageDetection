Then there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street the dread place of execution ! 
I fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man , sitting on his shameful cart , must feel that he has infinite life still before him . 
The houses recede , the cart moves on - oh , that 's nothing , it 's still far to the turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes fixed on him , and he still fancies that he is just such a man as they . 
But now the turning comes to the next street . 
Oh , that 's nothing , nothing , there 's still a whole street before him , and however many houses have been passed , he will still think there are many left .
