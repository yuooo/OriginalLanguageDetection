The forester still treated the matter contemptuously , and when he opened the window said grumpily : `` It 'll be all right , now . '' 
He went back to sleep , leaving Mitya a lighted lantern . 
Mitya fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour , wetting his head , and gravely resolved not to sleep all night . 
But he was so worn out that when he sat down for a moment to take breath , he closed his eyes , unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead .
