Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky , the doctor he met in the hospital , confidently asserted in reply to Ivan 's persistent questions , that Smerdyakov 's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine , and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe . 
They gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one , the fits persisting and recurring several times , so that the patient 's life was positively in danger , and it was only now , after they had applied remedies , that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive . 
`` Though it might well be , '' added Doctor Herzenstube , `` that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period , if not permanently . '' 
On Ivan 's asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad , they told him that this was not yet the case , in the full sense of the word , but that certain abnormalities were perceptible .
