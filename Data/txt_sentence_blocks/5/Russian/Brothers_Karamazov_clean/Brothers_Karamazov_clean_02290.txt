He had a brace of fine duelling pistols in a case , which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions . 
In the Metropolis tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons . 
He used to buy pistols , revolvers , daggers , hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances .

Mitya , without stopping to think , went straight to him , and offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten roubles .
