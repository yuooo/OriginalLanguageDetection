Here is my question : Is it true , great Father , that the story is told somewhere in the Lives of the Saints of a holy saint martyred for his faith who , when his head was cut off at last , stood up , picked up his head , and , ` courteously kissing it , ' walked a long way , carrying it in his hands . 
Is that true or not , honoured Father ? '' 
`` No , it is untrue , '' said the elder . 
`` There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints . 
What saint do you say the story is told of ? ''
