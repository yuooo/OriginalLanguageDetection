To Alyosha 's amazement this tomb turned out to be Grigory 's doing . 
He had put it up on the poor `` crazy woman 's '' grave at his own expense , after Fyodor Pavlovitch , whom he had often pestered about the grave , had gone to Odessa , abandoning the grave and all his memories . 
Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother 's grave . 
He only listened to Grigory 's minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb ; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word . 
It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again .
