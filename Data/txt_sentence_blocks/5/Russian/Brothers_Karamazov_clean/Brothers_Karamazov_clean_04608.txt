Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho , gentlemen ? 
Is n't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic ? 
And observe , if that supposition breaks down , the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds , for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles ? 
By what miracle could they have disappeared , since it 's proved the prisoner went nowhere else ? 
And we are ready to ruin a man 's life with such tales !
