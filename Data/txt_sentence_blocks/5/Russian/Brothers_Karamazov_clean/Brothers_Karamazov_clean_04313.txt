When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him , he scarcely tried to refute his evidence , but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal at Mokroe , a month before the arrest , when Timofey and another peasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles dropped by Mitya when he was drunk , and had given them to Trifon Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so . 
`` Well , '' asked the lawyer , '' did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr. Karamazov ? '' 
Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain ... . 
He was obliged , after the peasants had been examined , to admit the finding of the hundred roubles , only adding that he had religiously returned it all to Dmitri Fyodorovitch `` in perfect honesty , and it 's only because his honour was in liquor at the time , he would n't remember it . '' 
But , as he had denied the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove it , his evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded with great suspicion .
