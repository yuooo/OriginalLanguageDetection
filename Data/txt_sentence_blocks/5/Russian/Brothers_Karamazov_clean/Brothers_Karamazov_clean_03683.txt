It bores me . 
If I am ever poor , I shall murder somebody , and even if I am rich , I may murder someone , perhaps - why do nothing ! 
But do you know , I should like to reap , cut the rye ? 
I 'll marry you , and you shall become a peasant , a real peasant ; we 'll keep a colt , shall we ? 
Do you know Kalganov ? ''
