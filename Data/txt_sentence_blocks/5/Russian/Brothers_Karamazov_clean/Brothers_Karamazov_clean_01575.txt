`` Judge Thyself who was right - Thou or he who questioned Thee then ? 
Remember the first question ; its meaning , in other words , was this : `` Thou wouldst go into the world , and art going with empty hands , with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness can not even understand , which they fear and dread - for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom . 
But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness ? 
Turn them into bread , and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep , grateful and obedient , though for ever trembling , lest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread . '' 
But Thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer , thinking , what is that freedom worth if obedience is bought with bread ?
