It is written : `` Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me , if thou wouldst be perfect . '' 
Alyosha said to himself : `` I ca n't give two roubles instead of ` all , ' and only go to mass instead of ` following Him . ' '' 
Perhaps his memories of childhood brought back our monastery , to which his mother may have taken him to mass . 
Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his poor `` crazy '' mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination . 
Brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice all or only `` two roubles , '' and in the monastery he met this elder .
