It is like a mould cast of the world and man and human nature , everything is there , and a law for everything for all the ages . 
And what mysteries are solved and revealed ! 
God raises Job again , gives him wealth again . 
Many years pass by , and he has other children and loves them . 
But how could he love those new ones when those first children are no more , when he has lost them ?
