-LRB- c -RRB- Recollections of Father Zossima 's Youth before he became a Monk . 
The Duel I SPENT a long time , almost eight years , in the military cadet school at Petersburg , and in the novelty of my surroundings there , many of my childish impressions grew dimmer , though I forgot nothing . 
I picked up so many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel , absurd , almost savage creature . 
A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I did acquire together with the French language . 
But we all , myself included , looked upon the soldiers in our service as cattle .
