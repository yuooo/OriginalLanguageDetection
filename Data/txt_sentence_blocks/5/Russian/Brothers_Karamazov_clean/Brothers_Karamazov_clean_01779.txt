I have it lying on my shelf now ; I keep it as a precious relic of the past . 
But even before I learned to read , I remember first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old . 
My mother took me alone to mass -LRB- I do n't remember where my brother was at the time -RRB- on the Monday before Easter . 
It was a fine day , and I remember to-day , as though I saw it now , how the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and , overhead in the cupola , mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the little window . 
I was stirred by the sight , and for the first time in my life I consciously received the seed of God 's word in my heart .
