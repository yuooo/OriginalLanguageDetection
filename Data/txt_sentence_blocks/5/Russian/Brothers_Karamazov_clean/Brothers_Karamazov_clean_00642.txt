As for Ivan , I can understand how he must be cursing nature now with his intellect , too ! 
To see the preference given - to whom , to what ? 
To a monster who , though he is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him , ca n't restrain his debaucheries - and before the very eyes of his betrothed ! 
And a man like me is preferred , while he is rejected . 
And why ?
