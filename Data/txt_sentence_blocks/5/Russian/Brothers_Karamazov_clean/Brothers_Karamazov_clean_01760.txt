We had four servants , all serfs . 
I remember my mother selling one of the four , the cook Afimya , who was lame and elderly , for sixty paper roubles , and hiring a free servant to take her place . 
In the sixth week in Lent , my brother , who was never strong and had a tendency to consumption , was taken ill . 
He was tall but thin and delicate-looking , and of very pleasing countenance . 
I suppose he caught cold , anyway the doctor , who came , soon whispered to my mother that it was galloping consumption , that he would not live through the spring .
