Of course , bribing is dishonest even in such a case , but I ca n't undertake to judge about it , because if Ivan and Katya commissioned me to act for you , I know I should go and give bribes . 
I must tell you the truth . 
And so I ca n't judge of your own action . 
But let me assure you that I shall never condemn you . 
And it would be a strange thing if I could judge you in this .
