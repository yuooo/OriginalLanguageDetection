But we shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love . 
For it is not we , but they , who are in isolation , though they do n't see that . 
Of old , leaders of the people came from among us , and why should they not again ? 
The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great cause . 
The salvation of Russia comes from the people .
