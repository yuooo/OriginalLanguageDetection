I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself . 
His conception of culture was limited to good clothes , clean shirt-fronts and polished boots . 
Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch -LRB- there is evidence of this -RRB- , he might well have resented his position , compared with that of his master 's legitimate sons . 
They had everything , he nothing . 
They had all the rights , they had the inheritance , while he was only the cook .
