`` His , his , and he is very keen on it . 
He did n't come to see me at first , then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away . 
He is awfully keen on it . 
He does n't ask me , but orders me to escape . 
He does n't doubt of my obeying him , though I showed him all my heart as I have to you , and told him about the hymn , too .
