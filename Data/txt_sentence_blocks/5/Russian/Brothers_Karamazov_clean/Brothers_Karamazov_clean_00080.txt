The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction , but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement . 
As soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and immortality , and at once he instinctively said to himself : `` I want to live for immortality , and I will accept no compromise . '' 
In the same way , if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist , he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist . 
For socialism is not merely the labour question , it is before all things the atheistic question , the question of the form taken by atheism to-day , the question of the tower of Babel built without God , not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth . 
Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before .
