I wanted to so much , that I bribed Rakitin to bring you . 
And why did I want to do such a thing ? 
You knew nothing about it , Alyosha , you turned away from me ; if you passed me , you dropped your eyes . 
And I 've looked at you a hundred times before to-day ; I began asking everyone about you . 
Your face haunted my heart .
