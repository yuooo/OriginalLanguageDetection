And as soon as we 've learnt it - good-bye to America ! 
We 'll run here to Russia as American citizens . 
Do n't be uneasy - we would not come to this little town . 
We 'd hide somewhere , a long way off , in the north or in the south . 
I shall be changed by that time , and she will , too , in America .
