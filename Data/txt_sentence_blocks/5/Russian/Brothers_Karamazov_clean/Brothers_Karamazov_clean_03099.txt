And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck , on my way from Fenya 's to Perhotin . 
I had n't been able till that moment to bring myself to it . 
And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief , a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life . 
Why ? 
Because , with that I destroyed , too , my dream of going to Katya and saying , ` I 'm a scoundrel , but not a thief !
