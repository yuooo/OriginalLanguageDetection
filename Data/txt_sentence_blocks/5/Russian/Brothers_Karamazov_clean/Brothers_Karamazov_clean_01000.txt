What made him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling , and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic , although they had no doubt that he was crazy . 
But it was just his craziness attracted them . 
Father Ferapont never went to see the elder . 
Though he lived in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations , and this too because he behaved as though he were crazy . 
He was seventy-five or more , and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for another great ascetic , Father Iona , who had lived to be a hundred and five , and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighbourhood .
