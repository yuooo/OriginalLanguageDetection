The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once , could n't leave his room for two days , and did n't hand over the government money . 
Dr. Kravchenko declared that he really was ill . 
But I knew for a fact , and had known for a long time , that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands except when the Commander made his visits of inspection . 
He used to lend it to a trustworthy person , a merchant of our town called Trifonov , an old widower , with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles . 
He used to go to the fair , do a profitable business with the money , and return the whole sum to the colonel , bringing with it a present from the fair , as well as interest on the loan .
