He was simply an early lover of humanity , and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him , so to say , as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love . 
And the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time , as he thought an extrordinary being , our celebrated elder , Zossima , to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart . 
But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that time , and had been so indeed from his cradle . 
I have mentioned already , by the way , that though he lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life her face , her caresses , `` as though she stood living before me . '' 
Such memories may persist , as everyone knows , from an even earlier age , even from two years old , but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out of darkness , like a corner torn out of a huge picture , which has all faded and disappeared except that fragment .
