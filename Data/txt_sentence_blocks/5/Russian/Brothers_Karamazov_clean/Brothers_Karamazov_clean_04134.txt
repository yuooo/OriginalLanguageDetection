I 've tried all the medical faculty : they can diagnose beautifully , they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips , but they 've no idea how to cure you . 
There was an enthusiastic little student here , ` You may die , ' said he , ` but you 'll know perfectly what disease you are dying of ! ' 
And then what a way they have of sending people to specialists ! 
` We only diagnose , ' they say , ` but go to such-and-such a specialist , he 'll cure you . ' 
The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has completely disappeared , I assure you , now there are only specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers .
