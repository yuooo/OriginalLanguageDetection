cried Madame Hohlakov , alarmed , and she flew to the other end of the drawing-room . 
Mitya spat on the ground , and strode rapidly out of the room , out of the house , into the street , into the darkness ! 
He walked like one possessed , and beating himself on the breast , on the spot where he had struck himself two days previously , before Alyosha , the last time he saw him in the dark , on the road . 
What those blows upon his breast signified , on that spot , and what he meant by it - that was , for the time , a secret which was known to no one in the world , and had not been told even to Alyosha . 
But that secret meant for him more than disgrace ; it meant ruin , suicide .
