What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature . 
There was a childlike look in her eyes , a look of childish delight .

The light in her eyes gladdened the soul - Alyosha felt that . 
There was something else in her which he could not understand , or would not have been able to define , and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him .
