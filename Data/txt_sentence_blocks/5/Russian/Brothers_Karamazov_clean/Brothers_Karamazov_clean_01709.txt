You see , you must watch his beard ; he has a nasty , thin , red beard . 
If his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross , it 's all right , he is saying what he means , he wants to do business . 
But if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins - he is trying to cheat you . 
Do n't watch his eyes , you wo n't find out anything from his eyes , he is a deep one , a rogue but watch his beard ! 
I 'll give you a note and you show it to him .
