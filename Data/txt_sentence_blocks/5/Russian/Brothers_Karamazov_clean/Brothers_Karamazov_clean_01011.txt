On Saturday white cabbage soup , noodles with peas , kasha , all with hemp oil . 
On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage soup . 
From Monday till Saturday evening , six whole days in Holy Week , nothing is cooked , and we have only bread and water , and that sparingly ; if possible not taking food every day , just the same as is ordered for first week in Lent . 
On Good Friday nothing is eaten . 
In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o'clock , and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine .
