Do you hear , do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious history ? 
It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment only , but also for the salvation of the criminal ! 
Let other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law , we will cling to the spirit and the meaning - the salvation and the reformation of the lost . 
If this is true , if Russia and her justice are such , she may go forward with good cheer ! 
Do not try to scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust .
