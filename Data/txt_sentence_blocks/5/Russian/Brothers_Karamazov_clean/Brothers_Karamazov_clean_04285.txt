At last the counsel for the defence began to cross-examine him , and the first question he asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitch was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for `` a certain person . '' 
`` Have you ever seen it , you , who were for so many years in close attendance on your master ? '' 
Grigory answered that he had not seen it and had never heard of the money from anyone `` till everybody was talking about it . '' 
This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to everyone who could conceivably have known of it , as persistently as the prosecutor asked his question about Dmitri 's inheritance , and got the same answer from all , that no one had seen the envelope , though many had heard of it .
