To have dinners visits , carriages , rank , and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as a necessity , for which life , honour and human feeling are sacrificed , and men even commit suicide if they are unable to satisfy it . 
We see the same thing among those who are not rich , while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness . 
But soon they will drink blood instead of wine , they are being led on to it . 
I ask you is such a man free ? 
I knew one `` champion of freedom '' who told me himself that , when he was deprived of tobacco in prison , he was so wretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting tobacco again !
