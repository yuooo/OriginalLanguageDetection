`` My dear friend , above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to be recognised as such , '' the visitor began in an access of deprecating and simple-hearted pride , typical of a poor relation . 
`` I am poor , but ... I wo n't say very honest , but ... it 's an axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel . 
I certainly ca n't conceive how I can ever have been an angel . 
If I ever was , it must have been so long ago that there 's no harm in forgetting it . 
Now I only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly person and live as I can , trying to make myself agreeable .
