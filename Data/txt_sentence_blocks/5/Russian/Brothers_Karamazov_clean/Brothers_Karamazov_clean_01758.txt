He was eight years older than I was , of hasty , irritable temperament , but kind-hearted and never ironical . 
He was remarkably silent , especially at home with me , his mother , and the servants . 
He did well at school , but did not get on with his school-fellows , though he never quarrelled , at least so my mother has told me . 
Six months before his death , when he was seventeen , he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking , and led a solitary existence there . 
He was a good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university .
