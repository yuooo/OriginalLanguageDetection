He 'll carry off Katerina Ivanovna , for whom he is languishing , and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand . 
That 's very alluring to start with , for a man of no consequence and a beggar . 
And , take note , he wo n't be wronging Mitya , but doing him the greatest service . 
For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week , when he was with some Gipsy girls drunk in a tavern , cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed , Katya , but that his brother Ivan , he was the man who deserved her . 
And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan .
