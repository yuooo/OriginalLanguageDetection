The camels at that time caught my imagination , and Satan , who talked like that with God , and God who gave His servant up to destruction , and His servant crying out : `` Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish me , '' and then the soft and sweet singing in the church : `` Let my prayer rise up before Thee , '' and again incense from the priest 's censer and the kneeling and the prayer . 
Ever since then - only yesterday I took it up - I 've never been able to read that sacred tale without tears . 
And how much that is great , mysterious and unfathomable there is in it ! 
Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame , proud words , `` How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil , take from him his children , smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a potsherd - and for no object except to boast to the devil ` See what My saint can suffer for My sake . ' 
`` But the greatness of it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery - that the passing earthly show and the eternal verity are brought together in it .
