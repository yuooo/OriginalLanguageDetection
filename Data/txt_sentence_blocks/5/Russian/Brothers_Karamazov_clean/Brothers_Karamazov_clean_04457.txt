Of the other two I will speak only cursorily . 
`` The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and vigorous intellect , who has lost all faith in everything . 
He has denied and rejected much already , like his father . 
We have all heard him , he was a welcome guest in local society . 
He never concealed his opinions , quite the contrary in fact , which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him now , of course , not as an individual , but as a member of the Karamazov family .
