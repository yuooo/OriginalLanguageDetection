The word had almost escaped me , had almost broken from my lips ... you know how susceptible and aesthetically impressionable I am . 
But common sense - oh , a most unhappy trait in my character - kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass ! 
For what would have happened , I reflected , what would have happened after my hosannah ? 
Everything on earth would have been extinguished at once and no events could have occurred . 
And so , solely from a sense of duty and my social position , was forced to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task .
