`` That is what has happened to me in the present case , '' he explained . 
`` From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner 's favour . 
What interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice , but rarely , I think , in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case . 
I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech , but I will do so at the very beginning , for it is my weakness to go to work directly , not keeping my effects in reserve and economising my material . 
That may be imprudent on my part , but at least it 's sincere .
