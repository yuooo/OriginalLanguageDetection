Nevertheless , we will remark cursorily , there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns . 
The poacher lives in the forest , the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea . 
The cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men . 
The mountain , the sea , the forest , make savage men ; they develop the fierce side , but often without destroying the humane side . 
Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty .
