Hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him . 
The man entered , or rather , glided into , an open glade , at a considerable distance , masked by large trees , but with which Boulatruelle was perfectly familiar , on account of having noticed , near a large pile of porous stones , an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark . 
This glade was the one which was formerly called the Blaru-bottom . 
The heap of stones , destined for no one knows what employment , which was visible there thirty years ago , is doubtless still there . 
Nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity , unless it is a board fence .
