One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity , and said to his sister , with a smile , `` There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou . '' 
When it was a question of charity , he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal , and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection . 
Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town ; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier , a wealthy and avaricious old man , who contrived to be , at one and the same time , an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian . 
This variety of man has actually existed . 
When the Bishop came to him , he touched his arm , `` You must give me something , M. le Marquis . ''
