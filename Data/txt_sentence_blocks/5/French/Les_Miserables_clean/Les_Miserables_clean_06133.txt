Javert did not recognize Jean Valjean , who , as we have stated , no longer looked like himself . 
He did not unfold his arms , he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist , by an imperceptible movement , and said in a curt , calm voice : `` Who are you ? '' 
`` I. '' `` Who is ` I ' ? '' 
`` Jean Valjean . ''
