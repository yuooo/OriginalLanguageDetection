This exists . 
It can be seen . 
It can be touched . 
These in pace , these dungeons , these iron hinges , these necklets , that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river 's current , that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb , with this difference , that the dead man here was a living being , that soil which is but mud , that vault hole , those oozing walls , -- what declaimers ! 
ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST Monasticism , such as it existed in Spain , and such as it still exists in Thibet , is a sort of phthisis for civilization .
