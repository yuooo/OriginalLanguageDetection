His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality . 
One no longer beholds the object which one has before one , and one sees , as though apart from one 's self , the figures which one has in one 's own mind . 
Thus he contemplated himself , so to speak , face to face , and at the same time , athwart this hallucination , he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch . 
On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention , he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop . 
His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it , -- the Bishop and Jean Valjean .
