It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden 's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres , in his costume of a peer of France , with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action . 
The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this : being mayor of Bordeaux , on the 12th of March , 1814 , he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angouleme . 
Hence his peerage . 
In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres . 
The French army was dressed in white , after the mode of the Austrian ; the regiments were called legions ; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments ; Napoleon was at St. Helena ; and since England refused him green cloth , he was having his old coats turned .
