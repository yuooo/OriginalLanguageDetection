It also frequently happened , that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar , and in that case , woe to the sewermen . 
When they entered without precaution into the sewer , they were liable to be lost . 
Ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner . 
They give many names ; among others , that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the man-hole of the Rue Careme-Prenant , a certain Blaise Poutrain ; this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain , who was the last grave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des Innocents , in 1785 , the epoch when that cemetery expired . 
There was also that young and charming Vicomte d'Escoubleau , of whom we have just spoken , one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida , where they delivered the assault in silk stockings , with violins at their head .
