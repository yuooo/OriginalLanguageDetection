Those beings , who were not very lavish with their countenances , were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets . 
Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed , they went off by day to sleep , sometimes in the lime-kilns , sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge , sometimes in the sewers . 
They ran to earth . 
What became of these men ? 
They still exist .
