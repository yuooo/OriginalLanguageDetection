To be Prince Equality , to bear in his own person the contradiction of the Restoration and the Revolution , to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power , therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830 ; never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event ; the one entered into the other , and the incarnation took place . 
Louis Philippe is 1830 made man . 
Moreover , he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne , exile . 
He had been proscribed , a wanderer , poor . 
He had lived by his own labor .
