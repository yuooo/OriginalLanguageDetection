As his mother had failed him , he meditated on his country . 
He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case .

He had for his specialty Greece , Poland , Hungary , Roumania , Italy .
