She has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion . 
They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them , but it is much better to give the money to the poor ; and they are very ugly besides , and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany . 
I am always very happy . 
My brother is so good . 
He gives all he has to the poor and sick .
