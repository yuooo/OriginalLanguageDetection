He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore , her knot of ribbon , her gloves , her sleeves , her shoes , her cuffs , as sacred objects of which he was the master . 
He dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair , and he even said to himself , in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light , that there was not a ribbon of her gown , not a mesh in her stockings , not a fold in her bodice , which was not his . 
Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property , his own thing , his own despot and his slave . 
It seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls , that it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again . 
-- `` This is mine . ''
