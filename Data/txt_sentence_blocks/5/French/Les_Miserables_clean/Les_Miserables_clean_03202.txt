At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride , because he needs love , he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed , and ridiculous because he was poor . 
At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride , he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots , and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness . 
Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base , from which the strong emerge sublime . 
A crucible into which destiny casts a man , whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god . 
For many great deeds are performed in petty combats .
