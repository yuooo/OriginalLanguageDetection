Is there a foreign war ? 
Is not all war between men war between brothers ? 
War is qualified only by its object . 
There is no such thing as foreign or civil war ; there is only just and unjust war . 
Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded , war , that at least which is the effort of the future , which is hastening on against the past , which is lagging in the rear , may be necessary .
