He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles ; that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope , he would arrive , in less than a quarter of an hour , at some mouth on the Seine between the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf , that is to say , he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in Paris . 
Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection of streets . 
Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet . 
Arrival of the police , a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards . 
Thus they would be seized before they had even got out .
