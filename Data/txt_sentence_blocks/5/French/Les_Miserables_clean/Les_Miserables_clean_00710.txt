Now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for us . 
Being virtuous , we obey them . 
At the hour when you read this , five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas . 
We are pulling up our stakes , as Bossuet says . 
We are going ; we are gone .
