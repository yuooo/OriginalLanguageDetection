he walked with no less indecision than Cosette . 
He protected her , and she strengthened him . 
Thanks to him , she could walk through life ; thanks to her , he could continue in virtue . 
He was that child 's stay , and she was his prop . 
Oh , unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny !
