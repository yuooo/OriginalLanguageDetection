In the space of a flash of lightning , in the rear , to right and left , shops , stables , area-doors , windows , blinds , attic skylights , shutters of every description were closed , from the ground floor to the roof . 
A terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles for drying linen , in order to deaden the effect of musketry . 
The wine-shop alone remained open ; and that for a very good reason , that the mob had rushed into it . 
-- `` Ah my God ! 
Ah my God ! ''
