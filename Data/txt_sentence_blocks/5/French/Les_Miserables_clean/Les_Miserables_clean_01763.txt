Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water . 
The large houses , the aristocracy , of which the Thenardier tavern formed a part , paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it , and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with water ; but this good man only worked until seven o'clock in the evening in summer , and five in winter ; and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed , he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it . 
This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten , -- little Cosette . 
It will be remembered that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways : they made the mother pay them , and they made the child serve them . 
So when the mother ceased to pay altogether , the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters , the Thenardiers kept Cosette .
