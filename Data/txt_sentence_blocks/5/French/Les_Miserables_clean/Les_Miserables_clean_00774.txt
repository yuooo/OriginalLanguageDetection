Injustice had made her peevish , and misery had made her ugly . 
Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes , which inspired pain , because , large as they were , it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness . 
It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child , not yet six years old , shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen , full of holes , sweeping the street before daylight , with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands , and a tear in her great eyes . 
She was called the Lark in the neighborhood . 
The populace , who are fond of these figures of speech , had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling , frightened , and shivering little creature , no bigger than a bird , who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village , and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak .
