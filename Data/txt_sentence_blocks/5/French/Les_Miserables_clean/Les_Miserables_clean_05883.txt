Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones , in that Rue de la Chanvrerie , a battle worthy of a wall of Troy . 
These haggard , ragged , exhausted men , who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours , who had not slept , who had but a few more rounds to fire , who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges , nearly all of whom were wounded , with head or arm bandaged with black and blood-stained linen , with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled , and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords , became Titans . 
The barricade was ten times attacked , approached , assailed , scaled , and never captured . 
In order to form an idea of this struggle , it is necessary to imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courages , and then to gaze at the conflagration . 
It was not a combat , it was the interior of a furnace ; there mouths breathed the flame ; there countenances were extraordinary .
