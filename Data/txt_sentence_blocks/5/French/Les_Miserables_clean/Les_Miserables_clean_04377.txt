The truth is , that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer . 
One day she suddenly thought of Marius : `` Why ! '' 
said she , `` I no longer think of him . '' 
That same week , she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers , with a wasp-like waist , a delicious uniform , the cheeks of a young girl , a sword under his arm , waxed mustaches , and a glazed schapka , passing the gate . 
Moreover , he had light hair , prominent blue eyes , a round face , was vain , insolent and good-looking ; quite the reverse of Marius .
