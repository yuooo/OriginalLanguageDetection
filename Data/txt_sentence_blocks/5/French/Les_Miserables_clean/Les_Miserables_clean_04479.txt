The Thenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon . 
One day , a short time after Magnon had handed to Eponine the note relating to the Rue Plumet , a sudden raid was made by the police in the Rue Clocheperce ; Magnon was seized , as was also Mamselle Miss ; and all the inhabitants of the house , which was of a suspicious character , were gathered into the net . 
While this was going on , the two little boys were playing in the back yard , and saw nothing of the raid . 
When they tried to enter the house again , they found the door fastened and the house empty . 
A cobbler opposite called them to him , and delivered to them a paper which `` their mother '' had left for them .
