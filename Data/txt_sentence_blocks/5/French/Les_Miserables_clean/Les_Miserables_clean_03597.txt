He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in the evening , and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully , so that he might follow him on that occasion ; but , in his contemplation , it is doubtful whether he had heard this . 
As he was on the point of mounting the staircase , he perceived , on the other side of the boulevard , near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De la Barriere-des-Gobelins , Jondrette , wrapped in the `` philanthropist 's '' great-coat , engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent , prowlers of the barriers ; people of equivocal face , of suspicious monologues , who present the air of having evil minds , and who generally sleep in the daytime , which suggests the supposition that they work by night . 
These two men , standing there motionless and in conversation , in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds , formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed , but which Marius hardly noticed . 
Still , in spite of his mournful preoccupation , he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud , alias Printanier , alias Bigrenaille , whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer . 
This man 's name the reader has learned in the preceding book .
