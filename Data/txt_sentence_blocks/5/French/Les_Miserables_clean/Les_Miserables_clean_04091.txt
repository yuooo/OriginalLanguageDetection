Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed , which was furnished with two , spread it out on the floor , and said : `` There . '' 
At seven o'clock on the following morning , Marius returned to the hovel , paid the quarter 's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon , had his books , his bed , his table , his commode , and his two chairs loaded on a hand-cart and went off without leaving his address , so that when Javert returned in the course of the morning , for the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding evening , he found only Ma'am Bougon , who answered : `` Moved away ! '' 
Ma'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before . 
`` Who would ever have said it ? '' 
she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter , `` a young man like that , who had the air of a girl ! ''
