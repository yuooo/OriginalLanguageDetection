The man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex-convict , and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse . 
Assassination caught in the very act , if ever there was such a thing . 
As for the theft , that is understood ; one does not kill a man gratis . 
This convict was on his way to fling the body into the river . 
One fact is to be noticed , that before reaching the exit grating , this convict , who had come a long distance in the sewer , must , necessarily , have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body , but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day , while at work on the quagmire , and that did not suit the assassin 's plans .
