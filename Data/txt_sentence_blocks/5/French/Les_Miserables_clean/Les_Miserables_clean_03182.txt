Enjolras , left alone with Marius , was gazing gravely at him . 
Marius , however , having rallied his ideas to some extent , did not consider himself beaten ; there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point , no doubt , of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras , when all of a sudden , they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went . 
It was Combeferre , and this is what he was singing : -- `` Si Cesar m ` avait donne -LSB- 25 -RSB- La gloire et la guerre , Et qu'il me fallait quitter L'amour de ma mere , Je dirais au grand Cesar : Reprends ton sceptre et ton char , J'aime mieux ma mere , o gue ! 
J'aime mieux ma mere ! '' 
-LSB- 25 -RSB- If Cesar had given me glory and war , and I were obliged to quit my mother 's love , I would say to great Caesar , `` Take back thy sceptre and thy chariot ; I prefer the love of my mother . ''
