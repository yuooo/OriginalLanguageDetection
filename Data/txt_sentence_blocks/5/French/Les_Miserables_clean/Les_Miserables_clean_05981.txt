Villon would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging . 
This net-work of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers , rodents , swarming in greater numbers than ever ; from time to time , an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians ; but even these vermin grow tame , so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace . 
The cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity . 
The rain , which in former days soiled the sewer , now washes it . 
Nevertheless , do not trust yourself too much to it .
