M.Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish ; he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority . 
These are the words which he uttered ; here they are literally , as they were written down , immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene , and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago : -- `` I thank you , Mr. District-Attorney , but I am not mad ; you shall see ; you were on the point of committing a great error ; release this man ! 
I am fulfilling a duty ; I am that miserable criminal . 
I am the only one here who sees the matter clearly , and I am telling you the truth . 
God , who is on high , looks down on what I am doing at this moment , and that suffices .
