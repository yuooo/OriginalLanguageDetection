Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who has no glance at all . 
The social order has its black miners . 
There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial , and where light becomes extinct . 
Below all these mines which we have just mentioned , below all these galleries , below this whole immense , subterranean , venous system of progress and utopia , much further on in the earth , much lower than Marat , lower than Babeuf , lower , much lower , and without any connection with the upper levels , there lies the last mine . 
A formidable spot .
