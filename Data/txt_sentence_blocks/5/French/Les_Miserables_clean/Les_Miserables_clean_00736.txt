She sold all that she had , which produced for her two hundred francs ; her little debts paid , she had only about eighty francs left . 
At the age of twenty-two , on a beautiful spring morning , she quitted Paris , bearing her child on her back . 
Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them . 
This woman had , in all the world , nothing but her child , and the child had , in all the world , no one but this woman . 
Fantine had nursed her child , and this had tired her chest , and she coughed a little .
