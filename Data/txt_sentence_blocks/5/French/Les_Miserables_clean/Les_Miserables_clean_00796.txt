He had gray hair , a serious eye , the sunburned complexion of a laborer , the thoughtful visage of a philosopher . 
He habitually wore a hat with a wide brim , and a long coat of coarse cloth , buttoned to the chin . 
He fulfilled his duties as mayor ; but , with that exception , he lived in solitude . 
He spoke to but few people . 
He avoided polite attentions ; he escaped quickly ; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking ; he gave , in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling , The women said of him , `` What a good-natured bear ! ''
