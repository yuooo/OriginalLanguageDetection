You understand : suppose that I were to let her go and to sacrifice myself , I should like to know what becomes of her ; I should not wish to lose sight of her ; I should like to know with whom she is living , so that I could go to see her from time to time ; so that she may know that her good foster-father is alive , that he is watching over her . 
In short , there are things which are not possible . 
I do not even know your name . 
If you were to take her away , I should say : ` Well , and the Lark , what has become of her ? ' 
One must , at least , see some petty scrap of paper , some trifle in the way of a passport , you know ! ''
