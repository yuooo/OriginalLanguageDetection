Burial is a civil matter . 
This is horrible . 
Saint Leo II . 
wrote two special letters , one to Pierre Notaire , the other to the king of the Visigoths , for the purpose of combating and rejecting , in questions touching the dead , the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor . 
Gauthier , Bishop of Chalons , held his own in this matter against Otho , Duke of Burgundy .
