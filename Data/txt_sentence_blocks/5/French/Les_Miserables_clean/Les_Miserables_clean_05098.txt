JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER The worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the Empire . 
They were talking . 
The hair-dresser had , naturally , spoken to the veteran of the riot , then of General Lamarque , and from Lamarque they had passed to the Emperor . 
Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which Prudhomme , had he been present , would have enriched with arabesques , and which he would have entitled : `` Dialogue between the razor and the sword . '' 
`` How did the Emperor ride , sir ? ''
