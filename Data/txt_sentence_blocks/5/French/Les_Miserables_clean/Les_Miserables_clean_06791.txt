He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him , as much as possible , from Cosette 's mind . 
He had , in a manner , always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean , sure that , in this way , she would not perceive nor think of the latter .

He thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen , and others which will be seen later on , for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness , but without weakness .
