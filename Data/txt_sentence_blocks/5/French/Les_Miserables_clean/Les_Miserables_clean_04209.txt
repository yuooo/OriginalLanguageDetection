A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers ; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars . 
The same promiscuousness , and yet more unprecedented , exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance . 
Elements and principles mingle , combine , wed , multiply with each other , to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness . 
The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself . 
In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities , rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia , employing everything , not losing a single dream , not a single slumber , sowing an animalcule here , crumbling to bits a planet there , oscillating and winding , making of light a force and of thought an element , disseminated and invisible , dissolving all , except that geometrical point , the I ; bringing everything back to the soul-atom ; expanding everything in God , entangling all activity , from summit to base , in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism , attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth , subordinating , who knows ?
