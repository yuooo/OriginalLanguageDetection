Les Miserables VOLUME I. FANTINE . 
PREFACE So long as there shall exist , by virtue of law and custom , decrees of damnation pronounced by society , artificially creating hells amid the civilization of earth , and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny ; so long as the three great problems of the century -- the degradation of man through pauperism , the corruption of woman through hunger , the crippling of children through lack of light -- are unsolved ; so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world ; -- in other words , and with a still wider significance , so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth , books of the nature of Les Miserables can not fail to be of use .
