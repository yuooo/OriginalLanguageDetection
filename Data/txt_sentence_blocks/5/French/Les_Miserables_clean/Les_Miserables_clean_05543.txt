Terrible , in short . 
It was the acropolis of the barefooted . 
Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope ; an immense dray was spread out there crossways , its axle pointing heavenward , and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade ; an omnibus hoisted gayly , by main force , to the very summit of the heap , as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror , presented its horseless , unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air . 
This gigantic heap , the alluvium of the revolt , figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions ; '93 on ' 89 , the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August , the 18th of Brumaire on the 11th of January , Vendemiaire on Prairial , 1848 on 1830 . 
The situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared .
