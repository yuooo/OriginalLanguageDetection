This is a child whom I have reared . 
I was already old while he was very young . 
He played in the Tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair , and in order that the inspectors might not grumble , I stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel , with my cane . 
One day he exclaimed : Down with Louis XVIII . ! 
and off he went .
