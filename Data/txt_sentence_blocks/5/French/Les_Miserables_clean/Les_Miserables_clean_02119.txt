`` Come , child , '' he said to Cosette ; and he made haste to quit the Rue Pontoise . 
He took a circuit , turned into the Passage des Patriarches , which was closed on account of the hour , strode along the Rue de l'Epee-de-Bois and the Rue de l'Arbalete , and plunged into the Rue des Postes . 
At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets , where the College Rollin stands to-day , and where the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve turns off . 
It is understood , of course , that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve is an old street , and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des Postes once in ten years . 
In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes was inhabited by potters , and its real name is Rue des Pots .
