There was a stone bench in one corner , one or two mouldy statues , several lattices which had lost their nails with time , were rotting on the wall , and there were no walks nor turf ; but there was enough grass everywhere . 
Gardening had taken its departure , and nature had returned . 
Weeds abounded , which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land . 
The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid . 
Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life ; venerable growth reigned there among them .
