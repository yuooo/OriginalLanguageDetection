One day he rose from his arm-chair , and went to his library in search of a book . 
This book was on one of the upper shelves . 
As the bishop was rather short of stature , he could not reach it . 
`` Madame Magloire , '' said he , `` fetch me a chair . 
My greatness -LSB- grandeur -RSB- does not reach as far as that shelf . ''
