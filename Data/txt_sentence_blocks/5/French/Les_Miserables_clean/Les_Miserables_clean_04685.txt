But where are the snows of years gone by ? 
is a verse of slang . 
Antam -- ante annum -- is a word of Thunes slang , which signified the past year , and by extension , formerly . 
Thirty-five years ago , at the epoch of the departure of the great chain-gang , there could be read in one of the cells at Bicetre , this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to the galleys : Les dabs d'antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du Coesre . 
This means Kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed .
