The fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns , then ended at a blind alley . 
The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible , -- a lofty white wall .

On that side the lane was open , and about two hundred paces further on , ran into a street of which it was the affluent . 
On that side lay safety .
