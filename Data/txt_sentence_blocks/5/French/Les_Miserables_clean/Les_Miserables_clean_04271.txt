Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him ; he changed his hour , he changed his bench , he forgot his handkerchief , he came alone to the Luxembourg ; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares ; and to all the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway , he ingenuously answered `` yes . '' 
But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity , so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following conclusion : `` That ninny is madly in love with Cosette , but Cosette does not even know that he exists . '' 
None the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor . 
The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment . 
Does not everything begin with indifference ?
