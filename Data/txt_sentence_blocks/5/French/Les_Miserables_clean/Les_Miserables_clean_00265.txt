Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been , if the stories anent his youth , and even in regard to his manhood , were to be believed , a passionate , and , possibly , a violent man . 
His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life , and had trickled there slowly , thought by thought ; for , in a character , as in a rock , there may exist apertures made by drops of water . 
These hollows are uneffaceable ; these formations are indestructible . 
In 1815 , as we think we have already said , he reached his seventy-fifth birthday , but he did not appear to be more than sixty . 
He was not tall ; he was rather plump ; and , in order to combat this tendency , he was fond of taking long strolls on foot ; his step was firm , and his form was but slightly bent , a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion .
