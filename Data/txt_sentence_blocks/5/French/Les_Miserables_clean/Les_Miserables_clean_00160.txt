I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family . 
You are aware that he knows everything , and that he has memories , because he is still a very good royalist . 
They really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen . 
Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux , a Jean de Faux , and a Thomas de Faux , who were gentlemen , and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort . 
The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre , and was commander of a regiment , and something in the light horse of Bretagne .
