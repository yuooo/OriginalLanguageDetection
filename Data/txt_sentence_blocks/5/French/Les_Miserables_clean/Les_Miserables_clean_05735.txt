The rest of us have mistresses , more or less , who make us crazy , that is to say , brave . 
When a man is as much in love as a tiger , the least that he can do is to fight like a lion . 
That is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us . 
Roland gets himself killed for Angelique ; all our heroism comes from our women . 
A man without a woman is a pistol without a trigger ; it is the woman that sets the man off .
