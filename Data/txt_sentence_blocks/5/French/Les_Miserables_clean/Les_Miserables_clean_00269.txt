Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe ! 
He thought of the grandeur and presence of God ; of the future eternity , that strange mystery ; of the eternity past , a mystery still more strange ; of all the infinities , which pierced their way into all his senses , beneath his eyes ; and , without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible , he gazed upon it . 
He did not study God ; he was dazzled by him . 
He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms , which communicate aspects to matter , reveal forces by verifying them , create individualities in unity , proportions in extent , the innumerable in the infinite , and , through light , produce beauty . 
These conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly ; hence life and death .
