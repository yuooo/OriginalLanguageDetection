These candlesticks held two wax candles , and usually figured on the Bishop 's chimney-piece . 
When he had any one to dinner , Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table . 
In the Bishop 's own chamber , at the head of his bed , there was a small cupboard , in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night . 
But it is necessary to add , that the key was never removed . 
The garden , which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned , was composed of four alleys in cross-form , radiating from a tank .
