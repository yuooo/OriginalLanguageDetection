Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday ? 
Why does he always take the narrow streets ? 
Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house ? 
Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper , when she has a `` whole stationer 's shop full of it ? '' 
etc. .
