The pavements were less hard to him than his mother 's heart . 
His parents had despatched him into life with a kick . 
He simply took flight . 
He was a boisterous , pallid , nimble , wide-awake , jeering , lad , with a vivacious but sickly air . 
He went and came , sang , played at hopscotch , scraped the gutters , stole a little , but , like cats and sparrows , gayly laughed when he was called a rogue , and got angry when called a thief .
