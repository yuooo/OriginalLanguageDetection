As birds make nests out of everything , so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand . 
While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat , Cosette , on her side , had dressed up her sword . 
That done , she laid it in her arms , and sang to it softly , to lull it to sleep . 
The doll is one of the most imperious needs and , at the same time , one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood . 
To care for , to clothe , to deck , to dress , to undress , to redress , to teach , scold a little , to rock , to dandle , to lull to sleep , to imagine that something is some one , -- therein lies the whole woman 's future .
