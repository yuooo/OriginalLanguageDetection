On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys , the Bishop had hurt his soul , as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark . 
The future life , the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth , all pure and radiant , filled him with tremors and anxiety . 
He no longer knew where he really was . 
Like an owl , who should suddenly see the sun rise , the convict had been dazzled and blinded , as it were , by virtue . 
That which was certain , that which he did not doubt , was that he was no longer the same man , that everything about him was changed , that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him .
