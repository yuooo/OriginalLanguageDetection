Surely , although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves , binds together all these subterranean pioneers who , almost always , think themselves isolated , and who are not so , their works vary greatly , and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others . 
The first are paradisiacal , the last are tragic . 
Nevertheless , whatever may be the contrast , all these toilers , from the highest to the most nocturnal , from the wisest to the most foolish , possess one likeness , and this is it : disinterestedness . 
Marat forgets himself like Jesus . 
They throw themselves on one side , they omit themselves , they think not of themselves .
