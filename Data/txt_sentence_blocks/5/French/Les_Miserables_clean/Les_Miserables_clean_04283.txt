at such moments , what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister , that chaste peak , that abode of angels , that inaccessible glacier of virtue ! 
How he contemplated , with despairing ecstasy , that convent garden , full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins , where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven ! 
How he adored that Eden forever closed against him , whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged ! 
How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought Cosette back into the world , poor hero of sacrifice , seized and hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion ! 
How he said to himself , `` What have I done ? ''
