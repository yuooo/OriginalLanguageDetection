My drawing-room , which contains no furniture , and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing , is fifteen feet in height , eighteen square , with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded , and with beams , as in yours . 
This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital . 
And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers . 
But my room is the one you ought to see . 
Madam Magloire has discovered , under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top , some paintings , which without being good are very tolerable .
