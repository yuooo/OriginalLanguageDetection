Some bits of dry heather , tossed by the breeze , flew rapidly by , and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after . 
On all sides there were lugubrious stretches . 
The darkness was bewildering . 
Man requires light . 
Whoever buries himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract .
