Reflect on what progress has already accomplished . 
Formerly , the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes , breathing on the waters , the dragon which vomited flame , the griffin who was the monster of the air , and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger ; fearful beasts which were above man . 
Man , nevertheless , spread his snares , consecrated by intelligence , and finally conquered these monsters . 
We have vanquished the hydra , and it is called the locomotive ; we are on the point of vanquishing the griffin , we already grasp it , and it is called the balloon . 
On the day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished , and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimaera of antiquity , the hydra , the dragon and the griffin , he will be the master of water , fire , and of air , and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him .
