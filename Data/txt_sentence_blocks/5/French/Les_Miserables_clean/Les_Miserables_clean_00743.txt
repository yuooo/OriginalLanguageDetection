All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing , stopped short , and put out her tongue , in sign of admiration . 
Mother Thenardier released her daughters , made them descend from the swing , and said : -- `` Now amuse yourselves , all three of you . '' 
Children become acquainted quickly at that age , and at the expiration of a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer at making holes in the ground , which was an immense pleasure . 
The new-comer was very gay ; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child ; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel , and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly . 
The grave-digger 's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child .
