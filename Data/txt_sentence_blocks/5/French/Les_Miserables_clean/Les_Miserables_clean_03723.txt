The brazier , placed in the fireplace itself , beside the nearly extinct brands , sent its vapors up the chimney , and gave out no odor . 
The moon , entering through the four panes of the window , cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret ; and to the poetic spirit of Marius , who was dreamy even in the moment of action , it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth . 
A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane , helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier . 
The Jondrette lair was , if the reader recalls what we have said of the Gorbeau building , admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed , and as the envelope for a crime . 
It was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in Paris .
