They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin , and three armorers ' shops , the first in the Rue Beaubourg , the second in the Rue Michel-le-Comte , the other in the Rue du Temple . 
In a few minutes , the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns , nearly all double-barrelled , sixty-four swords , and eighty-three pistols . 
In order to provide more arms , one man took the gun , the other the bayonet . 
Opposite the Quai de la Greve , young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing . 
One of them had a flint-lock .
