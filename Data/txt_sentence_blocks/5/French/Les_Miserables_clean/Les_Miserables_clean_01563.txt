Scabra rubigine . 
A few years ago , a shell of sixty pounds , still charged , and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb , was unearthed . 
It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide , Lacoste , a hostile and terrified peasant , who was attached to the saddle of a hussar , and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon : `` Fool , it is shameful ! 
You 'll get yourself killed with a ball in the back . '' 
He who writes these lines has himself found , in the friable soil of this knoll , on turning over the sand , the remains of the neck of a bomb , disintegrated , by the oxidization of six and forty years , and old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers .
