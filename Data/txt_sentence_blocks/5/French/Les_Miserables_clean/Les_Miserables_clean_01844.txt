M. le Duc de Havre , as captain of the guard on duty that day , was seated in the carriage , opposite the king . 
He said to his Majesty , `` Yonder is an evil-looking man . '' 
Members of the police , who were clearing the king 's route , took equal note of him : one of them received an order to follow him . 
But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg , and as twilight was beginning to fall , the agent lost trace of him , as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comte d'Angles , Minister of State , Prefect of Police . 
When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track , he redoubled his pace , not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed .
