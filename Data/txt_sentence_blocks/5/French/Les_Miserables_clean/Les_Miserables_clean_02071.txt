She felt that which she had never felt before -- a sensation of expansion . 
The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor ; she thought Jean Valjean handsome , just as she thought the hovel pretty .

The novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here . 
Nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret .
