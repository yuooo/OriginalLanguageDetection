`` And you ? '' 
`` Under my shirt . '' 
In the Rue Traversiere , in front of the Bland workshop , and in the yard of the Maison-Brulee , in front of tool-maker Bernier 's , groups whispered together . 
Among them was observed a certain Mavot , who never remained more than a week in one shop , as the masters always discharged him `` because they were obliged to dispute with him every day . '' 
Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Menilmontant .
