`` This man was at the barricade , '' said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself . 
`` He is the one they called Marius . '' 
A spy of the first quality , who had observed everything , listened to everything , and taken in everything , even when he thought that he was to die ; who had played the spy even in his agony , and who , with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre , had taken notes . 
He seized Marius ' hand and felt his pulse . 
`` He is wounded , '' said Jean Valjean .
