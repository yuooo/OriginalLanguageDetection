In a corner , on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet , a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap . 
The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned . 
One would have said that there had been an earthquake `` for one . '' 
The covers were displaced , the rags scattered about , the jug broken , the mother had been crying , the children had probably been beaten ; traces of a vigorous and ill-tempered search . 
It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card , and had made everybody in the garret , from the jug to his wife , responsible for its loss .
