The thing was well ventilated for me . 
This is what they discovered : This Champmathieu had been , thirty years ago , a pruner of trees in various localities , notably at Faverolles . 
There all trace of him was lost . 
A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne ; then in Paris , where he is said to have been a wheelwright , and to have had a daughter , who was a laundress ; but that has not been proved . 
Now , before going to the galleys for theft , what was Jean Valjean ?
