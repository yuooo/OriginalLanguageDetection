In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and Javert bound to his post . 
`` This is the hall of the dead , '' said Enjolras . 
In the interior of this hall , barely lighted by a candle at one end , the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar , a sort of vast , vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone . 
The pole of the omnibus , although snapped off by the fusillade , was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it .
