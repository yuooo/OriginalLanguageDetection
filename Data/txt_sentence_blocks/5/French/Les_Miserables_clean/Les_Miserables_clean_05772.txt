The sun gilded , empurpled , set fire to and lighted up the tulips , which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers . 
All around the banks of tulips the bees , the sparks of these flame-flowers , hummed . 
All was grace and gayety , even the impending rain ; this relapse , by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit , had nothing disturbing about it ; the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low . 
He who was there aspired to happiness ; life smelled good ; all nature exhaled candor , help , assistance , paternity , caress , dawn . 
The thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it .
