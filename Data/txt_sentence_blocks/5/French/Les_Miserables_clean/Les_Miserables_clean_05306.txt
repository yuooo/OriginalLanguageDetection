Only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel des Princes and the Hotel Meurice . 
Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme . 
There the shops were closed , the merchants were chatting in front of their half-open doors , people were walking about , the street lanterns were lighted , beginning with the first floor , all the windows were lighted as usual . 
There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal . 
Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honore .
