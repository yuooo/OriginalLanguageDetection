HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION The Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end near the Halles , notice on their right , opposite the Rue Mondetour , a basket-maker 's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon the Great with this inscription : -- NAPOLEON IS MADE WHOLLY OF WILLOW , have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago . 
It was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie , which ancient deeds spell Chanverrerie , and the celebrated public-house called Corinthe . 
The reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point , and eclipsed , by the way , by the barricade Saint-Merry . 
It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , now fallen into profound obscurity , that we are about to shed a little light . 
May we be permitted to recur , for the sake of clearness in the recital , to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of Waterloo .
