A letter . 
A letter without name , without address , without date , without signature , pressing and disinterested , an enigma composed of truths , a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin , an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth , the love-letter of a phantom to a shade . 
It was an absent one , tranquil and dejected , who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love , his lady , the secret of fate , the key of life , love . 
This had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven . 
These lines , which had fallen one by one on the paper , were what might be called drops of soul .
