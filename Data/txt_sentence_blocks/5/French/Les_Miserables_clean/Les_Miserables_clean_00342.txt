That evening , the Bishop of D -- , after his promenade through the town , remained shut up rather late in his room . 
He was busy over a great work on Duties , which was never completed , unfortunately . 
He was carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject . 
His book was divided into two parts : firstly , the duties of all ; secondly , the duties of each individual , according to the class to which he belongs . 
The duties of all are the great duties .
