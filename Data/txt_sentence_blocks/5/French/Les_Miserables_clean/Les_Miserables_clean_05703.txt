The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star . 
The possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect . 
The down on the peach , the bloom on the plum , the radiated crystal of the snow , the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers , are coarse compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste . 
The young girl is only the flash of a dream , and is not yet a statue . 
Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal .
