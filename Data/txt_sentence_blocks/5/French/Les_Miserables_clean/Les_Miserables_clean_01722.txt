After this fall , there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen , that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day , obscurely , in the human community , and which history has noted only once , because it occurred after the death of Alexander .

Some of them quitted the country , others abandoned the trade .
