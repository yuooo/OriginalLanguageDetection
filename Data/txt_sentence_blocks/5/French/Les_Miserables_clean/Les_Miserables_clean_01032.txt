If he is Jean Valjean , he has his previous conviction against him . 
To climb a wall , to break a branch , to purloin apples , is a mischievous trick in a child ; for a man it is a misdemeanor ; for a convict it is a crime . 
Robbing and housebreaking -- it is all there . 
It is no longer a question of correctional police ; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes . 
It is no longer a matter of a few days in prison ; it is the galleys for life .
