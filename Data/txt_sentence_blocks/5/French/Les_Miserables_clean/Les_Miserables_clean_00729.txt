She was pale ; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance . 
She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child . 
A large blue handkerchief , such as the Invalides use , was folded into a fichu , and concealed her figure clumsily . 
Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles , her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle ; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff , a linen gown , and coarse shoes . 
It was Fantine .
