The social question is the same for you as for us . 
There are a few less deaths from hunger with you , and a few more from fever ; your social hygiene is not much better than ours ; shadows , which are Protestant in England , are Catholic in Italy ; but , under different names , the vescovo is identical with the bishop , and it always means night , and of pretty nearly the same quality . 
To explain the Bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the Gospel badly . 
Is it necessary to emphasize this ? 
Must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified ?
