The education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul , and never of love , very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame . 
This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love , sorrow , destiny , life , eternity , the beginning , the end . 
It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light . 
In these few lines she felt a passionate , ardent , generous , honest nature , a sacred will , an immense sorrow , and an immense despair , a suffering heart , an ecstasy fully expanded . 
What was this manuscript ?
