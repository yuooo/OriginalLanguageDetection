Ah ! 
by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of paradise , I was not intended to be a Parisian , that is to say , to rebound forever , like a shuttlecock between two battledores , from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers . 
I was made to be a Turk , watching oriental houris all day long , executing those exquisite Egyptian dances , as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man , or a Beauceron peasant , or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman , or a petty German prince , furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation , and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge , that is to say , his frontier . 
Those are the positions for which I was born ! 
Yes , I have said a Turk , and I will not retract .
