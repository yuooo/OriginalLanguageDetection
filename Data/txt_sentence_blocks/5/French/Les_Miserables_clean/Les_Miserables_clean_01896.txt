In the meantime , a door had opened , and Eponine and Azelma entered . 
They were two really pretty little girls , more bourgeois than peasant in looks , and very charming ; the one with shining chestnut tresses , the other with long black braids hanging down her back , both vivacious , neat , plump , rosy , and healthy , and a delight to the eye . 
They were warmly clad , but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement . 
There was a hint of winter , though the springtime was not wholly effaced . 
Light emanated from these two little beings .
