To this there is but one reply : `` In former days . '' 
To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things , and of the government of men by embalming , to restore dogmas in a bad condition , to regild shrines , to patch up cloisters , to rebless reliquaries , to refurnish superstitions , to revictual fanaticisms , to put new handles on holy water brushes and militarism , to reconstitute monasticism and militarism , to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication of parasites , to force the past on the present , -- this seems strange . 
Still , there are theorists who hold such theories . 
These theorists , who are in other respects people of intelligence , have a very simple process ; they apply to the past a glazing which they call social order , divine right , morality , family , the respect of elders , antique authority , sacred tradition , legitimacy , religion ; and they go about shouting , `` Look ! 
take this , honest people . ''
