He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him . 
Moreover , he made no pretensions to botany ; he ignored groups and consistency ; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method ; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons , nor with Jussieu against Linnaeus . 
He did not study plants ; he loved flowers . 
He respected learned men greatly ; he respected the ignorant still more ; and , without ever failing in these two respects , he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green . 
The house had not a single door which could be locked .
