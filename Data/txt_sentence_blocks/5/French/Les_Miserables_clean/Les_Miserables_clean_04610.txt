Every day , at four o'clock in the afternoon , a jailer , escorted by two dogs , -- this was still in vogue at that time , -- entered his cage , deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds , a jug of water , a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon , in which swam a few Mayagan beans , inspected his irons and tapped the bars . 
This man and his dogs made two visits during the night . 
Thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall , `` in order to preserve it from the rats , '' as he said . 
As Thenardier was kept in sight , no objection had been made to this spike . 
Still , it was remembered afterwards , that one of the jailers had said : `` It would be better to let him have only a wooden spike . ''
