A fire was burning there ; which indicated that Jean Valjean 's reply : `` I will remain below , '' had been foreseen . 
Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace . 
Between the chairs an old bedside rug , which displayed more foundation thread than wool , had been spread by way of a carpet . 
The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window . 
Jean Valjean was fatigued .
