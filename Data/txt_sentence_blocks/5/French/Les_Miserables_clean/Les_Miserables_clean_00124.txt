Voltaire made sport of Needham , and he was wrong , for Needham 's eels prove that God is useless . 
A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux . 
Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger ; you have the world . 
Man is the eel . 
Then what is the good of the Eternal Father ?
