It was no longer solitude , for there were passers-by ; it was not the country , for there were houses and streets ; it was not the city , for the streets had ruts like highways , and the grass grew in them ; it was not a village , the houses were too lofty . 
What was it , then ? 
It was an inhabited spot where there was no one ; it was a desert place where there was some one ; it was a boulevard of the great city , a street of Paris ; more wild at night than the forest , more gloomy by day than a cemetery . 
It was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux . 
The rambler , if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this Marche-aux-Chevaux ; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier , after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls ; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver huts ; then an enclosure encumbered with timber , with a heap of stumps , sawdust , and shavings , on which stood a large dog , barking ; then a long , low , utterly dilapidated wall , with a little black door in mourning , laden with mosses , which were covered with flowers in the spring ; then , in the most deserted spot , a frightful and decrepit building , on which ran the inscription in large letters : POST NO BILLS , -- this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel .
