The Thenardier , dishevelled and terrible , set her feet far apart , threw herself backwards , and hurled the paving-stone at Javert 's head . 
Javert ducked , the stone passed over him , struck the wall behind , knocked off a huge piece of plastering , and , rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel , now luckily almost empty , rested at Javert 's feet . 
At the same moment , Javert reached the Thenardier couple . 
One of his big hands descended on the woman 's shoulder ; the other on the husband 's head . 
`` The handcuffs ! ''
