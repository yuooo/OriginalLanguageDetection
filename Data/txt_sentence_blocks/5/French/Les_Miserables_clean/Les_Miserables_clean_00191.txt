I voted the end of the tyrant , that is to say , the end of prostitution for woman , the end of slavery for man , the end of night for the child . 
In voting for the Republic , I voted for that . 
I voted for fraternity , concord , the dawn . 
I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors . 
The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light .
