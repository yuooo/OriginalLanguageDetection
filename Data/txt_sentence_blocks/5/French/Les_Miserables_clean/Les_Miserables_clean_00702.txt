It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences . 
Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the Champs-Elysees . 
The majority followed the quay and went through the Passy Barrier . 
From moment to moment , some huge vehicle , painted yellow and black , heavily loaded , noisily harnessed , rendered shapeless by trunks , tarpaulins , and valises , full of heads which immediately disappeared , rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge , with dust for smoke , and an air of fury , grinding the pavements , changing all the paving-stones into steels . 
This uproar delighted the young girls .
