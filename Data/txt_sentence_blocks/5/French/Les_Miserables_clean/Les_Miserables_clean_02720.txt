There , darkness ; here , the shadow ; but a shadow filled with gleams of light , and of gleams full of radiance . 
Two strongholds of slavery ; but in the first , deliverance possible , a legal limit always in sight , and then , escape . 
In the second , perpetuity ; the sole hope , at the distant extremity of the future , that faint light of liberty which men call death . 
In the first , men are bound only with chains ; in the other , chained by faith . 
What flowed from the first ?
