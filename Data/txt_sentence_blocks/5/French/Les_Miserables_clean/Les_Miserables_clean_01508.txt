The wall on the right is of brick , the wall at the bottom is of stone . 
One enters the garden first . 
It slopes downwards , is planted with gooseberry bushes , choked with a wild growth of vegetation , and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone , with balustrade with a double curve . 
It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le Notre ; to-day it is ruins and briars . 
The pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon-balls of stone .
