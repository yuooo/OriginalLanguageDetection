`` Oh ! '' 
she said to him , `` be good ! '' 
And she went on : `` This is what I call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father . '' 
He loosed her hands . 
`` You no longer need a father , you have a husband . ''
