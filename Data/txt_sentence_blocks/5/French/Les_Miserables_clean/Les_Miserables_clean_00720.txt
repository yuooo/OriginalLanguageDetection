The whole thing was compact , overwhelming , and misshapen . 
It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon . 
The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels , the fellies , the hub , the axle , and the shaft , a layer of mud , a hideous yellowish daubing hue , tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals . 
The wood was disappearing under mud , and the iron beneath rust . 
Under the axle-tree hung , like drapery , a huge chain , worthy of some Goliath of a convict .
