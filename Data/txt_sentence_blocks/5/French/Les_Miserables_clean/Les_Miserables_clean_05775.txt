A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music , the cooing of nests , the buzzing of swarms , the flutterings of the breeze . 
All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole ; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order ; the lilacs ended ; the jasmines began ; some flowers were tardy , some insects in advance of their time ; the van-guard of the red June butterflies fraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May . 
The plantain trees were getting their new skins . 
The breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees . 
It was splendid .
