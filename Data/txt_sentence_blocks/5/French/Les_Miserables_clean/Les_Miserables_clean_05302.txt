Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other 's hands silently , and , leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade , they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion , that grave young man , executioner and priest , composed of light , like crystal , and also of rock . 
Let us say at once that later on , after the action , when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched , a police agent 's card was found on Le Cabuc . 
The author of this book had in his hands , in 1848 , the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832 . 
We will add , that if we are to believe a tradition of the police , which is strange but probably well founded , Le Cabuc was Claquesous . 
The fact is , that dating from the death of Le Cabuc , there was no longer any question of Claquesous .
