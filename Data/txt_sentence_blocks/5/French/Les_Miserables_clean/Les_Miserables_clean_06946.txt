Cosette , my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little . 
That barricade , that sewer , that furnace , that cesspool , -- all that he traversed for me , for thee , Cosette ! 
He carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me , and accepted for himself . 
Every courage , every virtue , every heroism , every sanctity he possesses ! 
Cosette , that man is an angel ! ''
