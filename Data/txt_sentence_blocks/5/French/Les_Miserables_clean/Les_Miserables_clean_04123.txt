To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime . 
They are artists , who have one picture in the salon , and who toil , none the less , on a new work in their studios . 
Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison . 
He could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the sutler 's window in the Charlemagne yard , staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with : garlic , 62 centimes , and ended with : cigar , 5 centimes . 
Or he passed his time in trembling , chattering his teeth , saying that he had a fever , and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant .
