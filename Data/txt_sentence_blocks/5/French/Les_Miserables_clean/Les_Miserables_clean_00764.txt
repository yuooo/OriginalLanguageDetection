Thanks to the traveller 's fifty-seven francs , Thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature . 
On the following month they were again in need of money . 
The woman took Cosette 's outfit to Paris , and pawned it at the pawnbroker 's for sixty francs . 
As soon as that sum was spent , the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity ; and they treated her accordingly . 
As she had no longer any clothes , they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats ; that is to say , in rags .
