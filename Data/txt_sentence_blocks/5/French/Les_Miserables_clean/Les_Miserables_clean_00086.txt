There was still another chair in the detached alcove , but the straw was half gone from it , and it had but three legs , so that it was of service only when propped against the wall . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood , which had formerly been gilded , and which was covered with flowered pekin ; but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window , as the staircase was too narrow ; it could not , therefore , be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine 's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet , stamped with a rose pattern , and with mahogany in swan 's neck style , with a sofa . 
But this would have cost five hundred francs at least , and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years , she had ended by renouncing the idea . 
However , who is there who has attained his ideal ?
