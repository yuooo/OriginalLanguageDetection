I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line , and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion . 
In one hour you will be attacked . 
As for the populace , it was seething yesterday , to-day it is not stirring . 
There is nothing to expect ; nothing to hope for . 
Neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment .
