Joly was studying medicine . 
He was two years younger than Bossuet . 
Joly was the `` malade imaginaire '' junior . 
What he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor . 
At three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian , and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror .
