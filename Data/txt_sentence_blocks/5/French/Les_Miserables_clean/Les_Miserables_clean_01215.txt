We are on a cross-road . 
The relays are badly served , the horses are in the fields . 
The season for ploughing is just beginning ; heavy teams are required , and horses are seized upon everywhere , from the post as well as elsewhere . 
Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay . 
And , then , they drive at a walk .
