As on the previous evening , the sentinels had come in ; but this time all had come . 
The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack . 
Since the departure of the five , they had increased its height still further .

He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane , which had been left open up to that time , barricaded .
