Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes . 
These beings also lived with shorn heads , with downcast eyes , with lowered voices , not in disgrace , but amid the scoffs of the world , not with their backs bruised with the cudgel , but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline . 
Their names , also , had vanished from among men ; they no longer existed except under austere appellations . 
They never ate meat and they never drank wine ; they often remained until evening without food ; they were attired , not in a red blouse , but in a black shroud , of woollen , which was heavy in summer and thin in winter , without the power to add or subtract anything from it ; without having even , according to the season , the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak ; and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever . 
They dwelt , not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold , but in cells where no fire was ever lighted ; they slept , not on mattresses two inches thick , but on straw .
