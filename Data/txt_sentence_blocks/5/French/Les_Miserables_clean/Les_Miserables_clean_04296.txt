Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber-yard . 
His face was turned towards the highway , his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising ; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated , which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls . 
There are meditations which may be called vertical ; when one is at the bottom of them , time is required to return to earth . 
Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries . 
He was thinking of Cosette , of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her , of the light with which she filled his life , a light which was but the emanation of her soul .
