The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels : one , the English tomb , is on the left ; the other , the German tomb , is on the right . 
There is no French tomb . 
The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France . 
Thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference , the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope . 
On the day of battle , particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte , it was abrupt and difficult of approach .
