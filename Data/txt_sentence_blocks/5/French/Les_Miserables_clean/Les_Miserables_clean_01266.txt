He wants to give me a surprise , you know ! 
he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers ; they can not say anything , can they ? 
they will give back Cosette , for they have been paid ; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay . 
Do not make signs to me that I must not talk , sister ! 
I am extremely happy ; I am doing well ; I am not ill at all any more ; I am going to see Cosette again ; I am even quite hungry ; it is nearly five years since I saw her last ; you can not imagine how much attached one gets to children , and then , she will be so pretty ; you will see !
