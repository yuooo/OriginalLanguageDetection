A wild darkness , full of traps , full of unseen and formidable shocks , into which it was alarming to penetrate , and in which it was terrible to remain , where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited , where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming . 
Invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street ; snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night . 
All was over . 
No more light was to be hoped for , henceforth , except the lightning of guns , no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death . 
Where ?
