Jean Valjean 's visits were not abridged . 
Far from it . 
When it is the heart which is slipping , one does not halt on the downward slope . 
When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour , he sang the praises of Marius ; he pronounced him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good . 
Cosette outdid him .
