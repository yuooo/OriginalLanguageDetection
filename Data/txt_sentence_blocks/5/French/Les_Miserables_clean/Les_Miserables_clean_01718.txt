A former convict , who had been liberated , named Jean Valjean , has just appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var , under circumstances calculated to attract attention . 
This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police , he had changed his name , and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns ; in this town he had established a considerable commerce . 
He has at last been unmasked and arrested , thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor . 
He had for his concubine a woman of the town , who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest . 
This scoundrel , who is endowed with Herculean strength , found means to escape ; but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more , in Paris itself , at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of Montfermeil -LRB- Seine-et-Oise -RRB- .
