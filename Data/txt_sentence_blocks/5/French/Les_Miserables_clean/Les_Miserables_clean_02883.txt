From this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon , M. l'Abbe Mabeuf . 
That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice , who had often observed this man gazing at his child , and the scar on his cheek , and the large tears in his eyes . 
That man , who had so manly an air , yet who was weeping like a woman , had struck the warden . 
That face had clung to his mind . 
One day , having gone to Vernon to see his brother , he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge , and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice .
