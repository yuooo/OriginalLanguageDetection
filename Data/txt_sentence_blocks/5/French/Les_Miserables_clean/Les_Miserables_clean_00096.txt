The door of the dining-room , which , as we have said , opened directly on the cathedral square , had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison . 
The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed , and this door was never fastened , either by night or by day , with anything except the latch . 
All that the first passerby had to do at any hour , was to give it a push . 
At first , the two women had been very much tried by this door , which was never fastened , but Monsieur de D -- had said to them , `` Have bolts put on your rooms , if that will please you . '' 
They had ended by sharing his confidence , or by at least acting as though they shared it .
