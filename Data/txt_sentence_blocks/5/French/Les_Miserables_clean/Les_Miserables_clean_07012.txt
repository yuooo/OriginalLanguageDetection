Your Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France . 
Your admirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it . 
Does not banditism , that raging form of pauperism , inhabit your mountains ? 
Few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I have endeavored to fathom . 
In spite of your possessing Rome , Milan , Naples , Palermo , Turin , Florence , Sienna , Pisa , Mantua , Bologna , Ferrara , Genoa , Venice , a heroic history , sublime ruins , magnificent ruins , and superb cities , you are , like ourselves , poor .
