He rummaged in the one or the other , according to circumstances . 
Among his other resources , thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at Toulon , he was , as it will be remembered , a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons , by sheer muscular force , by leaning on the nape of his neck , his shoulders , his hips , and his knees , by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone , in the right angle of a wall , as high as the sixth story , if need be ; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle , condemned to death , made his escape twenty years ago . 
Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden ; it was about eighteen feet in height . 
The angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled , at its lower extremity , by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape , probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by . 
This practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris .
