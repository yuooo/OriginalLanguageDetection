This cavern is below all , and is the foe of all . 
It is hatred , without exception . 
This cavern knows no philosophers ; its dagger has never cut a pen . 
Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand . 
Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling , turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper .
