Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion , but it is certain that Caesar laughed . 
While exploring on horseback at one o'clock on the preceding night , in storm and rain , in company with Bertrand , the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme , satisfied at the sight of the long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from Frischemont to Braine-l'Alleud , it had seemed to him that fate , to whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo , was exact to the appointment ; he stopped his horse , and remained for some time motionless , gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder ; and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying , `` We are in accord . '' 
Napoleon was mistaken . 
They were no longer in accord . 
He took not a moment for sleep ; every instant of that night was marked by a joy for him .
