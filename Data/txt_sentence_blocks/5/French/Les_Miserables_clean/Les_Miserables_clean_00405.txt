For in his history there is a fault , and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it . 
To such a point did he carry it , that at one time , when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier , who exercise a gentle labor near heaven , and who , he added , are happy because they are innocent , he stopped short , fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man . 
By dint of reflection , I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother 's heart . 
He was thinking , no doubt , that this man , whose name is Jean Valjean , had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind ; that the best thing was to divert him from it , and to make him believe , if only momentarily , that he was a person like any other , by treating him just in his ordinary way . 
Is not this indeed , to understand charity well ?
