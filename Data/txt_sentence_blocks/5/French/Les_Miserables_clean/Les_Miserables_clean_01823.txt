She felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring , and which usually served to support her , found one of its branches , clung to it , bent down , and plunged the bucket in the water .

While thus bent over , she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring . 
The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water . 
Cosette neither saw nor heard it fall .
