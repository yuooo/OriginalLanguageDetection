You see , there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may , in the very heart of the winter ; and you must have pity on such a being , my good Monsieur Javert . 
If she were older , she might earn her living ; but it can not be done at that age . 
I am not a bad woman at bottom . 
It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what I am . 
If I have drunk brandy , it was out of misery .
