Thus it was said in the town , when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure , he indulges in the cheer of a trappist . 
After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire ; then he retired to his own room and set to writing , sometimes on loose sheets , and again on the margin of some folio . 
He was a man of letters and rather learned . 
He left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts ; among others , a dissertation on this verse in Genesis , In the beginning , the spirit of God floated upon the waters . 
With this verse he compares three texts : the Arabic verse which says , The winds of God blew ; Flavius Josephus who says , A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth ; and finally , the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos , which renders it , A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters .
