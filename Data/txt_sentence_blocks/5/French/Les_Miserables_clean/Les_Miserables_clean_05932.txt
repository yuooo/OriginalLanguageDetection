They are the meadow in flower , the green grass , wild thyme , thyme and sage , they are game , they are cattle , they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the evening , they are perfumed hay , they are golden wheat , they are the bread on your table , they are the warm blood in your veins , they are health , they are joy , they are life . 
This is the will of that mysterious creation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven . 
Restore this to the great crucible ; your abundance will flow forth from it . 
The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men . 
You have it in your power to lose this wealth , and to consider me ridiculous to boot .
