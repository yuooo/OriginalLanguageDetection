Why was he called Little Gavroche ? 
Probably because his father 's name was Jondrette . 
It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread . 
The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor . 
The cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called M. Marius .
