The Prince de Talleyrand , grand chamberlain , and the Abbe Louis , appointed minister of finance , laughed as they looked at each other , with the laugh of the two augurs ; both of them had celebrated , on the 14th of July , 1790 , the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars ; Talleyrand had said it as bishop , Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon . 
In 1817 , in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars , two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain , rotting amid the grass , painted blue , with traces of eagles and bees , from which the gilding was falling . 
These were the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor 's platform in the Champ de Mai . 
They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou . 
Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires , and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops .
