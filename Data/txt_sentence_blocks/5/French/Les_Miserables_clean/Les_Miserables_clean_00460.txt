Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune , unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks , the reproved of the law , feel the whole weight of this human society , so formidable for him who is without , so frightful for him who is beneath , resting upon their heads .
