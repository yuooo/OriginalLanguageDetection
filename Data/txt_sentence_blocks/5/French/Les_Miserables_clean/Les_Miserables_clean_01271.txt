A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change ; she was all rosy now ; she spoke in a lively and natural voice ; her whole face was one smile ; now and then she talked , she laughed softly ; the joy of a mother is almost infantile . 
`` Well , '' resumed the nun , `` now that you are happy , mind me , and do not talk any more . '' 
Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice : `` Yes , lie down again ; be good , for you are going to have your child ; Sister Simplice is right ; every one here is right . '' 
And then , without stirring , without even moving her head , she began to stare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air , and she said nothing more .
