In that chamber there were no longer either judges , accusers , nor gendarmes ; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts . 
No one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play ; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting , the President that he was there to preside , the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend . 
It was a striking circumstance that no question was put , that no authority intervened . 
The peculiarity of sublime spectacles is , that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators . 
No one , probably , could have explained what he felt ; no one , probably , said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light : all felt themselves inwardly dazzled .
