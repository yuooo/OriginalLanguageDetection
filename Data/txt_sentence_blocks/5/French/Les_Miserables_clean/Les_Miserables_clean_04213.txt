She should be gently and discreetly enlightened , rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light . 
A useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls . 
There is nothing but the maternal instinct , that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman , which knows how this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist . 
Nothing supplies the place of this instinct . 
All the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl 's soul .
