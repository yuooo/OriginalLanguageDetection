Below ran this inscription : AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO -LRB- Au Sargent de Waterloo -RRB- . 
Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry . 
Nevertheless , the vehicle , or , to speak more accurately , the fragment of a vehicle , which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the Sergeant of Waterloo , one evening in the spring of 1818 , would certainly have attracted , by its mass , the attention of any painter who had passed that way . 
It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country , and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees . 
This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot , into which was fitted a heavy shaft , and which was supported by two huge wheels .
