Then the gamin emerged from his thicket , and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the dark , as the latter stood there motionless . 
In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without being seen or heard , gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth , seized the purse , withdrew his hand , and having recourse once more to his crawling , he slipped away like an adder through the shadows . 
Montparnasse , who had no reason to be on his guard , and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life , perceived nothing . 
When Gavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was , he flung the purse over the hedge , and fled as fast as his legs would carry him . 
The purse fell on Father Mabeuf 's foot .
