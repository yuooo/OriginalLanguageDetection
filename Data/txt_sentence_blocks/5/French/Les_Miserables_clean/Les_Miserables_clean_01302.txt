The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall , in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him . 
In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him , `` Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me ? '' 
It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously , and who was now bowing to the earth before him . 
At the same time , the usher handed him the paper . 
He unfolded it , and as he chanced to be near the light , he could read it .
