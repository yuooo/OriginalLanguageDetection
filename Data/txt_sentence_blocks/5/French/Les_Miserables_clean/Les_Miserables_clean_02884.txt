The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure , and both had paid the colonel a visit , on some pretext or other . 
This visit led to others . 
The colonel , who had been extremely reserved at first , ended by opening his heart , and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history , and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child 's future . 
This caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness , and the colonel , on his side , became fond of the cure . 
And moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier .
