Mon Dieu ! 
it is like a little republic . 
Neither judge nor bailiff is known there . 
The mayor does everything . 
He allots the imposts , taxes each person conscientiously , judges quarrels for nothing , divides inheritances without charge , pronounces sentences gratuitously ; and he is obeyed , because he is a just man among simple men . ''
