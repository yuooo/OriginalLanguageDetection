Little by little they began to talk to each other . 
Effusion followed silence , which is fulness . 
The night was serene and splendid overhead . 
These two beings , pure as spirits , told each other everything , their dreams , their intoxications , their ecstasies , their chimaeras , their weaknesses , how they had adored each other from afar , how they had longed for each other , their despair when they had ceased to see each other . 
They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy , which nothing could augment , their most secret and most mysterious thoughts .
