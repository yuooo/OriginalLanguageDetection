Each man had his collar , but the chain was for all ; so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk , they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity , and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone , somewhat after the fashion of millepeds . 
In the back and front of each vehicle , two men armed with muskets stood erect , each holding one end of the chain under his foot . 
The iron necklets were square . 
The seventh vehicle , a huge rack-sided baggage wagon , without a hood , had four wheels and six horses , and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers , cast-iron pots , braziers , and chains , among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length , and who seemed to be ill . 
This wagon , all lattice-work , was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments .
