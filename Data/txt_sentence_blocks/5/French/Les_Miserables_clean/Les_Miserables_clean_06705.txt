Persecution of the spiders was not organized there . 
A fine web , which spread far and wide , and was very black and ornamented with dead flies , formed a wheel on one of the window-panes . 
The room , which was small and low-ceiled , was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner . 
The wall , which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash , was scaling off in large flakes . 
At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf .
