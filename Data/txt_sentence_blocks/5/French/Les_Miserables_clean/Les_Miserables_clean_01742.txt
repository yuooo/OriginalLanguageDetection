This war contained many events in one , and a quantity of peculiarities . 
A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon ; the branch of France succoring and protecting the branch of Madrid , that is to say , performing an act devolving on the elder ; an apparent return to our national traditions , complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the North ; M. le Duc d'Angouleme , surnamed by the liberal sheets the hero of Andujar , compressing in a triumphal attitude that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air , the ancient and very powerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of the liberals ; the sansculottes resuscitated , to the great terror of dowagers , under the name of descamisados ; monarchy opposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy ; the theories of '89 roughly interrupted in the sap ; a European halt , called to the French idea , which was making the tour of the world ; beside the son of France as generalissimo , the Prince de Carignan , afterwards Charles Albert , enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer , with grenadier epaulets of red worsted ; the soldiers of the Empire setting out on a fresh campaign , but aged , saddened , after eight years of repose , and under the white cockade ; the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen , as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz ; monks mingled with our troops ; the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets ; principles slaughtered by cannonades ; France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind ; in addition to this , hostile leaders sold , soldiers hesitating , cities besieged by millions ; no military perils , and yet possible explosions , as in every mine which is surprised and invaded ; but little bloodshed , little honor won , shame for some , glory for no one . 
Such was this war , made by the princes descended from Louis XIV. , and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon . 
Its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics . 
Some feats of arms were serious ; the taking of the Trocadero , among others , was a fine military action ; but after all , we repeat , the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound , the whole effect was suspicious ; history approves of France for making a difficulty about accepting this false triumph .
