The infantry men , replying from below , six against two hundred , intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes , took a quarter of an hour to die . 
One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard , properly speaking . 
There , within the limits of those few square fathoms , fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour . 
The wall seems ready to renew the combat . 
Thirty-eight loopholes , pierced by the English at irregular heights , are there still .
