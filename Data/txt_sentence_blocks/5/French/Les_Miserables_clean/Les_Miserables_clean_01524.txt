Of course , we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of Waterloo ; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle , but this history is not our subject ; this history , moreover , has been finished , and finished in a masterly manner , from one point of view by Napoleon , and from another point of view by a whole pleiad of historians . 
-LSB- 7 -RSB- -LSB- 7 -RSB- Walter Scott , Lamartine , Vaulabelle , Charras , Quinet , Thiers . 
As for us , we leave the historians at loggerheads ; we are but a distant witness , a passer-by on the plain , a seeker bending over that soil all made of human flesh , taking appearances for realities , perchance ; we have no right to oppose , in the name of science , a collection of facts which contain illusions , no doubt ; we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorize a system ; in our opinion , a chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo ; and when it becomes a question of destiny , that mysterious culprit , we judge like that ingenious judge , the populace . 
A Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo have only to place , mentally , on the ground , a capital A . 
The left limb of the A is the road to Nivelles , the right limb is the road to Genappe , the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l'Alleud .
