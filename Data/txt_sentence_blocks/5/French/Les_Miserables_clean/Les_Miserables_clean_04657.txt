When it is a question of probing a wound , a gulf , a society , since when has it been considered wrong to go too far ? 
to go to the bottom ? 
We have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act , and , at least , a simple and useful deed , worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits . 
Why should one not explore everything , and study everything ? 
Why should one halt on the way ?
