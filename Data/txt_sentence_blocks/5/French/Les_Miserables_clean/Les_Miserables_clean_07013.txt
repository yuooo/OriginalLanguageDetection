You are covered with marvels and vermin . 
Assuredly , the sun of Italy is splendid , but , alas , azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man . 
Like us , you have prejudices , superstitions , tyrannies , fanaticisms , blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs . 
You taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it . 
You have a barbarian , the monk , and a savage , the lazzarone .
