Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor , whose back was turned to him . 
The mayor did not look at him , but went on annotating this docket . 
Javert advanced two or three paces into the study , and halted , without breaking the silence . 
If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert , and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization , this singular composite of the Roman , the Spartan , the monk , and the corporal , this spy who was incapable of a lie , this unspotted police agent -- if any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherished aversion for M. Madeleine , his conflict with the mayor on the subject of Fantine , and had examined Javert at that moment , he would have said to himself , `` What has taken place ? '' 
It was evident to any one acquainted with that clear , upright , sincere , honest , austere , and ferocious conscience , that Javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle .
