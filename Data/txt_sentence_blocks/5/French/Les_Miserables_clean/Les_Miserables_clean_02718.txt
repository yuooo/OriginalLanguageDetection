They were bandits , counterfeiters , poisoners , incendiaries , murderers , parricides . 
What had these women done ? 
They had done nothing whatever . 
On the one hand , highway robbery , fraud , deceit , violence , sensuality , homicide , all sorts of sacrilege , every variety of crime ; on the other , one thing only , innocence . 
Perfect innocence , almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption , attached to the earth by virtue , already possessing something of heaven through holiness .
