His whole life hung on these two words : watchfulness and supervision . 
He had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world ; he possessed the conscience of his usefulness , the religion of his functions , and he was a spy as other men are priests . 
Woe to the man who fell into his hands ! 
He would have arrested his own father , if the latter had escaped from the galleys , and would have denounced his mother , if she had broken her ban . 
And he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue .
