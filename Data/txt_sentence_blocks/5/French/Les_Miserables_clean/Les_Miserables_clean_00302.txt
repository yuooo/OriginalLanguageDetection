Had he done so , he would have seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold , surrounded by all the guests of his inn , and all the passers-by in the street , talking vivaciously , and pointing him out with his finger ; and , from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group , he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town . 
He saw nothing of all this . 
People who are crushed do not look behind them . 
They know but too well the evil fate which follows them . 
Thus he proceeded for some time , walking on without ceasing , traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing , forgetful of his fatigue , as is often the case when a man is sad .
