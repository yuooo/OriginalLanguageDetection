There ensued a most terrible silence ; then , all at once , a long file of uplifted arms , brandishing sabres , appeared above the crest , and casques , trumpets , and standards , and three thousand heads with gray mustaches , shouting , `` Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
All this cavalry debouched on the plateau , and it was like the appearance of an earthquake . 
All at once , a tragic incident ; on the English left , on our right , the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor . 
On arriving at the culminating point of the crest , ungovernable , utterly given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and cannon , the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench , -- a trench between them and the English . 
It was the hollow road of Ohain .
