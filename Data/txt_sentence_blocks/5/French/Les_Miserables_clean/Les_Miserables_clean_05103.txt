At Marengo , I received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck , a bullet in the right arm at Austerlitz , another in the left hip at Jena . 
At Friedland , a thrust from a bayonet , there , -- at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts , no matter where , at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers . 
Ah ! 
and then at Waterloo , a ball from a biscaien in the thigh , that 's all . '' 
`` How fine that is ! ''
