He urged the rich to give to the poor , in order to avoid hell , which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable , and to win paradise , which he represented as charming and desirable . 
Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant , who was somewhat of a usurer , named M. Geborand , who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth , serges , and woollen galloons . 
Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch . 
After the delivery of that sermon , it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral . 
There were six of them to share it .
