Nil sub sole novum , says Solomon ; amor omnibus idem , says Virgil ; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud , as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos . 
One last word . 
Do you know what Aspasia was , ladies ? 
Although she lived at an epoch when women had , as yet , no soul , she was a soul ; a soul of a rosy and purple hue , more ardent hued than fire , fresher than the dawn . 
Aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met ; she was the goddess prostitute ; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut .
