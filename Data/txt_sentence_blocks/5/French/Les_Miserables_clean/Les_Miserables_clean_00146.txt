Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible , and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness , -- places , sinecures , dignities , power , whether well or ill acquired , lucrative recantations , useful treacheries , savory capitulations of conscience , -- and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished . 
How agreeable that is ! 
I do not say that with reference to you , senator . 
Nevertheless , it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you . 
You great lords have , so you say , a philosophy of your own , and for yourselves , which is exquisite , refined , accessible to the rich alone , good for all sauces , and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably .
