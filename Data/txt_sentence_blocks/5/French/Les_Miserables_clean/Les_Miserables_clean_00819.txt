It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a street , calm , affectionate , surrounded by the blessings of all , a man of lofty stature , clad in an iron-gray frock-coat , armed with a heavy cane , and wearing a battered hat , turned round abruptly behind him , and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared , with folded arms and a slow shake of the head , and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose , a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by : `` What is that man , after all ? 
I certainly have seen him somewhere . 
In any case , I am not his dupe . '' 
This person , grave with a gravity which was almost menacing , was one of those men who , even when only seen by a rapid glimpse , arrest the spectator 's attention . 
His name was Javert , and he belonged to the police .
