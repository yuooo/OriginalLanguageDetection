I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette . 
We will have nothing to do with your dinner , Madame . 
And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him ` Monsieur Jean , ' and to receive him in a frightful , old , ugly cellar , where the walls have beards , and where the crystal consists of empty bottles , and the curtains are of spiders ' webs ! 
You are singular , I admit , that is your style , but people who get married are granted a truce . 
You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly .
