In the Rue de Thorigny , all was peace and silence . 
This apathy , peculiar to the Marais , presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar . 
Four gossips were chatting in a doorway . 
Scotland has trios of witches , Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags ; and the `` Thou shalt be King '' could be quite as mournfully hurled at Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr . 
The croak would be almost identical .
