He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with heaven and constellations in the intervals . 
Paris has a capital , the Town-Hall , a Parthenon , Notre-Dame , a Mount Aventine , the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , an Asinarium , the Sorbonne , a Pantheon , the Pantheon , a Via Sacra , the Boulevard des Italiens , a temple of the winds , opinion ; and it replaces the Gemoniae by ridicule . 
Its majo is called `` faraud , '' its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs , its hammal is the market-porter , its lazzarone is the pegre , its cockney is the native of Ghent . 
Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris . 
The fishwoman of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides , the discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso , the tight-rope dancer .
