Accordingly , the marriage took place on the 16th , notwithstanding the public merrymaking . 
It rained that day , but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness , which lovers see , even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella . 
On the preceding evening , Jean Valjean handed to Marius , in the presence of M. Gillenormand , the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs . 
As the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property , the papers had been simple . 
Henceforth , Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean ; Cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of lady 's maid .
