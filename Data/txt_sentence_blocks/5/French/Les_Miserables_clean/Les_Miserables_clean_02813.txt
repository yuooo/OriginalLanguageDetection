His manners were something between those of the courtier , which he had never been , and the lawyer , which he might have been . 
He was gay , and caressing when he had a mind . 
In his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses , because they are , at the same time , the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence . 
He was a connoisseur of painting . 
He had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom , painted by Jordaens , executed with great dashes of the brush , with millions of details , in a confused and hap-hazard manner .
