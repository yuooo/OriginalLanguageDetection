Marius was in error . 
There are fathers who do not love their children ; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson . 
At bottom , as we have said , M. Gillenormand idolized Marius . 
He idolized him after his own fashion , with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear ; but , this child once gone , he felt a black void in his heart ; he would allow no one to mention the child to him , and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed . 
At first , he hoped that this Buonapartist , this Jacobin , this terrorist , this Septembrist , would return .
