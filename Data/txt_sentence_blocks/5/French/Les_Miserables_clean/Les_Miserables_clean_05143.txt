Father Hucheloup had , possibly , been born a chemist , but the fact is that he was a cook ; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine-shop , they also ate there . 
Hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house , stuffed carps , which he called carpes au gras . 
These were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI. , on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths . 
People came thither from a distance .
