No trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of Paris . 
The bal Mabile is not the polymnia dance of the Janiculum , but the dealer in ladies ' wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes , exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in wait for the virgin Planesium . 
The Barriere du Combat is not the Coliseum , but people are as ferocious there as though Caesar were looking on . 
The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet , but , if Virgil haunted the Roman wine-shop , David d'Angers , Balzac and Charlet have sat at the tables of Parisian taverns . 
Paris reigns .
