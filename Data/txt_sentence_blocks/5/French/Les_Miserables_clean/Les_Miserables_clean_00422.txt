The family had no bread . 
No bread literally . 
Seven children ! 
One Sunday evening , Maubert Isabeau , the baker on the Church Square at Faverolles , was preparing to go to bed , when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop . 
He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist , through the grating and the glass .
