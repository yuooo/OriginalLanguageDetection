`` Have you the keys to those two doors ? '' 
`` No ; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent ; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church . '' 
`` When does the porter open that door ? '' 
`` Only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter , when they come to get the coffin . 
When the coffin has been taken out , the door is closed again . ''
