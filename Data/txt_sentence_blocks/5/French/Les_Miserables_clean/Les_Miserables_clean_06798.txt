Nature , as we have elsewhere said , `` looks before her . '' 
Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing . 
Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows , those who are arriving towards the light . 
Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old , and involuntary on the part of the young . 
This breach , at first insensible , increases slowly , like all separations of branches .
