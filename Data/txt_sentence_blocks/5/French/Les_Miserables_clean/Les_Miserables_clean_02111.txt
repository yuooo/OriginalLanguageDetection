For his own part , he is unacquainted with the new Paris , and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him . 
It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country , and that all has not vanished . 
So long as you go and come in your native land , you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you ; that those windows , those roofs , and those doors are nothing to you ; that those walls are strangers to you ; that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard ; that those houses , which you do not enter , are useless to you ; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones . 
Later on , when you are no longer there , you perceive that the streets are dear to you ; that you miss those roofs , those doors ; and that those walls are necessary to you , those trees are well beloved by you ; that you entered those houses which you never entered , every day , and that you have left a part of your heart , of your blood , of your soul , in those pavements . 
All those places which you no longer behold , which you may never behold again , perchance , and whose memory you have cherished , take on a melancholy charm , recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition , make the holy land visible to you , and are , so to speak , the very form of France , and you love them ; and you call them up as they are , as they were , and you persist in this , and you will submit to no change : for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother .
