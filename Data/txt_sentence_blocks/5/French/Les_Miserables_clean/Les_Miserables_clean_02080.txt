Life , henceforth , appeared to him to be full of interest ; men seemed to him good and just ; he no longer reproached any one in thought ; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man , now that this child loved him . 
He saw a whole future stretching out before him , illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light . 
The best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts . 
At times , he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly . 
This is only a personal opinion ; but , to utter our whole thought , at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette , it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well-doing .
