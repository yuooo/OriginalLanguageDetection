Nevertheless , the Bishop meditated on the subject , and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention , and he said , `` There is a soul yonder which is lonely . '' 
And he added , deep in his own mind , `` I owe him a visit . '' 
But , let us avow it , this idea , which seemed natural at the first blush , appeared to him after a moment 's reflection , as strange , impossible , and almost repulsive . 
For , at bottom , he shared the general impression , and the old member of the Convention inspired him , without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself , with that sentiment which borders on hate , and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement . 
Still , should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil ?
