The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter , and probably did not belong in Paris , for he was ignorant as to this detail . 
When , at two o'clock , the royal carriage , surrounded by a squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace , debouched on the boulevard , after having made the turn of the Salpetriere , he appeared surprised and almost alarmed . 
There was no one but himself in this cross-lane . 
He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure , though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spying him out .
