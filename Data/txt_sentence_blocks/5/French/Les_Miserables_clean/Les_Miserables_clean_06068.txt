Can any one picture to himself such a death ? 
If being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore , what is it in a cess-pool ? 
Instead of the open air , the broad daylight , the clear horizon , those vast sounds , those free clouds whence rains life , instead of those barks descried in the distance , of that hope under all sorts of forms , of probable passers-by , of succor possible up to the very last moment , -- instead of all this , deafness , blindness , a black vault , the inside of a tomb already prepared , death in the mire beneath a cover ! 
slow suffocation by filth , a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutches you by the throat ; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle ; slime instead of the strand , sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane , dung in place of the ocean ! 
And to shout , to gnash one 's teeth , and to writhe , and to struggle , and to agonize , with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all , over one 's head !
