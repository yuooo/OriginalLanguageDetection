Carriages were going and coming . 
A squadron of magnificent body-guards , with their clarions at their head , were descending the Avenue de Neuilly ; the white flag , showing faintly rosy in the setting sun , floated over the dome of the Tuileries . 
The Place de la Concorde , which had become the Place Louis XV .

Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon , which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817 .
