One would have said that , while desirous of reaching his destination , he feared the moment when he should be close at hand . 
When only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened , to such a degree that , at times , one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all . 
The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole . 
Whatever time he spent on arriving , he was obliged to arrive at last ; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire ; then he halted , he trembled , he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house , and gazed into that street , and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible , and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him . 
Then a tear , which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids , and had become large enough to fall , trickled down his cheek , and sometimes stopped at his mouth .
