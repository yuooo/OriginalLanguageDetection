It was with this full power , and the conviction that she was doing right , that the superintendent had instituted the suit , judged , condemned , and executed Fantine . 
As regards the fifty francs , she had given them from a fund which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes , and for giving assistance to the workwomen , and of which she rendered no account . 
Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood ; she went from house to house . 
No one would have her . 
She could not leave town .
