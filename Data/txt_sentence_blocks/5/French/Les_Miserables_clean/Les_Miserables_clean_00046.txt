One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral : -- `` My very dear brethren , my good friends , there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in France which have but three openings ; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings , the door and one window ; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening , the door . 
And this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows . 
Just put poor families , old women and little children , in those buildings , and behold the fevers and maladies which result !
