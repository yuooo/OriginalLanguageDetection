This incident attracted a crowd . 
Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word , Matin -LRB- the jade -RRB- , backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip , when the jade fell , never to rise again . 
On hearing the hubbub made by the passersby , Tholomyes ' merry auditors turned their heads , and Tholomyes took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe : -- `` Elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses -LSB- 3 -RSB- Ont le meme destin ; Et , rosse , elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses , L'espace d'un matin ! '' 
-LSB- 3 -RSB- She belonged to that circle where cuckoos and carriages share the same fate ; and a jade herself , she lived , as jades live , for the space of a morning -LRB- or jade -RRB- . 
`` Poor horse ! ''
