It happened , that at precisely that moment , as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against Thenardier in the matter of his daughters , Eponine and Azelma were released . 
When Eponine came out , Magnon , who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes , handed her Brujon 's note to Babet , charging her to look into the matter . 
Eponine went to the Rue Plumet , recognized the gate and the garden , observed the house , spied , lurked , and , a few days later , brought to Magnon , who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce , a biscuit , which Magnon transmitted to Babet 's mistress in the Salpetriere . 
A biscuit , in the shady symbolism of prisons , signifies : Nothing to be done . 
So that in less than a week from that time , as Brujon and Babet met in the circle of La Force , the one on his way to the examination , the other on his way from it : -- `` Well ? ''
