Arms are lost . 
A dizzy multitude fills the roads , the paths , the bridges , the plains , the hills , the valleys , the woods , encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men . 
Shouts despair , knapsacks and guns flung among the rye , passages forced at the point of the sword , no more comrades , no more officers , no more generals , an inexpressible terror . 
Zieten putting France to the sword at its leisure . 
Lions converted into goats .
