Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect . 
The stars had disappeared , heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds . 
A black sky rested on these dead streets , as though an immense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb . 
While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events , while youth , the secret associations , the schools , in the name of principles , and the middle classes , in the name of interests , were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together , clasping and throwing each other , while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis , far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter , in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent Paris , the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar . 
A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of God , which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise , which comes both from below like the voice of the lion , and from on high like the voice of the thunder .
