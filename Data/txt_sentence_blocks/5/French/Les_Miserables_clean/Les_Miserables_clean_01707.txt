He was a cuirassier , an officer , and even an officer of considerable rank ; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass ; this officer no longer possessed a helmet . 
A furious sword-cut had scarred his face , where nothing was discernible but blood . 
However , he did not appear to have any broken limbs , and , by some happy chance , if that word is permissible here , the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed . 
His eyes were still closed . 
On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor .
