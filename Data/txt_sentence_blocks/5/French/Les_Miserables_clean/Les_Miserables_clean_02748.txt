A BIT OF HISTORY At the epoch , nearly contemporary by the way , when the action of this book takes place , there was not , as there is to-day , a policeman at the corner of every street -LRB- a benefit which there is no time to discuss here -RRB- ; stray children abounded in Paris . 
The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period , by the police patrols , in unenclosed lands , in houses in process of construction , and under the arches of the bridges . 
One of these nests , which has become famous , produced `` the swallows of the bridge of Arcola . '' 
This is , moreover , the most disastrous of social symptoms . 
All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child .
