-- THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE MARIUS INDIGENT Life became hard for Marius . 
It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch . 
He ate of that terrible , inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrage ; that is to say , he endured great hardships and privations . 
A terrible thing it is , containing days without bread , nights without sleep , evenings without a candle , a hearth without a fire , weeks without work , a future without hope , a coat out at the elbows , an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls , a door which one finds locked on one at night because one 's rent is not paid , the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man , the sneers of neighbors , humiliations , dignity trampled on , work of whatever nature accepted , disgusts , bitterness , despondency . 
Marius learned how all this is eaten , and how such are often the only things which one has to devour .
