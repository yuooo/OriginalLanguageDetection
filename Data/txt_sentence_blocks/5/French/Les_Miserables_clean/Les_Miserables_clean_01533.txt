A detail to be noted . 
There was in the English infantry , particularly in Kempt 's brigade , a great many raw recruits . 
These young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry ; their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma ; they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers : the soldier skirmisher , left somewhat to himself , becomes , so to speak , his own general . 
These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and fury . 
This novice of an infantry had dash .
