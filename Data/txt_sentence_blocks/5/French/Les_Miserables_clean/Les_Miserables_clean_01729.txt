What is the devil 's treasure ? 
A sou , sometimes a crown-piece , a stone , a skeleton , a bleeding body , sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio , sometimes nothing . 
This is what Tryphon 's verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious : -- `` Fodit , et in fossa thesauros condit opaca , As , nummas , lapides , cadaver , simulacra , nihilque . '' 
It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with bullets , sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn , which has evidently served the devil . 
Tryphon does not record these two finds , since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century , and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon 's time , and cards before the time of Charles VI .
