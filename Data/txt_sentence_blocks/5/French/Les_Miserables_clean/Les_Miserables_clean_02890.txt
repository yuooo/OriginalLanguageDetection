The Cardinal de Cl ****** T ******* had been brought to Madame de T. 's by his most intimate friend , M. de Roquelaure , former Bishop of Senlis , and one of the Forty . 
M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy ; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings , the curious could , on every Tuesday , contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis , usually standing erect , freshly powdered , in violet hose , with his back turned to the door , apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar . 
All these ecclesiastics , though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen , added to the gravity of the T. salon , whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France , the Marquis de Vib **** , the Marquis de Tal *** , the Marquis de Herb ******* , the Vicomte Damb *** , and the Duc de Val ******** . 
This Duc de Val ******** , although Prince de Mon *** , that is to say a reigning prince abroad , had so high an idea of France and its peerage , that he viewed everything through their medium . 
It was he who said : `` The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome ; the lords are the peers of France of England . ''
