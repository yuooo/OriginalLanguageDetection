He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh , which was particularly dangerous . 
His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes . 
He had professional aphorisms , which he inserted into his wife 's mind . 
`` The duty of the inn-keeper , '' he said to her one day , violently , and in a low voice , `` is to sell to the first comer , stews , repose , light , fire , dirty sheets , a servant , lice , and a smile ; to stop passers-by , to empty small purses , and to honestly lighten heavy ones ; to shelter travelling families respectfully : to shave the man , to pluck the woman , to pick the child clean ; to quote the window open , the window shut , the chimney-corner , the arm-chair , the chair , the ottoman , the stool , the feather-bed , the mattress and the truss of straw ; to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror , and to put a price on it ; and , by five hundred thousand devils , to make the traveller pay for everything , even for the flies which his dog eats ! '' 
This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded -- a hideous and terrible team .
