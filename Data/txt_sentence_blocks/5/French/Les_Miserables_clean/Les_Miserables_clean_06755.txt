One afternoon , -- it was on one of those early days in April , already warm and fresh , the moment of the sun 's great gayety , the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking , the hawthorn was on the point of budding , a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls , snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones , amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies , and buttercups , the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance , the wind , that minstrel of the eternal wedding , was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand , auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide , -- Marius said to Cosette : -- `` We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet . 
Let us go thither . 
We must not be ungrateful . '' 
-- And away they flitted , like two swallows towards the spring . 
This garden of the Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn .
