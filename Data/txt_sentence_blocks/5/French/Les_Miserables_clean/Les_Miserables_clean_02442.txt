Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent , he had heard nothing of M. sur M. , and he knew nothing of what had taken place there . 
Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions ; and besides , Fauchelevent said to himself : `` One does not question a saint . '' 
M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent 's eyes . 
Only , from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall , the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times , and that he was pursued by his creditors ; or that he had compromised himself in some political affair , and was in hiding ; which last did not displease Fauchelevent , who , like many of our peasants of the North , had an old fund of Bonapartism about him . 
While in hiding , M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge , and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there .
