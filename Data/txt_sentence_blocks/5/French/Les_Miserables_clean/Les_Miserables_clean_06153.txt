As for himself , so far as he was personally concerned , all was over ; he had been seized by Javert and had not resisted ; any other man than himself in like situation would , perhaps , have had some vague thoughts connected with the rope which Thenardier had given him , and of the bars of the first cell that he should enter ; but , let us impress it upon the reader , after the Bishop , there had existed in Jean Valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence , even when directed against himself . 
Suicide , that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may contain , in a measure , the death of the soul , was impossible to Jean Valjean .
