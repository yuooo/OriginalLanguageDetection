`` Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker , '' thought Marius . 
Had Marius been a little more learned in this line , he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker , certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock , and others which will cut or slice , the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants . 
The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius . 
The brazier being concealed , the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle ; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow . 
There was something indescribably calm , threatening , and hideous about this chamber .
