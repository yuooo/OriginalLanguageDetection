They are almost unconscious , and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration . 
They have two mothers , both step-mothers , ignorance and misery . 
They have a guide , necessity ; and for all forms of satisfaction , appetite . 
They are brutally voracious , that is to say , ferocious , not after the fashion of the tyrant , but after the fashion of the tiger . 
From suffering these spectres pass to crime ; fatal affiliation , dizzy creation , logic of darkness .
