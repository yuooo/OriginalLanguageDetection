Bruneseau had given the impulse , but the cholera was required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on . 
It is surprising to say , for example , that in 1821 , a part of the belt sewer , called the Grand Canal , as in Venice , still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky , in the Rue des Gourdes . 
It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth . 
The three absorbing wells , of the Combat , the Cunette , and Saint-Mande , with their discharging mouths , their apparatus , their cesspools , and their depuratory branches , only date from 1836 . 
The intestinal sewer of Paris has been made over anew , and , as we have said , it has been extended more than tenfold within the last quarter of a century .
