As for the chance episcopal perquisites , the fees for marriage bans , dispensations , private baptisms , sermons , benedictions , of churches or chapels , marriages , etc. , the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity , since he bestowed them on the needy . 
After a time , offerings of money flowed in . 
Those who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel 's door , -- the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit . 
In less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress . 
Considerable sums of money passed through his hands , but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life , or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities .
