This hall , which was tolerably remote from the cafe , with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor , had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres . 
There they smoked and drank , and gambled and laughed . 
There they conversed in very loud tones about everything , and in whispers of other things . 
An old map of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall , -- a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent . 
The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students , who were on cordial terms with the working classes .
