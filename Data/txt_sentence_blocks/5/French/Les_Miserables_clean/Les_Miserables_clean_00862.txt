There exist beings who , for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas , which are , moreover , of no consequence whatever to them , spend more money , waste more time , take more trouble , than would be required for ten good actions , and that gratuitously , for their own pleasure , without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity . 
They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days ; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets , under alley-way doors at night , in cold and rain ; they will bribe errand-porters , they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy , buy a waiting-maid , suborn a porter . 
Why ? 
For no reason . 
A pure passion for seeing , knowing , and penetrating into things .
