Many flags had been lost , one from Alten 's division , and one from the battalion of Lunenburg , carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts . 
The Scotch Grays no longer existed ; Ponsonby 's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces . 
That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers of Travers ; out of twelve hundred horses , six hundred remained ; out of three lieutenant-colonels , two lay on the earth , -- Hamilton wounded , Mater slain . 
Ponsonby had fallen , riddled by seven lance-thrusts . 
Gordon was dead .
