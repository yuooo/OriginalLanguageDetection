-- MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny . 
He wished to die ; the opportunity presented itself ; he knocked at the door of the tomb , a hand in the darkness offered him the key . 
These melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair , are tempting . 
Marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass , emerged from the garden , and said : `` I will go . '' 
Mad with grief , no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain , incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love , overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair , he had but one desire remaining , to make a speedy end of all .
