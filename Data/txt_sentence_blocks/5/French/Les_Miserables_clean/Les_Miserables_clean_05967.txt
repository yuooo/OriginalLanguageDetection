The processes of disinfection were , at that epoch , extremely rudimentary . 
Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network , when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further . 
The operation was complicated ; the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning ; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time , to proceed ; to note the entrances of water , to count the gratings and the vents , to lay out in detail the branches , to indicate the currents at the point where they parted , to define the respective bounds of the divers basins , to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer , to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain , and the width , at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom , in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water-entrance , either of the bottom of the arch , or on the soil of the street . 
They advanced with toil . 
The lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere .
