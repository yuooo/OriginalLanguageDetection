The Jehovah hypothesis tires me , Bishop . 
It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people , whose reasoning is hollow . 
Down with that great All , which torments me ! 
Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace ! 
Between you and me , and in order to empty my sack , and make confession to my pastor , as it behooves me to do , I will admit to you that I have good sense .
