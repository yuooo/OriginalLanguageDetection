On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the claws of the Thenardiers , he returned to Paris . 
He re-entered it at nightfall , with the child , by way of the Barrier Monceaux . 
There he entered a cabriolet , which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire . 
There he got out , paid the coachman , took Cosette by the hand , and together they directed their steps through the darkness , -- through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere , towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital . 
The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette .
