These two creatures were resplendent . 
They had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment , at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy . 
They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire ; they were forty years old taken together . 
It was marriage sublimated ; these two children were two lilies . 
They did not see each other , they did not contemplate each other .
