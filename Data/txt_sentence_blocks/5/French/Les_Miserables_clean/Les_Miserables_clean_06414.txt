It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather , a fairy spectacle , with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of the bridal pair , a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door ; but it had been sweet and smiling . 
The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day . 
France had not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off one 's wife , of fleeing , on coming out of church , of hiding oneself with shame from one 's happiness , and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song of Songs . 
People had not yet grasped to the full the chastity , exquisiteness , and decency of jolting their paradise in a posting-chaise , of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs , of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn , and of leaving behind them , in a commonplace chamber , at so much a night , the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tete-a-tete of the conductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn . 
In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living , the mayor and his scarf , the priest and his chasuble , the law and God no longer suffice ; they must be eked out by the Postilion de Lonjumeau ; a blue waistcoat turned up with red , and with bell buttons , a plaque like a vantbrace , knee-breeches of green leather , oaths to the Norman horses with their tails knotted up , false galloons , varnished hat , long powdered locks , an enormous whip and tall boots .
