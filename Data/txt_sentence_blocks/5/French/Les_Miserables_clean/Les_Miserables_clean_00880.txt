When she was in the street , she divined that people turned round behind her , and pointed at her ; every one stared at her and no one greeted her ; the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind . 
It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns . 
In Paris , at least , no one knows you , and this obscurity is a garment . 
Oh ! 
how she would have liked to betake herself to Paris !
