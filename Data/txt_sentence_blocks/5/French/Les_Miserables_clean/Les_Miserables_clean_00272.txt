That which enlightened this man was his heart . 
His wisdom was made of the light which comes from there . 
No systems ; many works . 
Abstruse speculations contain vertigo ; no , there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses . 
The apostle may be daring , but the bishop must be timid .
