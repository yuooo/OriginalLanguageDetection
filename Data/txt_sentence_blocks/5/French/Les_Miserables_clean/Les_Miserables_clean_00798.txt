It had been observed that , ever since his arrival at M. sur M. . 
his language had grown more polished , more choice , and more gentle with every passing year . 
He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls , but he rarely made use of it . 
When he did happen to do so , his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror . 
He never killed an inoffensive animal .
