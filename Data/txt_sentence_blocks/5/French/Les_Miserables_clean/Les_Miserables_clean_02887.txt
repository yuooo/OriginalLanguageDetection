These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child 's mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart , and when they were all there , seated in a circle around a dying fire , sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green , with their severe profiles , their gray or white hair , their long gowns of another age , whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished , dropping , at rare intervals , words which were both majestic and severe , little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes , in the conviction that he beheld not women , but patriarchs and magi , not real beings , but phantoms . 
With these phantoms , priests were sometimes mingled , frequenters of this ancient salon , and some gentlemen ; the Marquis de Sass **** , private secretary to Madame de Berry , the Vicomte de Val *** , who published , under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine , monorhymed odes , the Prince de Beauff ******* , who , though very young , had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife , whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows , the Marquis de C ***** d' E ****** , the man in all France who best understood `` proportioned politeness , '' the Comte d'Am ***** , the kindly man with the amiable chin , and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy , a pillar of the library of the Louvre , called the King 's cabinet , M. de Port-de-Guy , bald , and rather aged than old , was wont to relate that in 1793 , at the age of sixteen , he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian , the Bishop of Mirepoix , also refractory , but as a priest , while he was so in the capacity of a soldier . 
This was at Toulon . 
Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day ; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses , and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck , which was dry in the morning and wet at night . 
These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T. 's salon , and by dint of cursing Marat , they applauded Trestaillon .
