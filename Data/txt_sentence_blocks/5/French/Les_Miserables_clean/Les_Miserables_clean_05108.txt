Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the group . 
Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun , Combeferre the gun of a National Guard bearing the number of his legion , and in his belt , two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen , Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket , Bahorel a rifle ; Courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane . 
Feuilly , with a naked sword in his hand , marched at their head shouting : `` Long live Poland ! '' 
They reached the Quai Morland . 
Cravatless , hatless , breathless , soaked by the rain , with lightning in their eyes .
