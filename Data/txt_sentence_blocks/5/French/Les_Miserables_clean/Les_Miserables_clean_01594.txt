The cuirassiers , relatively few in number , and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine , had almost the whole English army against them , but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten .

Wellington perceived it , and thought of his cavalry . 
Had Napoleon at that same moment thought of his infantry , he would have won the battle . 
This forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake .
