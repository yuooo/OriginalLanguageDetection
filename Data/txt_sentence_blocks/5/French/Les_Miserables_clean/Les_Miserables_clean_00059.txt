A tragic event occurred at D -- A man was condemned to death for murder . 
He was a wretched fellow , not exactly educated , not exactly ignorant , who had been a mountebank at fairs , and a writer for the public . 
The town took a great interest in the trial . 
On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man , the chaplain of the prison fell ill . 
A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments .
