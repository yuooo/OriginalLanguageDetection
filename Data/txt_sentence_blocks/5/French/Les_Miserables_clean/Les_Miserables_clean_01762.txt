In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens : it was only a village in the forest . 
Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there , to be sure , which were recognizable by their grand air , their balconies in twisted iron , and their long windows , whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters ; but Montfermeil was none the less a village . 
Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet ; it was a peaceful and charming place , which was not on the road to anywhere : there people lived , and cheaply , that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy ; only , water was rare there , on account of the elevation of the plateau . 
It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance ; the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there . 
The other end , which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of Chelles , found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope , near the road to Chelles , about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil .
