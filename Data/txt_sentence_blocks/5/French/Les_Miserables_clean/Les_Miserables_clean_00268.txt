Nevertheless , it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed , and after the two women had retired . 
It seemed to be a sort of rite with him , to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens . 
Sometimes , if the two old women were not asleep , they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night . 
He was there alone , communing with himself , peaceful , adoring , comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether , moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of God , opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown . 
At such moments , while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume , illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night , as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation , he could not have told himself , probably , what was passing in his spirit ; he felt something take its flight from him , and something descend into him .
