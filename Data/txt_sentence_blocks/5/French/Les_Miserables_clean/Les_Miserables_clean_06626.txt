`` By the way , '' said Cosette , `` I have opened my window , a flock of pierrots has arrived in the garden , -- Birds , not maskers . 
To-day is Ash-Wednesday ; but not for the birds . '' 
`` I tell you that we are talking business , go , my little Cosette , leave us alone for a moment . 
We are talking figures . 
That will bore you . ''
