Courage , and onward ! 
Citizens , whither are we going ? 
To science made government , to the force of things become the sole public force , to the natural law , having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence , to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day . 
We are advancing to the union of peoples ; we are advancing to the unity of man . 
No more fictions ; no more parasites .
