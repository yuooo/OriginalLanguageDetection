The point of support , thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment , was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement , which had bent but had not given way , and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece . 
Well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness . 
This fragment of the vaulting , partly submerged , but solid , was a veritable inclined plane , and , once on this plane , he was safe . 
Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire . 
As he emerged from the water , he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees .
