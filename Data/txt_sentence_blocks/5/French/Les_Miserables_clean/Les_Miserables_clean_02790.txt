The dawn dares when it rises . 
To attempt , to brave , to persist , to persevere , to be faithful to one 's self , to grasp fate bodily , to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us , now to affront unjust power , again to insult drunken victory , to hold one 's position , to stand one 's ground ; that is the example which nations need , that is the light which electrifies them . 
The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne 's short pipe . 
THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE As for the Parisian populace , even when a man grown , it is always the street Arab ; to paint the child is to paint the city ; and it is for that reason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow . 
It is in the faubourgs , above all , we maintain , that the Parisian race appears ; there is the pure blood ; there is the true physiognomy ; there this people toils and suffers , and suffering and toil are the two faces of man .
