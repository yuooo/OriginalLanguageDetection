At the end of this street , which was very short , he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles by a tall row of houses , and he would have thought himself in a blind alley , had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape . 
This was the Rue Mondetour , which on one side ran into the Rue de Precheurs , and on the other into the Rue du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie . 
At the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac , at the angle of the cutting on the right , there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest , and which formed a sort of cape in the street . 
It is in this house , of two stories only , that an illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before . 
This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old Theophilus described in the following couplet : -- La branle le squelette horrible D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit .
