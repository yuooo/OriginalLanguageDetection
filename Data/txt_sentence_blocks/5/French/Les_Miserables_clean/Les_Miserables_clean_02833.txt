And this he did . 
He had had a brother who was a priest , and who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years , and had died at seventy-nine . 
`` I lost him young , '' said he . 
This brother , of whom but little memory remains , was a peaceable miser , who , being a priest , thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met , but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous , thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise . 
As for M. Gillenormand the elder , he never haggled over his alms-giving , but gave gladly and nobly .
