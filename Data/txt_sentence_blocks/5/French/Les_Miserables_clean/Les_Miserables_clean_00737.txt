We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes . 
Let us confine ourselves to saying , that , twenty years later , under King Louis Philippe , he was a great provincial lawyer , wealthy and influential , a wise elector , and a very severe juryman ; he was still a man of pleasure . 
Towards the middle of the day , after having , from time to time , for the sake of resting herself , travelled , for three or four sous a league , in what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris , the `` little suburban coach service , '' Fantine found herself at Montfermeil , in the alley Boulanger . 
As she passed the Thenardier hostelry , the two little girls , blissful in the monster swing , had dazzled her in a manner , and she had halted in front of that vision of joy . 
Charms exist .
