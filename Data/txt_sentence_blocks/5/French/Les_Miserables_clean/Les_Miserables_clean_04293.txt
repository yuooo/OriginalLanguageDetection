Jean Valjean 's inclination led him , as we have seen , to the least frequented spots , to solitary nooks , to forgotten places . 
There then existed , in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris , a sort of poor meadows , which were almost confounded with the city , where grew in summer sickly grain , and which , in autumn , after the harvest had been gathered , presented the appearance , not of having been reaped , but peeled . 
Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields . 
Cosette was not bored there . 
It meant solitude to him and liberty to her .
