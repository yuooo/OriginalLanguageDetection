Below , by the lights of the torch , which was thrust between the paving-stones , this head could be vaguely distinguished . 
Nothing could be stranger , in that sombre and uncertain gleam , than that livid , motionless , astonished face , with its bristling hair , its eyes fixed and staring , and its yawning mouth , bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity . 
One would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die . 
A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head , descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor , where it stopped . 
THE FLAG : ACT FIRST As yet , nothing had come .
