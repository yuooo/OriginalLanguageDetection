He met , in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des Invalides , a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor , which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair . 
Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair , and scrutinized the man , who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation . 
Strange to say , he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc . 
The hair was the same , also the profile , so far as the cap permitted a view of it , the mien identical , only more depressed . 
But why these workingman 's clothes ?
