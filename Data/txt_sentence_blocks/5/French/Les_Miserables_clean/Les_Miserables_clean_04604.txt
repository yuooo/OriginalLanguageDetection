When one entered from the north end , one had on one 's left the four dormer-windows , on one 's right , facing the windows , at regular intervals , four square , tolerably vast cages , separated by narrow passages , built of masonry to about the height of the elbow , and the rest , up to the roof , of iron bars . 
Thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of the 3d of February . 
No one was ever able to discover how , and by what connivance , he succeeded in procuring , and secreting a bottle of wine , invented , so it is said , by Desrues , with which a narcotic is mixed , and which the band of the Endormeurs , or Sleep-compellers , rendered famous . 
There are , in many prisons , treacherous employees , half-jailers , half-thieves , who assist in escapes , who sell to the police an unfaithful service , and who turn a penny whenever they can . 
On that same night , then , when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost children , Brujon and Guelemer , who knew that Babet , who had escaped that morning , was waiting for them in the street as well as Montparnasse , rose softly , and with the nail which Brujon had found , began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood .
