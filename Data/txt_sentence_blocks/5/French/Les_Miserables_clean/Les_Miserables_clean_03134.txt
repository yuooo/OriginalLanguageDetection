Brutus was in love with the one , Nero with the other . 
All history is nothing but wearisome repetition . 
One century is the plagiarist of the other . 
The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna ; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water . 
I do n't attach much importance to victory .
