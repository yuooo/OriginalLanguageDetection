One overflows with serenity , with gayety , with ecstasy ; one is a radiance amid the night . 
And there are a thousand little cares . 
Nothings , which are enormous in that void . 
The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you , and supplying the vanished universe to you . 
One is caressed with the soul .
