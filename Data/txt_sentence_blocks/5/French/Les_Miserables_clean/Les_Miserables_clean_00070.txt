Nevertheless , it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution . 
M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying .

He understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love , of the mother who had lost her child .
