Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine , and named Madame Magloire , who , after having been the servant of M. le Cure , now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur . 
Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long , pale , thin , gentle creature ; she realized the ideal expressed by the word `` respectable '' ; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable . 
She had never been pretty ; her whole life , which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds , had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency ; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness . 
What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity ; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen . 
She was a soul rather than a virgin .
