Jean Valjean 's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul . 
Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts , utterly useless and foolish as they were , as often as the opportunity had presented itself , without reflecting for an instant on the result , nor on the experiences which he had already gone through . 
He escaped impetuously , like the wolf who finds his cage open . 
Instinct said to him , `` Flee ! '' 
Reason would have said , `` Remain ! ''
