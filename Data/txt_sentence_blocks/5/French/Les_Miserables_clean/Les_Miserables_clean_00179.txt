Yesterday , only my feet were cold ; to-day , the chill has ascended to my knees ; now I feel it mounting to my waist ; when it reaches the heart , I shall stop . 
The sun is beautiful , is it not ? 
I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things . 
You can talk to me ; it does not fatigue me . 
You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death .
