That done , Thenardier resumed : -- `` Address it , ` Mademoiselle Fabre , ' at your house . 
I know that you live a long distance from here , near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas , because you go to mass there every day , but I do n't know in what street . 
I see that you understand your situation . 
As you have not lied about your name , you will not lie about your address . 
Write it yourself . ''
