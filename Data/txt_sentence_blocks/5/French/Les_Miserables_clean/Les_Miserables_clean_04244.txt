In less than a month , little Cosette , in that Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone , was not only one of the prettiest , but one of the `` best dressed '' women in Paris , which means a great deal more . 
She would have liked to encounter her `` passer-by , '' to see what he would say , and to `` teach him a lesson ! '' 
The truth is , that she was ravishing in every respect , and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way . 
Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety . 
He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl , walk at the most , beheld wings sprouting on Cosette .
