`` On the day when he gave me my cross , I noticed his beast . 
It was a racing mare , perfectly white . 
Her ears were very wide apart , her saddle deep , a fine head marked with a black star , a very long neck , strongly articulated knees , prominent ribs , oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper . 
A little more than fifteen hands in height . '' 
`` A pretty horse , '' remarked the hair-dresser .
