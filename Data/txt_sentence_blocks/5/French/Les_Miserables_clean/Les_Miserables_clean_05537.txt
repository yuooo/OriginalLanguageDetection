But what was June , 1848 , at bottom ? 
A revolt of the people against itself . 
Where the subject is not lost sight of , there is no digression ; may we , then , be permitted to arrest the reader 's attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterized this insurrection . 
One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine ; the other defended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple ; those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of June , will never forget them . 
The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous ; it was three stories high , and seven hundred feet wide .
