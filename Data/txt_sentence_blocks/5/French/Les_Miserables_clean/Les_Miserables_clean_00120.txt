He was an old attorney , softened by success ; not a bad man by any means , who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons , his sons-in-law , his relations , and even to his friends , having wisely seized upon , in life , good sides , good opportunities , good windfalls . 
Everything else seemed to him very stupid . 
He was intelligent , and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus ; while he was , in reality , only a product of Pigault-Lebrun . 
He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things , and at the `` Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop . '' 
He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself , who listened to him .
