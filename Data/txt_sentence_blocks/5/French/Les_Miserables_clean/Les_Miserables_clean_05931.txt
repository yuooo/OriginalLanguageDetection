What is done with this golden manure ? 
It is swept into the abyss . 
Fleets of vessels are despatched , at great expense , to collect the dung of petrels and penguins at the South Pole , and the incalculable element of opulence which we have on hand , we send to the sea . 
All the human and animal manure which the world wastes , restored to the land instead of being cast into the water , would suffice to nourish the world . 
Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts , those tumbrils of mud which jolt through the street by night , those terrible casks of the street department , those fetid drippings of subterranean mire , which the pavements hide from you , -- do you know what they are ?
