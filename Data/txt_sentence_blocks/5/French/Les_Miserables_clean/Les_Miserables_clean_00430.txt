It is always the same story . 
These poor living beings , these creatures of God , henceforth without support , without guide , without refuge , wandered away at random , -- who even knows ? 
-- each in his own direction perhaps , and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies ; gloomy shades , into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads , in the sombre march of the human race . 
They quitted the country . 
The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them ; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them ; after a few years ' residence in the galleys , Jean Valjean himself forgot them .
