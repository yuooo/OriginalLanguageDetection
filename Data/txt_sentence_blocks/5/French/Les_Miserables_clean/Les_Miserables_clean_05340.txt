Leonidas against the stranger , Timoleon against the tyrant , which is the greater ? 
the one is the defender , the other the liberator . 
Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city 's limits without taking the object into a consideration ? 
Then note the infamy of Brutus , Marcel , Arnould von Blankenheim , Coligny , Hedgerow war ? 
War of the streets ?
