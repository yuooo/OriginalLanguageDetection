We flee in the arms of Lafitte and on the wings of Caillard . 
The Toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss , and the abyss is you , O our little beauties ! 
We return to society , to duty , to respectability , at full trot , at the rate of three leagues an hour . 
It is necessary for the good of the country that we should be , like the rest of the world , prefects , fathers of families , rural police , and councillors of state . 
Venerate us .
