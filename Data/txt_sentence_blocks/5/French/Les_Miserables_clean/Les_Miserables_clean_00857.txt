When work is abundant , when the country is rich and happy , the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing . 
It may be said , that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches , -- the cost of collecting the taxes . 
In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M. , and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villele , then Minister of Finance . 
Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither . 
No one remembered her .
