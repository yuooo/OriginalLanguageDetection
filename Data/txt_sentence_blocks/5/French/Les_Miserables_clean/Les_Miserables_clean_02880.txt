M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law . 
The colonel was `` a bandit '' to him . 
M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel , except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to `` his Baronship . '' 
It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him , under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited . 
For the Gillenormands , Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague .
