Lofty as it was , this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof , which could be seen beyond . 
This was the roof of the New Building . 
There one could descry four dormer-windows , guarded with bars ; they were the windows of the Fine-Air . 
A chimney pierced the roof ; this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories . 
The Bel-Air , that top story of the New Building , was a sort of large hall , with a Mansard roof , guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron , which were studded with enormous bolts .
