A new life gradually took possession of Cosette : the relations which marriage creates , visits , the care of the house , pleasures , great matters . 
Cosette 's pleasures were not costly , they consisted in one thing : being with Marius . 
The great occupation of her life was to go out with him , to remain with him . 
It was for them a joy that was always fresh , to go out arm in arm , in the face of the sun , in the open street , without hiding themselves , before the whole world , both of them completely alone . 
Cosette had one vexation .
