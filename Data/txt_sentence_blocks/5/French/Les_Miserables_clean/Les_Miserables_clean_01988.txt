I saw her first when she was a tiny thing . 
It is true that she costs us money ; it is true that she has her faults ; it is true that we are not rich ; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses ! 
But one must do something for the good God 's sake . 
She has neither father nor mother . 
I have brought her up .
