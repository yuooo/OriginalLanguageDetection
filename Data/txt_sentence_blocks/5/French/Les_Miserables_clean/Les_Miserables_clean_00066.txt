In fact , when the scaffold is there , all erected and prepared , it has something about it which produces hallucination . 
One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty , one may refrain from pronouncing upon it , from saying yes or no , so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one 's own eyes : but if one encounters one of them , the shock is violent ; one is forced to decide , and to take part for or against . 
Some admire it , like de Maistre ; others execrate it , like Beccaria . 
The guillotine is the concretion of the law ; it is called vindicte ; it is not neutral , and it does not permit you to remain neutral . 
He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers .
