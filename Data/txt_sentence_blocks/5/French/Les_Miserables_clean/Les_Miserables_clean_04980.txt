In the afternoon , extraordinary noises broke out in Paris . 
They resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude . 
Father Mabeuf raised his head . 
He saw a gardener passing , and inquired : -- `` What is it ? '' 
The gardener , spade on back , replied in the most unconcerned tone : -- `` It is the riots . ''
