These flowers were his occupation . 
By dint of labor , of perseverance , of attention , and of buckets of water , he had succeeded in creating after the Creator , and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature . 
He was ingenious ; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould , for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China . 
He was in his alleys from the break of day , in summer , planting , cutting , hoeing , watering , walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness , sadness , and sweetness , sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours , listening to the song of a bird in the trees , the babble of a child in a house , or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass , of which the sun made a carbuncle . 
His table was very plain , and he drank more milk than wine .
