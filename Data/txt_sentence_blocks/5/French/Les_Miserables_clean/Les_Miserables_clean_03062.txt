He had nosed about the law , but did not practise it . 
He had taken for his device : `` Never a lawyer , '' and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap . 
Every time that he passed the law-school , which rarely happened , he buttoned up his frock-coat , -- the paletot had not yet been invented , -- and took hygienic precautions . 
Of the school porter he said : `` What a fine old man ! '' 
and of the dean , M. Delvincourt : `` What a monument ! ''
