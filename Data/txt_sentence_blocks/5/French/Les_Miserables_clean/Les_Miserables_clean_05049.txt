In the centre was that famous house No. 50 , which was the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions , and which , flanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry , and on the other by a barricade of the Rue Maubuee , commanded three streets , the Rue des Arcis , the Rue Saint-Martin , and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher , which it faced . 
The barricades at right angles fell back , the one of the Rue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie , the other of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye . 
Without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of Paris , in the Marais , at Mont-Sainte-Genevieve ; one in the Rue Menilmontant , where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges ; another near the little bridge of the Hotel-Dieu made with an `` ecossais , '' which had been unharnessed and overthrown , three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police . 
At the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers , a well-dressed man distributed money to the workmen . 
At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat , a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver .
