Beyond this dense portion of the throng , in the Rue du Roule , in the Rue des Prouvaires , and in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honore , there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning . 
Only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance . 
The lanterns of that date resembled large red stars , hanging to ropes , and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider . 
These streets were not deserted . 
There could be descried piles of guns , moving bayonets , and troops bivouacking .
