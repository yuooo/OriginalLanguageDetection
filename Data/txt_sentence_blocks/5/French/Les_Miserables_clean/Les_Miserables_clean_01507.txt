A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard , so we were told . 
The orchard is terrible . 
It is in three parts ; one might almost say , in three acts . 
The first part is a garden , the second is an orchard , the third is a wood . 
These three parts have a common enclosure : on the side of the entrance , the buildings of the chateau and the farm ; on the left , a hedge ; on the right , a wall ; and at the end , a wall .
