There is something of the apocalypse in civil war , all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes , revolutions are sphinxes , and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream . 
The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of Marius , and we shall see the consequences ; they are both more and less than life . 
On emerging from a barricade , one no longer knows what one has seen there . 
One has been terrible , but one knows it not . 
One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces ; one 's head has been in the light of the future .
