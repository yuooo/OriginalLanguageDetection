As she performed this service , she was conversing with Mademoiselle Baptistine . 
A lamp stood on the table ; the table was near the fireplace . 
A wood fire was burning there . 
One can easily picture to one 's self these two women , both of whom were over sixty years of age . 
Madame Magloire small , plump , vivacious ; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle , slender , frail , somewhat taller than her brother , dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk , of the fashion of 1806 , which she had purchased at that date in Paris , and which had lasted ever since .
