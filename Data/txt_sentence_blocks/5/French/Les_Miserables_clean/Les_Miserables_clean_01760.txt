The fall was perilous . 
The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside the Orion , and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels : it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them . 
Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat ; the crowd cheered them on ; anxiety again took possession of all souls ; the man had not risen to the surface ; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple , as though he had fallen into a cask of oil : they sounded , they dived . 
In vain . 
The search was continued until the evening : they did not even find the body .
