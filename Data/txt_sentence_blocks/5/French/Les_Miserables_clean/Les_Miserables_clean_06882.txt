He was the foster-father of the poor . 
He founded hospitals , opened schools , visited the sick , dowered young girls , supported widows , and adopted orphans ; he was like the guardian angel of the country . 
He refused the cross , he was appointed Mayor . 
A liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days ; he denounced him , and had him arrested , and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte , -- I have the fact from the cashier himself , -- by means of a false signature , to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine .
