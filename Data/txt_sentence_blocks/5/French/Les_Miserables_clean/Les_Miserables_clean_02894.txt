A woman was called Madame la Generale . 
Madame la Colonelle was not entirely disused . 
The charming Madame de Leon , in memory , no doubt , of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse , preferred this appellation to her title of Princesse . 
The Marquise de Crequy was also called Madame la Colonelle . 
It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the refinement of speaking to the King in private as the King , in the third person , and never as Your Majesty , the designation of Your Majesty having been `` soiled by the usurper . ''
