The New Building contained four dormitories , one above the other , and a top story which was called the Bel-Air -LRB- FineAir -RRB- . 
A large chimney-flue , probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force , started from the groundfloor , traversed all four stories , cut the dormitories , where it figured as a flattened pillar , into two portions , and finally pierced the roof . 
Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory . 
They had been placed , by way of precaution , on the lower story . 
Chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney .
