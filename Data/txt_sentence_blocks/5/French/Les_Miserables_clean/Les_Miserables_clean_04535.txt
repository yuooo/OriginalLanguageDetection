This syllable , dig , uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase , means : `` Take care , we can no longer talk freely . '' 
There was besides , in Montparnasse 's sentence , a literary beauty which was lost upon Gavroche , that is mon dogue , ma dague et ma digue , a slang expression of the Temple , which signifies my dog , my knife , and my wife , greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century when Moliere wrote and Callot drew . 
Twenty years ago , there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the Place de la Bastille , near the basin of the canal , excavated in the ancient ditch of the fortress-prison , a singular monument , which has already been effaced from the memories of Parisians , and which deserved to leave some trace , for it was the idea of a `` member of the Institute , the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt . '' 
We say monument , although it was only a rough model . 
But this model itself , a marvellous sketch , the grandiose skeleton of an idea of Napoleon 's , which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown , on each occasion , still further from us , had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect .
