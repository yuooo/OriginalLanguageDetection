Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence . 
The first was , that he now had a horror of that house , where he had beheld , so close at hand , and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development , a social deformity which is , perhaps , even more terrible than the wicked rich man , the wicked poor man . 
The second was , that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability , and be brought in to testify against Thenardier . 
Javert thought that the young man , whose name he had forgotten , was afraid , and had fled , or perhaps , had not even returned home at the time of the ambush ; he made some efforts to find him , however , but without success . 
A month passed , then another .
