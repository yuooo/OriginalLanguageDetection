She had no longer a bed ; a rag which she called her coverlet , a mattress on the floor , and a seatless chair still remained . 
A little rosebush which she had , had dried up , forgotten , in one corner . 
In the other corner was a butter-pot to hold water , which froze in winter , and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice . 
She had lost her shame ; she lost her coquetry . 
A final sign .
