This letter , coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius ' thoughts ever since the preceding evening , was like a candle in a cellar . 
All was suddenly illuminated . 
This letter came from the same place as the other four . 
There was the same writing , the same style , the same orthography , the same paper , the same odor of tobacco . 
There were five missives , five histories , five signatures , and a single signer .
