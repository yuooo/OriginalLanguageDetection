Make use of your I while you have it . 
In truth , Bishop , I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own , and I have my philosophers . 
I do n't let myself be taken in with that nonsense . 
Of course , there must be something for those who are down , -- for the barefooted beggars , knife-grinders , and miserable wretches .
