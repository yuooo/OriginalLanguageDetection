What he had just done smacked of theft . 
At last the candle was lighted ; he leaned his elbows on the table , unfolded the paper , and read . 
In violent emotions , one does not read , one flings to the earth , so to speak , the paper which one holds , one clutches it like a victim , one crushes it , one digs into it the nails of one 's wrath , or of one 's joy ; one hastens to the end , one leaps to the beginning ; attention is at fever heat ; it takes up in the gross , as it were , the essential points ; it seizes on one point , and the rest disappears . 
In Marius ' note to Cosette , Jean Valjean saw only these words : -- `` I die . 
When thou readest this , my soul will be near thee . ''
