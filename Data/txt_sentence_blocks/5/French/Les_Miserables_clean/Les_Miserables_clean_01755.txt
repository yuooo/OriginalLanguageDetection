It anchored near the Arsenal ; it was fully equipped , and repairs were begun . 
The hull had received no damage on the starboard , but some of the planks had been unnailed here and there , according to custom , to permit of air entering the hold . 
One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident . 
The crew was busy bending the sails ; the topman , who had to take the upper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard , lost his balance ; he was seen to waver ; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a cry ; the man 's head overbalanced his body ; the man fell around the yard , with his hands outstretched towards the abyss ; on his way he seized the footrope , first with one hand , then with the other , and remained hanging from it : the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth ; the shock of his fall had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion ; the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope , like a stone in a sling . 
It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance ; not one of the sailors , all fishermen of the coast , recently levied for the service , dared to attempt it .
