When the alcove was in use , a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar . 
The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer . 
A moment later he was in his garden , walking , meditating , conteplating , his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open . 
As for the man , he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets . 
Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts , he dropped , all dressed as he was , upon the bed , where he immediately fell into a profound sleep .
