`` You know well that people refuse me . '' 
M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase , took a long look at all his books , one after another , as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice , then seized one hastily , put it in under his arm and went out . 
He returned two hours later , without anything under his arm , laid thirty sous on the table , and said : -- `` You will get something for dinner . '' 
From that moment forth , Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil , which was never more lifted , descend over the old man 's candid face .
