Two or three hours later , Boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood , carrying no longer the coffer , but a shovel and pick . 
Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass , and had not dreamed of accosting him , because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was , and armed with a pickaxe , and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him , and on perceiving that he was recognized .

But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle ; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning , and had found neither shovel nor pick . 
From this he had drawn the inference that this person , once in the forest , had dug a hole with his pick , buried the coffer , and reclosed the hole with his shovel .
