This child lived , in this absence of affection , like the pale plants which spring up in cellars . 
It did not cause him suffering , and he blamed no one . 
He did not know exactly how a father and mother should be . 
Nevertheless , his mother loved his sisters . 
We have forgotten to mention , that on the Boulevard du Temple this child was called Little Gavroche .
