That is his sort of bravery , he says . 
He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him . 
He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers , and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it . 
One must know how to understand him . 
He goes out in the rain , he walks in the water , he travels in winter .
