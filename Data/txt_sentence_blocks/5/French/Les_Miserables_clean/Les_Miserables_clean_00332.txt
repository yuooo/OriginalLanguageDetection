Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble , which , after the harvest , resemble shaved heads . 
The horizon was perfectly black . 
This was not alone the obscurity of night ; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself , and which were mounting and filling the whole sky . 
Meanwhile , as the moon was about to rise , and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight , these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch , whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth . 
The earth was thus better lighted than the sky , which produces a particularly sinister effect , and the hill , whose contour was poor and mean , was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon .
