However , he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours , the water-carrier , and would have thought no more about it . 
But , on the evening of that day , he saw , without being seen himself , as he was hidden by a large tree , `` a person who did not belong in those parts , and whom he , Boulatruelle , knew well , '' directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood . 
Translation by Thenardier : A comrade of the galleys . 
Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name . 
This person carried a package -- something square , like a large box or a small trunk .
