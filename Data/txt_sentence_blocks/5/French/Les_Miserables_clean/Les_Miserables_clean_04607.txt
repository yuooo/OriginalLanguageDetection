They fastened one end of the rope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off , flung the other over the outer wall , crossed the abyss at one bound , clung to the coping of the wall , got astride of it , let themselves slip , one after the other , along the rope , upon a little roof which touches the bath-house , pulled their rope after them , jumped down into the courtyard of the bath-house , traversed it , pushed open the porter 's wicket , beside which hung his rope , pulled this , opened the porte-cochere , and found themselves in the street . 
Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in the dark , nail in hand , and their project in their heads . 
A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse , who were prowling about the neighborhood . 
They had broken their rope in pulling it after them , and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof . 
They had sustained no other damage , however , than that of scratching nearly all the skin off their hands .
