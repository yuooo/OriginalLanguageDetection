This , sir , is what your letter prompts me to say ; I say it for you and for your country . 
If I have insisted so strongly , it is because of one phrase in your letter . 
You write : -- `` There are Italians , and they are numerous , who say : ` This book , Les Miserables , is a French book . 
It does not concern us . 
Let the French read it as a history , we read it as a romance . ' ''
