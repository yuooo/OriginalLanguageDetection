Her figure was formed , her skin had grown white , her hair was lustrous , an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes . 
The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant , like the sudden advent of daylight ; other people noticed it also , Toussaint had said so , it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken , there could no longer be any doubt of that ; she descended to the garden again , thinking herself a queen , imagining that she heard the birds singing , though it was winter , seeing the sky gilded , the sun among the trees , flowers in the thickets , distracted , wild , in inexpressible delight . 
Jean Valjean , on his side , experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart . 
In fact , he had , for some time past , been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette 's sweet face . 
The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him .
