An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said , `` There 's a girl who will come to a bad end . 
She took a lover , the first who offered , a man whom she did not love , out of bravado and with rage in her heart . 
He was a miserable scamp , a sort of mendicant musician , a lazy beggar , who beat her , and who abandoned her as she had taken him , in disgust . 
She adored her child . 
The lower she descended , the darker everything grew about her , the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart .
