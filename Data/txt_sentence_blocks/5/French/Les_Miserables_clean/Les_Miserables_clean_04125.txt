It was supposed that the messages , which had been addressed , not to houses , but to people who were waiting for them in the street , must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted . 
They were in possession of other indications ; they laid hand on the three prowlers , and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of Brujon 's machinations . 
About a week after these measures had been taken , one night , as the superintendent of the watch , who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the Batiment-Neuf , was about to drop his chestnut in the box -- this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually ; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories -- a watchman looked through the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp . 
The guardian entered , Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month , but they were not able to seize what he had written . 
The police learned nothing further about it .
