He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel , where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm . 
Then he passed to the frontier of Italy , and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert . 
Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general , and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant . 
Pontmercy was by Berthier 's side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say : `` Berthier has been cannoneer , cavalier , and grenadier . '' 
He beheld his old general , Joubert , fall at Novi , at the moment when , with uplifted sabre , he was shouting : `` Forward ! ''
