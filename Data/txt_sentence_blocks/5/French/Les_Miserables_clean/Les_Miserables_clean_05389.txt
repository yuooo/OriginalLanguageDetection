Marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long ; now it was a whirlwind . 
This whirlwind which was within him , produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away . 
It seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life . 
His two luminous months of joy and love , ending abruptly at that frightful precipice , Cosette lost to him , that barricade , M. Mabeuf getting himself killed for the Republic , himself the leader of the insurgents , -- all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare .
