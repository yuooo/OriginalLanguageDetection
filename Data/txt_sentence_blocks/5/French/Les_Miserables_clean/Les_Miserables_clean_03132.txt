Every good quality tends towards a defect ; economy borders on avarice , the generous man is next door to the prodigal , the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart ; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted ; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes ' cloak . 
Whom do you admire , the slain or the slayer , Caesar or Brutus ? 
Generally men are in favor of the slayer . 
Long live Brutus , he has slain ! 
There lies the virtue .
