Thus , against the wind , it has its cordage and its canvas ; against the water , wood ; against the rocks , its iron , brass , and lead ; against the shadows , its light ; against immensity , a needle . 
If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which , taken as a whole , constitute the ship of the line , one has only to enter one of the six-story covered construction stocks , in the ports of Brest or Toulon . 
The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glass there , as it were . 
This colossal beam is a yard ; that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the main-mast . 
Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds , it is sixty fathoms long , and its diameter at its base is three feet .
