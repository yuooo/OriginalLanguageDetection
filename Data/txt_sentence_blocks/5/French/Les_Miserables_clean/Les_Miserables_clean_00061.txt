He passed the entire day with him , forgetful of food and sleep , praying to God for the soul of the condemned man , and praying the condemned man for his own . 
He told him the best truths , which are also the most simple . 
He was father , brother , friend ; he was bishop only to bless . 
He taught him everything , encouraged and consoled him . 
The man was on the point of dying in despair .
