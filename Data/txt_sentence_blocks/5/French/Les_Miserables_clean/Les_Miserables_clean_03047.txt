It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting , he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle , and to attack it by main force and explosively ; but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually , by means of education , the inculcation of axioms , the promulgation of positive laws ; and , between two lights , his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration . 
A conflagration can create an aurora , no doubt , but why not await the dawn ? 
A volcano illuminates , but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination . 
Possibly , Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime . 
A light troubled by smoke , progress purchased at the expense of violence , only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit .
