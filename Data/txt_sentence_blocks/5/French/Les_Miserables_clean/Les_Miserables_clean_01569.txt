THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE So , on the morning of Waterloo , Napoleon was content . 
He was right ; the plan of battle conceived by him was , as we have seen , really admirable . 
The battle once begun , its very various changes , -- the resistance of Hougomont ; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte ; the killing of Bauduin ; the disabling of Foy ; the unexpected wall against which Soye 's brigade was shattered ; Guilleminot 's fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard nor powder sacks ; the miring of the batteries ; the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge ; the small effect of the bombs falling in the English lines , and there embedding themselves in the rain-soaked soil , and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud , so that the canister was turned into a splash ; the uselessness of Pire 's demonstration on Braine-l'Alleud ; all that cavalry , fifteen squadrons , almost exterminated ; the right wing of the English badly alarmed , the left wing badly cut into ; Ney 's strange mistake in massing , instead of echelonning the four divisions of the first corps ; men delivered over to grape-shot , arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep and with a frontage of two hundred ; the frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon-balls ; attacking columns disorganized ; the side-battery suddenly unmasked on their flank ; Bourgeois , Donzelot , and Durutte compromised ; Quiot repulsed ; Lieutenant Vieux , that Hercules graduated at the Polytechnic School , wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the English barricade which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels ; Marcognet 's division caught between the infantry and the cavalry , shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack , put to the sword by Ponsonby ; his battery of seven pieces spiked ; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding , in spite of the Comte d'Erlon , both Frischemont and Smohain ; the flag of the 105th taken , the flag of the 45th captured ; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre and Plancenoit ; the alarming things that had been said by prisoners ; Grouchy 's delay ; fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomont in less than an hour ; eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about La Haie-Sainte , -- all these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of battle before Napoleon , had hardly troubled his gaze and had not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty . 
Napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war ; he never added up the heart-rending details , cipher by cipher ; ciphers mattered little to him , provided that they furnished the total , victory ; he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray , since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end ; he knew how to wait , supposing himself to be out of the question , and he treated destiny as his equal : he seemed to say to fate , Thou wilt not dare . 
Composed half of light and half of shadow , Napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil .
