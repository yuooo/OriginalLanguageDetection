It had formerly been her delight , so she affirmed , to hear the loups-de-gorge -LRB- rouges-gorges -RRB- chanter dans les ogrepines -LRB- aubepines -RRB- -- to hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees . 
The hall on the first floor , where `` the restaurant '' was situated , was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools , chairs , benches , and tables , and with a crippled , lame , old billiard-table .

This room , lighted by a single narrow window , and by a lamp that was always burning , had the air of a garret .
