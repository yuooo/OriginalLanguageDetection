THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN The days that follow weddings are solitary . 
People respect the meditations of the happy pair . 
And also , their tardy slumbers , to some degree . 
The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on . 
On the morning of the 17th of February , it was a little past midday when Basque , with napkin and feather-duster under his arm , busy in setting his antechamber to rights , heard a light tap at the door .
