Such Shrove Tuesdays are no longer to be seen now-a-days . 
Everything which exists being a scattered Carnival , there is no longer any Carnival . 
The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators . 
The terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators . 
Besides the maskers , they stared at that procession -- peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps , -- of vehicles of every description , citadines , tapissieres , carioles , cabriolets marching in order , rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations , and locked into rails , as it were .
