On the afternoon following the visit of Javert , M. Madeleine went to see Fantine according to his wont . 
Before entering Fantine 's room , he had Sister Simplice summoned . 
The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary , Lazariste ladies , like all sisters of charity , bore the names of Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice . 
Sister Perpetue was an ordinary villager , a sister of charity in a coarse style , who had entered the service of God as one enters any other service . 
She was a nun as other women are cooks .
