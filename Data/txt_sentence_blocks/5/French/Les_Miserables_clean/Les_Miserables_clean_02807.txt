He was superficial , rapid , easily angered . 
He flew into a passion at everything , generally quite contrary to all reason . 
When contradicted , he raised his cane ; he beat people as he had done in the great century . 
He had a daughter over fifty years of age , and unmarried , whom he chastised severely with his tongue , when in a rage , and whom he would have liked to whip . 
She seemed to him to be eight years old .
