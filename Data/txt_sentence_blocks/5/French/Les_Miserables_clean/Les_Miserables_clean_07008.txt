In the spring , linnets warble in the trees . 
This stone is perfectly plain . 
In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb , and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man . 
No name is to be read there . 
Only , many years ago , a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines , which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust , and which are , to-day , probably effaced : Il dort .
