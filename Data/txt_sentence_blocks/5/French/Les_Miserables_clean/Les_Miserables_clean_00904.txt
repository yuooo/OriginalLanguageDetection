Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase . 
That evening she went out , and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the Rue de Paris , where the inns are situated . 
The next morning , when Marguerite entered Fantine 's room before daylight , -- for they always worked together , and in this manner used only one candle for the two , -- she found Fantine seated on her bed , pale and frozen . 
She had not lain down . 
Her cap had fallen on her knees .
