There is no blindness where there is certainty . 
Soul seeks soul , gropingly , and finds it . 
And this soul , found and tested , is a woman . 
A hand sustains you ; it is hers : a mouth lightly touches your brow ; it is her mouth : you hear a breath very near you ; it is hers . 
To have everything of her , from her worship to her pity , never to be left , to have that sweet weakness aiding you , to lean upon that immovable reed , to touch Providence with one 's hands , and to be able to take it in one 's arms , -- God made tangible , -- what bliss !
