The halt is a matter depending on the sounding-line , and not on the leadsman . 
Certainly , too , it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order , where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins , to rummage in those vague , murky waves , to follow up , to seize and to fling , still quivering , upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light , that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows . 
Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity , in the broad light of thought , of the horrible swarming of slang . 
It seems , in fact , to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool . 
One thinks one beholds a frightful , living , and bristling thicket which quivers , rustles , wavers , returns to shadow , threatens and glares .
