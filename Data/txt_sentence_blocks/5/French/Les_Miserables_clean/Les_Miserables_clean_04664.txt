Algebra , medicine , botany , have each their slang . 
The tongue which is employed on board ship , that wonderful language of the sea , which is so complete and so picturesque , which was spoken by Jean Bart , Duquesne , Suffren , and Duperre , which mingles with the whistling of the rigging , the sound of the speaking-trumpets , the shock of the boarding-irons , the roll of the sea , the wind , the gale , the cannon , is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang , which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal . 
-LSB- 40 -RSB- `` Vous trouverez dans ces potains-la , une foultitude de raisons pour que je me libertise . '' 
No doubt . 
But say what we will , this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit .
