A veteran from the neighboring barracks , who was gazing through the fence , said : `` Here is the Spring presenting arms and in full uniform . '' 
All nature was breakfasting ; creation was at table ; this was its hour ; the great blue cloth was spread in the sky , and the great green cloth on earth ; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly . 
God was serving the universal repast . 
Each creature had his pasture or his mess . 
The ring-dove found his hemp-seed , the chaffinch found his millet , the goldfinch found chickweed , the red-breast found worms , the green finch found flies , the fly found infusoriae , the bee found flowers .
