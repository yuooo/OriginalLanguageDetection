sir , '' resumed the road-mender ; `` shall I give you a piece of advice ? 
your horse is tired ; return to Tinques ; there is a good inn there ; sleep there ; you can reach Arras to-morrow . '' 
`` I must be there this evening . '' 
`` That is different ; but go to the inn all the same , and get an extra horse ; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads . '' 
He followed the road-mender 's advice , retraced his steps , and , half an hour later , he passed the same spot again , but this time at full speed , with a good horse to aid ; a stable-boy , who called himself a postilion , was seated on the shaft of the cariole .
