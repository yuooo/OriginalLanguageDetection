The vidette of the Lane des Precheurs had remained at his post , which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles . 
The Rue de la Chanvrerie , of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag , offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke . 
Each man had taken up his position for the conflict . 
Forty-three insurgents , among whom were Enjolras , Combeferre , Courfeyrac , Bossuet , Joly , Bahorel , and Gavroche , were kneeling inside the large barricade , with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier , the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop-holes , attentive , mute , ready to fire . 
Six , commanded by Feuilly , had installed themselves , with their guns levelled at their shoulders , at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe .
