You can not imagine it ; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg , she came there ; in the beginning , I did not pay much heed to her , and then , I do n't know how it came about , I fell in love with her . 
Oh ! 
how unhappy that made me ! 
Now , at last , I see her every day , at her own home , her father does not know it , just fancy , they are going away , it is in the garden that we meet , in the evening , her father means to take her to England , then I said to myself : ` I 'll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair . 
I should go mad first , I should die , I should fall ill , I should throw myself into the water .
