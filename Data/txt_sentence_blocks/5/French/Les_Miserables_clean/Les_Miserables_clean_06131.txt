Javert , after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade , had betaken himself to the prefecture of police , had rendered a verbal account to the Prefect in person in a brief audience , had then immediately gone on duty again , which implied -- the note , the reader will recollect , which had been captured on his person -- a certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Elysees , which had , for some time past , aroused the attention of the police . 
There he had caught sight of Thenardier and had followed him . 
The reader knows the rest . 
Thus it will be easily understood that that grating , so obligingly opened to Jean Valjean , was a bit of cleverness on Thenardier 's part . 
Thenardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there ; the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him ; it was necessary to fling a bone to that sleuth-hound .
