One day , her butcher , who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean , said to her : `` That 's a queer fish . '' 
She replied : `` He 's a saint . '' 
Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the Rue de Babylone . 
Unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet . 
That gate was always closed .
