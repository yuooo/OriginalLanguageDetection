Alas ! 
God gives air to men ; the law sells it to them . 
I do not blame the law , but I bless God . 
In the department of the Isere , in the Var , in the two departments of the Alpes , the Hautes , and the Basses , the peasants have not even wheelbarrows ; they transport their manure on the backs of men ; they have no candles , and they burn resinous sticks , and bits of rope dipped in pitch . 
That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphine .
