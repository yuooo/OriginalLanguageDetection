They own one goat out of every thirty that they tend . 
They make very pretty woollen cords of various colors , and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes . 
They need to be told of the good God now and then . 
What would they say to a bishop who was afraid ? 
What would they say if I did not go ? ''
