This is the mode in which the existence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged : He had passed the worst straits ; the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him . 
By dint of toil , perseverance , courage , and will , he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year . 
He had learned German and English ; thanks to Courfeyrac , who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher , Marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house . 
He drew up prospectuses , translated newspapers , annotated editions , compiled biographies , etc. ; net product , year in and year out , seven hundred francs . 
He lived on it .
