It was the collaboration of the pavement , the block of stone , the beam , the bar of iron , the rag , the scrap , the broken pane , the unseated chair , the cabbage-stalk , the tatter , the rag , and the malediction . 
It was grand and it was petty . 
It was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub . 
The mass beside the atom ; the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl , -- threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish . 
Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd .
