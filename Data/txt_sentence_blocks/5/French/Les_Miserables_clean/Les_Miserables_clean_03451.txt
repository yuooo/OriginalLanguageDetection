When I say to you that I beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all those that I shall make , is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection , and of adorning my writings with your name . 
If you deign to honor me with the most modest offering , I shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude . 
Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible , will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage . 
To Monsieur and Madame Pabourgeot , My most respectful complements , Genflot , man of letters . 
P. S. Even if it is only forty sous .
