Javert kept Marius ' pocket-book . 
A moment later , the carriage , which had descended by the inclined plane of the watering-place , was on the shore . 
Marius was laid upon the back seat , and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean . 
The door slammed , and the carriage drove rapidly away , ascending the quays in the direction of the Bastille . 
They quitted the quays and entered the streets .
