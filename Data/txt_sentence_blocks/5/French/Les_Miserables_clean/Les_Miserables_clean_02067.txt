His sister and his sister 's children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished ; he had made every effort to find them , and not having been able to find them , he had forgotten them . 
Human nature is made thus ; the other tender emotions of his youth , if he had ever had any , had fallen into an abyss . 
When he saw Cosette , when he had taken possession of her , carried her off , and delivered her , he felt his heart moved within him . 
All the passion and affection within him awoke , and rushed towards that child . 
He approached the bed , where she lay sleeping , and trembled with joy .
