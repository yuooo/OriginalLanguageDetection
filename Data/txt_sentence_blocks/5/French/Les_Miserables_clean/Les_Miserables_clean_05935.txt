A double tubular apparatus , provided with valves and sluices , sucking up and driving back , a system of elementary drainage , simple as the lungs of a man , and which is already in full working order in many communities in England , would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into our cities , and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities , and this easy exchange , the simplest in the world , would retain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away . 
People are thinking of other things . 
The process actually in use does evil , with the intention of doing good . 
The intention is good , the result is melancholy . 
Thinking to purge the city , the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars .
