It is the language which has been spoken , in France , for example , for more than four centuries , not only by a misery , but by every possible human misery . 
And then , we insist upon it , the study of social deformities and infirmities , and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy , is not a business in which choice is permitted . 
The historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events . 
The latter has the surface of civilization , the conflicts of crowns , the births of princes , the marriages of kings , battles , assemblages , great public men , revolutions in the daylight , everything on the exterior ; the other historian has the interior , the depths , the people who toil , suffer , wait , the oppressed woman , the agonizing child , the secret war between man and man , obscure ferocities , prejudices , plotted iniquities , the subterranean , the indistinct tremors of multitudes , the die-of-hunger , the counter-blows of the law , the secret evolution of souls , the go-bare-foot , the bare-armed , the disinherited , the orphans , the unhappy , and the infamous , all the forms which roam through the darkness . 
He must descend with his heart full of charity , and severity at the same time , as a brother and as a judge , to those impenetrable casemates where crawl , pell-mell , those who bleed and those who deal the blow , those who weep and those who curse , those who fast and those who devour , those who endure evil and those who inflict it .
