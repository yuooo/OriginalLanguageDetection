Thenardier was haggard , fierce , suspicious , rather menacing , yet amicable . 
There was one singular circumstance ; Thenardier 's manners were not simple ; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease ; while affecting an air of mystery , he spoke low ; from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth , and muttered , `` hush ! '' 
It was difficult to divine why . 
There was no one there except themselves . 
Jean Valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook , not very far off , and that Thenardier did not care to share with them .
