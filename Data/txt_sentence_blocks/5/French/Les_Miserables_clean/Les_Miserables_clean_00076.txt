One would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it . 
The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun . 
He bestowed his blessing , and they blessed him . 
They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything . 
Here and there he halted , accosted the little boys and girls , and smiled upon the mothers .
