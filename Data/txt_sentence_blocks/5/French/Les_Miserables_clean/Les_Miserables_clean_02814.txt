M. Gillenormand 's attire was not the habit of Louis XIV . 
nor yet that of Louis XVI. ; it was that of the Incroyables of the Directory . 
He had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions . 
His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers , a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons . 
With this he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes .
