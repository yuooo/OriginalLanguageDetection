The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts . 
When he saw the door of a church hung in black , he entered : he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings . 
Widowhood and the grief of others attracted him , because of his great gentleness ; he mingled with the friends clad in mourning , with families dressed in black , with the priests groaning around a coffin . 
He seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world . 
With his eyes fixed on heaven , he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite , those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death .
