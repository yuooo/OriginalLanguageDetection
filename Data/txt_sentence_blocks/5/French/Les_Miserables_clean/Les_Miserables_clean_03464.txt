I bless you , young man . 
My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days , four persons and my spouse ill . 
If I am not deseaved in my opinion , I think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor . 
I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity , -- Jondrette . 
P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders , dear Monsieur Marius .
