Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the factory , whether the mayor had returned , and if he would not come to the infirmary soon . 
The girl returned in a few minutes . 
Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts . 
The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone , that the mayor had set out that morning before six o'clock , in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse , cold as the weather was ; that he had gone alone , without even a driver ; that no one knew what road he had taken ; that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras ; that others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris . 
That when he went away he had been very gentle , as usual , and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night .
