You would have seen ! 
Mr. Mayor , I must treat myself as I would treat any other man . 
When I have subdued malefactors , when I have proceeded with vigor against rascals , I have often said to myself , ` If you flinch , if I ever catch you in fault , you may rest at your ease ! ' 
I have flinched , I have caught myself in a fault . 
So much the worse !
