In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand , a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties , had finally hunted up Marius ' abode . 
One morning , on his return from the law-school , Marius found a letter from his aunt , and the sixty pistoles , that is to say , six hundred francs in gold , in a sealed box . 
Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt , with a respectful letter , in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs .
