Odd numerical coincidence , -- twenty-six battalions rode to meet twenty-six battalions . 
Behind the crest of the plateau , in the shadow of the masked battery , the English infantry , formed into thirteen squares , two battalions to the square , in two lines , with seven in the first line , six in the second , the stocks of their guns to their shoulders , taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing , waited , calm , mute , motionless . 
They did not see the cuirassiers , and the cuirassiers did not see them . 
They listened to the rise of this flood of men . 
They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse , the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot , the jingling of the cuirasses , the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing .
