This graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child 's play , which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household , which raised poverty into dignity . 
Madame Magloire understood the remark , went out without saying a word , and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth , symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table .
