At a certain depth , the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization , the limit breathable by man has been passed ; a beginning of monsters is possible . 
The descending scale is a strange one ; and each one of the rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold , and where one encounters one of these workmen , sometimes divine , sometimes misshapen . 
Below John Huss , there is Luther ; below Luther , there is Descartes ; below Descartes , there is Voltaire ; below Voltaire , there is Condorcet ; below Condorcet , there is Robespierre ; below Robespierre , there is Marat ; below Marat there is Babeuf . 
And so it goes on . 
Lower down , confusedly , at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible , one perceives other gloomy men , who perhaps do not exist as yet .
