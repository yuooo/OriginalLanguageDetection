In order that the Revolution should take place , it does not suffice that Montesquieu should foresee it , that Diderot should preach it , that Beaumarchais should announce it , that Condorcet should calculate it , that Arouet should prepare it , that Rousseau should premeditate it ; it is necessary that Danton should dare it . 
The cry : Audacity ! 
is a Fiat lux . 
It is necessary , for the sake of the forward march of the human race , that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights . 
Daring deeds dazzle history and are one of man 's great sources of light .
