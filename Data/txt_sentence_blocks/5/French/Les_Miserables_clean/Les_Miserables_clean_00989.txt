In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs , -- one for the doctor , the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two long illnesses . 
Cosette , as we have already said , had not been ill . 
It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names . 
At the foot of the memorandum Thenardier wrote , Received on account , three hundred francs . 
M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more , and wrote , `` Make haste to bring Cosette . ''
