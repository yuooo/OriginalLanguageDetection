Many hours passed . 
The midnight mass was over , the chimes had ceased , the drinkers had taken their departure , the drinking-shop was closed , the public room was deserted , the fire extinct , the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude . 
From time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned . 
That was all ; but he had not said a word since Cosette had left the room . 
The Thenardiers alone , out of politeness and curiosity , had remained in the room .
