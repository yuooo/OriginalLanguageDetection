THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D -- , and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions , their thoughts , their feminine instincts even , which are easily alarmed , to the habits and purposes of the Bishop , without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them , we can not do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron , the friend of her childhood . 
This letter is in our possession . 
D -- , Dec. 16 , 18 -- .
