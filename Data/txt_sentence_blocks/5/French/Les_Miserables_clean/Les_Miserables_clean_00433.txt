Perhaps she did not know herself . 
Every morning she went to a printing office , No. 3 Rue du Sabot , where she was a folder and stitcher . 
She was obliged to be there at six o'clock in the morning -- long before daylight in winter . 
In the same building with the printing office there was a school , and to this school she took her little boy , who was seven years old . 
But as she entered the printing office at six , and the school only opened at seven , the child had to wait in the courtyard , for the school to open , for an hour -- one hour of a winter night in the open air !
