All that Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was a little more rain , and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble .

Why ? 
Because the ground was wet . 
The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before they could manoeuvre .
