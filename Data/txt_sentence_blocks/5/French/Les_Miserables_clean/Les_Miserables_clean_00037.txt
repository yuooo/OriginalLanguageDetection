To villages where he found no schoolmaster , he quoted once more the people of Queyras : `` Do you know how they manage ? '' 
he said . 
`` Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher , they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley , who make the round of the villages , spending a week in this one , ten days in that , and instruct them . 
These teachers go to the fairs . 
I have seen them there .
