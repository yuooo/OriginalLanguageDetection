The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions , horse races , hunting , dogs , tobacco , gaming , good repasts , and all the rest of it ; occupations for the baser side of the soul , at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides . 
The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty ; he eats ; when he has eaten , he has nothing more but meditation . 
He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis ; he gazes at the sky , space , the stars , flowers , children , the humanity among which he is suffering , the creation amid which he beams . 
He gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul , he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God . 
He dreams , he feels himself great ; he dreams on , and feels himself tender .
