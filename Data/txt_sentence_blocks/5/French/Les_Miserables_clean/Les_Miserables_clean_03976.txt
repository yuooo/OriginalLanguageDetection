Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand . 
After the Fieschi machine , he exclaimed : `` What a pity that I was not wounded ! 
Then I might have pardoned ! '' 
On another occasion , alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry , he wrote in connection with a political criminal , who is one of the most generous figures of our day : `` His pardon is granted ; it only remains for me to obtain it . '' 
Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX .
