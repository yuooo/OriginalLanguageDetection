We are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant . 
Here , then , is the superstition of Montfermeil : it is thought that the devil , from time immemorial , has selected the forest as a hiding-place for his treasures . 
Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall , in secluded nooks of the forest , a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper , wearing wooden shoes , clad in trousers and a blouse of linen , and recognizable by the fact , that , instead of a cap or hat , he has two immense horns on his head . 
This ought , in fact , to render him recognizable . 
This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole .
