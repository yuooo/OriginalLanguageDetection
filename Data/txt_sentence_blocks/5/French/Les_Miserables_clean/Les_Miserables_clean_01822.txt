It was a narrow , natural basin , hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil , about two feet deep , surrounded with moss and with those tall , crimped grasses which are called Henry IV . 
's frills , and paved with several large stones . 
A brook ran out of it , with a tranquil little noise . 
Cosette did not take time to breathe . 
It was very dark , but she was in the habit of coming to this spring .
