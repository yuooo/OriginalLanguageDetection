That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him , and from remaining with him ! 
Beloved by Cosette , he felt that he was healed , rested , appeased , loaded with benefits , recompensed , crowned . 
Beloved by Cosette , it was well with him ! 
He asked nothing more ! 
Had any one said to him : `` Do you want anything better ? ''
