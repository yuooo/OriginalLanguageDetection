The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers . 
The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m. , to receive coal , having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival . 
Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal , and then , accompanied by Aouda , who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore , disembarked . 
Fix , who suspected Mr. Fogg 's every movement , followed them cautiously , without being himself perceived ; while Passepartout , laughing in his sleeve at Fix 's manoeuvres , went about his usual errands . 
The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect , for there are no mountains ; yet its appearance is not without attractions .
