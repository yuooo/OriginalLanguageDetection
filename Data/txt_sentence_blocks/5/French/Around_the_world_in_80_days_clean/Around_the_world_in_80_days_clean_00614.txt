During the night it crossed the Mississippi at Davenport , and by Rock Island entered Illinois . 
The next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached Chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan . 
Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York ; but trains are not wanting at Chicago . 
Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other , and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne , and Chicago Railway left at full speed , as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose . 
It traversed Indiana , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey like a flash , rushing through towns with antique names , some of which had streets and car-tracks , but as yet no houses .
