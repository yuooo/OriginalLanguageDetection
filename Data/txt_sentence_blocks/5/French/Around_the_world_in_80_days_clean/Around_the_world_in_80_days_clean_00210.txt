The whole multitude prostrated themselves , terror-stricken , on the ground . 
The old rajah was not dead , then , since he rose of a sudden , like a spectre , took up his wife in his arms , and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke , which only heightened his ghostly appearance . 
Fakirs and soldiers and priests , seized with instant terror , lay there , with their faces on the ground , not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy . 
The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her , and which she did not seem in the least to burden . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect , the Parsee bowed his head , and Passepartout was , no doubt , scarcely less stupefied .
