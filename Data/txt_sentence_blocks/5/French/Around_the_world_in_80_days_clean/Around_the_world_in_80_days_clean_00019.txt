Passepartout , desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served , ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct ; which , being ill-received , he took his leave . 
Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after . 
He presented himself , and was accepted , as has been seen . 
At half-past eleven , then , Passepartout found himself alone in the house in Saville Row . 
He begun its inspection without delay , scouring it from cellar to garret .
