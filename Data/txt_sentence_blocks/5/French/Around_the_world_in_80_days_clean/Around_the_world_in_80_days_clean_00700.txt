Where was he at this moment ? 
The 17th of December , the day of James Strand 's arrest , was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg 's departure , and no news of him had been received . 
Was he dead ? 
Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ? 
And would he appear on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon ?
