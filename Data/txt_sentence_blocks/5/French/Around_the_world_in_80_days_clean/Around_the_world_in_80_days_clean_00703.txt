The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch . 
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club . 
John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , the bankers , Andrew Stuart , the engineer , Gauthier Ralph , the director of the Bank of England , and Thomas Flanagan , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously . 
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , Andrew Stuart got up , saying , `` Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired . '' 
`` What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool ? ''
