Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide 's narrative of her touching history . 
She did , indeed , belong to the highest of the native races of India . 
Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton ; and one of them , Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy , was made a baronet by the English government . 
Aouda was a relative of this great man , and it was his cousin , Jeejeeh , whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong . 
Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell ; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties , and to assure her that everything would be mathematically -- he used the very word -- arranged .
