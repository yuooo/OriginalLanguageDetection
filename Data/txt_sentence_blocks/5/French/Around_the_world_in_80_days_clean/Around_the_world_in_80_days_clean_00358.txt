Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board , where they found Fix already installed . 
Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan ; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp . 
The accommodation was confined , but neat . 
`` I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , '' said Mr. Fogg to Fix , who bowed without responding . 
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg .
