They entered Nebraska at eleven , passed near Sedgwick , and touched at Julesburg , on the southern branch of the Platte River . 
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , General Dodge . 
Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point ; cheers were given , the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train . 
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist . 
The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than Amphion 's lyre , was about to bid them rise from American soil .
