As for Fix , he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty , whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not . 
The thought then struck Passepartout , that he was the cause of this new misfortune ! 
Had he not concealed Fix 's errand from his master ? 
When Fix revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told Mr. Fogg ? 
If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake ; at least , Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil .
