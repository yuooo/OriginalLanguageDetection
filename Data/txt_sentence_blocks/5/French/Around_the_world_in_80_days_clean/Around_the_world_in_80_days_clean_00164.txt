Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . 
Returning to the Indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain . 
Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds . 
Passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense . 
At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded .
