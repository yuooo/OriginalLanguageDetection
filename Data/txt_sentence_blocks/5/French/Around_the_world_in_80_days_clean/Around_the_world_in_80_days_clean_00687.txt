As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before -LRB- Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine -RRB- , he had lost his wager . 
It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds ; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands , and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit . 
Mr. Fogg , therefore , had no reason for going out , and so he remained at home . 
He shut himself up in his room , and busied himself putting his affairs in order . 
Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs .
