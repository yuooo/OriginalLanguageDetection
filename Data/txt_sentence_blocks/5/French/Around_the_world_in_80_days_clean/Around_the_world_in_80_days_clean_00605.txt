The prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . 
It seemed like a vast frozen lake . 
The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island , Columbus , an important Nebraska town , Schuyler , and Fremont , to Omaha . 
It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River . 
The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway .
