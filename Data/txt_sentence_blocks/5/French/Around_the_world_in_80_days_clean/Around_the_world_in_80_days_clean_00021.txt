It comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the Reform Club -- all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten . 
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired . 
Mr. Fogg 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste . 
Each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes . 
In short , the house in Saville Row , which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan , was cosiness , comfort , and method idealised .
