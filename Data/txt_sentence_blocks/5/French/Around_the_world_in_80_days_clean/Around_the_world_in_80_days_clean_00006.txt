His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist . 
He often won at this game , which , as a silent one , harmonised with his nature ; but his winnings never went into his purse , being reserved as a fund for his charities . 
Mr. Fogg played , not to win , but for the sake of playing . 
The game was in his eyes a contest , a struggle with a difficulty , yet a motionless , unwearying struggle , congenial to his tastes . 
Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children , which may happen to the most honest people ; either relatives or near friends , which is certainly more unusual .
