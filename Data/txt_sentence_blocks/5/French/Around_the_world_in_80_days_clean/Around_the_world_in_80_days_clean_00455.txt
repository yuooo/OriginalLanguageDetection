Payment was made only for the ale , porter , or sherry which was drunk . 
This seemed `` very American '' to Passepartout . 
The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable , and Mr. Fogg and Aouda , installing themselves at a table , were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue . 
After breakfast , Mr. Fogg , accompanied by Aouda , started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed . 
As he was going out , he met Passepartout , who asked him if it would not be well , before taking the train , to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt 's revolvers .
