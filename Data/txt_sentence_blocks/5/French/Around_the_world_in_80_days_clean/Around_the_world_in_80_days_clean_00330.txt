`` My master is the most honourable of men ! '' 
`` How can you tell ? 
You know scarcely anything about him . 
You went into his service the day he came away ; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes . 
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man ! ''
