Three days before , Phileas Fogg had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police ; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world . 
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made . 
Phileas Fogg 's name was once more at a premium on ` Change . 
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense . 
Would Phileas Fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes !
