Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter . 
The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours . 
Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day , October 25th , at noon , for Hong Kong . 
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station , whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet , a dress , shawl , and some furs ; for which his master gave him unlimited credit . 
Passepartout started off forthwith , and found himself in the streets of Allahabad , that is , the City of God , one of the most venerated in India , being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers , Ganges and Jumna , the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula .
