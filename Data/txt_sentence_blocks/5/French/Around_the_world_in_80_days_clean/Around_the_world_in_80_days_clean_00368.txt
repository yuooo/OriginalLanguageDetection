The Tankadere still carried all sail , and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed . 
If the wind held as it was , the chances would be in her favour . 
During the day she kept along the coast , where the currents were favourable ; the coast , irregular in profile , and visible sometimes across the clearings , was at most five miles distant . 
The sea was less boisterous , since the wind came off land -- a fortunate circumstance for the boat , which would suffer , owing to its small tonnage , by a heavy surge on the sea . 
The breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south-west .
