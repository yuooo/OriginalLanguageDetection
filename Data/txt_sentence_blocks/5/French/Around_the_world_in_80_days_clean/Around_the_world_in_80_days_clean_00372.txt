The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of Cancer . 
The sea was very rough in the straits , full of eddies formed by the counter-currents , and the chopping waves broke her course , whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck . 
At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again , and the heavens seemed to predict a gale . 
The barometer announced a speedy change , the mercury rising and falling capriciously ; the sea also , in the south-east , raised long surges which indicated a tempest . 
The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean .
