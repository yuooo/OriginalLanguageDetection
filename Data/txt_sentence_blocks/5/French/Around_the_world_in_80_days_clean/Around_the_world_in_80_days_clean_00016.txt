Phileas Fogg was , indeed , exactitude personified , and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet ; for in men , as well as in animals , the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions . 
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions . 
He never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated . 
He was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment . 
He lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .
