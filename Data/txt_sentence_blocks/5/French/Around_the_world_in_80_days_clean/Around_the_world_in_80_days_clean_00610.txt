The plain was absolutely deserted . 
Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island . 
Neither village , station , nor fort appeared . 
From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree , whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind . 
Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose , or bands of gaunt , famished , ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge .
