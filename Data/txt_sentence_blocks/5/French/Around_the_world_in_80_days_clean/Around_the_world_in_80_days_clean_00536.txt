Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha . 
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River , on its left bank . 
At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha . 
The one hundred and first meridian was passed . 
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game ; no one -- not even the dummy -- complained of the length of the trip .
