It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible . 
They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly . 
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim . 
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned . 
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?
