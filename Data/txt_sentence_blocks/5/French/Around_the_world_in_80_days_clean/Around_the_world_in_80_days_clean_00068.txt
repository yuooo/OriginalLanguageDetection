Not only the members of the Reform , but the general public , made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg , who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse . 
Bonds were issued , and made their appearance on ` Change ; `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' were offered at par or at a premium , and a great business was done in them . 
But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared , the demand began to subside : `` Phileas Fogg '' declined . 
They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred ! 
Lord Albemarle , an elderly paralytic gentleman , was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left .
