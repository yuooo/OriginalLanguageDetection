A tax-collector , on the way to his post at Goa ; the Rev. Decimus Smith , returning to his parish at Bombay ; and a brigadier-general of the English army , who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares , made up the party , and , with Mr. Fogg , played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence . 
As for Passepartout , he , too , had escaped sea-sickness , and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin . 
He rather enjoyed the voyage , for he was well fed and well lodged , took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing , and consoled himself with the delusion that his master 's whim would end at Bombay . 
He was pleased , on the day after leaving Suez , to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays . 
`` If I am not mistaken , '' said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , `` you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez ? ''
