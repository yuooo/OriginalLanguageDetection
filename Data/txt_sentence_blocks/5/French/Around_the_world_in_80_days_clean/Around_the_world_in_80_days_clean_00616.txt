The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day , and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager . 
Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw , which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers . 
Passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour . 
It was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! 
And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin Mr. Fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations .
