The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg , when he was shot and fell . 
At the same moment he cried , `` Unless the train is stopped in five minutes , we are lost ! '' 
`` It shall be stopped , '' said Phileas Fogg , preparing to rush from the car . 
`` Stay , monsieur , '' cried Passepartout ; `` I will go . '' 
Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the Indians , succeeded in slipping under the car ; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train .
