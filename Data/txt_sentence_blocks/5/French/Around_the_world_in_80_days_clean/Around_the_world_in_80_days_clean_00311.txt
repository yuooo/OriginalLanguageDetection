Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep . 
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer , porter , gin , and brandy ; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose . 
From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed . 
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots . 
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity !
