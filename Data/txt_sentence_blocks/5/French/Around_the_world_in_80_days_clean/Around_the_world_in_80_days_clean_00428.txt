As a last scene , a `` human pyramid '' had been announced , in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut . 
But , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other 's shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses . 
It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , Passepartout had been chosen to take his place . 
The poor fellow really felt sad when -- melancholy reminiscence of his youth ! 
-- he donned his costume , adorned with vari-coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long .
