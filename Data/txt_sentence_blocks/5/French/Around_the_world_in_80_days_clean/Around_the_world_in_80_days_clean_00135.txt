Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg , and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police . 
He made himself known as a London detective , told his business at Bombay , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London . 
It had not reached the office ; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive . 
Fix was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police . 
This the director refused , as the matter concerned the London office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant .
