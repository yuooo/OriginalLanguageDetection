The Tankadere bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale . 
Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight , having been already preceded by Fix , who had lain down on one of the cots . 
The pilot and crew remained on deck all night . 
At sunrise the next day , which was 8th November , the boat had made more than one hundred miles . 
The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles .
