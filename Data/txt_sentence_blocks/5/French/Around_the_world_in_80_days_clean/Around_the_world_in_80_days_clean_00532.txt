Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward ; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful ; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive ; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second .

And they passed over ! 
It was like a flash . 
No one saw the bridge .
