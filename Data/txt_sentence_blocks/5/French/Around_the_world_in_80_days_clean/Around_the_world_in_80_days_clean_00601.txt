Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air , Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort Kearney , the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions . 
But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg , and Passepartout was delighted with her decision ; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him . 
It would be difficult to guess the detective 's thoughts . 
Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg 's return , or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal , who , his journey round the world completed , would think himself absolutely safe in England ? 
Perhaps Fix 's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified ; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty , and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible .
