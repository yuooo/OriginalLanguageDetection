The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway . 
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains , which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund , towards evening . 
The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . 
This famous timepiece , always regulated on the Greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . 
Sir Francis corrected Passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at London time .
