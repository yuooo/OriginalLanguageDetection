The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening -- about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in London -- Passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriage ceremony , which was to take place the next day . 
Passepartout went on his errand enchanted . 
He soon reached the clergyman 's house , but found him not at home . 
Passepartout waited a good twenty minutes , and when he left the reverend gentleman , it was thirty-five minutes past eight . 
But in what a state he was !
