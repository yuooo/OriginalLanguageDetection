His common sense pitied , above all , the husband . 
It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life , and to conduct them , as it were , in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith , who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place , to all eternity .
