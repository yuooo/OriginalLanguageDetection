The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat , and drove in a carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel , on Broadway . 
Rooms were engaged , and the night passed , briefly to Phileas Fogg , who slept profoundly , but very long to Aouda and the others , whose agitation did not permit them to rest . 
The next day was the 12th of December .
