The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . 
The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . 
The guide watched Kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . 
Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls front panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . 
Sir Francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue .
