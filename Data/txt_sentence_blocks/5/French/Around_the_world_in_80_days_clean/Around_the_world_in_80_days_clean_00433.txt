Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . 
Chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar 's theatre . 
He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . 
He could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the `` pyramid '' pell-mell upon the stage . 
All this Passepartout learned from Aouda , who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere , in company with one Mr. Fix .
