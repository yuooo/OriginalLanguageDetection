If you had not suggested our marriage , my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel Wilson 's , I should not have been apprised of my error , and -- '' `` Dear Mr. Fogg ! '' 
said the young woman . 
`` Dear Aouda ! '' 
replied Phileas Fogg . 
It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after , and that Passepartout , glowing and dazzling , gave the bride away .
