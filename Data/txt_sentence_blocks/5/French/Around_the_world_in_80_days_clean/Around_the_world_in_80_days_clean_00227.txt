Night came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of Bengal , Golconda ruined Gour , Murshedabad , the ancient capital , Burdwan , Hugly , and the French town of Chandernagor , where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness . 
Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning , and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon ; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him . 
According to his journal , he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October , and that was the exact date of his actual arrival . 
He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time . 
The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost , as has been seen , in the journey across India .
