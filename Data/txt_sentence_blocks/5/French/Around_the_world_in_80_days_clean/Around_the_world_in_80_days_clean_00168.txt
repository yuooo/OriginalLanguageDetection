The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant 's neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board ; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in Kiouni 's trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot . 
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which Kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . 
Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . 
`` Why , he 's made of iron ! '' 
exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on Kiouni .
