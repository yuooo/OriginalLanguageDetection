Mr. Fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . 
She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . 
The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves . 
Passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . 
But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam .
