My descendants , if I have any , will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest will confer , just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with regard to the estates of the poor Marechal d'Ancre . 
But the thing is , how best to execute the king 's directions in a proper manner . 
Any man would know how to say to M. Fouquet , ` Your sword , monsieur . ' 
But it is not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without others knowing anything about it . 
How am I to manage , then , so that M. le surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace ; that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him ; that after having been steeped to his lips , as it were , in all the perfumes and incense of Ahasuerus , he is transferred to the gallows of Haman ; in other words , of Enguerrand de Marigny ?
