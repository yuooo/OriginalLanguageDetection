Baisemeaux advanced , and Aramis followed him . 
It was a calm and lovely starlit night ; the steps of three men resounded on the flags of the terraces , and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer 's girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers , as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach . 
It might have been said that the alteration effected in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners . 
The turnkey , the same who , on Aramis 's first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious , was now not only silent , but impassible . 
He held his head down , and seemed afraid to keep his ears open .
