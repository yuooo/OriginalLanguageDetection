The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexandre Dumas : The Prisoner . 
Since Aramis 's singular transformation into a confessor of the order , Baisemeaux was no longer the same man . 
Up to that period , the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor 's estimation was that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude ; but now he felt himself an inferior , and that Aramis was his master . 
He himself lighted a lantern , summoned a turnkey , and said , returning to Aramis , `` I am at your orders , monseigneur . '' 
Aramis merely nodded his head , as much as to say , `` Very good '' ; and signed to him with his hand to lead the way .
