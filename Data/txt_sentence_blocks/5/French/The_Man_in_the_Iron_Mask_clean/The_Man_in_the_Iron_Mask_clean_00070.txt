It was my preceptor come back again . 
I had but just time . 
I calculated that it would take ten minutes before he would gain my place of concealment , even if , guessing where I was , he came straight to it ; and twenty if he were obliged to look for me . 
But this was time enough to allow me to read the cherished letter , whose fragments I hastened to unite again . 
The writing was already fading , but I managed to decipher it all .
