Some endeavored to fly , but they encountered the third brigade , which barred their passage ; others mechanically took aim and attempted to fire their discharged muskets ; others fell instinctively upon their knees . 
Two or three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his liberty if he would spare their lives . 
The lieutenant of the third brigade commanded his men to fire ; but the guards had before them their terrified companions , who served as a living rampart for Porthos .
