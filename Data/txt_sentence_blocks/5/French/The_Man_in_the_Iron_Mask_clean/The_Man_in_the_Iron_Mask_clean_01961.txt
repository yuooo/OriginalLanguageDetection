His Bretons surrounded him ; Aramis yielded to their kind exertions , and the three sailors , lifting him up , carried him to the canoe . 
Then , having laid him down upon the bench near the rudder , they took to their oars , preferring this to hoisting sail , which might betray them . 
On all that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria , one single hillock attracted their eyes . 
Aramis never removed his from it ; and , at a distance out in the sea , in proportion as the shore receded , that menacing proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up , as formerly Porthos used to draw himself up , raising a smiling , yet invincible head towards heaven , like that of his dear old honest valiant friend , the strongest of the four , yet the first dead . 
Strange destiny of these men of brass !
