Roast partridges , flanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret ; boiled fowls ; hams , fried and sprinkled with white wine , cardons of Guipuzcoa and la bisque ecrevisses : these , together with soups and hors d'oeuvres , constituted the governor 's bill of fare . 
Baisemeaux , seated at table , was rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes , who , booted like a cavalier , dressed in gray and sword at side , kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience . 
M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes , and this evening Aramis , becoming sprightly , volunteered confidence on confidence . 
The prelate had again a little touch of the musketeer about him . 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of conversation .
