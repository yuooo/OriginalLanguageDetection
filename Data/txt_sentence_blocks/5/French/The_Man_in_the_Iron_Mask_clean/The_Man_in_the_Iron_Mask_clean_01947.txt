And now , in this burning tomb , this subterranean volcano , seek the king 's guards with their blue coats laced with silver . 
Seek the officers , brilliant in gold , seek for the arms upon which they depended for their defense . 
One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more confused , more shapeless , more terrible than the chaos which existed before the creation of the world . 
There remained nothing of the three compartments - nothing by which God could have recognized His handiwork . 
As for Porthos , after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his enemies , he had fled , as Aramis had directed him to do , and had gained the last compartment , into which air , light , and sunshine penetrated through the opening .
