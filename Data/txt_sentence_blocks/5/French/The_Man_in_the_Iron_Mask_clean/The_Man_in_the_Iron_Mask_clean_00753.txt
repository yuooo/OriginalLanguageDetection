Poverty -LRB- a phantom I have sometimes beheld , clad in rags , awaiting me at the end of my journey through life -RRB- - poverty has been the specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past , which they poetize and caress , and which has attracted me towards them . 
Poverty ! 
I accept it , acknowledge it , receive it , as a disinherited sister ; for poverty is neither solitude , nor exile , nor imprisonment . 
Is it likely I shall ever be poor , with such friends as Pelisson , as La Fontaine , as Moliere ? 
with such a mistress as - Oh !
