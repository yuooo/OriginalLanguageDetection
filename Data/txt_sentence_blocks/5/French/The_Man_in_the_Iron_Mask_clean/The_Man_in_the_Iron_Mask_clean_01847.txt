`` So be it ; I wish it may , monseigneur , '' continued Yves ; `` but your highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench , there is an enormous stone to be lifted - that under which the fox always passes , and which closes the trench like a door . '' 
`` It can be raised , '' said Porthos ; `` that is nothing . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men , '' replied Yves ; `` but that is giving him a great deal of trouble . ''
