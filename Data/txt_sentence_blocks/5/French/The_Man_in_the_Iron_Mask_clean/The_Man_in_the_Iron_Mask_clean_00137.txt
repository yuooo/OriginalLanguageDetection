`` I am going to explain it , '' said Porthos . 
`` You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony , who had always seven wild boars kept roasting , each cooked up to a different point ; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it . 
Well , then , I resolved , as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week , I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion . '' 
`` Capitally reasoned , Porthos - only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims . 
Without counting the time lost in being measured , the fashions are always changing . ''
