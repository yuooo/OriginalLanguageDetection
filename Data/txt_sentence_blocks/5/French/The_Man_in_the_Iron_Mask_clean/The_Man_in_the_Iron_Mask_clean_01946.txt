A jet of fire , smoke , and debris sprang from the middle of the grotto , enlarging as it mounted . 
The large walls of silex tottered and fell upon the sand , and the sand itself , an instrument of pain when launched from its hard bed , riddled the faces with its myriad cutting atoms . 
Shrieks , imprecations , human life , dead bodies - all were engulfed in one terrific crash . 
The three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell grimly back , in the order of their weight , every vegetable , mineral , or human fragment . 
Then the lighter sand and ash came down in turn , stretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal scene .
