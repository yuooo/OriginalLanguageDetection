Athos and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as that of Planchet . 
The duke , likewise , was making his inventory ; that is to say , he was distributing to his friends everything of value he had in his house . 
Owing nearly two millions - an enormous amount in those days - M. de Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for Africa without a good round sum , and , in order to find that sum , he was distributing to his old creditors plate , arms , jewels , and furniture , which was more magnificent in selling it , and brought him back double . 
In fact , how could a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing , refuse to carry away a present worth six thousand , enhanced in estimation from having belonged to a descendant of Henry IV . ? 
And how , after having carried away that present , could he refuse ten thousand livres more to this generous noble ?
