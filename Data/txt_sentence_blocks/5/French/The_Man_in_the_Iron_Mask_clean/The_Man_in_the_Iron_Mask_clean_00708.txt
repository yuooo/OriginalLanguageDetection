`` And then , really , '' said Baisemeaux to his next in command , `` an ordinary prisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner ; he suffers quite enough , indeed , to induce one to hope , charitably enough , that his death may not be far distant . 
With still greater reason , accordingly , when the prisoner has gone mad , and might bite and make a terrible disturbance in the Bastile ; why , in such a case , it is not simply an act of mere charity to wish him dead ; it would be almost a good and even commendable action , quietly to have him put out of his misery . ''
