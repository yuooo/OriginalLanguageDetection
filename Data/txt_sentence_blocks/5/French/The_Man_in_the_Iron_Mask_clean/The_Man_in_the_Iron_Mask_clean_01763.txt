I therefore intend to send for two of the principal officers of the place , that we may converse with them . 
Having separated them from their troops and cannon , we shall be better able to deal with them ; particularly by reasoning with them . 
Is not this your opinion , gentlemen ? '' 
The major of artillery rose .
