The doctor knew the temper of that mind ; he appreciated the strength of that body ; he reflected for the moment , told himself that words were useless , remedies absurd , and left the chateau , exhorting Athos 's servants not to quit him for a moment . 
The doctor being gone , Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at having been disturbed . 
He did not even desire that all letters that came should be brought to him directly . 
He knew very well that every distraction which should arise would be a joy , a hope , which his servants would have paid with their blood to procure him . 
Sleep had become rare .
