The sun 's rays there are soft and tempered : in plots of solid earth , whose soil is swart and fertile , grows the vine , nourishing with generous juice its purple , white , and golden grapes . 
Once a week , a boat is sent to deliver the bread which has been baked at an oven - the common property of all . 
There - like the seigneurs of early days - powerful in virtue of your dogs , your fishing-lines , your guns , and your beautiful reed-built house , would you live , rich in the produce of the chase , in plentitude of absolute secrecy . 
There would years of your life roll away , at the end of which , no longer recognizable , for you would have been perfectly transformed , you would have succeeded in acquiring a destiny accorded to you by Heaven . 
There are a thousand pistoles in this bag , monseigneur - more , far more , than sufficient to purchase the whole marsh of which I have spoken ; more than enough to live there as many years as you have days to live ; more than enough to constitute you the richest , the freest , and the happiest man in the country .
