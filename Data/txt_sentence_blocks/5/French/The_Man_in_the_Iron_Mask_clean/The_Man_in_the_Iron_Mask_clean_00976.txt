`` Sire , I gave M. d'Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours ' start over all those your majesty might , probably , dispatch after him . '' 
`` Be it so ! '' 
murmured the king . 
`` But still , the world is wide enough and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses , notwithstanding the ` four hours ' start ' which you have given to M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` In giving him these four hours , sire , I knew I was giving him his life , and he will save his life . ''
