`` What do you wish ? '' 
said he , in an agitated voice . 
`` We come humbly to ask your majesty , '' replied Pelisson , upon whom emotion was fast gaining , `` to permit us , without incurring the displeasure of your majesty , to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand pistoles collected among the old friends of her husband , in order that the widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life . '' 
At the word widow , pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still alive , the king turned very pale ; - his pride disappeared ; pity rose from his heart to his lips ; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt sobbing at his feet .
