It was to D'Artagnan the king owed this ; and his majesty was anxious to acknowledge these services ; he wrote to M. Colbert : `` MONSIEUR COLBERT , - We have a promise to fulfil with M. d'Artagnan , who so well keeps his . 
This is to inform you that the time is come for performing it . 
All provisions for this purpose you shall be furnished with in due time . 
LOUIS . '' 
In consequence of this , Colbert , detaining D'Artagnan 's envoy , placed in the hands of that messenger a letter from himself , and a small coffer of ebony inlaid with gold , not very important in appearance , but which , without doubt , was very heavy , as a guard of five men was given to the messenger , to assist him in carrying it .
