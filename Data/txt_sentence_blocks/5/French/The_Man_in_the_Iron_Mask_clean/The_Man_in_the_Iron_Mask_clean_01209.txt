The price was agreed upon , but the gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case , which he insisted upon embarking , in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the operation . 
The fisherman wished to retract . 
He had even threatened , but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the gentleman 's cane , which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long . 
Swearing and grumbling , he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes , who administer justice among themselves and protect each other ; but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper , at sight of which the syndic , bowing to the very ground , enjoined obedience from the fisherman , and abused him for having been refractory . 
They then departed with the freight .
