Madame set out for London , where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother , Charles II. , acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle de Keroualle , that the alliance between England and France was signed , and the English vessels , ballasted by a few millions of French gold , made a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces . 
Charles II . 
had promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude for her good counsels ; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth . 
Colbert had promised the king vessels , munitions , victories . 
He kept his word , as is well known .
