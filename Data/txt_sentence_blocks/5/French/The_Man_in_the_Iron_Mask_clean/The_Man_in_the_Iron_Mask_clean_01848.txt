`` I think the skipper may be right , '' said Aramis ; `` let us try the open-air passage . '' 
`` The more so , monseigneur , '' continued the fisherman , `` that we should not be able to embark before day , it will require so much labor , and that as soon as daylight appears , a good vedette placed outside the grotto would be necessary , indispensable even , to watch the maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us . '' 
`` Yes , yes , Yves , your reasons are good ; we will go by the beach . '' 
And the three robust Bretons went to the boat , and were beginning to place their rollers underneath it to put it in motion , when the distant barking of dogs was heard , proceeding from the interior of the island . 
Aramis darted out of the grotto , followed by Porthos .
