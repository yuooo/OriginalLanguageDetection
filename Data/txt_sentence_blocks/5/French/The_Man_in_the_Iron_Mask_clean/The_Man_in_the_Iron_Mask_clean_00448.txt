Such were the reflections of Aramis as he watched , with an anxiety impossible to describe , the silent progress of the emotions of Philippe , whom he perceived gradually becoming more and more absorbed in his meditations . 
The young prince was offering up an inward prayer to Heaven , to be divinely guided in this trying moment , upon which his life or death depended . 
It was an anxious time for the bishop of Vannes , who had never before been so perplexed . 
His iron will , accustomed to overcome all obstacles , never finding itself inferior or vanquished on any occasion , to be foiled in so vast a project from not having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in all its luxuriance would have on the human mind ! 
Aramis , overwhelmed by anxiety , contemplated with emotion the painful struggle that was taking place in Philippe 's mind .
