`` You shall have it . '' 
`` Then consider me already gone , brother . '' 
On hearing these words , Louis XIV . 
turned round towards the corner of the room in which D'Artagnan , Colbert , and Aramis stood , and made an affirmative sign to his minister . 
Colbert then broke in on the conversation suddenly , and said to Aramis : `` Monsieur l'ambassadeur , shall we talk about business ? ''
