The young queen , kind-hearted by nature and curious by disposition , praised Fouquet , ate with an exceedingly good appetite , and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed upon the table . 
Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names . 
The fruits came from his own stores ; he had often cultivated them himself , having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic fruits and plants . 
The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the replies , but was only the more humiliated ; he thought the queen a little too familiar in her manners , and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno a little too much , in being too proud and haughty ; his chief anxiety , however , was himself , that he might remain cold and distant in his behavior , bordering lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple admiration . 
But Fouquet had foreseen all this ; he was , in fact , one of those men who foresee everything .
