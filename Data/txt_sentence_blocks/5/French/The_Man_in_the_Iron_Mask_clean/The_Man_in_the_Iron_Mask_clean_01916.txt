Porthos collected all his strength , took the canoe in his arms , and raised it up , whilst the Bretons made it run rapidly along the rollers . 
They had descended into the third compartment ; they had arrived at the stone which walled the outlet . 
Porthos seized this gigantic stone at its base , applied his robust shoulder , and gave a heave which made the wall crack . 
A cloud of dust fell from the vault , with the ashes of ten thousand generations of sea birds , whose nests stuck like cement to the rock . 
At the third shock the stone gave way , and oscillated for a minute .
