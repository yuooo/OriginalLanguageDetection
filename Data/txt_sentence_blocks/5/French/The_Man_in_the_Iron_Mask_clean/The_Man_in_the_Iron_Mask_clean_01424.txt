In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the hoods of two women , and being rather curious , he wished to know the names of the ladies hid beneath these hoods . 
To get a glimpse at them , for they kept themselves closely covered up , he urged his horse so near the carriage , that he drove him against the step with such force as to shake everything containing and contained . 
The terrified women uttered , the one a faint cry , by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman , the other an imprecation , in which he recognized the vigor and aplomb that half a century bestows . 
The hoods were thrown back : one of the women was Madame Vanel , the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse . 
D'Artagnan 's eyes were quicker than those of the ladies ; he had seen and known them , whilst they did not recognize him ; and as they laughed at their fright , pressing each other 's hands , - `` Humph ! ''
