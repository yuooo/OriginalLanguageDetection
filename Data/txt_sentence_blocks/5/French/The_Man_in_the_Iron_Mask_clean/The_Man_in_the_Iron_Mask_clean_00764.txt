In one word , you have been a prodigal with money , you have ordered and been obeyed - have been steeped to the lips in enjoyment ; while I have dragged my tether after me , have been commanded and have obeyed , and have drudged my life away . 
Well , although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you , monseigneur , I do declare to you , that the recollection of what I have done serves me as a spur , and prevents me from bowing my old head too soon . 
I shall remain unto the very end a trooper ; and when my turn comes , I shall fall perfectly straight , all in a heap , still alive , after having selected my place beforehand . 
Do as I do , Monsieur Fouquet , you will not find yourself the worse for it ; a fall happens only once in a lifetime to men like yourself , and the chief thing is , to take it gracefully when the chance presents itself . 
There is a Latin proverb - the words have escaped me , but I remember the sense of it very well , for I have thought over it more than once - which says , ` The end crowns the work ! ' ''
