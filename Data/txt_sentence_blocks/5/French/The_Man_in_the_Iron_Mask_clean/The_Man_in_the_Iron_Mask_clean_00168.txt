Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown Percerin , the king , Louis XIII. , had the generosity to bear no malice to his tailor , and to retain him in his service . 
At the time that Louis the Just afforded this great example of equity , Percerin had brought up two sons , one of whom made his debut at the marriage of Anne of Austria , invented that admirable Spanish costume , in which Richelieu danced a saraband , made the costumes for the tragedy of `` Mirame , '' and stitched on to Buckingham 's mantle those famous pearls which were destined to be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre . 
A man becomes easily notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham , a M. de Cinq - Mars , a Mademoiselle Ninon , a M. de Beaufort , and a Marion de Lorme . 
And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory when his father died . 
This same Percerin III. , old , famous and wealthy , yet further dressed Louis XIV. ; and having no son , which was a great cause of sorrow to him , seeing that with himself his dynasty would end , he had brought up several hopeful pupils .
