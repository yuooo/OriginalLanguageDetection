`` And you are going to release this prisoner . 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also , I declare to you I will not oppose it the least in the world . '' 
Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile , the irony of which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux 's confusion of mind , and restored his courage . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he said , `` this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a priest confessor of our order came to visit in so imperious and so secret a manner . ''
