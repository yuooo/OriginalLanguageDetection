How many , from Richelieu to Louis XIV. , had bowed their heads , never to raise them again ! 
But M. de Beaufort was born a prince , and of a blood which is not shed upon scaffolds , unless by the decree of peoples , - a prince who had kept up a grand style of living . 
How did he maintain his horses , his people , and his table ? 
Nobody knew ; himself less than others . 
Only there were then privileges for the sons of kings , to whom nobody refused to become a creditor , whether from respect or the persuasion that they would some day be paid .
