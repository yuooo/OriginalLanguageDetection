`` That which the king has just told you , monsieur , proves how well his majesty is acquainted with men . 
The inveterate opposition I have displayed , up to this day , against abuses and not against men , proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign , for my country a great blessing . 
I have many ideas , M. d'Artagnan . 
You will see them expand in the sun of public peace ; and if I have not the good fortune to conquer the friendship of honest men , I am at least certain , monsieur , that I shall obtain their esteem . 
For their admiration , monsieur , I would give my life . ''
