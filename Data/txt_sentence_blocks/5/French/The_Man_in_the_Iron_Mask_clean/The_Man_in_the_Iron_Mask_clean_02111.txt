Age , which had been kept back by the presence of the beloved object , arrived with that cortege of pains and inconveniences , which grows by geometrical accretion . 
Athos had no longer his son to induce him to walk firmly , with head erect , as a good example ; he had no longer , in those brilliant eyes of the young man , an ever-ardent focus at which to kindle anew the fire of his looks . 
And then , must it be said , that nature , exquisite in tenderness and reserve , no longer finding anything to understand its feelings , gave itself up to grief with all the warmth of common natures when they yield to joy . 
The Comte de la Fere , who had remained a young man to his sixty-second year ; the warrior who had preserved his strength in spite of fatigue ; his freshness of mind in spite of misfortune , his mild serenity of soul and body in spite of Milady , in spite of Mazarin , in spite of La Valliere ; Athos had become an old man in a week , from the moment at which he lost the comfort of his later youth . 
Still handsome , though bent , noble , but sad , he sought , since his solitude , the deeper glades where sunshine scarcely penetrated .
