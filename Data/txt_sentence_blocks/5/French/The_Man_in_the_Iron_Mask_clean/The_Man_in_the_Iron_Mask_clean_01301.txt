The king will not refuse me , and I will take you with me . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' replied Raoul , pressing his hand with emotion , `` thanks for that offer , which would give us more than we wish , either monsieur le comte or I. I , who am young , stand in need of labor of mind and fatigue of body ; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose . 
You are his best friend . 
I recommend him to your care . 
In watching over him , you are holding both our souls in your hands . ''
