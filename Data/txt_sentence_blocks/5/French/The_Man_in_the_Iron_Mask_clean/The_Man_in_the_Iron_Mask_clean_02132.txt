In fact , this letter from Aramis informed the Comte de la Fere of the bad success of the expedition of Belle-Isle . 
It gave him sufficient details of the death of Porthos to move the tender and devoted heart of Athos to its innermost fibers . 
Athos wished to go and pay his friend Porthos a last visit . 
To render this honor to his companion in arms , he meant to send to D'Artagnan , to prevail upon him to recommence the painful voyage to Belle-Isle , to accomplish in his company that sad pilgrimage to the tomb of the giant he had so much loved , then to return to his dwelling to obey that secret influence which was conducting him to eternity by a mysterious road . 
But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed their master , whom they saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might dissipate his melancholy ; scarcely had the comte 's gentlest horse been saddled and brought to the door , when the father of Raoul felt his head become confused , his legs give way , and he clearly perceived the impossibility of going one step further .
