- Loret was composing an account of the fetes at Vaux , before those fetes had taken place . 
La Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other , a peripatetic , absent - minded , boring , unbearable dreamer , who kept buzzing and humming at everybody 's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions . 
He so often disturbed Pelisson , that the latter , raising his head , crossly said , `` At least , La Fontaine , supply me with a rhyme , since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus . '' 
`` What rhyme do you want ? '' 
asked the Fabler as Madame de Sevigne used to call him .
