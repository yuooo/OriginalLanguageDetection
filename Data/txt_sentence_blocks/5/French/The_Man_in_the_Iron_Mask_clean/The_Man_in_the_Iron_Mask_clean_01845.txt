`` Let us inspect the boat , '' said Aramis , `` and satisfy ourselves at once what it will hold . '' 
`` Do not go too near with the light , '' said the patron Yves ; `` for as you desired me , monseigneur , I have placed under the bench of the poop , in the coffer you know of , the barrel of powder , and the musket-charges that you sent me from the fort . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Aramis ; and , taking the lantern himself , he examined minutely all parts of the canoe , with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger . 
The canoe was long , light , drawing little water , thin of keel ; in short , one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle ; a little high in its sides , solid upon the water , very manageable , furnished with planks which , in uncertain weather , formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide , so as to protect the rowers . 
In two well-closed coffers , placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop , Aramis found bread , biscuit , dried fruits , a quarter of bacon , a good provision of water in leathern bottles ; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit the coast , and would be able to revictual , if necessity commanded .
