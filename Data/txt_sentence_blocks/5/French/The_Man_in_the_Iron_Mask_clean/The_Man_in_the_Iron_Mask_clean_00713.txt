he is lost ! 
But shall I put my foot on his neck , I , of all men , when he is falling a prey to the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks ? 
For shame ! 
If he be dangerous , I will lay him low enough ; if , however , he be only persecuted , I will look on . 
I have come to such a decisive determination , that neither king nor living man shall change my mind .
