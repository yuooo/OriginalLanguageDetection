`` I mean - '' interrupted Planchet , quite confused . 
`` Well , well ; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question ; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you . 
Since the captain of the musketeers is not here , and as we can not learn from you where we are likely to find M. d'Artagnan , we will take our leave of you . 
Au revoir , Planchet , au revoir .
