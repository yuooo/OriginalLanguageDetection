`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened .

'' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband .
