Philippe gave orders that for his petit lever the grandes entrees , already prepared to appear before the king , should be introduced . 
He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence of M. d'Herblay , who did not return - our readers know the reason . 
But the prince , not believing that absence could be prolonged , wished , as all rash spirits do , to try his valor and his fortune far from all protection and instruction . 
Another reason urged him to this - Anne of Austria was about to appear ; the guilty mother was about to stand in the presence of her sacrificed son . 
Philippe was not willing , if he had a weakness , to render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound thenceforth to display so much strength .
