The king did not expect him so soon , and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon . 
D'Artagnan , instead of riding after the king , as he would formerly have done , took off his boots , had a bath , and waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired . 
He occupied the interval of five hours in taking , as people say , the air of the house , and in arming himself against all ill chances . 
He learned that the king , during the last fortnight , had been gloomy ; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed ; that Monsieur , the king 's brother , was exhibiting a devotional turn ; that Madame had the vapors ; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates . 
He learned that M. Colbert was radiant ; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day , who still did not cure him , and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not usually cure , unless they are political physicians .
