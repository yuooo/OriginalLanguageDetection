Aramis had pronounced these words with his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom , where D'Artagnan , seated with his back towards the alcove , could not suspect that any one was lying concealed . 
The earnestness of his words , the studied slowness with which he pronounced them , the solemnity of his oath , gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction . 
He took hold of both Aramis 's hands , and shook them cordially . 
Aramis had endured reproaches without turning pale , and had blushed as he listened to words of praise . 
D'Artagnan , deceived , did him honor ; but D'Artagnan , trustful and reliant , made him feel ashamed .
