What could he do without me ? 
Oh ! 
without me he will be utterly destroyed . 
Yet who knows - let destiny be fulfilled - condemned he was , let him remain so then ! 
Good or evil Spirit - gloomy and scornful Power , whom men call the genius of humanity , thou art a power more restlessly uncertain , more baselessly useless , than wild mountain wind !
