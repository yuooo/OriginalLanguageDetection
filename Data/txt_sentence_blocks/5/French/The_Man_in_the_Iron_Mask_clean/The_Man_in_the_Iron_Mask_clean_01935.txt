The captain , illumining with trembling pine-torch this frightful carnage , of which he in vain sought the cause , drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was concealed . 
Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade , and fastened on the throat of the captain , who uttered a stifle rattle ; his stretched-out arms beating the air , the torch fell and was extinguished in blood . 
A second after , the corpse of the captain dropped close to the extinguished torch , and added another body to the heap of dead which blocked up the passage . 
All this was effected as mysteriously as though by magic . 
At hearing the rattling in the throat of the captain , the soldiers who accompanied him had turned round , caught a glimpse of his extended arms , his eyes starting from their sockets , and then the torch fell and they were left in darkness .
