The young woman raised her head with a solemn air . 
`` A day will come , '' said she , `` when you will repent of having so misjudged me . 
On that day , it is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards me . 
Besides , I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first to pity my sufferings . 
Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; it costs me dear , and I have not paid all my debt . ''
