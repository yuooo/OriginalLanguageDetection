D'Artagnan , through the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs , saw , as he went up behind Fouquet , the man who had delivered the note , looking round him on the place and making signs to several persons , who disappeared in the adjacent streets , after having themselves repeated the signals . 
Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken , - a terrace which abutted on the little corridor , at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located . 
Here D'Artagnan passed on before the surintendant , whom , till that time , he had respectfully accompanied , and entered the royal cabinet . 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Louis XIV. , who , on perceiving him , threw on to the table covered with papers a large green cloth .
