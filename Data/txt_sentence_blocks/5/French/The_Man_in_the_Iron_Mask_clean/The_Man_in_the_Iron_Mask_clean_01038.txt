`` Listen , monsieur . 
Never shall I accustom myself to the idea that Louise , the chastest and most innocent of women , has been able to so basely deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself . 
Never can I persuade myself that I see that sweet and noble mask change into a hypocritical lascivious face . 
Louise lost ! 
Louise infamous !
