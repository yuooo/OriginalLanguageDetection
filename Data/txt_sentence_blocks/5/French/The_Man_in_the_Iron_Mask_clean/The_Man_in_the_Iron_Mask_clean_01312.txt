And yet , it must be admitted that , whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations for departure , it was easy to perceive careless precipitation , and the absence of all the precaution that make the French solider the first soldier in the world , because , in that world , he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral resources . 
All things having satisfied , or appearing to have satisfied , the admiral , he paid his compliments to Raoul , and gave the last orders for sailing , which was ordered the next morning at daybreak . 
He invited the comte had his son to dine with him ; but they , under a pretext of service , kept themselves apart . 
Gaining their hostelry , situated under the trees of the great Place , they took their repast in haste , and Athos led Raoul to the rocks which dominate the city , vast gray mountains , whence the view is infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears , so remote is it , on a level with the rocks themselves . 
The night was fine , as it always is in these happy climes .
