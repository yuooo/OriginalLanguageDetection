`` Colbert was right , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` for me the baton of a marechal of France will cost the lives of my two friends . 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds , and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings . 
I will show them that hand so plainly , that they will have quite time enough to see it . 
Poor Porthos ! 
Poor Aramis !
