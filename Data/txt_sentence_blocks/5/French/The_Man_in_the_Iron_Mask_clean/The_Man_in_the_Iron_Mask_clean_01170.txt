But , as certain tenacities are stronger than others , Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity , translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus .

`` You want nothing now , then , but heirs to your property . '' 
`` If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres , '' said Planchet .
