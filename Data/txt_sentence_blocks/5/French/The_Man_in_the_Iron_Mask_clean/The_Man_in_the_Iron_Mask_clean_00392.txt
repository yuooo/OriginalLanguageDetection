It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop 's , but just now so playful and gay , had become funereal and sad ; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel , the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood . 
Aramis took a pen and wrote . 
Baisemeaux , in terror , read over his shoulder . 
`` A. M. D. G. , '' wrote the bishop ; and he drew a cross under these four letters , which signify ad majorem Dei gloriam , `` to the greater glory of God ; '' and thus he continued : `` It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun , governor , for the king , of the castle of the Bastile , be held by him good and effectual , and be immediately carried into operation . '' 
-LRB- Signed -RRB- D'HERBLAY `` General of the Order , by the grace of God . ''
