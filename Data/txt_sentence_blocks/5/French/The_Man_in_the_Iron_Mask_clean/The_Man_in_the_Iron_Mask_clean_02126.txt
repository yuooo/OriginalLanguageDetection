Lying down like the soldiers , my ear on the stretch for the report that may reach me , I wish to be ready to set out at the first summons . 
Who will make me that summons ? 
life or death ? 
God or Raoul ? 
My baggage is packed , my soul is prepared , I await the signal - I wait , doctor , I wait ! ''
