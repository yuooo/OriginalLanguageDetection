The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port .
