`` I again recommend Porthos to you , '' repeated the count , with a sort of cold persistence . 
`` Whatever becomes of me , count , '' replied Aramis , in the same tone , `` our brother Porthos will fare as I do - or better . '' 
Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis , and turned to embrace Porthos with emotion . 
`` I was born lucky , was I not ? '' 
murmured the latter , transported with happiness , as he folded his cloak round him .
