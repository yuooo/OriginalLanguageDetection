Except Grimaud , who entered his chamber once , the musketeer saw neither servants nor guests . 
He supposed , from the noises in the house , and the continual coming and going , that preparations were being made for the funeral of the comte . 
He wrote to the king to ask for an extension of his leave of absence . 
Grimaud , as we have said , had entered D'Artagnan 's apartment , had seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door , like a man who meditates profoundly ; then , rising , he made a sign to D'Artagnan to follow him . 
The latter obeyed in silence .
