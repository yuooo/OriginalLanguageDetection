These people arrived before the place which D'Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak , and presented themselves at the lodgings of the general . 
They were told that M. d'Artagnan , annoyed by a sortie which the governor , an artful man , had made the evening before , and in which the works had been destroyed and seventy-seven men killed , and the reparation of the breaches commenced , had just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to reconstruct the works . 
M. Colbert 's envoy had orders to go and seek M. d'Artagnan , wherever he might be , or at whatever hour of the day or night . 
He directed his course , therefore , towards the trenches , followed by his escort , all on horseback . 
They perceived M. d'Artagnan in the open plain , with his gold - laced hat , his long cane , and gilt cuffs .
