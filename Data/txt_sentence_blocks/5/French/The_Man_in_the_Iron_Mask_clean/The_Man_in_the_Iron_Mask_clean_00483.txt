The sun poured down its burning rays upon the heathen deities of marble and bronze : it raised the temperature of the water in the conch shells , and ripened , on the walls , those magnificent peaches , of which the king , fifty years later , spoke so regretfully , when , at Marly , on an occasion of a scarcity of the finer sorts of peaches being complained of , in the beautiful gardens there - gardens which had cost France double the amount that had been expended on Vaux - the great king observed to some one : `` You are far too young to have eaten any of M. Fouquet 's peaches . '' 
Oh , fame ! 
Oh , blazon of renown ! 
Oh , glory of this earth ! 
That very man whose judgment was so sound and accurate where merit was concerned - he who had swept into his coffers the inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet , who had robbed him of Lenotre and Lebrun , and had sent him to rot for the remainder of his life in one of the state prisons - merely remembered the peaches of that vanquished , crushed , forgotten enemy !
