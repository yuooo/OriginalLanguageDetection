All the troop advanced in beautiful order , at a foot 's pace , the horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses . 
There was an animation in the scene , a mirage of light , of which nothing now can give an idea , unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric spectacle . 
D'Artagnan , with an eye a little , just a little , dimmed by age , distinguished behind the group three carriages . 
The first was intended for the queen ; it was empty . 
D'Artagnan , who did not see Mademoiselle de la Valliere by the king 's side , on looking about for her , saw her in the second carriage .
