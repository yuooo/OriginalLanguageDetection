That evening D'Artagnan was seated at the king 's table , near M. Colbert and M. le Duc d'Almeda . 
The king was very gay . 
He paid a thousand little attentions to the queen , a thousand kindnesses to Madame , seated at his left hand , and very sad . 
It might have been supposed that time of calm when the king was wont to watch his mother 's eyes for the approval or disapproval of what he had just done . 
Of mistresses there was no question at this dinner .
