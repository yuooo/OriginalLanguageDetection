I come to you . 
A barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity , far from mankind , deprived of every joy . 
I will make you sit down beside me ; I will buckle round your waist our father 's sword . 
Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put down or restrain me ? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood ? '
