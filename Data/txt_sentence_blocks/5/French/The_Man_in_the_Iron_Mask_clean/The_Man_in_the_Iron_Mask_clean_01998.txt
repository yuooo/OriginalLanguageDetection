As to Master Aramis , he is always full of resources , and I am easy on his account . 
But , no , no ; Porthos is not yet an invalid , nor is Aramis in his dotage . 
The one with his arm , the other with his imagination , will find work for his majesty 's soldiers . 
Who knows if these brave men may not get up for the edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of Saint - Gervais ! 
I do n't despair of it .
