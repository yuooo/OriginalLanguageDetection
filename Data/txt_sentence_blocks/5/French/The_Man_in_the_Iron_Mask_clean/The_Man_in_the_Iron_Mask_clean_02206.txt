never have I suffered so much as now ; because then I hoped , desired , - now I have no longer anything to wish for ; because this death drags all my joy into the tomb ; because I can no longer dare to love without remorse , and I feel that he whom I love - oh !

- will repay me with the tortures I have made others undergo . ''
