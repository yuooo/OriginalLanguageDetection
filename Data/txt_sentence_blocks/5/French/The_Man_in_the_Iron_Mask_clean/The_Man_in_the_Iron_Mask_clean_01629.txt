`` About this , sire ; monsieur - monsieur , who could not guess your majesty 's orders , and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M. Fouquet ; monsieur , who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for his patron of yesterday - has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of M. Fouquet , and , under the pretense of securing the surintendant 's papers , they have taken away the furniture . 
My musketeers have been posted round the house all the morning ; such were my orders . 
Why did any one presume to order them to enter ? 
Why , by forcing them to assist in this pillage , have they been made accomplices in it ?
