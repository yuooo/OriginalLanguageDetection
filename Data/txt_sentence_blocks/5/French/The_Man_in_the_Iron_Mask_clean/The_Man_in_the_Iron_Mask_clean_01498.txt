The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together .

Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity .
