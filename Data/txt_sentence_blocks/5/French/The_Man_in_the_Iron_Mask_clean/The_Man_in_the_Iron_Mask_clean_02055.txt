Great they will be , I feel - but , if by chance I should not think them so ? 
I have seen war , sire , I have seen peace ; I have served Richelieu and Mazarin ; I have been scorched with your father , at the fire of Rochelle ; riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve , having grown a new skin ten times , as serpents do . 
After affronts and injustices , I have a command which was formerly something , because it gave the bearer the right of speaking as he liked to his king . 
But your captain of the musketeers will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors . 
Truly , sire , if that is to be my employment from this time , seize the opportunity of our being on good terms , to take it from me .
