`` I have told you , '' pursued Louis XIV. , `` that I would one day be an affectionate , generous , and constant master . 
You are now the only man of former times worthy of my anger or my friendship . 
I will not spare you either sentiment , according to your conduct . 
Could you serve a king , Monsieur d'Artagnan , who should have a hundred kings , his equals , in the kingdom ? 
Could I , tell me , do with such weak instruments the great things I meditate ?
