You will love me , because , however charming a new love may appear to you , God has not made me in anything inferior to him you have chosen , and because my devotedness , my sacrifice , and my painful end will assure me , in your eyes , a certain superiority over him . 
I have allowed to escape , in the candid credulity of my heart , the treasure I possessed . 
Many people tell me that you loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much . 
That idea takes from my mind all bitterness , and leads me only to blame myself . 
You will accept this last farewell , and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished , and where all love endures forever .
