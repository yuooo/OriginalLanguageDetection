It was to this place the somber coffins were carried , attended by a silent and respectful crowd . 
The office of the dead being celebrated , the last adieux paid to the noble departed , the assembly dispersed , talking , along the roads , of the virtues and mild death of the father , of the hopes the son had given , and of his melancholy end upon the arid coast of Africa . 
Little by little , all noises were extinguished , like the lamps illuminating the humble nave . 
The minister bowed for the last time to the altar and the still fresh graves ; then , followed by his assistant , he slowly took the road back to the presbytery . 
D'Artagnan , left alone , perceived that night was coming on .
