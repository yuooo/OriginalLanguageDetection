`` Monseigneur , I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and intelligence , so much real bravery , as in Raoul ; but if he failed to arrange your embarkation , you would only meet the fate that you deserve . ''

`` Monseigneur , to provision a fleet , to assemble a flotilla , to enroll your maritime force , would take an admiral a year . 
Raoul is a cavalry officer , and you allow him a fortnight ! ''
