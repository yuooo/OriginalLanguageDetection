In this way , both of them , leaving the candles burning , awaited the first dawn of the day ; and when Fouquet happened to sigh too loudly , D'Artagnan only snored the louder . 
Not a single visit , not even from Aramis , disturbed their quietude : not a sound even was heard throughout the whole vast palace . 
Outside , however , the guards of honor on duty , and the patrol of musketeers , paced up and down ; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel walks . 
It seemed to act as an additional soporific for the sleepers , while the murmuring of the wind through the trees , and the unceasing music of the fountains whose waters tumbled in the basin , still went on uninterruptedly , without being disturbed at the slight noises and items of little moment that constitute the life and death of human nature . 
: The Morning .
