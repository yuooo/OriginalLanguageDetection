It was a strange thing that in this chaos , in which Athos distinguished raised arms , in which he heard cries , sobs , and groans , he did not see one human figure . 
The cannon thundered at a distance , musketry madly barked , the sea moaned , flocks made their escape , bounding over the verdant slope . 
But not a soldier to apply the match to the batteries of cannon , not a sailor to assist in maneuvering the fleet , not a shepherd in charge of the flocks . 
After the ruin of the village , the destruction of the forts which dominated it , a ruin and destruction magically wrought without the co-operation of a single human being , the flames were extinguished , the smoke began to subside , then diminished in intensity , paled and disappeared entirely . 
Night then came over the scene ; night dark upon the earth , brilliant in the firmament .
