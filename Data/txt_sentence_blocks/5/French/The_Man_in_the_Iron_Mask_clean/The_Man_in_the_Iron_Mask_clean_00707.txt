Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison ? 
and were not the walls still stronger ? 
M. de Baisemeaux , thoroughly impressed with what Aramis had told him , and in perfect conformity with the king 's order , hoped only that one thing might happen ; namely , that the madman Marchiali might be mad enough to hang himself to the canopy of his bed , or to one of the bars of the window . 
In fact , the prisoner was anything but a profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux , and became more annoying than agreeable to him . 
These complications of Seldon and Marchiali - the complications first of setting at liberty and then imprisoning again , the complications arising from the strong likeness in question - had at last found a very proper denouement .
