Aramis , who followed him step by step in his thoughts , as in his walk , concluded that the event he was expecting would not be long before it was announced . 
This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the bishop of Vannes , and had he received for every annoyance which he inflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis , he could not have done better . 
During the whole of the day the king , who , in all probability , wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which disturbed his mind , seemed to seek La Valliere 's society as actively as he seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet . 
The evening came .
