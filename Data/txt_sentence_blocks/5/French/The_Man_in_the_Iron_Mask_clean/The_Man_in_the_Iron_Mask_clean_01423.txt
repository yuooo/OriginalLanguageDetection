As Gourville had seen , the king 's musketeers were mounting and following their captain . 
The latter , who did not like to be confined in his proceedings , left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant , and set off on post horses , recommending his men to use all diligence . 
However rapidly they might travel , they could not arrive before him . 
He had time , in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs , to see something which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture . 
He saw M. Colbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage , which was stationed before the door .
