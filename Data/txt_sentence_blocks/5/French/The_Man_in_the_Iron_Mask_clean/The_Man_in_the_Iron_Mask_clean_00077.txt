`` In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor mirrors ? '' 
`` What are those two words , and what is their meaning ? '' 
asked the young man ; `` I have no sort of knowledge of them . '' 
`` They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects ; so that , for instance , you may see in them your own lineaments , as you see mine now , with the naked eye . '' 
`` No ; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house , '' answered the young man .
