The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin 's doors were closed , while a servant , standing before them , was explaining to the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M. Percerin could not receive anybody . 
It was bruited about outside still , on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom he favored , in confidence , that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes for the king , and that , owing to the urgency of the case , he was meditating in his office on the ornaments , colors , and cut of these five suits . 
Some , contented with this reason , went away again , contented to repeat the tale to others , but others , more tenacious , insisted on having the doors opened , and among these last three Blue Ribbons , intended to take parts in a ballet , which would inevitably fail unless the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great Percerin himself . 
D'Artagnan , pushing on Porthos , who scattered the groups of people right and left , succeeded in gaining the counter , behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer queries . 
-LRB- We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos like the rest , but D'Artagnan , showing himself , pronounced merely these words , `` The king 's order , '' and was let in with his friend . -RRB-
