`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . ''
