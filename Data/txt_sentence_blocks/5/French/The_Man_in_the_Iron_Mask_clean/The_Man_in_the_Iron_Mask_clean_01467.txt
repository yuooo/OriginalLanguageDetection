Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy .
