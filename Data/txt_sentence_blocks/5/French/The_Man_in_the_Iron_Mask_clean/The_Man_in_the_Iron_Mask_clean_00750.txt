Fouquet drew a deep sigh , rose from his seat , took three or four turns in his room , and finished by seating himself , with an expression of extreme dejection , upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings , and costliest lace . 
D'Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the deepest and sincerest pity . 
`` I have seen a good many men arrested in my life , '' said the musketeer , sadly ; `` I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested , though I was very young then . 
I have seen M. de Conde arrested with the princes ; I have seen M. de Retz arrested ; I have seen M. Broussel arrested . 
Stay a moment , monseigneur , it is disagreeable to have to say , but the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was that poor fellow Broussel .
