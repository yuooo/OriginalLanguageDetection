Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more , and then , a moment after , he said : `` Where can M. d'Herblay be ? 
I dare not ask you to send for him . '' 
`` You would not ask me , because I would not do it , Monsieur Fouquet . 
People would learn it , and Aramis , who is not mixed up with the affair , might possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace . '' 
`` I will wait here till daylight , '' said Fouquet .
