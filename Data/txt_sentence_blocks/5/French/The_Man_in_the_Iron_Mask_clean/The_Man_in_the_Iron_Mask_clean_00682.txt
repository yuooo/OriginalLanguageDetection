Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded ; in other words , the weak suffer more , where the trial is the same , than the strong . 
And what are the elementary principles , we may ask , that compose human strength ? 
Is it not - more than anything else - exercise , habit , experience ? 
We shall not even take the trouble to demonstrate this , for it is an axiom in morals , as in physics . 
When the young king , stupefied and crushed in every sense and feeling , found himself led to a cell in the Bastile , he fancied death itself is but a sleep ; that it , too , has its dreams as well ; that the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux ; that death had resulted from the occurrence ; and that , still carrying out his dream , the king , Louis XIV. , now no longer living , was dreaming one of those horrors , impossible to realize in life , which is termed dethronement , imprisonment , and insult towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power .
