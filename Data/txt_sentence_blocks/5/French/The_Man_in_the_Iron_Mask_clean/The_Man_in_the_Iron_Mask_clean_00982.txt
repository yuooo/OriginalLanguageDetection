Philippe opened his folding doors , and several persons entered silently . 
Philippe did not stir whilst his valets de chambre dressed him . 
He had watched , the evening before , all the habits of his brother , and played the king in such a manner as to awaken no suspicion . 
He was thus completely dressed in hunting costume when he received his visitors . 
His own memory and the notes of Aramis announced everybody to him , first of all Anne of Austria , to whom Monsieur gave his hand , and then Madame with M. de Saint-Aignan .
