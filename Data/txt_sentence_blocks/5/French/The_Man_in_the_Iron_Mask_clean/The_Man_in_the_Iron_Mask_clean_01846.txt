The arms , eight muskets , and as many horse-pistols , were in good condition , and all loaded . 
There were additional oars , in case of accident , and that little sail called trinquet , which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row , and is so useful when the breeze is slack . 
When Aramis had seen to all these things , and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection , `` Let us consult Porthos , '' said he , `` to know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto , following the descent and the shade of the cavern , or whether it be better , in the open air , to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes , leveling the road of the little beach , which is but twenty feet high , and gives , at high tide , three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom . '' 
`` It must be as you please , monseigneur , '' replied the skipper Yves , respectfully ; `` but I do n't believe that by the slope of the cavern , and in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat , the road will be so convenient as the open air . 
I know the beach well , and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden ; the interior of the grotto , on the contrary , is rough ; without reckoning , monseigneur , that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea , and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it .
