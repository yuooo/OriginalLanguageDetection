`` Monseigneur ! '' 
said Aramis , smiling . 
`` I admit that , whoever would do this much for me , would seem more than mortal in my eyes ; but as you tell me I am a prince , brother of the king , how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my brother have deprived me of ? 
And as , to effect this , I must pass a life of war and hatred , how can you cause me to prevail in those combats - render me invulnerable by my enemies ? 
Ah !
