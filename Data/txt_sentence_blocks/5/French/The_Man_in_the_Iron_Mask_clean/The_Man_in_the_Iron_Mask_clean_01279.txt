Please to understand , Raoul , that it is never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force . 
If your heart says to you , ` Go there , or die , ' why go , Raoul . 
Was she base or brave , she whom you loved , in preferring the king to you , the king whom her heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you ? 
No , she was the bravest of women . 
Do , then , as she has done .
