On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! ''
