-- bum ! 
bum ! 
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quit -- and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager . 
The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but I had n't any clothes on , and did n't mind . 
We did n't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them .
