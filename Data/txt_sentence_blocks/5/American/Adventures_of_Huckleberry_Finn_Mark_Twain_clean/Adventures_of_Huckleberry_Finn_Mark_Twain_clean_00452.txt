It come all the way from Philadelphia , they said . 
There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table . 
One was a big family Bible full of pictures . 
One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why . 
I read considerable in it now and then .
