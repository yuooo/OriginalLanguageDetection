So I done it . 
But I das n't go fur , or she 'd a sent for me . 
And when it was late in the day the people all went , and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and `` Sid , '' and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightning-rod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we did n't never want to try THAT no more . 
And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before ; and then she said she 'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harum - scarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm had n't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done . 
So then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : `` Why , lawsamercy , it 's most night , and Sid not come yet !
