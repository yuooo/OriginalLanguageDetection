I was letting ON to give up sin , but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all . 
I was trying to make my mouth SAY I would do the right thing and the clean thing , and go and write to that nigger 's owner and tell where he was ; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie , and He knowed it . 
You ca n't pray a lie -- I found that out . 
So I was full of trouble , full as I could be ; and did n't know what to do . 
At last I had an idea ; and I says , I 'll go and write the letter -- and then see if I can pray .
