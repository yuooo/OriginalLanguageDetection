But the next day I went exploring around down through the island . 
I was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and I wanted to know all about it ; but mainly I wanted to put in the time . 
I found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green razberries ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show . 
They would all come handy by and by , I judged . 
Well , I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I war n't far from the foot of the island .
