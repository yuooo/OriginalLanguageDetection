I laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it . 
The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; I never knowed it before . 
And how far a body can hear on the water such nights ! 
I heard people talking at the ferry landing . 
I heard what they said , too -- every word of it .
