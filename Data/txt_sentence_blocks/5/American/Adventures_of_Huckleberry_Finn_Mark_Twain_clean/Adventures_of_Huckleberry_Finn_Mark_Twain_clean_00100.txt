He got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him . 
Well , WAS N'T he mad ? 
He said he would show who was Huck Finn 's boss . 
So he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there war n't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was . 
He kept me with him all the time , and I never got a chance to run off .
