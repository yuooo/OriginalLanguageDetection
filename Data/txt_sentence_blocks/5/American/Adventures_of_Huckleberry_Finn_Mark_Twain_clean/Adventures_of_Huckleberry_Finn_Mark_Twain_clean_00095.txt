I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week . 
But he said HE was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for HIM . 
When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him . 
So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak . 
And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
