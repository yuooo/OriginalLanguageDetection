But of course we thought of the right way at last -- which was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie . 
So then we laid in with Jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with . 
We let on it took nine months to make it . 
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it would n't go into the pie . 
Being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we 'd a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose .
