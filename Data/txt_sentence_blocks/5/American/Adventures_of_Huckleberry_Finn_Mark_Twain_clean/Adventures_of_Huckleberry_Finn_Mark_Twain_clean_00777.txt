They 've got to stand it yet a while . 
They might suspicion something if all of you was to go . 
I do n't want you to see them , nor your sisters , nor nobody in this town ; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something . 
No , you go right along , Miss Mary Jane , and I 'll fix it with all of them . 
I 'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you 've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change , or to see a friend , and you 'll be back to-night or early in the morning . ''
