`` Oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful . 
Why , looky here . 
There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter , most as white as a white man . 
He had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silver - headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State . 
And what do you think ?
