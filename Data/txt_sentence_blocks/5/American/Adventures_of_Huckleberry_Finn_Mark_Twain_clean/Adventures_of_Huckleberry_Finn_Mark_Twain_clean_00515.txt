It 's lovely to live on a raft . 
We had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened . 
Jim he allowed they was made , but I allowed they happened ; I judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many . 
Jim said the moon could a LAID them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so I did n't say nothing against it , because I 've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done . 
We used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down .
