Well , I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked , and so I war n't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , `` There was the Sunday-school , you could a gone to it ; and if you 'd a done it they 'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I 'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire . '' 
It made me shiver . 
And I about made up my mind to pray , and see if I could n't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better . 
So I kneeled down . 
But the words would n't come .
