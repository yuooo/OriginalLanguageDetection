So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , Jim a - making his 'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon , Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms . 
By and by he said he 'd struck so many good ones he did n't hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he 'd decide on . 
He says : `` On the scutcheon we 'll have a bend OR in the dexter base , a saltire MURREY in the fess , with a dog , couchant , for common charge , and under his foot a chain embattled , for slavery , with a chevron VERT in a chief engrailed , and three invected lines on a field AZURE , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ; crest , a runaway nigger , SABLE , with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ; and a couple of gules for supporters , which is you and me ; motto , MAGGIORE FRETTA , MINORE OTTO . 
Got it out of a book -- means the more haste the less speed . ''
