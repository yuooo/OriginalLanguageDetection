If they did n't find them -- I could n't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , I could n't think about nothing else . 
It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip . 
He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up . 
When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow . 
And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody had n't thought to fetch a lantern .
