But I war n't comfortable long , because I happened to think of something . 
I knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face . 
So I knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes . 
So I was uncomfortable again . 
I judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though I wished he would n't .
