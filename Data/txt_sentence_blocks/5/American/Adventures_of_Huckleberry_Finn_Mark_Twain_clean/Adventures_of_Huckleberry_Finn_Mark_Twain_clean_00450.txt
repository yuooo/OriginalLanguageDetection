They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log . 
There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it . 
It was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out . 
They would n't took any money for her . 
Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
