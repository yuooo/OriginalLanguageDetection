They had pictures hung on the walls -- mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes , and battles , and Highland Marys , and one called `` Signing the Declaration . '' 
There was some that they called crayons , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old . 
They was different from any pictures I ever see before -- blacker , mostly , than is common . 
One was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping willow , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule , and underneath the picture it said `` Shall I Never See Thee More Alas . '' 
Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said `` I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas .
