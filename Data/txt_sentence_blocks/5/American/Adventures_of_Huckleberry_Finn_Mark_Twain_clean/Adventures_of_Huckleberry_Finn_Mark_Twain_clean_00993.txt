Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch . 
By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk . 
He says : `` Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . '' 
`` Tools ? '' 
I says .
