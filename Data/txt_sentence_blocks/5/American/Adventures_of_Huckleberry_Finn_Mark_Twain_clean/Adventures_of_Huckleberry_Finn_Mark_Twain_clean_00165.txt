I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper . 
Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast . 
When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ai n't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you ca n't stay so , you soon get over it . 
And so for three days and nights . 
No difference -- just the same thing .
