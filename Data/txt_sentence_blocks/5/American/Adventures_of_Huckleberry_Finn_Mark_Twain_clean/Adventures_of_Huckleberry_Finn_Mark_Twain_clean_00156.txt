I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat 's side . 
You see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top . 
I was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke . 
So I set there and watched the cannon - smoke and listened to the boom . 
The river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat .
