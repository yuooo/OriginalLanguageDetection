I begun to tell about Sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the English Wilkses , and so on ; but I did n't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and Levi Bell , the lawyer , says : `` Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you . 
I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice . 
You do it pretty awkward . '' 
I did n't care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway . 
The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : `` If you 'd been in town at first , Levi Bell -- '' The king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : `` Why , is this my poor dead brother 's old friend that he 's wrote so often about ? ''
