Two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and I did n't see how I 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time . 
I did n't want to go back no more . 
I had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now I took to it again because pap had n't no objections . 
It was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around . 
But by and by pap got too handy with his hick ` ry , and I could n't stand it .
