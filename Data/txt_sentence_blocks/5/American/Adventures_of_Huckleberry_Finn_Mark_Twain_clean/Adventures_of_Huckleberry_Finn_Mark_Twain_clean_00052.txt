But there war n't no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants . 
It war n't anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that . 
We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut . 
I did n't see no di ` monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so . 
He said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things .
