`` En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck . 
It ` uz planned beautiful , en it ` uz done beautiful ; en dey ai n't NOBODY kin git up a plan dat 's mo ' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz . '' 
We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg .
