They dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad Panama hats . 
Then there was Miss Charlotte ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father . 
She was beautiful . 
So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind . 
She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
