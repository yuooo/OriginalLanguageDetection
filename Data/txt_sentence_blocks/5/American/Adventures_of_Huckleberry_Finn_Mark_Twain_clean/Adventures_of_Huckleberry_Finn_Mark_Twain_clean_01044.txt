But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along , for if that rope ladder would n't cramp him down to business I do n't know nothing what I 'm talking about , and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time , too . 
Nat did n't look when we put the witch pie in Jim 's pan ; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ; and so Jim got everything all right , and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick , and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole . 
MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job , and so was the saw ; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all . 
That 's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall . 
But he had to have it ; Tom said he 'd GOT to ; there war n't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind , and his coat of arms .
