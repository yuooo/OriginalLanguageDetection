Well , by this time I was most down to the foot of the island . 
A little ripply , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done . 
I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods . 
I sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves . 
I see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river .
