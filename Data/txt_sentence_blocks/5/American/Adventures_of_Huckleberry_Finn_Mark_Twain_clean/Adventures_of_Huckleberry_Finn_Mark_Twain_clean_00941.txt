It was a dreadful thing to see . 
Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another . 
We see we was too late -- could n't do no good . 
We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them . 
So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing .
