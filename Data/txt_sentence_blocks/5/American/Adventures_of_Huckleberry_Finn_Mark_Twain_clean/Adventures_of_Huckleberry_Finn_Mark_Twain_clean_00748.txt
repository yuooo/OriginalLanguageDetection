Next day was auction day . 
About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up , and I see by their look that there was trouble . 
The king says : `` Was you in my room night before last ? '' 
`` No , your majesty '' -- which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang war n't around . 
`` Was you in there yisterday er last night ? ''
