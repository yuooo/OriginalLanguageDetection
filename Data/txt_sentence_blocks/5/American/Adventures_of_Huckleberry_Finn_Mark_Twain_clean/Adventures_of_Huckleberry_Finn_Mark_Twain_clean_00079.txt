His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines . 
It was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers . 
There war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white , a fish-belly white . 
As for his clothes -- just rags , that was all . 
He had one ankle resting on t ` other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then .
