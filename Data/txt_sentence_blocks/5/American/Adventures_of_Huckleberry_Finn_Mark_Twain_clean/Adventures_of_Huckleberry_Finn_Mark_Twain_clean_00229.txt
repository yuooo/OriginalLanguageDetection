Well , after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco . 
I went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there . 
I killed him , and curled him up on the foot of Jim 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when Jim found him there . 
Well , by night I forgot all about the snake , and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him . 
He jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring .
