You ca n't be too careful . 
I ai n't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in WASTING it on them . 
It was a real bully circus . 
It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them -- and every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds . 
It was a powerful fine sight ; I never see anything so lovely .
