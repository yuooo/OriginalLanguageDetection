The door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked . 
Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples . 
The chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and had n't no connection with it ; and there war n't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow . 
The match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever . 
Tom was joyful .
