There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they could n't come it . 
Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at . 
The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways . 
By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling . 
They started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the wood-rank , and drops one of them out of his saddle .
