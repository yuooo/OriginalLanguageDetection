Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it did n't seem right that there war n't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but I could n't seem to make it go somehow . 
They kept Emmeline 's room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there . 
The old lady took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly . 
Well , as I was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink . 
There was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , I reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing `` The Last Link is Broken '' and play `` The Battle of Prague '' on it .
