`` Smouch three , '' he says ; `` we want one to make a saw out of . '' 
`` Tom , if it ai n't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , '' I says , `` there 's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather - boarding behind the smoke-house . '' 
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : `` It ai n't no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck . 
Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them . '' 
So I done it .
