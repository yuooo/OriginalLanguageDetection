So I wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up ; and it was all I could do to keep from crying . 
WHEN they got aboard the king went for me , and shook me by the collar , and says : `` Tryin ' to give us the slip , was ye , you pup ! 
Tired of our company , hey ? '' 
I says : `` No , your majesty , we war n't -- PLEASE do n't , your majesty ! '' 
`` Quick , then , and tell us what WAS your idea , or I 'll shake the insides out o ' you ! ''
