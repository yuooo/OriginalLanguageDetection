LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea , time of the evasion ? 
-- what it was he 'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before ? 
And he said , what he had planned in his head from the start , if we got Jim out all safe , was for us to run him down the river on the raft , and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river , and then tell him about his being free , and take him back up home on a steamboat , in style , and pay him for his lost time , and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around , and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band , and then he would be a hero , and so would we . 
But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was . 
We had Jim out of the chains in no time , and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do .
