I could n't see but a little ways , but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then I run across a big old - fashioned double log-house before I noticed it . 
I was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and I knowed better than to move another peg . 
IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : `` Be done , boys ! 
Who 's there ? '' 
I says : `` It 's me . ''
