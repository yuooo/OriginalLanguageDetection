Then I turned in , with my clothes all on ; but I could n't a gone to sleep if I 'd a wanted to , I was in such a sweat to get through with the business . 
By and by I heard the king and the duke come up ; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen . 
But nothing did . 
So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones had n't begun yet ; and then I slipped down the ladder . 
I CREPT to their doors and listened ; they was snoring .
