I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence . 
There was an inch of new snow on the ground , and I seen somebody 's tracks . 
They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence . 
It was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so . 
I could n't make it out .
