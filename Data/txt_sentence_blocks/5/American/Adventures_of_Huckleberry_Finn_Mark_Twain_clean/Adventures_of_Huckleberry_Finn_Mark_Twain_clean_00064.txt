It was very curious , somehow . 
I was going to follow around , but I stooped down to look at the tracks first . 
I did n't notice anything at first , but next I did . 
There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails , to keep off the devil . 
I was up in a second and shinning down the hill .
