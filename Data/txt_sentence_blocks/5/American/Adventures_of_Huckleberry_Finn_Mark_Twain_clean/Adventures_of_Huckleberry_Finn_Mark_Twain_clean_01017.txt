He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life , and the most intellectural ; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out ; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it . 
He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year , and would be the best time on record . 
And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it . 
In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes , and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket . 
Then we went to the nigger cabins , and while I got Nat 's notice off , Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn - pone that was in Jim 's pan , and we went along with Nat to see how it would work , and it just worked noble ; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ; and there war n't ever anything could a worked better .
