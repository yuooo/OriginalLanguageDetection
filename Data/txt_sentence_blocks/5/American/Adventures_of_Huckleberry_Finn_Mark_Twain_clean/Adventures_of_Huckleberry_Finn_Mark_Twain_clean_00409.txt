Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by . 
I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom ! 
it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? '' 
`` Hold on , Parker , '' says the other man , `` here 's a twenty to put on the board for me . 
Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you 'll be all right . ''
