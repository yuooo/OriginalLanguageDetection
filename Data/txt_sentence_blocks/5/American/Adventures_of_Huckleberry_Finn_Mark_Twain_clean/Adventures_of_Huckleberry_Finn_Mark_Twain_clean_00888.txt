I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because I wanted to stop Jim 's mouth till these fellows could get away . 
I did n't want no trouble with their kind . 
I 'd seen all I wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them . 
WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like , and hot and sunshiny ; the hands was gone to the fields ; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody 's dead and gone ; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it 's spirits whispering -- spirits that 's been dead ever so many years -- and you always think they 're talking about YOU . 
As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead , too , and done with it all .
