They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but did n't wear no coats nor waistcoats , they called one another Bill , and Buck , and Hank , and Joe , and Andy , and talked lazy and drawly , and used considerable many cuss words . 
There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post , and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch . 
What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : `` Gim me a chaw ' v tobacker , Hank . '' 
`` Cai n't ; I hai n't got but one chaw left . 
Ask Bill . ''
