Pray for me ! 
I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size . 
But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind . 
She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge . 
You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand .
