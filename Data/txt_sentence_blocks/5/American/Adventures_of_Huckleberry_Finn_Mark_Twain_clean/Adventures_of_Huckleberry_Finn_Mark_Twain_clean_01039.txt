So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : `` Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther 's TEN now ! '' 
and she looked huffy and bothered both . 
But Tom says : `` Why , Aunty , I do n't think there 's ten . '' 
`` You numskull , did n't you see me COUNT 'm ? '' 
`` I know , but -- '' `` Well , I 'll count 'm AGAIN . ''
