He turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection . 
They say he was a sight to look at . 
Your uncle 's been up to the town every day to fetch you . 
And he 's gone again , not more 'n an hour ago ; he 'll be back any minute now . 
You must a met him on the road , did n't you ?
