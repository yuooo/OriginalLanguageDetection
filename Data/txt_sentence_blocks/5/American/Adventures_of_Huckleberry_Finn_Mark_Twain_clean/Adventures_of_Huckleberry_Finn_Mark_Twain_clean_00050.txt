We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned . 
All the boys did . 
We had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended . 
We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them . 
Tom Sawyer called the hogs `` ingots , '' and he called the turnips and stuff `` julery , '' and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
