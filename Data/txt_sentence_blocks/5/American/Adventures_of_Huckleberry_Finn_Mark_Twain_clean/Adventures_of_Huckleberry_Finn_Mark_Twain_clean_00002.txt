Aunt Polly -- Tom 's Aunt Polly , she is -- and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before . 
Now the way that the book winds up is this : Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich . 
We got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold . 
It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up . 
Well , Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with .
