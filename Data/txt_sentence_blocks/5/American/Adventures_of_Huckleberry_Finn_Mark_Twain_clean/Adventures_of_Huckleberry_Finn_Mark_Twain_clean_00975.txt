Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ? 
-- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes ? 
Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ? 
No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound . 
Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are .
