The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away . 
As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him . 
He did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first . 
He was awful surprised . 
He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or other -- would n't be gone long .
