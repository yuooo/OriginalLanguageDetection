I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was -- a skiff , away across the water . 
I could n't tell how many was in it . 
It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there war n't but one man in it . 
Think 's I , maybe it 's pap , though I war n't expecting him . 
He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him .
