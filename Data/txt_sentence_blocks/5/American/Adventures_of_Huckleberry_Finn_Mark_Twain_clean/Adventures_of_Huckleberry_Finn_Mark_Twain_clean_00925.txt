Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door . 
Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer . 
In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable . 
He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram . 
When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : `` Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? ''
