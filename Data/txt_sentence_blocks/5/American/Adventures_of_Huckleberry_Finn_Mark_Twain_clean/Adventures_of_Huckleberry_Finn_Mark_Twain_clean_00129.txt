I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so I knowed the river had begun to rise . 
I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town . 
The June rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down , and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill . 
I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t ` other one out for what the rise might fetch along . 
Well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck .
