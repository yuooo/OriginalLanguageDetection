I made fast and laid down under Jim 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against Jim , and says : `` Hello , Jim , have I been asleep ? 
Why did n't you stir me up ? '' 
`` Goodness gracious , is dat you , Huck ? 
En you ain ' dead -- you ain ' drownded -- you 's back agin ? 
It 's too good for true , honey , it 's too good for true .
