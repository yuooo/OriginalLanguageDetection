But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap , for when I waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and I was spinning down a big bend stern first . 
First I did n't know where I was ; I thought I was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week . 
It was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as I could see by the stars . 
I looked away down-stream , and seen a black speck on the water . 
I took after it ; but when I got to it it war n't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together .
