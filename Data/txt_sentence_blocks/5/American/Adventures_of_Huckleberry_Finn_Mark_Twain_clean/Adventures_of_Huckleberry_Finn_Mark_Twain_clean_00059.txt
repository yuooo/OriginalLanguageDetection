So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer 's lies . 
I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants , but as for me I think different . 
It had all the marks of a Sunday-school . 
WELL , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now . 
I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever .
