No , sir ; I know what I 'LL do . 
I 'll wait , and when he comes back if he says he 's got to go any more I 'll get down there , too , if I swim ; and we 'll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river ; and when Tom 's done with him we 'll give him what it 's worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore . 
So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep ; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head !
