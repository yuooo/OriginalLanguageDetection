`` They lie -- that 's how . '' 
`` Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass . 
I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich . 
I heard about it away down the river , too . 
That 's why I come .
