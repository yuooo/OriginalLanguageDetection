But as I was saying , we 'd got all the work done now , at last ; and we was all pretty much fagged out , too , but mainly Jim . 
The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but had n't got no answer , because there war n't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and I see we had n't no time to lose . 
So Tom said , now for the nonnamous letters . 
`` What 's them ? ''
