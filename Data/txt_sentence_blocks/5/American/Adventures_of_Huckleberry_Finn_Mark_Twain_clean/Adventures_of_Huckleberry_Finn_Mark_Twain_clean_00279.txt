I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around I could n't see it , for stars and shadows ai n't good to see by . 
Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still -- never saying a word . 
IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow . 
If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore ; and it was well a boat did n't come , for we had n't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a fishing-line , or anything to eat . 
We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things .
