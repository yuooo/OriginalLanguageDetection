But we got under all right , and out through the hole , swift but soft -- Jim first , me next , and Tom last , which was according to Tom 's orders . 
Now we was in the lean-to , and heard trampings close by outside . 
So we crept to the door , and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack , but could n't make out nothing , it was so dark ; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further , and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first , and him last . 
So he set his ear to the crack and listened , and listened , and listened , and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time ; and at last he nudged us , and we slid out , and stooped down , not breathing , and not making the least noise , and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file , and got to it all right , and me and Jim over it ; but Tom 's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail , and then he hear the steps coming , so he had to pull loose , which snapped the splinter and made a noise ; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out : `` Who 's that ? 
Answer , or I 'll shoot ! ''
