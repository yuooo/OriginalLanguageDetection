Here 's the law a-standing ready to take a man 's son away from him -- a man 's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising . 
Yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin ' for HIM and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him . 
And they call THAT govment ! 
That ai n't all , nuther . 
The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o ' my property .
