Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing . 
She did n't ever have to stop to think . 
He said she would slap down a line , and if she could n't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead . 
She war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful . 
Every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her `` tribute '' before he was cold .
