you 're afraid to back down -- afraid you 'll be found out to be what you are -- COWARDS -- and so you raise a yell , and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man 's coat-tail , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you 're going to do . 
The pitifulest thing out is a mob ; that 's what an army is -- a mob ; they do n't fight with courage that 's born in them , but with courage that 's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers . 
But a mob without any MAN at the head of it is BENEATH pitifulness . 
Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole . 
If any real lynching 's going to be done it will be done in the dark , Southern fashion ; and when they come they 'll bring their masks , and fetch a MAN along .
