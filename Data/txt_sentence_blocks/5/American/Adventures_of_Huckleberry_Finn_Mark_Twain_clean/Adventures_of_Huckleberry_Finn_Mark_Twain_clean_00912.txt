If I 'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well . 
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other . 
Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river . 
Then I says to myself , s ` pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat ? 
And s ` pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet ?
