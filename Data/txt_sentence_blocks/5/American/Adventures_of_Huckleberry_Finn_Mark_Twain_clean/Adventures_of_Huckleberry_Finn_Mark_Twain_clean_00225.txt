I paddled over to the Illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it . 
I crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody . 
We got home all safe . 
AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but Jim did n't want to . 
He said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha ` nt us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go a-ha ` nting around than one that was planted and comfortable .
