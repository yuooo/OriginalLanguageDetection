I did n't look at him at all . 
Jim throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; I did n't want to see him . 
There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal . 
There was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sun-bonnet , and some women 's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too . 
We put the lot into the canoe -- it might come good .
