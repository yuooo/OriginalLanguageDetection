De yuther servants wouldn ' miss me , kase dey 'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ` uz out 'n de way . 
`` Well , when it come dark I tuck out up de river road , en went ` bout two mile er more to whah dey war n't no houses . 
I 'd made up my mine ` bout what I 's agwyne to do . 
You see , ef I kep ' on tryin ' to git away afoot , de dogs ` ud track me ; ef I stole a skift to cross over , dey 'd miss dat skift , you see , en dey 'd know ` bout whah I 'd lan ' on de yuther side , en whah to pick up my track . 
So I says , a raff is what I 's arter ; it doan ' MAKE no track .
