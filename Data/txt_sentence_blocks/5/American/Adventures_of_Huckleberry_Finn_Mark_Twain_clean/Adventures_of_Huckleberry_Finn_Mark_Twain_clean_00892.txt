She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand -- and says : `` It 's YOU , at last ! 
-- AI N'T it ? '' 
I out with a `` Yes 'm '' before I thought . 
She grabbed me and hugged me tight ; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ; and the tears come in her eyes , and run down over ; and she could n't seem to hug and shake enough , and kept saying , `` You do n't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would ; but law sakes , I do n't care for that , I 'm so glad to see you ! 
Dear , dear , it does seem like I could eat you up !
