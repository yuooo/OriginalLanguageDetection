He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around . 
Well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said . 
They judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they could n't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it war n't much like a face at all . 
They said he was floating on his back in the water . 
They took him and buried him on the bank .
