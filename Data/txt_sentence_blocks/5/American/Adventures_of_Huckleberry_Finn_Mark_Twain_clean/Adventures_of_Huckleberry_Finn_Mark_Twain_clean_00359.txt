WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo , at the bottom of Illinois , where the Ohio River comes in , and that was what we was after . 
We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States , and then be out of trouble . 
Well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to . 
I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went . 
I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards .
