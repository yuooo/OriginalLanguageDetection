By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool . 
She never told me why , and I could n't make it out no way . 
I set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it . 
I says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why do n't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork ? 
Why ca n't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ?
