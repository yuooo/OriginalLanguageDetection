Nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell . 
So he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three . 
I judged he would n't come back that night . 
I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start ; then I out with my saw , and went to work on that log again . 
Before he was t ` other side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder .
