He never said nothing . 
But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking . 
Then he says : `` It ai n't no use , Huck , it ai n't a-going to work . 
If we was prisoners it would , because then we 'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we would n't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands would n't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done . 
But WE ca n't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ai n't got no time to spare .
