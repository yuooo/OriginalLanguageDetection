We could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close . 
She aimed right for us . 
Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he 's mighty smart . 
Well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be sheering off a bit . 
She was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us .
