Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill . 
And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news . 
Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town . 
Hump yourself , now ; I 'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer . '' 
I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start .
