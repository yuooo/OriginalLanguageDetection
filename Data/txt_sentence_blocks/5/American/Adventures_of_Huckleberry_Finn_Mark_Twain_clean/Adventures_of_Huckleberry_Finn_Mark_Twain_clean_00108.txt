He said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me . 
That made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; I reckoned I would n't stay on hand till he got that chance . 
The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got . 
There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a four-gallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow . 
I toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
