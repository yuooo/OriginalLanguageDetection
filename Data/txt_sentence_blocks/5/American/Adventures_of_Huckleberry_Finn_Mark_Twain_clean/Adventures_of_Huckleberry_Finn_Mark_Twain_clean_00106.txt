I got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through . 
Well , it was a good long job , but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap 's gun in the woods . 
I got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in . 
Pap war n't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self . 
He said he was down town , and everything was going wrong .
