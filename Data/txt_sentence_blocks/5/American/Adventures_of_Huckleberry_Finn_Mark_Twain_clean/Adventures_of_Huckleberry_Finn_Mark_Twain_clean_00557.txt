Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt . 
Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly . 
The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn . 
He lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and so on . 
The people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout .
