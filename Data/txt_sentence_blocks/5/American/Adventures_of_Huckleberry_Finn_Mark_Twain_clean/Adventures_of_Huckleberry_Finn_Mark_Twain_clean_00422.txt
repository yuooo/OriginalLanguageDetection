We did n't say a word for a good while . 
There war n't anything to say . 
We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin ; so what was the use to talk about it ? 
It would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still . 
By and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
