He wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning . 
Then he laid stiller , and did n't make a sound . 
I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still . 
He was laying over by the corner . 
By and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side .
