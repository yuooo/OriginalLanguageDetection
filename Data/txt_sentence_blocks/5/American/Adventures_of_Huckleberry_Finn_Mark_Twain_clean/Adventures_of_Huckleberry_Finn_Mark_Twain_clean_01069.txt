Specially , painful music ; and you ca n't get no other kind out of a jews-harp . 
It always interests them ; they come out to see what 's the matter with you . 
Yes , you 're all right ; you 're fixed very well . 
You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jews-harp ; play ` The Last Link is Broken ' -- that 's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else ; and when you 've played about two minutes you 'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come . 
And they 'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time . ''
