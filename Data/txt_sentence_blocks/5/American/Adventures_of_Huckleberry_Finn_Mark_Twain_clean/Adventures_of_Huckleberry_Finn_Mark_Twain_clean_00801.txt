So they 'd got to work that off -- I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING . 
Well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out : `` HERE 'S your opposition line ! 
here 's your two sets o ' heirs to old Peter Wilks -- and you pays your money and you takes your choice ! '' 
THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along , and a nice - looking younger one , with his right arm in a sling . 
And , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up .
