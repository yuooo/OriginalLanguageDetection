So I smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time . 
Well , she WAS in a tearing way -- just a-trembling all over , she was so mad . 
But she counted and counted till she got that addled she 'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong . 
Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west ; and she said cle ' r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she 'd skin us . 
So we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a - giving us our sailing orders , and Jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon .
