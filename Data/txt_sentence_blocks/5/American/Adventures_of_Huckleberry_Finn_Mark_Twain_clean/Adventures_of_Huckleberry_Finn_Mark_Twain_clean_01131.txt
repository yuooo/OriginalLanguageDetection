It looks foolish enough NOW , in the daytime ; but I says to myself , there 's my two poor boys asleep , ` way up stairs in that lonesome room , and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy ' t I crep ' up there and locked 'em in ! 
I DID . 
And anybody would . 
Because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o ' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos 'n I was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ai n't locked , and you -- '' She stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on me -- I got up and took a walk . 
Says I to myself , I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little .
