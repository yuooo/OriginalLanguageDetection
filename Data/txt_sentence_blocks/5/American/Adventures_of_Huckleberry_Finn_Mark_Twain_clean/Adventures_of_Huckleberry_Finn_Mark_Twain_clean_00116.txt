It was ` lection day , and I was just about to go and vote myself if I war n't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they 'd let that nigger vote , I drawed out . 
I says I 'll never vote agin . 
Them 's the very words I said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all me -- I 'll never vote agin as long as I live . 
And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why , he would n't a give me the road if I had n't shoved him out o ' the way . 
I says to the people , why ai n't this nigger put up at auction and sold ?
