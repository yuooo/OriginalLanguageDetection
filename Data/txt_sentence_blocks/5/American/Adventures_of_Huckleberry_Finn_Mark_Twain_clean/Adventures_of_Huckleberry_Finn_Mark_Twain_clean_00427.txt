Of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though I could hear her . 
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I did n't get any answer ; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was `` treading water , '' and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me . 
But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing ; so I changed off and went that way . 
It was one of these long , slanting , two-mile crossings ; so I was a good long time in getting over . 
I made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank .
