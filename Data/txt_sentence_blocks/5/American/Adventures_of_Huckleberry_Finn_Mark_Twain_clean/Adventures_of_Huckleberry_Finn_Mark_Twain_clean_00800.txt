The girls would n't say nothing because they wanted to go to England ; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson . 
I felt very good ; I judged I had done it pretty neat -- I reckoned Tom Sawyer could n't a done it no neater himself . 
Of course he would a throwed more style into it , but I ca n't do that very handy , not being brung up to it . 
Well , they held the auction in the public square , along towards the end of the afternoon , and it strung along , and strung along , and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest , up there longside of the auctioneer , and chipping in a little Scripture now and then , or a little goody-goody saying of some kind , and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how , and just spreading himself generly . 
But by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was sold -- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
