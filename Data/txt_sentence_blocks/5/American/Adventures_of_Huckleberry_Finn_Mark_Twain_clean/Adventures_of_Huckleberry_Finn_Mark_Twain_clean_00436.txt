I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , `` There , that 's enough -- put your head in . '' 
I done it , but I judged they would take it off . 
The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well . 
The old gentleman says : `` There ; I reckon it 's all right . 
Come in . ''
