It was after sun-up , and I had been sound asleep . 
Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too . 
He says : `` What you doin ' with this gun ? '' 
I judged he did n't know nothing about what he had been doing , so I says : `` Somebody tried to get in , so I was laying for him . '' 
`` Why did n't you roust me out ? ''
