Jim was laid up for four days and nights . 
Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again . 
I made up my mind I would n't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands , now that I see what had come of it . 
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time . 
And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we had n't got to the end of it yet .
