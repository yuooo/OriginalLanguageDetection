I landed below where I judged was Phelps 's place , and hid my bundle in the woods , and then filled up the canoe with water , and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her , about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank . 
Then I struck up the road , and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it , `` Phelps 's Sawmill , '' and when I come to the farm-houses , two or three hundred yards further along , I kept my eyes peeled , but did n't see nobody around , though it was good daylight now . 
But I did n't mind , because I did n't want to see nobody just yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land . 
According to my plan , I was going to turn up there from the village , not from below . 
So I just took a look , and shoved along , straight for town .
