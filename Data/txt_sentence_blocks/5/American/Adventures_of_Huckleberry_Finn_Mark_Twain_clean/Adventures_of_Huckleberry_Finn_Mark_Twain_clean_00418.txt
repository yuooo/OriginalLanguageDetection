Jim was awful disappointed , but I said never mind , Cairo would be the next place , I reckoned . 
We passed another town before daylight , and I was going out again ; but it was high ground , so I did n't go . 
No high ground about Cairo , Jim said . 
I had forgot it . 
We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank .
