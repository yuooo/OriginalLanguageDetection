She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her . 
I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still . 
I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could . 
Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river . 
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
