`` Yes , '' says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , `` WE did . '' 
After about a half a minute the king drawls out : `` Leastways , I did . '' 
The duke says , the same way : `` On the contrary , I did . '' 
The king kind of ruffles up , and says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to ? '' 
The duke says , pretty brisk : `` When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was YOU referring to ? ''
