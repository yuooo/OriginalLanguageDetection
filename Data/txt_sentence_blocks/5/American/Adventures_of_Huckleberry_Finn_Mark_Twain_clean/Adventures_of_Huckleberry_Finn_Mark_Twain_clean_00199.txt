And Jim said you must n't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck . 
The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown . 
And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die . 
Jim said bees would n't sting idiots ; but I did n't believe that , because I had tried them lots of times myself , and they would n't sting me . 
I had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them .
