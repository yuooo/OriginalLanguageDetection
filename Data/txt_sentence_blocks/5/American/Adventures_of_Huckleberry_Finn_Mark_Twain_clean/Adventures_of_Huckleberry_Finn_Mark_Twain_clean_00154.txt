There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there . 
A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly . 
I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- did n't want to get up and cook breakfast . 
Well , I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of `` boom ! '' 
away up the river .
