I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking . 
My new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and I was dog - tired . 
WELL , I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she did n't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could . 
Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it . 
She told me to pray every day , and whatever I asked for I would get it .
