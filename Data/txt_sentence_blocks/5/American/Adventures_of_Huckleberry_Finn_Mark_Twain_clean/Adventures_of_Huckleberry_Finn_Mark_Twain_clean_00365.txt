It war n't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes . 
It had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .

No , you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you do n't think to yourself how fast YOU 'RE going , but you catch your breath and think , my !
