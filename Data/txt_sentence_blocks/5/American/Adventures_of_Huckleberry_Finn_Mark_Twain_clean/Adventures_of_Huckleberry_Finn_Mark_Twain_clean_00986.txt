`` Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too . '' 
`` PRISONERS do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins . 
They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall . 
THEY would n't use a goose-quill if they had it . 
It ai n't regular . ''
