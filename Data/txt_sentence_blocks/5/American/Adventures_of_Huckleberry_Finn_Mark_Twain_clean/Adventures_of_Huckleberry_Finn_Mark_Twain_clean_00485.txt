Says I to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament . 
So I give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with `` HALF-PAST TWO '' wrote on it with a pencil . 
I ransacked it , but could n't find anything else . 
I could n't make anything out of that , so I put the paper in the book again , and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me . 
She pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said I was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody .
