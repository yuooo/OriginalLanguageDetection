I slipped up and peeped in at the window . 
There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table . 
I did n't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you could n't start a face in that town that I did n't know . 
Now this was lucky , because I was weakening ; I was getting afraid I had come ; people might know my voice and find me out . 
But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know ; so I knocked at the door , and made up my mind I would n't forget I was a girl .
