We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet 's nest , but we did n't . 
The family was at home . 
We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we 'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it . 
Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient . 
And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ?
