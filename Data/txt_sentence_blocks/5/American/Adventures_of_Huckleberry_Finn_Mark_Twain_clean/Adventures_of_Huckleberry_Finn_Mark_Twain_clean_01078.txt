You 'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you did n't want them . 
Well , they was handsome and striped , and there war n't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she could n't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it did n't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out . 
I never see such a woman . 
And you could hear her whoop to Jericho . 
You could n't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs .
