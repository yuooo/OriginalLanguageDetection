Why do n't your juries hang murderers ? 
Because they 're afraid the man 's friends will shoot them in the back , in the dark -- and it 's just what they WOULD do . 
`` So they always acquit ; and then a MAN goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal . 
Your mistake is , that you did n't bring a man with you ; that 's one mistake , and the other is that you did n't come in the dark and fetch your masks . 
You brought PART of a man -- Buck Harkness , there -- and if you had n't had him to start you , you 'd a taken it out in blowing .
