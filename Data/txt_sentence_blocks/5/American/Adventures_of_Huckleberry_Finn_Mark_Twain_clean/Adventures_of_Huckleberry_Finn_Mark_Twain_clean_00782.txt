It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night . 
I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane . '' 
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : `` GOOD-bye . 
I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha 'n' t ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll PRAY for you , too ! '' 
-- and she was gone .
