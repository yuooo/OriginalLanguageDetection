It ai n't my fault I war n't born a duke , it ai n't your fault you war n't born a king -- so what 's the use to worry ? 
Make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says I -- that 's my motto . 
This ai n't no bad thing that we 've struck here -- plenty grub and an easy life -- come , give us your hand , duke , and le 's all be friends . '' 
The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it . 
It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others .
