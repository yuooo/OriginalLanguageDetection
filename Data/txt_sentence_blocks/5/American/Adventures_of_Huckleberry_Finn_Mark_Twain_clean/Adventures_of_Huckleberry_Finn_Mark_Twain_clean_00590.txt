I was scared , but a man says : `` He do n't mean nothing ; he 's always a-carryin ' on like that when he 's drunk . 
He 's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober . '' 
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : `` Come out here , Sherburn ! 
Come out and meet the man you 've swindled . 
You 're the houn ' I 'm after , and I 'm a-gwyne to have you , too ! ''
