She called them tributes . 
The neighbors said it was the doctor first , then Emmeline , then the undertaker -- the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was Whistler . 
She war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long . 
Poor thing , many 's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little . 
I liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us .
