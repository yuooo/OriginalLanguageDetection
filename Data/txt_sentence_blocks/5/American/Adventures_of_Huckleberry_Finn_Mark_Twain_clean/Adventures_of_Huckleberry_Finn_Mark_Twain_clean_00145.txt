I set up and looked around , a little scared . 
Then I remembered . 
The river looked miles and miles across . 
The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore . 
Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and SMELT late .
