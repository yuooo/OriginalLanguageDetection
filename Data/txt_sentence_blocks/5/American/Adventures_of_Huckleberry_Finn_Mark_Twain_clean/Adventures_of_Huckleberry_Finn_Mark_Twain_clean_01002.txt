Then his next move will be to advertise Jim , or something like that . 
So we ca n't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to . 
By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years ; but we ca n't . 
Things being so uncertain , what I recommend is this : that we really dig right in , as quick as we can ; and after that , we can LET ON , to ourselves , that we was at it thirty-seven years . 
Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there 's an alarm .
