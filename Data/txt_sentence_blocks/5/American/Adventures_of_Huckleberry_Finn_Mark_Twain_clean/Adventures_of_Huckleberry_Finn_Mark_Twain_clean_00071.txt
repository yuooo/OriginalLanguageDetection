So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for I found his tracks in the snow . 
What I wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ? 
Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor . 
It fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch . 
Jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same .
