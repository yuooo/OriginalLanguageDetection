WELL , den , is JIM gywne to say it ? 
No , sah -- I doan ' budge a step out 'n dis place ` dout a DOCTOR , not if it 's forty year ! '' 
I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he 'd say what he did say -- so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor . 
He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and would n't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we would n't let him . 
Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it did n't do no good .
