He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office -- horse bills -- and took the money , four dollars . 
And he had got in ten dollars ' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance -- so they done it . 
The price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash . 
He set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own head -- three verses -- kind of sweet and saddish -- the name of it was , `` Yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heart '' -- and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and did n't charge nothing for it . 
Well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he 'd done a pretty square day 's work for it .
