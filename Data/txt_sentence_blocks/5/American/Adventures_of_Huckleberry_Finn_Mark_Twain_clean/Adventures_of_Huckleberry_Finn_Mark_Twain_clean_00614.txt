The minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down . 
And at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t ` other one on t ` other side , and the people just crazy . 
It war n't funny to me , though ; I was all of a tremble to see his danger . 
But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle , a-reeling this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood ! 
and the horse a-going like a house afire too .
