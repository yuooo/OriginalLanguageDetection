The river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise . 
By and by along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fast together . 
We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore . 
Then we had dinner . 
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that war n't pap 's style .
