It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever . 
Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter . 
Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy . 
It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard . 
Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he 's in pretty hard luck .
