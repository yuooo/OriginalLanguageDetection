And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody . 
Then somebody sings out , `` Take up a collection for him , take up a collection ! '' 
Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , `` Let HIM pass the hat around ! '' 
Then everybody said it , the preacher too . 
So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times -- and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
