Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States . 
He said twenty mile more war n't far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there . 
Towards daybreak we tied up , and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good . 
Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit rafting . 
That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend .
