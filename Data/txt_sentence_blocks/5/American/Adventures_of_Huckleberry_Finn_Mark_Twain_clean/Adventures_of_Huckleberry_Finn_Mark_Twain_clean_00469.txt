The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses . 
One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming . 
We was crossing the road . 
Buck says : `` Quick ! 
Jump for the woods ! ''
