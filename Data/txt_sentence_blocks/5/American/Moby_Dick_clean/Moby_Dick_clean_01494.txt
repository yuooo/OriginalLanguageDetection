What a leg this is ! 
It looks like a real live leg , filed down to nothing but the core ; he 'll be standing on this to-morrow ; he 'll be taking altitudes on it . 
Halloa ! 
I almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude . 
So , so ; chisel , file , and sand-paper , now !
