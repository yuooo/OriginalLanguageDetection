The Blanket I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale . 
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore . 
My original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion . 
The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale . 
Already you know what his blubber is .
