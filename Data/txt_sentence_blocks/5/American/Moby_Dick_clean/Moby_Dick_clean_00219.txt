After much prolonged sauntering , and many random inquiries , I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years ' voyages -- The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit , and the Pequod . 
Devil-dam , I do not know the origin of ; Tit-bit is obvious ; Pequod you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians ; now extinct as the ancient Medes . 
I peered and pryed about the Devil-Dam ; from her , hopped over to the Tit-bit ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us . 
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught I know ; -- square-toed luggers ; mountainous Japanese junks ; butter-box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod . 
She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her .
