For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth . 
It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck . 
This particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil . 
Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with -- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads . 
To sum up , then : in the Right Whale 's there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the Sperm Whale 's .
