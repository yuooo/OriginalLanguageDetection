These admeasurements I now propose to set before you . 
But first , be it recorded , that , in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied measurements I please . 
Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to , to test my accuracy . 
There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales . 
Likewise , I have heard that in the museum of Manchester , in New Hampshire , they have what the proprietors call `` the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States . ''
