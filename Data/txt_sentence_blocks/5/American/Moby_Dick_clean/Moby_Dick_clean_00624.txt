That it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock . 
In a strait-jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales . 
And , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun ` sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man 's delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone ; even then , Ahab , in his hidden self , raved on . 
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing . 
When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form .
