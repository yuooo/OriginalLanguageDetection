Had this tail any prehensile power , I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes ' elephant that so frequented the flower-market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones . 
On more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for I have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart . 
Fourth : Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten-like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth . 
But still you see his power in his play . 
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air !
