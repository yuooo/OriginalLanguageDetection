Go visit the Prairies in June , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies -- what is the one charm wanting ? 
-- Water there is not a drop of water there ! 
Were Niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ? 
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ? 
Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?
