I do n't wonder he looked so scornful at me ! 
I 'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes , they say ; but that 's only haphazard-like . 
Then , a short , little old body like me , should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall , heron-built captains ; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick , and there 's a great cry for life-boats . 
And here 's the heron 's leg ! 
long and slim , sure enough !
