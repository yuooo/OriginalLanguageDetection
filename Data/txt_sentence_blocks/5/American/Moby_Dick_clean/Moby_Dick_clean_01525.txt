The same waves wash the moles of the new-built California towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands , older than Abraham ; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles , and low-lying , endless , unknown Archipelagoes , and impenetrable Japans . 
Thus this mysterious , divine Pacific zones the world 's whole bulk about ; makes all coasts one bay to it ; seems the tide-beating heart of earth . 
Lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to Pan . 
But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab 's brain , as standing , like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles -LRB- in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking -RRB- , and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming . 
Launched at length upon these almost final waters , and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground , the old man 's purpose intensified itself .
