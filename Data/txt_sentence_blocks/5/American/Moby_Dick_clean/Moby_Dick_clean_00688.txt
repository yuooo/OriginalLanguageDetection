But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle-fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface . 
If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , Procopius 's sea-monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale . 
Surmises Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman 's ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage . 
Or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him . 
It would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted .
