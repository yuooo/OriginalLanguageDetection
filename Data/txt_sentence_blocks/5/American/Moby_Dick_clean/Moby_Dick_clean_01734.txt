When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it . 
Because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft can not always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea . 
So Ahab 's proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person 's hands . 
Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings . 
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head .
