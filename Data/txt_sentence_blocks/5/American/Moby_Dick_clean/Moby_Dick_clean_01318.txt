Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field . 
Extending it upon the forecastle deck , he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt , as an African hunter the pelt of a boa . 
This done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry . 
Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it . 
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling .
