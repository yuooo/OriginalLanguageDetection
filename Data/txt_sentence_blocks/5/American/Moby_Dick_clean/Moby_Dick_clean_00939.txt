Do n't be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour 's mout , I say . 
Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale ? 
And , by Gor , none on you has de right to dat whale ; dat whale belong to some one else . 
I know some o ' you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swallar wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat ca n't get into de scrouge to help demselves . '' 
`` Well done , old Fleece ! ''
