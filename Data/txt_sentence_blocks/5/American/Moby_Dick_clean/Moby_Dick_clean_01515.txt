will ye never have done with all this weary roving ? 
Where go ye now ? 
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ? 
Seek out one Pip , who 's now been missing long : I think he 's in those far Antilles . 
If ye find him , then comfort him ; for he must be very sad ; for look !
