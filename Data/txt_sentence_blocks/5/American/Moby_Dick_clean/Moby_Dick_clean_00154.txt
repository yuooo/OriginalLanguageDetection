He feels that his dreadful punishment is just . 
He leaves all his deliverance to God , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards His holy temple . 
And here , shipmates , is true and faithful repentance ; not clamorous for pardon , but grateful for punishment . 
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale . 
Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance .
