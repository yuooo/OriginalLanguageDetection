Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat , the gigantic negro , stooping a little , presented his flat palm to Flask 's foot , and then putting Flask 's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss , with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders . 
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . 
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas . 
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the logger head itself , under such circumstances . 
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form .
