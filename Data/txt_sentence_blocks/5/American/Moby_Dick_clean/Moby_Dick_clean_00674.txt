In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ? 
Yet I will tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat 's crew . 
For God 's sake , be economical with your lamps and candles ! 
not a gallon you burn , but at least one drop of man 's blood was spilled for it . 
Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt .
