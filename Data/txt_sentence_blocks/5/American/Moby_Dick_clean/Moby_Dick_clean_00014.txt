No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the fore-castle , aloft there to the royal mast-head . 
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a May meadow . 
And at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough . 
It touches one 's sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the Van Rensselaers , or Randolphs , or Hardicanutes . 
And more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you .
