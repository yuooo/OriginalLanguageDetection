And it was so light too ; the sun shining in at the window , and a great rattling of coaches in the streets , and the sound of gay voices all over the house . 
I felt worse and worse -- at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour : anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time . 
But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers , and back I had to go to my room . 
For several hours I lay there broad awake , feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since , even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes . 
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze ; and slowly waking from it -- half steeped in dreams -- I opened my eyes , and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness .
