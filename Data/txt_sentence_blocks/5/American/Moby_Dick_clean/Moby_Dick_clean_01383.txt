This was quickly lowered to Ahab , who at once comprehending it all , slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook -LRB- it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple tree -RRB- , and then giving the word , held himself fast , and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight , by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle . 
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head . 
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome , the other captain advanced , and Ahab , putting out his ivory leg , and crossing the ivory arm -LRB- like two sword-fish blades -RRB- cried out in his walrus way , `` Aye , aye , hearty ! 
let us shake bones together ! 
-- an arm and a leg !
