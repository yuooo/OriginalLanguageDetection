In fact , he ai n't sick ; but no , he is n't well either . 
Any how , young man , he wo n't always see me , so I do n't suppose he will thee . 
He 's a queer man , Captain Ahab -- so some think -- but a good one . 
Oh , thou ` lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear . 
He 's a grand , ungodly , god-like man , Captain Ahab ; does n't speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen .
