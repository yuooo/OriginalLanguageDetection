Some were storied weapons . 
With this once long lance , now wildly elbowed , fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset . 
And that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in Javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco . 
The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump . 
Crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low-arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room .
