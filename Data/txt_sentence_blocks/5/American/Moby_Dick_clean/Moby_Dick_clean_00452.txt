But the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first . 
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up-and-down tail . 
Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position . 
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien . 
* Hence , all the smaller , spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology .
