Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship 's water-line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards . 
`` Screwed at its axis against the side , a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah 's room ; and the ship , heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received , the lamp , flame and all , though in slight motion , still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room ; though , in truth , infallibly straight itself , it but made obvious the false , lying levels among which it hung . 
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah ; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place , and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance . 
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him . 
The floor , the ceiling , and the side , are all awry .
