it 's bad for the digestion ! 
Take a tonic , follow me ! 
-LRB- Sings , and all follow -RRB- Our captain stood upon the deck , A spy-glass in his hand , A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand . 
Oh , your tubs in your boats , my boys , And by your braces stand , And we 'll have one of those fine whales , Hand , boys , over hand ! 
So , be cheery , my lads !
