So , so ; he travels fast , and I must down . 
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there 's time for that . 
An old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and not changed a wink since I first saw it , a boy , from the sand-hills of Nantucket ! 
The same -- the same ! 
-- the same to Noah as to me .
