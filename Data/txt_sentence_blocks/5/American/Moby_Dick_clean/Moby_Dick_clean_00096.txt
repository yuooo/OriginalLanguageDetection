Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you do n't see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding . 
He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then -- still minus his trowsers -- he hunted up his boots . 
What under the heavens he did it for , I can not tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots . 
But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition state -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly . 
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner .
