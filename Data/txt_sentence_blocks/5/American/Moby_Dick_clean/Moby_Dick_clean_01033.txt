An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight , in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale . 
So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel . 
`` Cut , cut ! '' 
was the cry from the ship to the boats , which , for one instant , seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel 's side . 
But having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship .
