Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull 's complexion was darkened like a French grenadier 's , who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia . 
Her venerable bows looked bearded . 
Her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of Japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne . 
Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled . 
But to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed .
