Oh ! 
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed . 
No more . 
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne'er enjoy . 
Gifted with the high perception , I lack the low , enjoying power ; damned , most subtly and most malignantly !
