The landlord was near spraining his wrist , and I told him for heaven 's sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank . 
So gathering up the shavings with another grin , and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room , he went about his business , and left me in a brown study . 
I now took the measure of the bench , and found that it was a foot too short ; but that could be mended with a chair . 
But it was a foot too narrow , and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one -- so there was no yoking them . 
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
