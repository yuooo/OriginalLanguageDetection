In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged `` whale '' and a `` narwhale . '' 
I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys . 
Then , again , in 1825 , Bernard Germain , Count de Lacepede , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan . 
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale -LRB- that is to say the Right whale -RRB- , even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature . 
But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron .
