And besides all this , there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan , which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim . 
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor . 
Whether it was , too , that his head being shaved , his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief , and looked more expansive than it otherwise would , this I will not venture to decide ; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one . 
It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington 's head , as seen in the popular busts of him . 
It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows , which were likewise very projecting , like two long promontories thickly wooded on top .
