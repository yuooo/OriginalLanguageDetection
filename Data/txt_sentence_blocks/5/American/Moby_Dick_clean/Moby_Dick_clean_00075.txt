There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead . 
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull . 
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door , I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner . 
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back . 
I am no coward , but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension .
