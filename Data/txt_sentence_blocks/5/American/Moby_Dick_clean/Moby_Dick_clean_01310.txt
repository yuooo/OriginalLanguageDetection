In thoughts of the visions of the night , I saw long rows of angels in paradise , each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti . 
Now , while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it , in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works . 
First comes white-horse , so called , which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish , and also from the thicker portions of his flukes . 
It is tough with congealed tendons -- a wad of muscle -- but still contains some oil . 
After being severed from the whale , the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer .
