But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon . 
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last . 
As if struck by some enchanter 's wand , the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness ; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel , simultaneously with the three notes from aloft , shouted forth the accustomed cry , as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air . 
`` Clear away the boats ! 
Luff ! ''
