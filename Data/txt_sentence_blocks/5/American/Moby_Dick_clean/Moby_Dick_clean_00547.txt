Starbuck paled , and turned , and shivered . 
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin . 
Sunset The cabin ; by the stern windows ; Ahab sitting alone , and gazing out . 
I leave a white and turbid wake ; pale waters , paler cheeks , where'er I sail . 
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track ; let them ; but first I pass .
