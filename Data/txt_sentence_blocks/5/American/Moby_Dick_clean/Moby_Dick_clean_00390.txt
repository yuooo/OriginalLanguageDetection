Knights and Squires Stubb was the second mate . 
He was a native of Cape Cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a Cape-Cod-man . 
A happy-go-lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year . 
Good-humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests . 
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangements of his part of the boat , as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box .
