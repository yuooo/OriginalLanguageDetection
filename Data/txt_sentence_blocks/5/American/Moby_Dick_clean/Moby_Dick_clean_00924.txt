Furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp-edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions . 
Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse . 
Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him . 
For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery . 
All these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted .
