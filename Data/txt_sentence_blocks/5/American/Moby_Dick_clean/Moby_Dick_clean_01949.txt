ANOTHER VERSION OF THE WHALE-SHIP GLOBE NARRATIVE . 
`` The voyages of the Dutch and English to the Northern Ocean , in order , if possible , to discover a passage through it to India , though they failed of their main object , laid-open the haunts of the whale . '' 
-- MCCULLOCH 'S COMMERCIAL DICTIONARY . 
`` These things are reciprocal ; the ball rebounds , only to bound forward again ; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale , the whalemen seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West Passage . ''
