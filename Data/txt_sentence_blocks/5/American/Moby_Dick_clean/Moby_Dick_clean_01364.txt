I 've studied signs , and know their marks ; they were taught me two score years ago , by the old witch in Copenhagen . 
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ? 
The horse-shoe sign ; for there it is , right opposite the gold . 
And what 's the horse-shoe sign ? 
The lion is the horse-shoe sign -- the roaring and devouring lion .
