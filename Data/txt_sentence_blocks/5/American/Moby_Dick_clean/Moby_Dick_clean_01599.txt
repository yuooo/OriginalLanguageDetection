I would not take it . 
The lightning flashes through my skull ; mine eyeballs ache and ache ; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded , and rolling on some stunning ground . 
Oh , oh ! 
Yet blindfold , yet will I talk to thee . 
Light though thou be , thou leapest out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee !
