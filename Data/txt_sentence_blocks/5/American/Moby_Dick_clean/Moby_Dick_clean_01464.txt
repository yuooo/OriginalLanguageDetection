The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice-bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood . 
At all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works . 
A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole : the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices , and straightway files it smaller . 
A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone , and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it . 
An oarsman sprains his wrist : the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion .
