The Pequod Meets The Rachel Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly clustering with men . 
At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst , and all life fled from the smitten hull . 
`` Bad news ; she brings bad news , '' muttered the old Manxman . 
But ere her commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he could hopefully hail , Ahab 's voice was heard . 
`` Hast seen the White Whale ? ''
