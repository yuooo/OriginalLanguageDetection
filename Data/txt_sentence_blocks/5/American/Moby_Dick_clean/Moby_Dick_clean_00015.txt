The transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it . 
But even this wears off in time . 
What of it , if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ? 
What does that indignity amount to , weighed , I mean , in the scales of the New Testament ? 
Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ?
