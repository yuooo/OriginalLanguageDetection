So , cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg , after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern ; then stretching it on a waif pole , handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope . 
There , then , he sat , holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness . 
There , then , he sat , the sign and symbol of a man without faith , hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . 
Wet , drenched through , and shivering cold , despairing of ship or boat , we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on . 
The mist still spread over the sea , the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat .
