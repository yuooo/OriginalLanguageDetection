And what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain 's cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain . 
Under all these circumstances , would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale 's spine phrenologically ? 
For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord . 
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists , I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment , in reference to the Sperm Whale 's hump . 
This august hump , if I mistake not , rises over one of the larger vertebrae , and is , therefore , in some sort , the outer convex mould of it .
