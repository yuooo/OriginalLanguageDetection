So in dreams , have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell . 
But in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the Dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of Isaiah , the archangels . 
Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea , I once saw a large herd of whales in the east , all heading towards the sun , and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes . 
As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in Persia , the home of the fire worshippers . 
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant , I then testified of the whale , pronouncing him the most devout of all beings .
