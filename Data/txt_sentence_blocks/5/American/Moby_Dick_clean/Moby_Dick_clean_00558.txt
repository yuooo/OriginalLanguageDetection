Horrible old man ! 
Who 's over him , he cries ; -- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below ! 
Oh ! 
I plainly see my miserable office , -- to obey , rebelling ; and worse yet , to hate with touch of pity ! 
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up , had I it .
