Hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the Nor ' West Passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale . 
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal -LRB- near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface -RRB- ; and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse -LRB- whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage -RRB- ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen . 
Forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the White Whale had escaped alive ; it can not be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal -LRB- for immortality is but ubiquity in time -RRB- ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen . 
But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power . 
For , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out -- a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump .
