I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines . 
To mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long .

Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake . 
Look at that popular work `` Goldsmith 's Animated Nature . ''
