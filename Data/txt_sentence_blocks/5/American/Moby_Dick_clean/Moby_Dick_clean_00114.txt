The Chapel In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman 's Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot . 
I am sure that I did not . 
Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand . 
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist . 
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin , I fought my way against the stubborn storm .
