`` Now , as you well know , it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours -- watery or otherwise ; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood , straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness ; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower , and make a little heap of dust of it . 
Be this conceit of mine as it may , gentlemen , at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman , and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy 's snorting charger ; and a brain , and a heart , and a soul in him , gentlemen , which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne , had he been born son to Charlemagne 's father . 
But Radney , the mate , was ugly as a mule ; yet as hardy , as stubborn , as malicious . 
He did not love Steelkilt , and Steelkilt knew it .
