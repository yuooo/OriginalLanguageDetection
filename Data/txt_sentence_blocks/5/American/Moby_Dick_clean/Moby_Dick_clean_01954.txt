exclaimed the mate , as upon turning his head , he saw the distended jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the boat , threatening it with instant destruction ; -- ` Stern all , for your lives ! ' '' 
-- WHARTON THE WHALE KILLER . 
`` So be cheery , my lads , let your hearts never fail , While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale ! '' 
-- NANTUCKET SONG . 
`` Oh , the rare old Whale , mid storm and gale In his ocean home will be A giant in might , where might is right , And King of the boundless sea . ''
