Stubb , for one , ca n't fight it . 
You see , Mr. Starbuck , a wave has such a great long start before it leaps , all round the world it runs , and then comes the spring ! 
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here . 
But never mind ; it 's all in fun : so the old song says ; '' -- -LRB- sings . -RRB- 
Oh !
