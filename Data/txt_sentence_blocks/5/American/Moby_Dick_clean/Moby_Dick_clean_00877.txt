At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door . 
When the porter is sleepy , the anvil-headed whale would be best . 
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays . 
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weathercocks ; but they are so elevated , and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with `` Hands off ! '' 
you can not examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit .
