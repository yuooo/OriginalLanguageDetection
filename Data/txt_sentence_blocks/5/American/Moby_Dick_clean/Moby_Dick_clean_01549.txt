These are the times , when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land-like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure . 
The long-drawn virgin vales ; the mild blue hill-sides ; as over these there steals the hush , the hum ; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes , in some glad May-time , when the flowers of the woods are plucked . 
And all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half-way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole . 
Nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab . 
But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing .
