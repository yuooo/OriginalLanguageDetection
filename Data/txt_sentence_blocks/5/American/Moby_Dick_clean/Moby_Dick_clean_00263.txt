Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab 's above the common ; Ahab 's been in colleges , as well as ` mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales . 
His lance ! 
aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle ! 
Oh ! 
he ai n't Captain Bildad ; no , and he ai n't Captain Peleg ; he 's Ahab , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king ! ''
