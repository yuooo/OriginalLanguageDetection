In a word , after being tried out , the crisp , shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters , still contains considerable of its unctuous properties . 
These fritters feed the flames . 
Like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self-consuming misanthrope , once ignited , the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body . 
Would that he consumed his own smoke ! 
for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
