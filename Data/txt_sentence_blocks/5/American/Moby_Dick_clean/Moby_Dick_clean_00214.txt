In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us . 
We resumed business ; and while plying our spoons in the bowl , thinks I to myself , I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ? 
What 's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people ? 
`` But look , Queequeg , ai n't that a live eel in your bowl ? 
Where 's your harpoon ? ''
