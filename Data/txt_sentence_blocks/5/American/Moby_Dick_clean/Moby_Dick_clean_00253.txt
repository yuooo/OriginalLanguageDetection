The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay , Captain Peleg . '' 
`` Thou Bildad ! '' 
roared Peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin . 
`` Blast ye , Captain Bildad , if I had followed thy advice in these matters , I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn . ''
