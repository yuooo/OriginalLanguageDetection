Say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then . 
I could not endure the sight ; could not possibly fly his howlings ; all comfort , sleep itself , inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage . 
What , then , remains ? 
The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest . 
I stand alone here upon an open sea , with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law .
