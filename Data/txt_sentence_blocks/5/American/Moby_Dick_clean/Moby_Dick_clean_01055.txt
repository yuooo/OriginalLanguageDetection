Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale 's jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt 's eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head . 
Now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale 's eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern . 
In a word , the position of the whale 's eyes corresponds to that of a man 's ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears . 
You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it . 
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind .
