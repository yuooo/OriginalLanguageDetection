Meanwhile , others of the ship 's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works , from which the huge pots had been removed . 
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea . 
Lord and master over all this scene , the captain stood erect on the ship 's elevated quarter-deck , so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him , and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion . 
And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter-deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other 's wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed , the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene . 
`` Come aboard , come aboard ! ''
