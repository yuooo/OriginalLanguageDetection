Because , in the case of pirates , say , I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it . 
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation , indeed ; but only at the gallows . 
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude . 
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on . 
But what is a Gam ?
