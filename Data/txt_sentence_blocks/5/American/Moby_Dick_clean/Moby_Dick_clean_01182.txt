And I know one , who coming into still closer contact with the spout , whether with some scientific object in view , or otherwise , I can not say , the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm . 
Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it . 
Another thing ; I have heard it said , and I do not much doubt it , that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes , it will blind you . 
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone . 
Still , we can hypothesize , even if we can not prove and establish .
