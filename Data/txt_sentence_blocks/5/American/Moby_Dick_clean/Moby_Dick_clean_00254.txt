`` Captain Peleg , '' said Bildad steadily , `` thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I ca n't tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg . '' 
`` Fiery pit ! 
fiery pit ! 
ye insult me , man ; past all natural bearing , ye insult me . 
It 's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he 's bound to hell .
