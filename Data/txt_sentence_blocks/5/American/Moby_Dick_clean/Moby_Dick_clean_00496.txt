In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head : nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful . 
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes . 
There you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves . 
The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor . 
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .
