says old Dives , in his red silken wrapper -- -LRB- he had a redder one afterwards -RRB- pooh , pooh ! 
What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights ! 
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories ; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals . 
But what thinks Lazarus ? 
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
