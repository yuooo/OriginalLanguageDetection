We feel the floods surging over us , we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters ; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us ! 
But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches ? 
Shipmates , it is a two-stranded lesson ; a lesson to us all as sinful men , and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God . 
As sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard-heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah . 
As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command .
