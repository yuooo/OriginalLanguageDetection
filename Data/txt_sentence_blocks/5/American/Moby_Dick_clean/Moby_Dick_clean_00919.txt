According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale-boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer-oar . 
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet . 
But however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one 's compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started -- what that is none know but those who have tried it . 
For one , I can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time . 
In this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry -- `` Stand up , and give it to him ! ''
