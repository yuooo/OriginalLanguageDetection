It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest . 
Nevertheless , so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it , and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so , were they governed in this matter , that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod 's main-mast . 
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record . 
* The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin . 
For my humor 's sake , I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima , to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends , one saint 's eve , smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn .
