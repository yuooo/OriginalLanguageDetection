Through its inexpressible , strange eyes , methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God . 
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns . 
Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage . 
I can not tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then . 
But at last I awoke ; and turning , asked a sailor what bird was this .
