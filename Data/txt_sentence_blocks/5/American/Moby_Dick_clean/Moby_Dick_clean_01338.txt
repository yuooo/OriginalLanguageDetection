To dress in the dark , and eat in the dark , and stumble in darkness to his pallet , this is his usual lot . 
But the whaleman , as he seeks the food of light , so he lives in light . 
He makes his berth an Aladdin 's lamp , and lays him down in it ; so that in the pitchiest night the ship 's black hull still houses an illumination . 
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the tryworks , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat . 
He burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore .
