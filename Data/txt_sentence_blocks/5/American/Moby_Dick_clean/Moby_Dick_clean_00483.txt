Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up . 
Consider ! 
For hereby Flask 's dinner was badly jammed in point of time . 
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear . 
If Stubb even , who is but a peg higher than Flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then Flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck .
