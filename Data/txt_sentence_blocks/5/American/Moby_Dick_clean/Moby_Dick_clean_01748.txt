Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command ! 
-- when I think of all this ; only half-suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul ! 
-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world 's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ? 
wife ? 
-- rather a widow with her husband alive ?
