In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort . 
Second : This arrangement is indispensable for common safety 's sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again . 
Before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man 's oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out . 
From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms -LRB- called box-line -RRB- being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short-warp -- the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail . 
Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction .
