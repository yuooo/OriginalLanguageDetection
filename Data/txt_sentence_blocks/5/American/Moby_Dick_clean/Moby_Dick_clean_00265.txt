Captain Ahab did not name himself . 
'T was a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old . 
And yet the old squaw Tistig , at Gayhead , said that the name would somehow prove prophetic . 
And , perhaps , other fools like her may tell thee the same . 
I wish to warn thee .
