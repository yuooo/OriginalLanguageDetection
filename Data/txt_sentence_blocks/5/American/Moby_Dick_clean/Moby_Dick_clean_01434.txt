Of this seventy-two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone . 
Attached to this back-bone , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals . 
To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber . 
The ribs were ten on a side . 
The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .
