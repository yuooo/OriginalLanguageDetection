even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink . 
Be it said , however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species . 
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do . 
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free . 
But there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life .
