Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two substances are quite distinct . 
For amber , though at times found on the sea-coast , is also dug up in some far inland soils , whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea . 
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth-pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair-powders , and pomatum . 
The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter 's in Rome . 
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret , to flavor it .
