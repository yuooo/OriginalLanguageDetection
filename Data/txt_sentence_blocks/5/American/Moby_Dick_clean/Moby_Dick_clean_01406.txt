The voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the Amelia 's example was soon followed by other ships , English and American , and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open . 
But not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself : Samuel and all his Sons -- how many , their mother only knows -- and under their immediate auspices , and partly , I think , at their expense , the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea . 
Commanded by a naval Post-Captain , the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear . 
But this is not all . 
In 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan .
