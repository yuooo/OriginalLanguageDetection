So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colors , bearing down under the stern . 
Trumpet to mouth , the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-deck , his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain , who was carelessly reclining in his own boat 's bow . 
He was a darkly-tanned , burly , goodnatured , fine-looking man , of sixty or thereabouts , dressed in a spacious roundabout , that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth ; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar 's surcoat . 
`` Hast seen the White Whale ! ''
