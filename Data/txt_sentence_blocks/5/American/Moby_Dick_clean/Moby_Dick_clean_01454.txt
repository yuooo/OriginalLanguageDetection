Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo , which , not forty years ago , overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri , and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals , where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch ; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished , to show that the hunted whale can not now escape speedy extinction . 
But you must look at this matter in every light . 
Though so short a period ago -- not a good lifetime -- the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan . 
Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well , and thank God , if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish . 
Whereas , in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West , when the far west -LRB- in whose sunset suns still rise -RRB- was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated .
