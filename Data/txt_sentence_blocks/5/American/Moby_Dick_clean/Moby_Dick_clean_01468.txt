Yet , as previously hinted , this omnitooled , open-and-shut carpenter , was , after all , no mere machine of an automaton . 
If he did not have a common soul in him , he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty . 
What that was , whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn , there is no telling . 
But there it was ; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more . 
And this it was , this same unaccountable , cunning life-principle in him ; this it was , that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing ; but only like an unreasoning wheel , which also hummingly soliloquizes ; or rather , his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there , and talking all the time to keep himself awake .
