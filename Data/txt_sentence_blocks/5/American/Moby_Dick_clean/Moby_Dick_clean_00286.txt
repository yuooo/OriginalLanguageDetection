I went down to supper . 
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage , as they called it -LRB- that is , a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only -RRB- ; after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination . 
But no ; there he was just where I had left him ; he had not stirred an inch . 
I began to grow vexed with him ; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room , holding a piece of wood on his head . 
`` For heaven 's sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper .
