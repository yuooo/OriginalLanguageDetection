All Beale 's drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter . 
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect . 
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved . 
That is not his fault though . 
Of the Right Whale , the best outline pictures are in Scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression .
