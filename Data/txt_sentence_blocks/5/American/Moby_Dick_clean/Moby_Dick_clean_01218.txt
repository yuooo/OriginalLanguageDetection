In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods . 
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion . 
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs . 
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us . 
We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up .
