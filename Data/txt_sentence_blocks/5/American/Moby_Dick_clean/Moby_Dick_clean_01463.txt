But from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates , both contemporary and hereditary . 
But most humble though he was , and far from furnishing an example of the high , humane abstraction ; the Pequod 's carpenter was no duplicate ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage . 
Like all sea-going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off-hand , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter 's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material . 
But , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ' voyage , in uncivilized and far-distant seas . 
For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties : -- repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars , inserting bull 's eyes in the deck , or new tree-nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious .
