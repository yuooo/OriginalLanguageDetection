He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , `` Down , down all , and give way ! 
-- there they are ! ''
