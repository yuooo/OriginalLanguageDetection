Consider ! 
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars . 
Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait . 
The living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line-of-battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations . 
And , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship 's deck , such is then the outlandish , eel-like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch .
