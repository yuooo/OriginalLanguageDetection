thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land ? 
Was it not so , O Morquan ! 
King of Japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky ? 
Was it not so , O Don Miguel ! 
thou Chilian whale , marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back !
