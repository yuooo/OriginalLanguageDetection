It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude . 
Now , in that Japanese sea , the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences . 
That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean 's immeasurable burning-glass . 
The sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God 's throne . 
Well that Ahab 's quadrant was furnished with colored glasses , through which to take sight of that solar fire .
