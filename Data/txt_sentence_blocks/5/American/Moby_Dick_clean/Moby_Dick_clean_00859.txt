In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale . 
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket . 
In a word , Frederick Cuvier 's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale , but a squash . 
Of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage -LRB- such men seldom have -RRB- , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ? 
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing .
