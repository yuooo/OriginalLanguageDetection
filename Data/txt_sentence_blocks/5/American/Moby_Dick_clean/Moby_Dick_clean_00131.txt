`` Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures . 
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah 's deep sealine sound ! 
what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet ! 
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish 's belly ! 
How billow-like and boisterously grand !
