How then ? 
The baleen , hump , back-fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars . 
Thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases . 
Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases . 
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned .
