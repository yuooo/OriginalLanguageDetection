Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning ; and lo ! 
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak . 
Much concern was shown ; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavorable affair . 
* * In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board , it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold , and drench the casks with sea-water ; which afterwards , at varying intervals , is removed by the ship 's pumps . 
Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo .
