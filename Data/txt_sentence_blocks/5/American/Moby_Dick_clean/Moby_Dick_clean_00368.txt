I freely assert , that the cosmopolite philosopher can not , for his life , point out one single peaceful influence , which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world , taken in one aggregate , than the high and mighty business of whaling . 
One way and another , it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves , and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues , that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother , who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb . 
It would be a hopeless , endless task to catalogue all these things . 
Let a handful suffice . 
For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth .
