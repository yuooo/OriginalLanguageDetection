But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish , I say , will on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; For notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on . 
Is it not a saying in every one 's mouth , Possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ? 
But often possession is the whole of the law . 
What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish , whereof possession is the whole of the law ? 
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow 's last mite but a Fast-Fish ?
