Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight . 
There is Napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below , whether Louis Philippe , Louis Blanc , or Louis the Devil . 
Great Washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore , and like one of Hercules ' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go . 
Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun-metal , stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square ; and even when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire . 
But neither great Washington , nor Napoleon , nor Nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned .
