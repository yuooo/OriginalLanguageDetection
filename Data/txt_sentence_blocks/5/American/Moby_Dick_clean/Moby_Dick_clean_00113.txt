And in August , high in air , the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts , candelabra-wise , proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms . 
So omnipotent is art ; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation 's final day . 
And the women of New Bedford , they bloom like their own red roses . 
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens . 
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye can not , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands .
