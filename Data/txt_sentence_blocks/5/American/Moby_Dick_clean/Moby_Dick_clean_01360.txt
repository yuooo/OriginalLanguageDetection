As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside ! 
here 's the battering-ram , Capricornus , or the Goat ; full tilt , he comes rushing , and headlong we are tossed ; when Aquarius , or the Waterbearer , pours out his whole deluge and drowns us ; and to wind up with Pisces , or the Fishes , we sleep . 
There 's a sermon now , writ in high heaven , and the sun goes through it every year , and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty . 
Jollily he , aloft there , wheels through toil and trouble ; and so , alow here , does jolly Stubb . 
Oh , jolly 's the word for aye !
