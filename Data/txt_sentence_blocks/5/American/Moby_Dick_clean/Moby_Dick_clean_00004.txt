-- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries . 
Some leaning against the spiles ; some seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over the bulwarks glasses ! 
of ships from China ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better seaward peep . 
But these are all landsmen ; of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks . 
How then is this ?
