Ahab and the Carpenter The Deck - First Night Watch -LRB- Carpenter standing before his vice-bench , and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg , which joist is firmly fixed in the vice . 
Slabs of ivory , leather straps , pads , screws , and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench . 
Forward , the red flame of the forge is seen , where the blacksmith is at work . -RRB- 
Drat the file , and drat the bone ! 
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
