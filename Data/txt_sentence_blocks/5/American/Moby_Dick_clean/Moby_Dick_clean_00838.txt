After a stiff pull , their harpooneer got fast , and , spear in hand , Radney sprang to the bow . 
He was always a furious man , it seems , in a boat . 
And now his bandaged cry was , to beach him on the whale 's topmost back . 
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate . 
That instant , as he fell on the whale 's slippery back , the boat righted , and was dashed aside by the swell , while Radney was tossed over into the sea , on the other flank of the whale .
