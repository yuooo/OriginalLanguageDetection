But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night . 
The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I , but stop , could n't I steal a march on him -- bolt his door inside , and jump into his bed , not to be wakened by the most violent knockings ? 
It seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts I dismissed it . 
For who could tell but what the next morning , so soon as I popped out of the room , the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to knock me down ! 
Still looking around me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person 's bed , I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer .
