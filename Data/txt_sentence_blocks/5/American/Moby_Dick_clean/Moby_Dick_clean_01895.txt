Ho , ho ! 
from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death ! 
Towards thee I roll , thou all-destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last I grapple with thee ; from hell 's heart I stab at thee ; for hate 's sake I spit my last breath at thee . 
Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool ! 
and since neither can be mine , let me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , thou damned whale !
