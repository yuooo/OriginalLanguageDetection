From that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches . 
In general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length . 
The middle ribs were the most arched . 
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams . 
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .
