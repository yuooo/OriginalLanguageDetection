It was merely the condensation of the man . 
He was by no means ill-looking ; quite the contrary . 
His pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified Egyptian , this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates . 
Looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life . 
A staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds .
