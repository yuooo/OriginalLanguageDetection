In some particulars , perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale , is that of the full front of his head . 
This aspect is sublime . 
In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning . 
In the repose of the pasture , the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it . 
Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant 's brow is majestic .
