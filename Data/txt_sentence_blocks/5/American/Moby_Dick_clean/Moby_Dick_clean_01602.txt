There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy eternity is but time , all thy creativeness mechanical . 
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it . 
Oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief . 
Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire . 
Leap !
