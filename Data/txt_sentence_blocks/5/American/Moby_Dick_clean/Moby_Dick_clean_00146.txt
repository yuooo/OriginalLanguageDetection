` Oh ! 
so my conscience hangs in me ! ' 
he groans , `` straight upward , so it burns ; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ! ' 
`` Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed , still reeling , but with conscience yet pricking him , as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him ; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish , praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed ; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels , a deep stupor steals over him , as over the man who bleeds to death , for conscience is the wound , and there 's naught to staunch it ; so , after sore wrestling in his berth , Jonah 's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep . 
`` And now the time of tide has come ; the ship casts off her cables ; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish , all careening , glides to sea .
