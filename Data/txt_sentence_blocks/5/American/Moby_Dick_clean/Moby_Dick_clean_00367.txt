Why did Louis XVI of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ? 
Why did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1,000,000 pounds ? 
And lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world ; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels ; manned by eighteen thousand men ; yearly consuming 00824,000,000 of dollars ; the ships worth , at the time of sailing , 20,000,000 dollars ; and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 00847,000,000 dollars . 
How comes all this , if there be not something puissant in whaling ? 
But this is not the half ; look again .
