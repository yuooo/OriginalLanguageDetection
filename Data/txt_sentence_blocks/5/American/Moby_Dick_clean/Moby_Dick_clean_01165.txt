Towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift precipitancy ; a disordered flight , as of Cleopatra 's barges from Actium . 
Nevertheless , the boats pursued , and Stubb 's was foremost . 
By great exertion , Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness . 
Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it . 
It became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him .
