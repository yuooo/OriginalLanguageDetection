This man interested me at once ; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate -LRB- though but a sleeping partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned -RRB- , I will here venture upon a little description of him . 
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer-dam . 
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man . 
His face was deeply brown and burnt , making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast ; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy . 
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature , I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia .
