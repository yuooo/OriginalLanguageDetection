Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers . 
I would be free as air ; and I 'm down in the whole world 's books . 
I am so rich , I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire -LRB- which was the world 's -RRB- ; and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with . 
By heavens ! 
I 'll get a crucible , and into it , and dissolve myself down to one small , compendious vertebra .
