ye three unsurrendered spires of mine ; thou uncracked keel ; and only god-bullied hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and Pole-pointed prow , -- death -- glorious ship ! 
must ye then perish , and without me ? 
Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains ? 
Oh , lonely death on lonely life ! 
Oh , now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief .
