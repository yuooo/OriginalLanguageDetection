But I stood irresolute ; when looking at a clock in the corner , he exclaimed `` I vum it 's Sunday -- you wo n't see that harpooneer to-night ; he 's come to anchor somewhere -- come along then ; do come ; wo n't ye come ? '' 
I considered the matter a moment , and then up stairs we went , and I was ushered into a small room , cold as a clam , and furnished , sure enough , with a prodigious bed , almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast . 
`` There , '' said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table ; `` there , make yourself comfortable now ; and good night to ye . '' 
I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared . 
Folding back the counterpane , I stooped over the bed .
