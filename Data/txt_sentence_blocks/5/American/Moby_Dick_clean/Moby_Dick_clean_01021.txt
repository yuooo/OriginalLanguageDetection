Suspended over the side in one of the stages , Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale-spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach . 
This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them . 
They meant Queequeg 's best happiness , I admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall . 
But poor Queequeg , I suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook -- poor Queequeg , I suppose , only prayed to his Yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods . 
Well , well , my dear comrade and twin-brother , thought I , as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea -- what matters it , after all ?
