It was Moby Dick 's open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea . 
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition . 
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth 's harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
