He published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica . 
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ; -- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness . 
Moreover , they were afraid of him . 
As such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual 's intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials -- devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out . 
So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain .
