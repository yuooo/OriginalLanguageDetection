Swerve me ? 
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run . 
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush ! 
Naught 's an obstacle , naught 's an angle to the iron way ! 
Dusk By the Mainmast ; Starbuck leaning against it .
