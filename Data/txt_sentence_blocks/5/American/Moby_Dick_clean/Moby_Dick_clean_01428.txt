But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine . 
To and fro I paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of Arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbors . 
But soon my line was out ; and following it back , I emerged from the opening where I entered . 
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones . 
Cutting me a green measuring-rod , I once more dived within the skeleton .
