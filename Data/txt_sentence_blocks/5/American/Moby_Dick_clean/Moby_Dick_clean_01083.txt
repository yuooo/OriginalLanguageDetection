As in decapitating the whale , the operator 's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents . 
It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . 
Thus much being said , attend now , I pray you , to that marvellous and -- in this particular instance -- almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale 's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped . 
Cistern and Buckets Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun . 
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single-sheaved block .
