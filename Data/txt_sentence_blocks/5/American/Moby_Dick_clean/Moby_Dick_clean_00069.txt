I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall , and I never saw such a sight in my life . 
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck . 
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer , and his door mat . 
After thinking some time on the bed-side , I got up and took off my monkey jacket , and then stood in the middle of the room thinking . 
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
