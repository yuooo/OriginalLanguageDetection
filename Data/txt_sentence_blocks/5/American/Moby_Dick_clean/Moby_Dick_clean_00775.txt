Whereas , some merchant ships crossing each other 's wake in the mid-Atlantic , will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition , mutually cutting each other on the high seas , like a brace of dandies in Broadway ; and all the time indulging , perhaps , in finical criticism upon each other 's rig . 
As for Men-of-War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all . 
As touching Slave-ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible . 
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other 's cross-bones , the first hail is -- `` How many skulls ? '' 
-- the same way that whalers hail -- `` How many barrels ? ''
