So , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man can not be true -- not true , or undeveloped . 
With books the same . 
The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows , and the truest of all books is Solomon 's , and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe . 
`` All is vanity . '' 
ALL .
