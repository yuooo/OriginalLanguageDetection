All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs . 
Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other 's grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon . 
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used . 
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time . 
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
