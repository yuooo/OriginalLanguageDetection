The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth . 
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet . 
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part . 
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels . 
Still more , for the ample fins , I here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !
