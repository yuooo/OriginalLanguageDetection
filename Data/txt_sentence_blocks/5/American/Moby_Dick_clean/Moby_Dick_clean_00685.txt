In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius , a Christian magistrate of Constantinople , in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general . 
As many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value . 
By the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned . 
Now , in this history of his , Procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople , a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis , or Sea of Marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years . 
A fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsaid .
