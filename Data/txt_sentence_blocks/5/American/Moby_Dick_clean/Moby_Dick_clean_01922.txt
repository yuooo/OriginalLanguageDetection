-- SCHOUTEN 'S SIXTH CIRCUMNAVIGATION . 
`` We set sail from the Elbe , wind N. E. in the ship called The Jonas-in-the-Whale . 
... Some say the whale ca n't open his mouth , but that is a fable . 
... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale , for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains . 
... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland , that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly .
