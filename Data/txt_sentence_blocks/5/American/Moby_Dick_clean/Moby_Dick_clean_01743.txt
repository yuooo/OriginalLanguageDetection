Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us ! 
Sweet childhood of air and sky ! 
how oblivious were ye of old Ahab 's close-coiled woe ! 
But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha , laughing-eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain . 
Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity .
