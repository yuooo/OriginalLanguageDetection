Going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open . 
Seeing a light , we went down , and found only an old rigger there , wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket . 
He was thrown at whole length upon two chests , his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms . 
The profoundest slumber slept upon him . 
`` Those sailors we saw , Queequeg , where can they have gone to ? ''
