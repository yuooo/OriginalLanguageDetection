And that question once answered , pirates straightway steer apart , for they are infernal villains on both sides , and do n't like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likenesses . 
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free-and-easy whaler ! 
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ? 
She has a `` Gam , '' a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about `` spouters '' and `` blubber-boilers , '' and such like pretty exclamations . 
Why it is that all Merchant-seamen , and also all Pirates and Man-of-War 's men , and Slave-ship sailors , cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships ; this is a question it would be hard to answer .
