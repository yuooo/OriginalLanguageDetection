The Pequod 's signal was at last responded to by the stranger 's setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket . 
Squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the Pequod 's lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck 's order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat 's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary . 
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that Mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the Pequod 's company . 
For , though himself and the boat 's crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod . 
But this did by no means prevent all communications .
