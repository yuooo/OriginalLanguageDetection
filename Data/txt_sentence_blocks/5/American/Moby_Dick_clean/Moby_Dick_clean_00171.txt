After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together . 
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine . 
I was going to remonstrate ; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ' pockets . 
I let them stay . 
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper firebrand .
