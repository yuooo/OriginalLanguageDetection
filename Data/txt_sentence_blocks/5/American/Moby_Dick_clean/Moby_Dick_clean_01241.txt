Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases . 
Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment , was that of Holland . 
It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695 . 
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter . 
They have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian 's Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People 's Business .
