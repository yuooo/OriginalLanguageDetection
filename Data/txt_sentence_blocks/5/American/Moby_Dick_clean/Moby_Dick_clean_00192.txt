On one side , New Bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air . 
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye . 
Such is the endlessness , yea , the intolerableness of all earthly effort . 
Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings . 
How I snuffed that Tartar air !
