But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it . 
First : What is a Fast-Fish ? 
Alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants , -- a mast , an oar , a nine-inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same . 
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognized symbol of possession ; so long as the party wailing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do . 
These are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks -- the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist .
