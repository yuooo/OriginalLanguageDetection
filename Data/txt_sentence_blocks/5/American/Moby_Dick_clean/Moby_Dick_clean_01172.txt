No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head . 
If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , I do not think I shall err ; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words . 
Assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time . 
That is to say , he would then live without breathing . 
Anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more -LRB- when at the bottom -RRB- without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .
