Now , as the business of standing mast-heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here . 
I take it , that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them . 
For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet -LRB- ere the final truck was put to it -RRB- as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God 's wrath ; therefore , we can not give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians . 
And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight . 
In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post .
