Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam 's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea -LRB- for by this time it blew very fresh -RRB- , with her main-topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again . 
Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort . 
Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam 's boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities . 
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair . 
A long-skirted , cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists .
