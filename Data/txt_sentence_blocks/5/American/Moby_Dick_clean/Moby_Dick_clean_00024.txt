I knew no one in the place . 
With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver , -- So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and do n't be too particular . 
With halting steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of `` The Crossed Harpoons '' -- but it looked too expensive and jolly there . 
Further on , from the bright red windows of the `` Sword-Fish Inn , '' there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement , -- rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight . 
Too expensive and jolly , again thought I , pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street , and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within .
