But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping . 
In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors ; but in New Bedford , actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners ; savages outright ; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh . 
It makes a stranger stare . 
But , besides the Feegeeans , Tongatobooarrs , Erromanggoans , Pannangians , and Brighggians , and , besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets , you will see other sights still more curious , certainly more comical . 
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery .
