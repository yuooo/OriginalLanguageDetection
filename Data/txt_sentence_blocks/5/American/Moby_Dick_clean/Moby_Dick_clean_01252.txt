And what are you , reader , but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish , too ? 
Heads or Tails `` De balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam . '' 
BRACTON , L. 3 , C. 3 . 
Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honorary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail . 
A division which , in the whale , is much like halving an apple ; there is no intermediate remainder .
