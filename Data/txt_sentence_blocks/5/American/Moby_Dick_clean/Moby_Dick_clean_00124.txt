Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes , Father Mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel . 
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth-covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint . 
At my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary . 
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec . 
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .
