When not in use , they are kept remarkably clean . 
Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand , till they shine within like silver punchbowls . 
During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap . 
While employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips . 
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation .
