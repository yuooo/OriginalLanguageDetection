Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the Antilles he 's a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward ! 
Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat ! 
I 'd never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here . 
No , no ! 
shame upon all cowards -- shame upon them !
