First : The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish . 
In his System of Nature , A.D. 1776 , Linnaeus declares , `` I hereby separate the whales from the fish . '' 
But of my own knowledge , I know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against Linnaeus 's express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan . 
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows : `` On account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem , '' and finally , `` ex lege naturae jure meritoque . '' 
I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin , of Nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient .
