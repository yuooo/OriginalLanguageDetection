The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod 's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea . 
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying-fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata , or the in-shore ground off Peru . 
It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air . 
No resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn . 
Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me , I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen mast-heads were already drowsy .
