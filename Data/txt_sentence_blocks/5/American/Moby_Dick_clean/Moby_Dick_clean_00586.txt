I 'll dance over your grave , I will -- that 's the bitterest threat of your night-women , that beat head-winds round corners . 
O Christ ! 
to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews ! 
Well , well ; belike the whole world 's a ball , as you scholars have it ; and so 't is right to make one ballroom of it . 
Dance on , lads , you 're young ; I was once .
