The Romish mass for the dead begins with `` Requiem eternam '' -LRB- eternal rest -RRB- , whence Requiem denominating the mass itself , and any other funeral music . 
Now , in allusion to the white , silent stillness of death in this shark , and the mild deadliness of his habits , the French call him Requin . 
Bethink thee of the albatross , whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread , in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations ? 
Not Coleridge first threw that spell ; but God 's great , unflattering laureate , Nature . 
* * I remember the first albatross I ever saw .
