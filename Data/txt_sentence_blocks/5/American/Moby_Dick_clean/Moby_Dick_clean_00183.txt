But this fine young savage -- this sea Prince of Wales , never saw the Captain 's cabin . 
They put him down among the sailors , and made a whaleman of him . 
But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities , Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen . 
For at bottom -- so he told me -- he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians , the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were ; and more than that , still better than they were . 
But , alas !
