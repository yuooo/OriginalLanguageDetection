So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark . 
* * With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast . 
But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror . 
As for the white shark , the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature , when beheld in his ordinary moods , strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped . 
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish .
