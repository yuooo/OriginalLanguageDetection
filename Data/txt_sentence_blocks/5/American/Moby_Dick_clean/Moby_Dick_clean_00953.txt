`` All ` dention , '' said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time . 
`` Well then , cook , you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , do n't you ? 
Well , for the future , when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here , the capstan , I 'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing . 
Hold the steak in one hand , and show a live coal to it with the other ; that done , dish it ; d'ye hear ? 
And now to-morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle .
