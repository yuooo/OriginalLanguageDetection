I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it . 
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin . 
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat , as you see the same in South American ponchos . 
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat , and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise ? 
I put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day .
