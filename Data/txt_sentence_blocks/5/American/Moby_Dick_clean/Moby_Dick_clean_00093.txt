Now , take away the awful fear , and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness , to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg 's pagan arm thrown round me . 
But at length all the past night 's events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament . 
For though I tried to move his arm -- unlock his bridegroom clasp -- yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain . 
I now strove to rouse him -- `` Queequeg ! '' 
-- but his only answer was a snore .
