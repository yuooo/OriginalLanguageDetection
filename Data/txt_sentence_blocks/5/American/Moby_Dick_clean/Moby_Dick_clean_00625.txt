Ahab 's full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated Hudson , when that noble Northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge . 
But , as in his narrow-flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab 's broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . 
That before living agent , now became the living instrument . 
If such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , Ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object . 
This is much ; yet Ahab 's larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted .
