Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale , Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft , and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea . 
Not very far distant Flask 's boat was also lying breathlessly still ; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead , a stout sort of post rooted in the keel , and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform . 
It is used for catching turns with the whale line . 
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man 's hand , and standing upon such a base as that , Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks . 
But little King-Post was small and short , and at the same time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition , so that this logger head stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post .
