In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns . 
Gliding among them , old Leviathan swam as of yore ; was there swimming in that planisphere , centuries before Solomon was cradled . 
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale , in his own osseous postdiluvian reality , as set down by the venerable John Leo , the old Barbary traveller . 
`` Not far from the Sea-side , they have a Temple , the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale-Bones ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore . 
The Common People imagine , that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
