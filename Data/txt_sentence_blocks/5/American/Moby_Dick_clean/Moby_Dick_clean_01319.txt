Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office . 
That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots ; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse , planted endwise against the bulwarks , and with a capacious tub beneath it , into which the minced pieces drop , fast as the sheets from a rapt orator 's desk . 
Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer ! 
* * Bible leaves ! 
Bible leaves !
