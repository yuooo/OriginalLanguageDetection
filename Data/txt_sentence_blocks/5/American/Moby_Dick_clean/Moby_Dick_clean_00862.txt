But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form . 
Not at all . 
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape . 
Though Jeremy Bentham 's skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy 's other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan 's articulated bones . 
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .
