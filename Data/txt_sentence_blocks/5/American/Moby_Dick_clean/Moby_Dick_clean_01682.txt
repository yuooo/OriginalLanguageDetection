Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ? 
And now I 'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it . 
It 's like turning an old coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now . 
I do n't like this cobbling sort of business -- I do n't like it at all ; it 's undignified ; it 's not my place . 
Let tinkers ' brats do tinkerings ; we are their betters .
