It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon . 
It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again . 
A whale wounded -LRB- as we afterwards learned -RRB- in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went . 
But agonizing as was the wound of this whale , and an appalling spectacle enough , any way ; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd , was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us . 
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail , the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .
