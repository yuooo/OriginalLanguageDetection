Now as this law , under a modified form , is to this day in force in England ; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast -- and Loose-Fish , it is here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car , specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty . 
In the first place , in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force , I proceed to lay before you a circumstance-that happened within the last two years . 
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover , or Sandwich , or some one of the Cinque Ports , had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore . 
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden . 
Holding the office directly from the crown , I believe , all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his .
