But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time . 
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling . 
But owing to the mystery of the spout -- whether it be water or whether it be vapor -- no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head . 
Sure it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories . 
But what does he want of them ?
