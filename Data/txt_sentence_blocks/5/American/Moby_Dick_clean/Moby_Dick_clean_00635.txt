It was during a prolonged gale , in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas . 
From my forenoon watch below , I ascended to the overclouded deck ; and there , dashed upon the main hatches , I saw a regal , feathery thing of unspotted whiteness , and with a hooked , Roman bill sublime . 
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark . 
Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it . 
Though bodily unharmed , it uttered cries , as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress .
