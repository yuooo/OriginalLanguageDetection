Far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines . 
But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it . 
In an instant 's compass , great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang , the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men 's whole lives . 
And so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls . 
`` The harpoon , '' said Ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm -- `` is it safe ? ''
