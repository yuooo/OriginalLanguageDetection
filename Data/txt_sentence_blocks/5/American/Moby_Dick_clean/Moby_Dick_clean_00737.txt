Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks . 
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist ; neither ship nor boat to be seen . 
`` Give way , men , '' whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; `` there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes . 
There 's white water again ! 
-- close to !
