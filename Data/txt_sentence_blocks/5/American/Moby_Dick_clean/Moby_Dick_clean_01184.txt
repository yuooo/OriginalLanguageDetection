The invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition . 
And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations , and that vapor -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow , as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts . 
For d'ye see , rainbows do not visit the clear air ; they only irradiate vapor . 
And so , through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind , divine intuitions now and then shoot , enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray . 
And for this I thank God ; for all have doubts ; many deny ; but doubts or denials , few along with them , have intuitions .
