In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce . 
Oh , horrible vulturism of earth ! 
from which not the mightiest whale is free . 
Nor is this the end . 
Desecrated as the body is , a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare .
