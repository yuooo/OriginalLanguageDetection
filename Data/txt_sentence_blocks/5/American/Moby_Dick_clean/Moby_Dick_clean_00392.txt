What , perhaps , with other things , made Stubb such an easy-going , unfearing man , so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers , all bowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his ; that thing must have been his pipe . 
For , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face . 
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe . 
He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew . 
For , when Stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth .
