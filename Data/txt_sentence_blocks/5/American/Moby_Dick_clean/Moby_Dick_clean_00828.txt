`` During the night , Radney had an unseaman-like way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck , and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there , a little above the ship 's side . 
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed . 
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship , and down between this was the sea . 
Steelkilt calculated his time , and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock , in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed . 
At his leisure , he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below . ''
