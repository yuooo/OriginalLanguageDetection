But the Sperm Whale 's food is far beneath the surface , and there he can not spout even if he would . 
Besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration . 
But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject ? 
Speak out ! 
You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?
