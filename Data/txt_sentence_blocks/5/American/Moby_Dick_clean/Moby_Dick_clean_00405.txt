By some tacit consent , throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it , especially by the mates . 
But once Tashtego 's senior , an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew , superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded , and then it came upon him , not in the fury of any mortal fray , but in an elemental strife at sea . 
Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab . 
Nevertheless , the old sea-traditions , the immemorial credulities , popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment . 
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole .
