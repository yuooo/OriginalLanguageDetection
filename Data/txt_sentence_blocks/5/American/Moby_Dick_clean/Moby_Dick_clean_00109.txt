Ah , poor Hay-Seed ! 
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest . 
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers , cannibals , and bumpkins to show her visitors . 
Not at all . 
Still New Bedford is a queer place .
