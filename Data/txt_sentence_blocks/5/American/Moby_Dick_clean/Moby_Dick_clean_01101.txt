Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so . 
In profile , you plainly perceive that horizontal , semi-crescentic depression in the forehead 's middle , which , in a man , is Lavater 's mark of genius . 
But how ? 
Genius in the Sperm Whale ?
