Holding a light in one hand , and that identical New Zealand head in the other , the stranger entered the room , and without looking towards the bed , placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room . 
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag 's mouth . 
This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens ; what a sight ! 
Such a face ! 
It was of a dark , purplish , yellow color , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares .
