The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill . 
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood , which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake . 
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men . 
And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance -LRB- by the line attached to it -RRB- , Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale . 
`` Pull up -- pull up ! ''
