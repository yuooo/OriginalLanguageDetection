Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say , -- Oh ! 
my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill-humor or envy ! 
Come ; let us squeeze hands all round ; nay , let us all squeeze ourselves into each other ; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness . 
Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever ! 
For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fire-side ; the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally .
