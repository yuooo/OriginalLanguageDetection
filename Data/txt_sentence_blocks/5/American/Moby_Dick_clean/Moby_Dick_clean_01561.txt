He too worships fire ; most faithful , broad , baronial vassal of the sun ! 
-- Oh that these too-favoring eyes should see these too-favoring sights . 
Look ! 
here , far water-locked ; beyond all hum of human weal or woe ; in these most candid and impartial seas ; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets ; where for long Chinese ages , the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to , as stars that shine upon the Niger 's unknown source ; here , too , life dies sunwards full of faith , but see ! 
no sooner dead , than death whirls round the corpse , and it heads some other way .
