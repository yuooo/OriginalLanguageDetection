I 'll have me -- let 's see -- how many in the ship 's company , all told ? 
But I 've forgotten . 
Any way , I 'll have me thirty separate , Turk 's - headed life-lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin . 
Then , if the hull go down , there 'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun ! 
Come hammer , caulking-iron , pitch-pot , and marling-spike !
