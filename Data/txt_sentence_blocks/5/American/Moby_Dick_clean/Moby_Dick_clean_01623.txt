Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing . 
The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed , and a storm-trysail was set further aft ; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again ; and the course -- for the present , East-south-east -- which he was to steer , if practicable , was once more given to the helmsman . 
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes . 
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo ! 
a good sign !
