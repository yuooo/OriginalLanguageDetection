Delight , -- top-gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven . 
Delight is to him , whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages . 
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father ! 
-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die . 
I have striven to be Thine , more than to be this world 's , or mine own .
