thought I. Lo ! 
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship 's stern , with my back to her prow and the compass . 
In an instant I faced back , just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind , and very probably capsizing her . 
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee ! 
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !
