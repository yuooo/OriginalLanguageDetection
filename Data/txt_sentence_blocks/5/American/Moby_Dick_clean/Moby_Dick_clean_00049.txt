They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered . 
No wonder , then , that they made a straight wake for the whale 's mouth -- the bar -- when the wrinkled little old Jonah , there officiating , soon poured them out brimmers all round . 
One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice-island . 
The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously . 
I observed , however , that one of them held somewhat aloof , and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face , yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest .
