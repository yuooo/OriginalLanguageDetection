Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her , yet Nantucket was her great original -- the Tyre of this Carthage ; -- the place where the first dead American whale was stranded . 
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the Red-Men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ? 
And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ? 
Now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in New Bedford , ere I could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile . 
It was a very dubious-looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless .
