Alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiselled hearth-stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth . 
No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the wildest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears . 
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the White Whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw . 
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work . 
Nor even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body .
