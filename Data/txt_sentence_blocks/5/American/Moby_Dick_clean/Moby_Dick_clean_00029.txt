-- Rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought I . 
But it is a common name in Nantucket , they say , and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there . 
As the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it , I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee . 
It was a queer sort of place -- a gable-ended old house , one side palsied as it were , and leaning over sadly .
