Pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp-string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , Ahab exclaimed , `` Good ! 
and now for the seizings . '' 
At one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the pole 's length , and firmly secured so , with inter-twistings of twine . 
This done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the Three Fates -- remained inseparable , and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank . 
But ere he entered his cabin , a light , unnatural , half-bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard .
