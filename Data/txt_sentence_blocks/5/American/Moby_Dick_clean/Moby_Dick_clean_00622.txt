And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab 's leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field . 
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice . 
Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations . 
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung . 
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ; -- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it .
