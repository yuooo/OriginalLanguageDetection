`` Give way , or the German will have him . '' 
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time . 
At this juncture , the Pequod 's keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered ; but from the great start he had had , Derick 's boat still led the chase , though every moment neared by his foreign rivals .
