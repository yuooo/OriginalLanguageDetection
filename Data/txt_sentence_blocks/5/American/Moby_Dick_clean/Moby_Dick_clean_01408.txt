It was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps -- every soul on board . 
A short life to them , and a jolly death . 
And that fine gam I had -- long , very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel -- it minds me of the noble , solid , Saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if I ever lose sight of it . 
Flip ? 
Did I say we had flip ?
