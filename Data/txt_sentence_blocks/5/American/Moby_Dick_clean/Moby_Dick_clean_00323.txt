All Astir A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod . 
Not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship 's preparations were hurrying to a close . 
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands : Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall . 
On the day following Queequeg 's signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship 's company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing . 
So Queequeg and I got down our traps , resolving , however , to sleep ashore till the last .
