I turned in , and never slept better in my life . 
The Counterpane Upon waking next morning about daylight , I found Queequeg 's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner . 
You had almost thought I had been his wife . 
The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt . 
Indeed , partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke , I could hardly tell it from the quilt , they so blended their hues together ; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me .
