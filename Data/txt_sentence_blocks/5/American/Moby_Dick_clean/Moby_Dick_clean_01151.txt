And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute . 
The Virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase . 
Oh ! 
many are the Fin-Backs , and many are the Dericks , my friend .
