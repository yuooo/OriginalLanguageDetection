The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane ; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads . 
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears . 
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle-shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower . 
You shuddered as you gazed , and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking , horrifying implement . 
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed .
