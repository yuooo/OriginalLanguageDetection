In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes . 
At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across . 
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it : -- upper , middle , and lower . 
The fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers . 
This triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail .
