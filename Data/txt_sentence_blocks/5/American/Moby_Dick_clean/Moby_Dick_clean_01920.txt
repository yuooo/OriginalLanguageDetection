`` The mighty whales which swim in a sea of water , and have a sea of oil swimming in them . '' 
-- FULLLER 'S PROFANE AND HOLY STATE . 
`` So close behind some promontory lie The huge Leviathan to attend their prey , And give no chance , but swallow in the fry , Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way . '' 
-- DRYDEN 'S ANNUS MIRABILIS . 
`` While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship , they cut off his head , and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come ; but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water . ''
