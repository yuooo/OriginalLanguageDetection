In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain 's table , was the entire care-free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers . 
While their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it . 
They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices . 
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox . 
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon-wise .
