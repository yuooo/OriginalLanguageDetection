Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons . 
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship 's company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . 
But those wild eyes met his , as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison ; but , alas ! 
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian .
