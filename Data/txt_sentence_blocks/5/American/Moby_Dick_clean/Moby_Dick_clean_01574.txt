Curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man 's eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun ! 
Level by nature to this earth 's horizon are the glances of man 's eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament . 
Curse thee , thou quadrant ! '' 
dashing it to the deck , `` no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship 's compass , and the level deadreckoning , by log and by line ; these shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea . 
Aye , '' lighting from the boat to the deck , `` thus I trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus I split and destroy thee ! ''
