The gaff is something like a boat-hook . 
With his gaff , the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping , as the ship pitches and lurches about . 
Meanwhile , the spade-man stands on the sheet itself , perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces . 
This spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan 's feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge . 
If he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants ' , would you be very much astonished ?
