Presently a breeze sprang up ; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the Frenchman soon increased his distance , while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb 's whale . 
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning . 
Seizing his sharp boat-spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin . 
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam . 
His boat 's crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold-hunters .
