Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo 's . 
In both cases , the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged , were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds . 
King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it ; and Sir Clifford , because he was lord of the seignories of those parts . 
Sir Clifford 's whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities -- spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan -- and swing all day upon his lower jaw . 
Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side .
