What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . 
And poor little Flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party .

Had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , Ahab never forbade him .
