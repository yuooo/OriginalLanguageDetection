But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and Ifs eternally . 
Where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more ? 
In what rapt ether sails the world , of which the weariest will never weary ? 
Where is the foundling 's father hidden ? 
Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them : the secret of our paternity lies in their grave , and we must there to learn it .
