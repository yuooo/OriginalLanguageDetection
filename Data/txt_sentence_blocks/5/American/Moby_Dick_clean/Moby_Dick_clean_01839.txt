to think 's audacity . 
God only has that right and privilege . 
Thinking is , or ought to be , a coolness and a calmness ; and our poor hearts throb , and our poor brains beat too much for that . 
And yet , I 've sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it . 
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it 's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava .
