Closing the door upon the landlady , I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair ; but in vain . 
There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in any the slightest way . 
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island . 
It must be so ; yes , it 's a part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he 'll get up sooner or later , no doubt . 
It ca n't last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I do n't believe it 's very punctual then .
