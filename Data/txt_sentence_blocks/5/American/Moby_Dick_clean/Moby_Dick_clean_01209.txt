But no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them , -- though as yet a mile in their rear , -- than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity . 
Stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white-ash , and after several hours ' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating tokens that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied * . 
The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like King Porus ' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation . 
In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic . 
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea .
