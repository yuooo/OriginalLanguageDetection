`` Landlord , '' I whispered , `` that aint the harpooneer is it ? '' 
`` Oh , no , '' said he , looking a sort of diabolically funny , `` the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap . 
He never eats dumplings , he do n't -- he eats nothing but steaks , and he likes 'em rare . '' 
`` The devil he does , '' says I. `` Where is that harpooneer ? 
Is he here ? ''
