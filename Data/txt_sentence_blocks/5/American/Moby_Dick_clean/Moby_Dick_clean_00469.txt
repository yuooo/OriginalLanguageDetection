Beyond the DUODECIMO , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales . 
Above , you have all the Leviathans of note . 
But there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive , half-fabulous whales , which , as an American whaleman , I know by reputation , but not personally . 
I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations ; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators , who may complete what I have here but begun . 
If any of the following whales , shall hereafter be caught and marked , then he can readily be incorporated into this System , according to his Folio , Octavo , or Duodecimo magnitude : -- The Bottle-Nose Whale ; the Junk Whale ; the Pudding-Headed Whale ; the Cape Whale ; the Leading Whale ; the Cannon Whale ; the Scragg Whale ; the Coppered Whale ; the Elephant Whale ; the Iceberg Whale ; the Quog Whale ; the Blue Whale ; & c. From Icelandic , Dutch , and old English authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names .
