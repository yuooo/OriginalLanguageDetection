`` There 's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers , and all other grand and lofty things ; look here , -- three peaks as proud as Lucifer . 
The firm tower , that is Ahab ; the volcano , that is Ahab ; the courageous , the undaunted , and victorious fowl , that , too , is Ahab ; all are Ahab ; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe , which , like a magician 's glass , to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self . 
Great pains , small gains for those who ask the world to solve them ; it can not solve itself . 
Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face ; but see ! 
aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox !
