Now when I looked about the quarter-deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first I saw nobody ; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main-mast . 
It seemed only a temporary erection used in port . 
It was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale . 
Planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a top-knot on some old Pottowotamie Sachem 's head . 
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward .
