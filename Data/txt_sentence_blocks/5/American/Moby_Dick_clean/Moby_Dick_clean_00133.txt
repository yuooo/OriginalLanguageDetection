But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade . 
And if we obey God , we must disobey ourselves ; and it is in this disobeying ourselves , wherein the hardness of obeying God consists . 
`` With this sin of disobedience in him , Jonah still further flouts at God , by seeking to flee from Him . 
He thinks that a ship made by men , will carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth . 
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa , and seeks a ship that 's bound for Tarshish .
