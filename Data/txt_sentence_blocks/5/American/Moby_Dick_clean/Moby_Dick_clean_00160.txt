on the starboard hand of every woe , there is a sure delight ; and higher the top of that delight , than the bottom of the woe is deep . 
Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low ? 
Delight is to him -- a far , far upward , and inward delight -- who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth , ever stands forth his own inexorable self . 
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him , when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him . 
Delight is to him , who gives no quarter in the truth , and kills , burns , and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges .
