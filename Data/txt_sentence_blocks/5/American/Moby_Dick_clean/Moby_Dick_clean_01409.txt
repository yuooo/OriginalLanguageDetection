Yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came -LRB- for it 's squally off there by Patagonia -RRB- , and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails , we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars . 
However , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it for my taste . 
The beef was fine -- tough , but with body in it . 
They said it was bullbeef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was . 
They had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings .
