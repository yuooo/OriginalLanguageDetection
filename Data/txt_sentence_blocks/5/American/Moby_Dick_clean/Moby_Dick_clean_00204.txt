Setting out in their canoes , after a perilous passage they discovered the island , and there they found an empty ivory casket , -- the poor little Indian 's skeleton . 
What wonder , then , that these Nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood ! 
They first caught crabs and quahogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring 's Straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous ! 
That Himmalehan , salt-sea , Mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults ! 
And thus have these naked Nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant-hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders ; parcelling out among them the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did Poland .
