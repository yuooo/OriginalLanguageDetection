What a pity they did n't stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there . 
But it 's too late to make any improvements now . 
The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago . 
Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn-cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon . 
Euroclydon !
