`` Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks , the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over ; he rears his enormous head , and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him ; he rushes at the boats with his head ; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness , and sometimes utterly destroyed . 
... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting , and , in a commercial point of view , so important an animal -LRB- as the Sperm Whale -RRB- should have been so entirely neglected , or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous , and many of them competent observers , that of late years , must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes . '' 
-- THOMAS BEALE 'S HISTORY OF THE SPERM WHALE , 1839 . 
`` The Cachalot '' -LRB- Sperm Whale -RRB- `` is not only better armed than the True Whale '' -LRB- Greenland or Right Whale -RRB- `` in possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body , but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful , bold , and mischievous , as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe .
