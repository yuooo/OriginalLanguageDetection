* To gally , or gallow , is to frighten excessively -- to confound with fright . 
It is an old Saxon word . 
It occurs once in Shakespeare : -- The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves . 
To common language , the word is now completely obsolete . 
When the polite landsman first hears it from the gaunt Nantucketer , he is apt to set it down as one of the whaleman 's self-derived savageries .
