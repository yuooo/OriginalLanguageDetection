You can not put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat . 
Concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called crow 's - nests , in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas . 
In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled `` A Voyage among the Icebergs , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland ; '' in this admirable volume , all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow 's - nest of the Glacier , which was the name of Captain Sleet 's good craft . 
He called it the Sleet 's crow 's - nest , in honor of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names -LRB- we fathers being the original inventors and patentees -RRB- , so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget . 
In shape , the Sleet 's crow 's - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale .
