Uppermost was the impression , that whatever swift , rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern . 
A stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me . 
Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller , but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was , somehow , in some enchanted way , inverted . 
My God ! 
what is the matter with me ?
