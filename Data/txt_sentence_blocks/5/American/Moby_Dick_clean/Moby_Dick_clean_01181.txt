For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm , with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary 's in the desert ; even then , the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head , as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain . 
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout . 
It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it . 
You can not go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away . 
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapory shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it .
