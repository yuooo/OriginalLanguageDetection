Not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman 's head ; but the mate for ever sank . 
It is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any . 
Sometimes , nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated ; oftener the boat 's bow is knocked off , or the thigh-board , on which the headsman stands , is torn from its place and accompanies the body . 
But strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead . 
The whole calamity , with the falling form of Macey , was plainly descried from the ship .
