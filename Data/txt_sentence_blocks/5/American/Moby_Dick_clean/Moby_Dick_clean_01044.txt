`` Am I the same man that helped kill this whale ? 
Does n't the devil live for ever ; who ever heard that the devil was dead ? 
Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ? 
And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral 's cabin , do n't you suppose he can crawl into a porthole ? 
Tell me that , Mr. Flask ? ''
