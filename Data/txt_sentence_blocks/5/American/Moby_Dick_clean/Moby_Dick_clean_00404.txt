He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness . 
His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like Cellini 's cast Perseus . 
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod-like mark , lividly whitish . 
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight , lofty trunk of a great tree , when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it , and without wrenching a single twig , peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil , leaving the tree still greenly alive , but branded . 
Whether that mark was born with him , or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound , no one could certainly say .
