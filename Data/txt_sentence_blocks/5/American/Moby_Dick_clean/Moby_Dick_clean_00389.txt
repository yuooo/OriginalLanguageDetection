His omnipresence , our divine equality ! 
If , then , to meanest mariners , and renegades and castaways , I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities , though dark ; weave round them tragic graces ; if even the most mournful , perchance the most abased , among them all , shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts ; if I shall touch that workman 's arm with some ethereal light ; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun ; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it , thou just Spirit of Equality , which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind ! 
Bear me out in it , thou great democratic God ! 
who didst not refuse to the swart convict , Bunyan , the pale , poetic pearl ; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold , the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes ; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles ; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne ! 
Thou who , in all Thy mighty , earthly marchings , ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commoners ; bear me out in it , O God !
