With back to the stranger ship , and face set like a flint to his own , Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod . 
The Decanter Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here , that she hailed from London , and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of enderby and sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman 's opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons , in point of real historical interest . 
How long , prior to the year of our Lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish-documents do not make plain ; but in that year -LRB- 1775 -RRB- it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous -LRB- ever since 1726 -RRB- our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued the Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere . 
Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him . 
In 1778 , a fine ship , the Amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys , boldly rounded Cape Horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea .
