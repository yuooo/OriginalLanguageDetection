Oh -- We 'll drink to-night with hearts as light , To love , as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim , on the beaker 's brim , And break on the lips while meeting . 
A brave stave that -- who calls ? 
Mr. Starbuck ? 
Aye , aye , sir -- -LRB- Aside -RRB- he 's my superior , he has his too , if I 'm not mistaken . 
-- Aye , aye , sir , just through with this job -- coming .
