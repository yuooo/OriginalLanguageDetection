I tried to go out noiselessly . 
Coming in , I found my landlord going quietly upstairs ; he had heard the door close , I suppose . 
You would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as came tearing after him . 
He glared at me as I went by him , and I made the house quiver with the slamming of my door . 
I heard him come shuffling up to my floor , hesitate , and go down .
