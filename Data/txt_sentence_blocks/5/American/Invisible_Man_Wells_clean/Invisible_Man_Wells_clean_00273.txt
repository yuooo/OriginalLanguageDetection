Hall , Henfrey , and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell into the street . 
They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road , and Mr. Huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder . 
Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them . 
Mr. Huxter was stunned . 
Henfrey stopped to discover this , but Hall and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner , shouting incoherent things , and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall .
