It was very still ; in one place I remember passing near one of the Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening to the tapping of boot-heels of the passers-by . 
`` My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves for sale . 
It was dark , and I had the devil of a hunt after matches , which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk . 
Then I had to get a candle . 
I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers , but at last I managed to turn out what I sought ; the box label called them lambswool pants , and lambswool vests .
