` This way , policeman ! ' 
I heard someone shouting . 
I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . 
I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . 
They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers .
