A glass box would not be so brilliant , not so clearly visible , as a diamond box , because there would be less refraction and reflection . 
See that ? 
From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it . 
Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others , a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass . 
A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light , because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little .
