If a sheet of glass is smashed , Kemp , and beaten into a powder , it becomes much more visible while it is in the air ; it becomes at last an opaque white powder . 
This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur . 
In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces ; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through , and very little gets right through the powder . 
But if the white powdered glass is put into water , it forthwith vanishes . 
The powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index ; that is , the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other .
