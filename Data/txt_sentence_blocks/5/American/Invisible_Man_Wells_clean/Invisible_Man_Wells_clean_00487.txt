No , not those Roentgen vibrations -- I do n't know that these others of mine have been described . 
Yet they are obvious enough . 
I needed two little dynamos , and these I worked with a cheap gas engine . 
My first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric . 
It was the strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white , and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish .
