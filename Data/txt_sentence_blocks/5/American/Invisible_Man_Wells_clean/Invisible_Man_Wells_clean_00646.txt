Then suddenly he was struck violently . 
By nothing ! 
A vast weight , it seemed , leapt upon him , and he was hurled headlong down the staircase , with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin . 
An invisible foot trod on his back , a ghostly patter passed downstairs , he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run , and the front door of the house slammed violently . 
He rolled over and sat up staring .
