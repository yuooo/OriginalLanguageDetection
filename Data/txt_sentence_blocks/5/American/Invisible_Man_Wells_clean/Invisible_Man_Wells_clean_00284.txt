You must figure the street full of running figures , of doors slamming and fights for hiding-places . 
You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher 's planks and two chairs -- with cataclysmic results . 
You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing . 
And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen , and littered with cocoanuts , overthrown canvas screens , and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall . 
Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts , and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane .
