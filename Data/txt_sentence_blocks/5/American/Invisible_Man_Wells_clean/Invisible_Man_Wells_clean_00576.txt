I peered through the window and , seeing no one within , entered . 
The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing . 
I left it open , and walked round a bare costume stand , into a corner behind a cheval glass . 
For a minute or so no one came . 
Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room , and a man appeared down the shop .
