And from it he began to produce bottles -- little fat bottles containing powders , small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids , fluted blue bottles labeled Poison , bottles with round bodies and slender necks , large green-glass bottles , large white-glass bottles , bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels , bottles with fine corks , bottles with bungs , bottles with wooden caps , wine bottles , salad-oil bottles -- putting them in rows on the chiffonnier , on the mantel , on the table under the window , round the floor , on the bookshelf -- everywhere . 
The chemist 's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many . 
Quite a sight it was . 
Crate after crate yielded bottles , until all six were empty and the table high with straw ; the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance . 
And directly the crates were unpacked , the stranger went to the window and set to work , not troubling in the least about the litter of straw , the fire which had gone out , the box of books outside , nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs .
