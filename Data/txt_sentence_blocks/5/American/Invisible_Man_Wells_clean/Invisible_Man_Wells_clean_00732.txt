The Invisible Man must have started back , and he blundered into the umbrella stand . 
Then , as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed , the Invisible Man countered with the axe , the helmet crumpled like paper , and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs . 
But the second policeman , aiming behind the axe with his poker , hit something soft that snapped . 
There was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground . 
The policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing ; he put his foot on the axe , and struck again .
