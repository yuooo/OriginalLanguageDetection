Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms . 
I had to dodge to get out of the way , and as it was , my ankle got stung with the sawdust . 
For some time , wandering through the swathed and darkened departments , I could hear the brooms at work . 
And at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed , came a noise of locking doors . 
Silence came upon the place , and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops , galleries , show-rooms of the place , alone .
