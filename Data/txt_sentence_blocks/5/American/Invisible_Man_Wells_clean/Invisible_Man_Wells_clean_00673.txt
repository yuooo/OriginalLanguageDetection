Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air . 
Without any thought of the Invisible Man -- for Port Burdock is ten miles away -- he may have pursued it . 
It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the Invisible Man . 
One can then imagine the Invisible Man making off -- quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the neighbourhood , and Wicksteed , excited and curious , pursuing this unaccountably locomotive object -- finally striking at it . 
No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged pursuer under ordinary circumstances , but the position in which Wicksteed 's body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit .
