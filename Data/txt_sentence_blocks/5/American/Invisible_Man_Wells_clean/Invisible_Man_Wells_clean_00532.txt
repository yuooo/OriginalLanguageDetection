`` I tried to get into the stream of people , but they were too thick for me , and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon . 
I took to the gutter , the roughness of which I found painful to my feet , and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade , reminding me that I was already bruised severely . 
I staggered out of the way of the cab , avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement , and found myself behind the hansom . 
A happy thought saved me , and as this drove slowly along I followed in its immediate wake , trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure . 
And not only trembling , but shivering .
