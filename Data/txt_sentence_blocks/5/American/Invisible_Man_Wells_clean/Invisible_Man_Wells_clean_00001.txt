The Invisible Man A Grotesque Romance By H.G. Wells CONTENTS THE STRANGE MAN 'S ARRIVAL The stranger came early in February , one wintry day , through a biting wind and a driving snow , the last snowfall of the year , over the down , walking from Bramblehurst railway station , and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand . 
He was wrapped up from head to foot , and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose ; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest , and added a white crest to the burden he carried . 
He staggered into the `` Coach and Horses '' more dead than alive , and flung his portmanteau down . 
`` A fire , '' he cried , `` in the name of human charity ! 
A room and a fire ! ''
