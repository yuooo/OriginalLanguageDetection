Mr. Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe `` in all this nonsense '' about an Invisible Man . 
His wife , however , as he was subsequently to be reminded , did . 
He insisted upon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter , and he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom of years . 
He slept through the smashing of the windows , and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong . 
He looked across at Kemp 's house , rubbed his eyes and looked again .
