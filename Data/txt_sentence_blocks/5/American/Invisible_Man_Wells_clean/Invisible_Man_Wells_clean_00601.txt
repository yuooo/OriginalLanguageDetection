This looked out upon the street , two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window . 
I went and peered out through their interstices . 
Outside the day was bright -- by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself , dazzlingly bright . 
A brisk traffic was going by , fruit carts , a hansom , a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes , a fishmonger 's cart . 
I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me .
