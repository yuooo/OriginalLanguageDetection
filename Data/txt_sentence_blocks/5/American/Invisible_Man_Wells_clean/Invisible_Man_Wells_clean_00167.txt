He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip . 
Hall sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as Jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . 
A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together . 
`` Get the feet , '' said Jaffers between his teeth . 
Mr. Hall , endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and Mr. Wadgers , seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of Jaffers , retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with Mr. Huxter and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order .
