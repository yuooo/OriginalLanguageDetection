Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts , very warm and comfortable . 
`` My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had since the change . 
I was in a state of physical serenity , and that was reflected in my mind .

I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days .
