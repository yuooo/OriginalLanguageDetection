After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed , he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland . 
There is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom . 
It was wailing and laughing , sobbing and groaning , and ever and again it shouted . 
It must have been queer hearing . 
It drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills .
