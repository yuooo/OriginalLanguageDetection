I stopped the gas engine , felt for and stroked the beast , which was still insensible , and then , being tired , left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed . 
I found it hard to sleep . 
I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff , going over the experiment over and over again , or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me , until everything , the ground I stood on , vanished , and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets . 
About two , the cat began miaowing about the room . 
I tried to hush it by talking to it , and then I decided to turn it out .
