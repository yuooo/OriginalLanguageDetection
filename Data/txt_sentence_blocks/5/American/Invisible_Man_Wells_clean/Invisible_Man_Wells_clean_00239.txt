At that precise moment Mr. Cuss and Mr. Bunting were in the parlour . 
They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning , and were , with Mr. Hall 's permission , making a thorough examination of the Invisible Man 's belongings .

The stranger 's scattered garments had been removed by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up .
