`` I slept during the forenoon , pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light , and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking . 
My strength had returned . 
I sat up and listened and heard a whispering . 
I sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus , and to distribute it about the room , so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement . 
Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called , first my landlord 's , and then two others .
