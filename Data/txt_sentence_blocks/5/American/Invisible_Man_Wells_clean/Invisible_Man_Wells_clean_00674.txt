To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of the Invisible Man , the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine . 
But this is pure hypothesis . 
The only undeniable facts -- for stories of children are often unreliable -- are the discovery of Wicksteed 's body , done to death , and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the nettles . 
The abandonment of the rod by Griffin , suggests that in the emotional excitement of the affair , the purpose for which he took it -- if he had a purpose -- was abandoned . 
He was certainly an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man , but the sight of his victim , his first victim , bloody and pitiful at his feet , may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived .
