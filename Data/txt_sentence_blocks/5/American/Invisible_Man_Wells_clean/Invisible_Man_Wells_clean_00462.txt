If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light , it can not of itself be visible . 
You see an opaque red box , for instance , because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest , all the red part of the light , to you . 
If it did not absorb any particular part of the light , but reflected it all , then it would be a shining white box . 
Silver ! 
A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface , but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted , so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies -- a sort of skeleton of light .
