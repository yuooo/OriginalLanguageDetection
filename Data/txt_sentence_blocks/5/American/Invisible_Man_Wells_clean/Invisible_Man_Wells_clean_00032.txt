`` I thought , sir , '' said Mrs. Hall , `` you 'd prefer the clock -- '' `` Certainly , '' said the stranger , `` certainly -- but , as a rule , I like to be alone and undisturbed . 
`` But I 'm really glad to have the clock seen to , '' he said , seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey 's manner .
