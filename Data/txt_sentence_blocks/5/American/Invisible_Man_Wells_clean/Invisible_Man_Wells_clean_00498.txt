I remember the shock I had when striking a light -- there were just the round eyes shining green -- and nothing round them . 
I would have given it milk , but I had n't any . 
It would n't be quiet , it just sat down and miaowed at the door . 
I tried to catch it , with an idea of putting it out of the window , but it would n't be caught , it vanished . 
Then it began miaowing in different parts of the room .
