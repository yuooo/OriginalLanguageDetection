The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example -- a man named Kemp . 
Death starts for him to-day . 
He may lock himself away , hide himself away , get guards about him , put on armour if he likes -- Death , the unseen Death , is coming . 
Let him take precautions ; it will impress my people . 
Death starts from the pillar box by midday .
