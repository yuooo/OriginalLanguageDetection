People down the village heard shouts and shrieks , and looking up the street saw the `` Coach and Horses '' violently firing out its humanity . 
They saw Mrs. Hall fall down and Mr. Teddy Henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her , and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie , who , emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult , had come upon the headless stranger from behind . 
These increased suddenly . 
Forthwith everyone all down the street , the sweetstuff seller , cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant , the swing man , little boys and girls , rustic dandies , smart wenches , smocked elders and aproned gipsies -- began running towards the inn , and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people , and rapidly increasing , swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested , in front of Mrs. Hall 's establishment . 
Everyone seemed eager to talk at once , and the result was Babel .
