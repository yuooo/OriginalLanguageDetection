On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me , Kemp , to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal .

I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back .
