YOU do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter . 
That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly . 
There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth . 
That is nothing . 
I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary .
