I could n't stood it much longer . 
Then for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety . 
Miss Watson would say , `` Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; '' and `` Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; '' and pretty soon she would say , `` Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave ? '' 
Then she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there . 
She got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm .
