Can you inform us , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch began , with extreme gentleness , `` where did you get so much money all of a sudden , when it appears from the facts , from the reckoning of time , that you had not been home ? '' 
The prosecutor 's brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly , but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` No , I did n't go home , '' answered Mitya , apparently perfectly composed , but looking at the floor . 
`` Allow me then to repeat my question , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as though creeping up to the subject . 
`` Where were you able to procure such a sum all at once , when by your own confession , at five o'clock the same day you - '' `` I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin , and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she would n't give me , and so on , and all the rest of it , '' Mitya interrupted sharply . 
`` Yes , gentlemen , I was in want of it , and suddenly thousands turned up , eh ? 
Do you know , gentlemen , you 're both afraid now ` what if he wo n't tell us where he got it ? ' 
That 's just how it is . 
I 'm not going to tell you , gentlemen . 
You 've guessed right . 
You 'll never know , '' said Mitya , chipping out each word with extraordinary determination . 
The lawyers were silent for a moment . 
`` You must understand , Mr. Karamazov , that it is of vital importance for us to know , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , softly and suavely . 
`` I understand ; but still I wo n't tell you . '' 
The prosecutor , too , intervened , and again reminded the prisoner that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions , if he thought it to his interest , and so on . 
But in view of the damage he might do himself by his silence , especially in a case of such importance as - `` And so on , gentlemen , and so on . 
Enough ! 
I 've heard that rigmarole before , '' Mitya interrupted again . 
`` I can see for myself how important it is , and that this is the vital point , and still I wo n't say . '' 
`` What is it to us ? 
It 's not our business , but yours . . 
You are doing yourself harm , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously . 
`` You see , gentlemen , joking apart '' - Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly at them both - `` I had an inkling from the first that we should come to loggerheads at this point . 
But at first when I began to give my evidence , it was all still far away and misty ; it was all floating , and I was so simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing between us . 
Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the question , for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block . 
And now we 've come to it ! 
It 's impossible and there 's an end of it ! 
But I do n't blame you . 
You ca n't believe it all simply on my word . 
I understand that , of course . '' 
He relapsed into gloomy silence . 
`` Could n't you , without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point , could you not , at the same time , give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer , at a crisis so full of danger to you ? '' 
Mitya smiled mournfully , almost dreamily . 
`` I 'm much more good-natured than you think , gentlemen . 
I 'll tell you the reason why and give you that hint , though you do n't deserve it . 
I wo n't speak of that , gentlemen , because it would be a stain on my honour . 
The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father , if I had murdered and robbed him . 
That 's why I ca n't tell you . 
I ca n't for fear of disgrace . 
What , gentlemen , are you going to write that down ? '' 
`` Yes , we 'll write it down , '' lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You ought not to write that down about ` disgrace . ' 
I only told you that in the goodness of my heart . 
I need n't have told you . 
I made you a present of it , so to speak , and you pounce upon it at once . 
Oh , well , write - write what you like , '' he concluded , with scornful disgust . 
`` I 'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my head before you . '' 
`` And ca n't you tell us the nature of that disgrace ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hazarded . 
The prosecutor frowned darkly . 
`` No , no , c'est fini , do n't trouble yourselves . 
It 's not worth while soiling one 's hands . 
I have soiled myself enough through you as it is . 
You 're not worth it - no one is . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I 'm not going on . '' 
This was said too peremptorily . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist further , but from Ippolit Kirillovitch 's eyes he saw that he had not given up hope . 
`` Can you not , at least , tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into Mr. Perhotin 's - how many roubles exactly ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that . '' 
`` You spoke to Mr. Perhotin , I believe , of having received three thousand from Madame Hohlakov . '' 
`` Perhaps I did . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I wo n't say how much I had . '' 
`` Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you have done since you arrived ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you might ask the people here about that . 
But I 'll tell you if you like . '' 
He proceeded to do so , but we wo n't repeat his story . 
He told it dryly and curtly . 
Of the raptures of his love he said nothing , but told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself , owing to `` new factors in the case . '' 
He told the story without going into motives or details . 
And this time the lawyers did not worry him much . 
It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here . 
`` We shall verify all that . 
We will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses , which will , of course , take place in your presence , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion . 
`` And now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession , especially all the money you still have about you . '' 
`` My money , gentlemen ? 
Certainly . 
I understand that that is necessary . 
I 'm surprised , indeed , that you have n't inquired about it before . 
It 's true I could n't get away anywhere . 
I 'm sitting here where I can be seen . 
But here 's my money - count it - take it . 
That 's all , I think . '' 
He turned it all out of his pockets ; even the small change - two pieces of twenty copecks - he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket . 
They counted the money , which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles , and forty copecks . 
`` And is that all ? '' 
asked the investigating lawyer . 
`` You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at Plotnikovs ' . 
You gave Perhotin ten , your driver twenty , here you lost two hundred , then ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up . 
Mitya helped him readily . 
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total . 
`` With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first ? '' 
`` I suppose so , '' snapped Mitya . 
`` How is it they all assert there was much more ? '' 
`` Let them assert it . '' 
`` But you asserted it yourself . '' 
`` Yes , I did , too . '' 
`` We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet examined . 
Do n't be anxious about your money . 
It will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning ... if it appears , or , so to speak , is proved that you have undisputed right to it . 
Well , and now ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up , and informed Mitya firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search `` of your clothes and everything else ... '' `` By all means , gentlemen . 
I 'll turn out all my pockets , if you like . '' 
And he did , in fact , begin turning out his pockets . 
`` It will be necessary to take off your clothes , too . '' 
`` What ! 
Undress ? 
Ugh ! 
Damn it ! 
Wo n't you search me as I am ? 
Ca n't you ? '' 
`` It 's utterly impossible , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You must take off your clothes . '' 
`` As you like , '' Mitya submitted gloomily ; `` only , please , not here , but behind the curtains . 
Who will search them ? '' 
`` Behind the curtains , of course . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent . 
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity . 
The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny . 
`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya . 
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers . 
There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes . 
`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? '' 
`` Yes , '' Mitya jerked out . 
`` That is , what blood ? 
... and why is the cuff turned in ? '' 
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory , and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin 's . 
`` You must take off your shirt , too . 
That 's very important as material evidence . '' 
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage . 
`` What , am I to stay naked ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Do n't disturb yourself . 
We will arrange something . 
And meanwhile take off your socks . '' 
`` You 're not joking ? 
Is that really necessary ? '' 
Mitya 's eyes flashed . 
`` We are in no mood for joking , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly . 
`` Well , if I must - '' muttered Mitya , and sitting down on the bed , he took off his socks . 
He felt unbearably awkward . 
All were clothed , while he was naked , and strange to say , when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence , and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them , and that now they had a perfect right to despise him . 
`` When all are undressed , one is somehow not ashamed , but when one 's the only one undressed and everybody is looking , it 's degrading , '' he kept repeating to himself , again and again . 
`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . '' 
`` Well , am I to stay naked like this ? '' 
he added savagely . 
`` Yes , that ca n't be helped for the time ... . 
Kindly sit down here for a while . 
You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed , and I. . . 
I 'll see to all this . '' 
All the things were shown to the witnesses . 
The report of the search was drawn up , and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out , and the clothes were carried out after him . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out , too . 
Mitya was left alone with the peasants , who stood in silence , never taking their eyes off him . 
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt . 
Luckily he had them all in his trunk . 
You can keep your own socks and underclothes . '' 
Mitya flew into a passion . 
`` I wo n't have other people 's clothes ! '' 
he shouted menacingly , `` give me my own ! '' 
`` It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Give me my own . 
Damn Kalganov and his clothes , too ! '' 
It was a long time before they could persuade him . 
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down . 
They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled . 
`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before . 
He had an absurd nightmarish feeling , as though he were out of his mind . 
`` Well , what now ? 
Are you going to flog me ? 
That 's all that 's left for you , '' he said , clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor . 
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though he disdained to speak to him . 
`` He looked too closely at my socks , and turned them inside out on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were - the scoundrel ! '' 
`` Well , now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though in reply to Mitya 's question . 
`` Yes , '' said the prosecutor thoughtfully , as though reflecting on something . 
`` We 've done what we could in your interest , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on , `` but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you , we are , at the present moment - '' `` What is the stone in your ring ? '' 
Mitya interrupted suddenly , as though awakening from a reverie . 
He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it ! 
... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night ! 
... And should I have been like this on this night , and at this moment , sitting with you , could I have talked like this , could I have moved like this , could I have looked at you and at the world like this , if I had really been the murderer of my father , when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night - not from fear - oh , not simply from fear of your punishment ! 
The disgrace of it ! 
And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you , who see nothing and believe in nothing , blind moles and scoffers , and to tell you another nasty thing I 've done , another disgrace , even if that would save me from your accusation ! 
No , better Siberia ! 
The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door , he killed him , he robbed him . 
Who was he ? 
I 'm racking my brains and ca n't think who . 
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov , and that 's all I can tell you , and that 's enough , enough , leave me alone ... . 
Exile me , punish me , but do n't bother me any more . 
I 'll say no more . 
Call your witnesses ! '' 
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future . 
The prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking , observed , as though it were the most ordinary thing , with the most frigid and composed air : `` Oh , about the open door of which you spoke just now , we may as well inform you , by the way , now , of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us , that has been given us by Grigory , the old man you wounded . 
On his recovery , he clearly and emphatically stated , in reply to our questions , that when , on coming out to the steps , and hearing a noise in the garden , he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open , before he noticed you running , as you have told us already , in the dark from the open window where you saw your father , he , Grigory , glanced to the left , and , while noticing the open window , observed at the same time , much nearer to him , the door , standing wide open - that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden . 
I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door , though , of course , he did not see you do so with his own eyes , since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden , running towards the fence . '' 
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he yelled , in a sudden frenzy , `` it 's a barefaced lie . 
He could n't have seen the door open because it was shut . 
He 's lying ! '' 
`` I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement . 
He does not waver . 
He adheres to it . 
We 've cross-examined him several times . '' 
`` Precisely . 
I have cross-examined him several times , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly . 
`` It 's false , false ! 
It 's either an attempt to slander me , or the hallucination of a madman , '' Mitya still shouted . 
`` He 's simply raving , from loss of blood , from the wound . 
He must have fancied it when he came to ... . 
He 's raving . '' 
`` Yes , but he noticed the open door , not when he came to after his injuries , but before that , as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge . '' 
`` But it 's false , it 's false ! 
It ca n't be so ! 
He 's slandering me from spite ... . 
He could n't have seen it ... I did n't come from the door , '' gasped Mitya . 
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him impressively : `` Confront him with it . '' 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope , on which three seals still remained intact . 
The envelope was empty , and slit open at one end . 
Mitya stared at it with open eyes . 
`` It ... it must be that envelope of my father 's , the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there 's inscribed on it , allow me , ` For my little chicken ' ... yes - three thousand ! '' 
he shouted , `` do you see , three thousand , do you see ? '' 
`` Of course , we see . 
But we did n't find the money in it . 
It was empty , and lying on the floor by the bed , behind the screen . '' 
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck . 
`` Gentlemen , it 's Smerdyakov ! '' 
he shouted suddenly , at the top of his voice . 
`` It 's he who 's murdered him ! 
He 's robbed him ! 
No one else knew where the old man hid the envelope . 
It 's Smerdyakov , that 's clear , now ! '' 
`` But you , too , knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow . '' 
`` I never knew it . 
I 've never seen it . 
This is the first time I 've looked at it . 
I 'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov ... . 
He was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden , I did n't know ... '' Mitya was completely breathless . 
`` But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father 's pillow . 
You especially stated that it was under the pillow , so you must have known it . '' 
`` We 've got it written down , '' confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Nonsense ! 
It 's absurd ! 
I 'd no idea it was under the pillow . 
And perhaps it was n't under the pillow at all ... . 
It was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow . 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
Have you asked him where it was ? 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
That 's the chief point ... . 
And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself ... . 
I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow , and now you - Oh , you know how one says the wrong thing , without meaning it . 
No one knew but Smerdyakov , only Smerdyakov , and no one else ... . 
He did n't even tell me where it was ! 
But it 's his doing , his doing ; there 's no doubt about it , he murdered him , that 's as clear as daylight now , '' Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically , repeating himself incoherently , and growing more and more exasperated and excited . 
`` You must understand that , and arrest him at once ... . 
He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious , that 's clear now ... . 
He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal , and without the signal father would never have opened the door ... '' `` But you 're again forgetting the circumstance , '' the prosecutor observed , still speaking with the same restraint , though with a note of triumph , `` that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there , while you were in the garden ... '' `` The door , the door , '' muttered Mitya , and he stared speechless at the prosecutor . 
He sank back helpless in his chair . 
All were silent . 
`` Yes , the door ! 
... It 's a nightmare ! 
God is against me ! '' 
he exclaimed , staring before him in complete stupefaction . 
`` Come , you see , '' the prosecutor went on with dignity , `` and you can judge for yourself , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
On the one hand , we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out , a fact which overwhelms you and us . 
On the other side , your incomprehensible , persistent , and , so to speak , obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands , when only three hours earlier , on your own showing , you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles ! 
In view of all these facts , judge for yourself . 
What are we to believe , and what can we depend upon ? 
And do n't accuse us of being ` frigid , cynical , scoffing people , ' who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart ... . 
Try to enter into our position ... '' Mitya was indescribably agitated . 
He turned pale . 
`` Very well ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly , `` I will tell you my secret . 
I 'll tell you where I got the money ! 
... I 'll reveal my shame , that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter . '' 
`` And believe me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch , in a voice of almost pathetic delight , `` that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may , later on , have an immense influence in your favour , and may , indeed , moreover - '' But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table , and he checked himself in time . 
Mitya , it is true , had not heard him . 
Mitya 's Great Secret Received with Hisses `` GENTLEMEN , '' he began , still in the same agitation , `` I want to make a full confession : that money was my own . '' 
The lawyer 's faces lengthened . 
That was not at all what they expected . 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` when at five o'clock on the same day , from your own confession - '' `` Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession ! 
That 's nothing to do with it now ! 
That money was my own , my own , that is , stolen by me ... not mine , I mean , but stolen by me , and it was fifteen hundred roubles , and I had it on me all the time , all the time ... '' `` But where did you get it ? '' 
`` I took it off my neck , gentlemen , off this very neck ... it was here , round my neck , sewn up in a rag , and I 'd had it round my neck a long time , it 's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace ! '' 
`` And from whom did you ... appropriate it ? '' 
`` You mean , ` steal it ' ? 
Speak out plainly now . 
Yes , I consider that I practically stole it , but , if you prefer , I ` appropriated it . ' 
I consider I stole it . 
And last night I stole it finally . '' 
`` Last night ? 
But you said that it 's a month since you ... obtained it ? 
... '' `` Yes . 
But not from my father . 
Not from my father , do n't be uneasy . 
I did n't steal it from my father , but from her . 
Let me tell you without interrupting . 
It 's hard to do , you know . 
You see , a month ago , I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna , formerly my betrothed . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` I know you know her . 
She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that . 
No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me . 
How 's that ? 
Why , when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand , not fifteen hundred , everybody knows that . '' 
`` Who knows it ? 
Who counted the money ? 
Did I let anyone count it ? '' 
`` Why , you told everyone yourself that you 'd spent exactly three thousand . '' 
`` It 's true , I did . 
I told the whole town so , and the whole town said so . 
And here , at Mokroe , too , everyone reckoned it was three thousand . 
Yet I did n't spend three thousand , but fifteen hundred . 
And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag . 
That 's how it was , gentlemen . 
That 's where I got that money yesterday ... '' `` This is almost miraculous , '' murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Allow me to inquire , '' observed the prosecutor at last , `` have you informed anyone whatever of this circumstance before ; I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago ? '' 
`` I told no one . '' 
`` That 's strange . 
Do you mean absolutely no one ? '' 
`` Absolutely no one . 
No one and nobody . '' 
`` What was your reason for this reticence ? 
What was your motive for making such a secret of it ? 
To be more precise : You have told us at last your secret , in your words , so ` disgraceful , ' though in reality - that is , of course , comparatively speaking - this action , that is , the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to someone else , and , of course , only for a time is , in my view at least , only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful , when one takes into consideration your character ... . 
Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable , still , discreditable is not ` disgraceful . ' 
... Many people have already guessed , during this last month , about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna 's that you have spent , and I heard the legend myself , apart from your confession ... . 
Mihail Makarovitch , for instance , had heard it , too , so that indeed , it was scarcely a legend , but the gossip of the whole town . 
There are indications , too , if I am not mistaken , that you confessed this yourself to someone , I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna 's , and so , it 's extremely surprising to me that hitherto , that is , up to the present moment , you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by , apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret ... . 
It 's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret ... . 
You cried out , just now , that Siberia would be better than confessing it ... '' The prosecutor ceased speaking . 
He was provoked . 
He did not conceal his vexation , which was almost anger , and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen , disconnectedly and incoherently , without choosing words . 
`` It 's not the fifteen hundred that 's the disgrace , but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand , '' said Mitya firmly . 
`` Why ? '' 
smiled the prosecutor irritably . 
`` What is there disgraceful , to your thinking , in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably , if you prefer , ` disgracefully , ' appropriated ? 
Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it . 
And by the way , why did you do that - why did you set apart that half , for what purpose , for what object did you do it ? 
Can you explain that to us ? '' 
`` Oh , gentlemen , the purpose is the whole point ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I put it aside because I was vile , that is , because I was calculating , and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month . '' 
`` It 's incomprehensible . '' 
`` I wonder at you . 
But I 'll make it clearer . 
Perhaps it really is incomprehensible . 
You see , attend to what I say . 
I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honour ; I spend it on a spree , say I spend it all , and next morning I go to her and say , ` Katya , I 've done wrong , I 've squandered your three thousand ' ; well , is that right ? 
No , it 's not right - it 's dishonest and cowardly ; I 'm a beast , with no more self-control than a beast , that 's so , is n't it ? 
But still I 'm not a thief ? 
Not a downright thief , you 'll admit ! 
I squandered it , but I did n't steal it . 
Now a second , rather more favourable alternative : follow me carefully , or I may get confused again - my head 's going round - and so , for the second alternative : I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand , that is , only half . 
Next day I go and take that half to her : ` Katya , take this fifteen hundred from me , I 'm a low beast , and an untrustworthy scoundrel , for I 've wasted half the money , and I shall waste this , too , so keep me from temptation ! ' 
Well , what of that alternative ? 
I should be a beast and a scoundrel , and whatever you like ; but not a thief , not altogether a thief , or I should not have brought back what was left , but have kept that , too . 
She would see at once that since I brought back half , I should pay back what I 'd spent , that I should never give up trying to , that I should work to get it and pay it back . 
So in that case I should be a scoundrel , but not a thief , you may say what you like , not a thief ! '' 
`` I admit that there is a certain distinction , '' said the prosecutor , with a cold smile . 
`` But it 's strange that you see such a vital difference . '' 
`` Yes , I see a vital difference . 
Every man may be a scoundrel , and perhaps every man is a scoundrel , but not everyone can be a thief ; it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that . 
Oh , of course , I do n't know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel , that 's my conviction . 
Listen , I carry the money about me a whole month ; I may make up my mind to give it back to-morrow , and I 'm a scoundrel no longer ; but I can not make up my mind , you see , though I 'm making up my mind every day , and every day spurring myself on to do it , and yet for a whole month I ca n't bring myself to it , you see . 
Is that right to your thinking , is that right ? '' 
`` Certainly , that 's not right ; that I can quite understand , and that I do n't dispute , '' answered the prosecutor with reserve . 
`` And let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions , and , if you will be so kind , get back to the point . 
And the point is , that you have still not told us , although we 've asked you , why , in the first place , you halved the money , squandering one half and hiding the other ? 
For what purpose exactly did you hide it , what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred ? 
I insist upon that question , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Yes , of course ! '' 
cried Mitya , striking himself on the forehead ; `` forgive me , I 'm worrying you , and am not explaining the chief point , or you 'd understand in a minute , for it 's just the motive of it that 's the disgrace ! 
You see , it was all to do with the old man , my dead father . 
He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous ; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him . 
So I kept thinking everyday , suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden , suppose she were to leave off tormenting me , and were suddenly to say to me , ' I love you , not him ; take me to the other end of the world . ' 
And I 'd only forty copecks ; how could I take her away , what could I do ? 
Why , I 'd be lost . 
You see , I did n't know her then , I did n't understand her , I thought she wanted money , and that she would n't forgive my poverty . 
And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand , sewed it up , calculating on it , sewed it up before I was drunk , and after I had sewn it up , I went off to get drunk on the rest . 
Yes , that was base . 
Do you understand now ? '' 
Both the lawyers laughed aloud . 
`` I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all , '' chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` for after all what does it amount to ? '' 
`` Why , that I stole it , that 's what it amounts to ! 
Oh , God , you horrify me by not understanding ! 
Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck , every day and every hour I said to myself , ` You 're a thief ! 
you 're a thief ! ' 
Yes , that 's why I 've been so savage all this month , that 's why I fought in the tavern , that 's why I attacked my father , it was because I felt I was a thief . 
I could n't make up my mind ; I did n't dare even to tell Alyosha , my brother , about that fifteen hundred : I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket . 
But , do you know , while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour : ` No , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you may yet not be a thief . ' 
Why ? 
Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya . 
And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck , on my way from Fenya 's to Perhotin . 
I had n't been able till that moment to bring myself to it . 
And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief , a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life . 
Why ? 
Because , with that I destroyed , too , my dream of going to Katya and saying , ` I 'm a scoundrel , but not a thief ! 
Do you understand now ? 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` What was it made you decide to do it yesterday ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch interrupted . 
`` Why ? 
It 's absurd to ask . 
Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning , here , at dawn . 
I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honour . 
But I see it 's not so , it turns out that it does make a difference . 
Believe me , gentlemen , what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I 'd killed the old servant , and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded , and Heaven was open to me again . 
Oh , that did torture me , but not in the same way ; not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it , and had become a downright thief ! 
Oh , gentlemen , I tell you again , with a bleeding heart , I have learnt a great deal this night . 
I have learnt that it 's not only impossible to live a scoundrel , but impossible to die a scoundrel ... . 
No , gentlemen , one must die honest ... '' Mitya was pale . 
His face had a haggard and exhausted look , in spite of his being intensely excited . 
`` I am beginning to understand you , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor said slowly , a soft and almost compassionate tone . 
`` But all this , if you 'll excuse my saying so , is a matter of nerves , in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves , that 's what it is . 
And why , for instance , should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month , by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you ? 
And why could you not have explained things to her , and in view of your position , which you describe as being so awful , why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one 's mind , that is , after honourably confessing your errors to her , why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses , which , with her generous heart , she would certainly not have refused you in your distress , especially if it had been with some guarantee , or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov , and to Madame Hohlakov ? 
I suppose you still regard that security as of value ? '' 
Mitya suddenly crimsoned . 
`` Surely you do n't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that ? 
You ca n't be speaking in earnest ? '' 
he said , with indignation , looking the prosecutor straight in the face , and seeming unable to believe his ears . 
`` I assure you I 'm in earnest ... Why do you imagine I 'm not serious ? '' 
It was the prosecutor 's turn to be surprised . 
`` Oh , how base that would have been ! 
Gentlemen , do you know , you are torturing me ! 
Let me tell you everything , so be it . 
I 'll confess all my infernal wickedness , but to put you to shame , and you 'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink . 
You must know that I already had that plan myself , that plan you spoke of , just now , prosecutor ! 
Yes , gentlemen , I , too , have had that thought in my mind all this current month , so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya - I was mean enough for that . 
But to go to her , to tell her of my treachery , and for that very treachery , to carry it out , for the expenses of that treachery , to beg for money from her , Katya -LRB- to beg , do you hear , to beg -RRB- , and go straight from her to run away with the other , the rival , who hated and insulted her - to think of it ! 
You must be mad , prosecutor ! '' 
`` Mad I am not , but I did speak in haste , without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case , as you assert ... yes , perhaps there is something of the kind , '' said the prosecutor , smiling . 
`` But that would have been so infamous ! '' 
Mitya brought his fist down on the table fiercely . 
`` That would have been filthy beyond everything ! 
Yes , do you know that she might have given me that money , yes , and she would have given it , too ; she 'd have been certain to give it , to be revenged on me , she 'd have given it to satisfy her vengeance , to show her contempt for me , for hers is an infernal nature , too , and she 's a woman of great wrath . 
I 'd have taken the money , too , oh , I should have taken it ; I should have taken it , and then , for the rest of my life ... oh , God ! 
Forgive me , gentlemen , I 'm making such an outcry because I 've had that thought in my mind so lately , only the day before yesterday , that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy , and afterwards yesterday , all day yesterday , I remember , till that happened ... '' `` Till what happened ? '' 
put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively , but Mitya did not hear it . 
`` I have made you an awful confession , '' Mitya said gloomily in conclusion . 
`` You must appreciate it , and what 's more , you must respect it , for if not , if that leaves your souls untouched , then you 've simply no respect for me , gentlemen , I tell you that , and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you ! 
Oh , I shall shoot myself ! 
Yes , I see , I see already that you do n't believe me . 
What , you want to write that down , too ? '' 
he cried in dismay . 
`` Yes , what you said just now , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , looking at him surprise , `` that is , that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her ... . 
I assure you , that 's a very important piece of evidence for us , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you , particularly important for you . '' 
`` Have mercy , gentlemen ! '' 
Mitya flung up his hands . 
`` Do n't write that , anyway ; have some shame . 
Here I 've torn my heart asunder before you , and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves ... . 
Oh , my God ! '' 
In despair he hid his face in his hands . 
`` Do n't worry yourself so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' observed the prosecutor , `` everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards , and what you do n't agree to we 'll alter as you like . 
But now I 'll ask you one little question for the second time . 
Has no one , absolutely no one , heard from you of that money you sewed up ? 
That , I must tell you , is almost impossible to believe . '' 
`` No one , no one , I told you so before , or you 've not understood anything ! 
Let me alone ! '' 
`` Very well , this matter is bound to be explained , and there 's plenty of time for it , but meantime , consider ; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad , and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you 'd spent here ; three thousand , not fifteen hundred . 
And now , too , when you got hold of the money you had yesterday , you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you . '' 
`` You 've got not dozens , but hundreds of witnesses , two hundred witnesses , two hundred have heard it , thousands have heard it ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Well , you see , all bear witness to it . 
And the word all means something . '' 
`` It means nothing . 
I talked rot , and everyone began repeating it . '' 
`` But what need had you to ` talk rot , ' as you call it ? '' 
`` The devil knows . 
From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money ... . 
To try and forget that money I had sewn up , perhaps ... yes , that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question ? 
Well , I told a fib , and that was the end of it ; once I 'd said it , I did n't care to correct it . 
What does a man tell lies for sometimes ? '' 
`` That 's very difficult to decide , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , what makes a man tell lies , '' observed the prosecutor impressively . 
`` Tell me , though , was that ` amulet , ' as you call it , on your neck , a big thing ? '' 
`` No , not big . '' 
`` How big , for instance ? '' 
`` If you fold a hundred-rouble note in half , that would be the size . '' 
`` You 'd better show us the remains of it . 
You must have them somewhere . '' 
`` Damnation , what nonsense ! 
I do n't know where they are . '' 
`` But excuse me : where and when did you take it off your neck ? 
According to your own evidence you did n't go home . '' 
`` When I was going from Fenya 's to Perhotin 's , on the way I tore it off my neck and took out the money . '' 
`` In the dark ? '' 
`` What should I want a light for ? 
I did it with my fingers in one minute . '' 
`` Without scissors , in the street ? '' 
`` In the market-place I think it was . 
Why scissors ? 
It was an old rag . 
It was torn in a minute . '' 
`` Where did you put it afterwards ? '' 
`` I dropped it there . '' 
`` Where was it , exactly ? '' 
`` In the market-place , in the market-place ! 
The devil knows whereabouts . 
What do you want to know for ? '' 
`` That 's extremely important , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
It would be material evidence in your favour . 
How is it you do n't understand that ? 
Who helped you to sew it up a month ago ? '' 
`` No one helped me . 
I did it myself . '' 
`` Can you sew ? '' 
`` A soldier has to know how to sew . 
No knowledge was needed to do that . '' 
`` Where did you get the material , that is , the rag in which you sewed the money ? '' 
`` Are you laughing at me ? '' 
`` Not at all . 
And we are in no mood for laughing , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` I do n't know where I got the rag from - somewhere , I suppose . '' 
`` I should have thought you could n't have forgotten it ? '' 
`` Upon my word , I do n't remember . 
I might have torn a bit off my linen . '' 
`` That 's very interesting . 
We might find in your lodgings to-morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag . 
What sort of rag was it , cloth or linen ? '' 
`` Goodness only knows what it was . 
Wait a bit ... I believe I did n't tear it off anything . 
It was a bit of calico ... . 
I believe I sewed it up in a cap of my landlady 's . '' 
`` In your landlady 's cap ? '' 
`` Yes . 
I took it from her . '' 
`` How did you get it ? '' 
`` You see , I remember once taking a cap for a rag , perhaps to wipe my pen on . 
I took it without asking , because it was a worthless rag . 
I tore it up , and I took the notes and sewed them up in it . 
I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them . 
An old piece of calico , washed a thousand times . '' 
`` And you remember that for certain now ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether for certain . 
I think it was in the cap . 
But , hang it , what does it matter ? '' 
`` In that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost ? '' 
`` No , she wo n't , she did n't miss it . 
It was an old rag , I tell you , an old rag not worth a farthing . '' 
`` And where did you get the needle and thread ? '' 
`` I 'll stop now . 
I wo n't say any more . 
Enough of it ! '' 
said Mitya , losing his temper at last . 
`` It 's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place . '' 
`` Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow , and perhaps you 'll find it , '' said Mitya sneering . 
`` Enough , gentlemen , enough ! '' 
he decided , in an exhausted voice . 
`` I see you do n't believe me ! 
Not for a moment ! 
It 's my fault , not yours . 
I ought not to have been so ready . 
Why , why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you ? 
it 's a joke to you . 
I see that from your eyes . 
You led me on to it , prosecutor ! 
Sing a hymn of triumph if you can ... . 
Damn you , you torturers ! '' 
He bent his head , and hid his face in his hands . 
The lawyers were silent . 
A minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly . 
His face now expressed complete , hopeless despair , and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening . 
In the meantime they had to finish what they were about . 
They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses . 
It was by now eight o'clock in the morning . 
The lights had been extinguished long ago . 
Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov , who had been continually in and out of the room all the while the interrogation had been going on , had now both gone out again . 
The lawyers , too , looked very tired . 
It was a wretched morning , the whole sky was overcast , and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls . 
Mitya gazed blankly out of window . 
`` May I look out of window ? '' 
he asked Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly . 
`` Oh , as much as you like , '' the latter replied . 
Mitya got up and went to the window ... . 
The rain lashed against its little greenish panes . 
He could see the muddy road just below the house , and farther away , in the rain and mist , a row of poor , black , dismal huts , looking even blacker and poorer in the rain . 
Mitya thought of `` Phoebus the golden-haired , and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray . 
`` Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this , '' he thought with a smile , and suddenly , flinging his hand downwards , he turned to his `` torturers . '' 
`` Gentlemen , '' he cried , `` I see that I am lost ! 
But she ? 
Tell me about her , I beseech you . 
Surely she need not be ruined with me ? 
She 's innocent , you know , she was out of her mind when she cried last night ` It 's all my fault ! ' 
She 's done nothing , nothing ! 
I 've been grieving over her all night as I sat with you ... . 
Ca n't you , wo n't you tell me what you are going to do with her now ? '' 
`` You can set your mind quite at rest on that score , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' the prosecutor answered at once , with evident alacrity . 
`` We have , so far , no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested . 
I trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case ... . 
On the contrary , we 'll do everything that lies in our power in that matter . 
Set your mind completely at rest . '' 
`` Gentlemen , I thank you . 
I knew that you were honest , straightforward people in spite of everything . 
You 've taken a load off my heart ... . 
Well , what are we to do now ? 
I 'm ready . '' 
`` Well , we ought to make haste . 
We must pass to examining the witnesses without delay . 
That must be done in your presence and therefore - '' `` Should n't we have some tea first ? '' 
interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` I think we 've deserved it ! '' 
They decided that if tea were ready downstairs -LRB- Mihail Makarovitch had , no doubt , gone down to get some -RRB- they would have a glass and then `` go on and on , '' putting off their proper breakfast until a more favourable opportunity . 
Tea really was ready below , and was soon brought up . 
Mitya at first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him , but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily . 
He looked surprisingly exhausted . 
It might have been supposed from his Herculean strength that one night of carousing , even accompanied by the most violent emotions , could have had little effect on him . 
But he felt that he could hardly hold his head up , and from time to time all the objects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eyes . 
`` A little more and I shall begin raving , '' he said to himself . 
The Evidences of the Witnesses . 
The Babe THE examination of the witnesses began . 
But we will not continue our story in such detail as before . 
And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and conscience , and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath , how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence , and so on . 
We will only note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles ; that is , was the sum spent here , at Mokroe , by Mitya on the first occasion , a month before , three thousand or fifteen hundred ? 
And again had he spent three thousand or fifteen hundred yesterday ? 
Alas , all the evidence given by everyone turned out to be against Mitya . 
There was not one in his favour , and some witnesses introduced new , almost crushing facts , in contradiction of his , Mitya 's , story . 
The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch . 
He was not in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers . 
He had , on the contrary , an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused , which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity . 
He spoke little , and with reserve , waited to be questioned , answered precisely and deliberately . 
Firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than three thousand , that all the peasants about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself . 
`` What a lot of money he flung away on the Gypsy girls alone ! 
He wasted a thousand , I daresay , on them alone . '' 
`` I do n't believe I gave them five hundred , '' was Mitya 's gloomy comment on this . 
`` It 's a pity I did n't count the money at the time , but I was drunk ... '' Mitya was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains . 
He listened gloomily , with a melancholy and exhausted air , as though he would say : `` Oh , say what you like . 
It makes no difference now . '' 
`` More than a thousand went on them , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly . 
`` You flung it about at random and they picked it up . 
They were a rascally , thievish lot , horse-stealers , they 've been driven away from here , or maybe they 'd bear witness themselves how much they got from you . 
I saw the sum in your hands , myself - count it I did n't , you did n't let me , that 's true enough - but by the look of it I should say it was far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred , indeed ! 
We 've seen money too . 
We can judge of amounts ... '' As for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had told him , as soon as he arrived , that he had brought three thousand with him . 
`` Come now , is that so , Trifon Borissovitch ? '' 
replied Mitya . 
`` Surely I did n't declare so positively that I 'd brought three thousand ? '' 
`` You did say so , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You said it before Andrey . 
Andrey himself is still here . 
Send for him . 
And in the hall , when you were treating the chorus , you shouted straight out that you would leave your sixth thousand here - that is , with what you spent before , we must understand . 
Stepan and Semyon heard it , and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov , too , was standing beside you at the time . 
Maybe he 'd remember it ... '' The evidence as to the `` sixth '' thousand made an extraordinary impression on the two lawyers . 
They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning ; three and three made six , three thousand then and three now made six , that was clear . 
They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch , Stepan and Semyon , the driver Andrey , and Kalganov . 
The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch 's evidence . 
They noted down , with particular care , Andrey 's account of the conversation he had had with Mitya on the road : '' ` Where , ' says he , ` am I , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , going , to heaven or to hell , and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not ? ' '' 
The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile , and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be `` included in the case . '' 
Kalganov , when called , came in reluctantly , frowning and ill-humoured , and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his life , though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day for a long time past . 
He began by saying that `` he knew nothing about it and did n't want to . '' 
But it appeared that he had heard of the '' sixth '' thousand , and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the moment . 
As far as he could see he `` did n't know '' how much money Mitya had in his hands . 
He affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards . 
In reply to reiterated questions he stated that , after the Poles had been turned out , Mitya 's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved , and that she had said that she loved him . 
He spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect , as though she had been a lady of the best society , and did not once allow himself to call her Grushenka . 
In spite of the young man 's obvious repugnance at giving evidence , Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him at great length , and only from him learnt all the details of what made up Mitya 's `` romance , '' so to say , on that night . 
Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up . 
At last they let the young man go , and he left the room with unconcealed indignation . 
The Poles , too , were examined . 
Though they had gone to bed in their room , they had not slept all night , and on the arrival of the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready , realising that they would certainly be sent for . 
They gave their evidence with dignity , though not without some uneasiness . 
The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the twelfth class , who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon . 
His name was Mussyalovitch . 
Pan Vrubelvsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist . 
Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch , who was standing on one side , taking him in their ignorance for the most important person and in command , and addressed him at every word as `` Pan Colonel . '' 
Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself , they grasped that they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only . 
It turned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words . 
Of his relations with Grushenka , past and present , Pan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly , so that Mitya was roused at once and declared that he would not allow the `` scoundrel '' to speak like that in his presence ! 
Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the word `` scoundrel , '' and begged that it should be put down in the protocol . 
Mitya fumed with rage . 
`` He 's a scoundrel ! 
A scoundrel ! 
You can put that down . 
And put down , too , that , in spite of the protocol I still declare that he 's a scoundrel ! '' 
he cried . 
Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol , he showed the most praiseworthy tact and management . 
After sternly reprimanding Mitya , he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case , and hastened to pass to what was essential . 
One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special interest in the lawyers : that was how , in that very room , Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch , and had offered him three thousand roubles to resign his claims , seven hundred roubles down , and the remaining two thousand three hundred `` to be paid next day in the town . '' 
He had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at Mokroe , but that his money was in the town . 
Mitya observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in the town . 
But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement , and Mitya , after thinking for a moment admitted , frowning , that it must have been as the Poles stated , that he had been excited at the time , and might indeed have said so . 
The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence . 
It seemed to establish for the prosecution -LRB- and they did , in fact , base this deduction on it -RRB- that half , or a part of , the three thousand that had come into Mitya 's hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town , or even , perhaps , somewhere here , in Mokroe . 
This would explain the circumstance , so baffling for the prosecution , that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya 's hands . 
This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which , insignificant as it was , had hitherto told , to some extent , in Mitya 's favour . 
Now this one piece of evidence in his favour had broken down . 
In answer to the prosecutor 's inquiry , where he would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles , since he himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred , Mitya confidently replied that he had meant to offer the `` little chap , '' not money , but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of Tchermashnya , those rights which he had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov . 
The prosecutor positively smiled at the `` innocence of this subterfuge . '' 
`` And you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash ? '' 
`` He certainly would have accepted it , '' Mitya declared warmly . 
`` Why , look here , he might have grabbed not two thousand , but four or six , for it . 
He would have put his lawyers , Poles and Jews , on to the job , and might have got , not three thousand , but the whole property out of the old man . '' 
The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was , of course , entered in the protocol in the fullest detail . 
Then they let the Poles go . 
The incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them , as it was , and did not want to worry them with trifles , moreover , it was nothing but a foolish , drunken quarrel over cards . 
There had been drinking and disorder enough , that night ... . 
So the two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles . 
Then old Maximov was summoned . 
He came in timidly , approached with little steps , looking very dishevelled and depressed . 
He had , all this time , taken refuge below with Grushenka , sitting dumbly beside her , and `` now and then he 'd begin blubbering over her and wiping his eyes with a blue check handkerchief , '' as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards . 
So that she herself began trying to pacify and comfort him . 
The old man at once confessed that he had done wrong , that he had borrowed `` ten roubles in my poverty , '' from Dmitri Fyodorovitch , and that he was ready to pay it back . 
To Nikolay Parfenovitch 's direct question , had he noticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his hand , as he must have been able to see the sum better than anyone when he took the note from him , Maximov , in the most positive manner , declared that there was twenty thousand . 
`` Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before , then ? '' 
inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch , with a smile . 
`` To be sure I have , not twenty , but seven , when my wife mortgaged my little property . 
She 'd only let me look at it from a distance , boasting of it to me . 
It was a very thick bundle , all rainbow-coloured notes . 
And Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's were all rainbow-coloured ... '' He was not kept long . 
At last it was Grushenka 's turn . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might have on Mitya , and he muttered a few words of admonition to him , but Mitya bowed his head in silence , giving him to understand `` that he would not make a scene . '' 
Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in . 
She entered with a stern and gloomy face , that looked almost composed , and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
She was very pale , she seemed to be cold , and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl . 
She was suffering from a slight feverish chill - the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night . 
Her grave air , her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favourable impression on everyone . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit `` fascinated . '' 
He admitted himself , when talking about it afterwards , that only then had he seen `` how handsome the woman was , '' for , though he had seen her several times he had always looked upon her as something of a `` provincial hetaira . '' 
`` She has the manners of the best society , '' he said enthusiastically , gossiping about her in a circle of ladies . 
But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies , who immediately called him a `` naughty man , '' to his great satisfaction . 
As she entered the room , Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya , who looked at her uneasily . 
But her face reassured him at once . 
After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings , Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her , hesitating a little , but preserving the most courteous manner , on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov . 
To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied : `` He was an acquaintance . 
He came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month . '' 
To further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness , that , though `` at times '' she had thought him attractive , she had not loved him , but had won his heart as well as his old father 's `` in my nasty spite , '' that she had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and everyone else ; but that had only amused her . 
She had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch , she had simply been laughing at him . 
`` I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month . 
I was expecting another man who had wronged me . 
But I think , '' she said in conclusion , `` that there 's no need for you to inquire about that , nor for me to answer you , for that 's my own affair . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint . 
He again dismissed the `` romantic '' aspect of the case and passed to the serious one , that is , to the question of most importance , concerning the three thousand roubles . 
Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe , and , though she had not counted the money herself , she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch 's own lips . 
`` Did he tell you that alone , or before someone else , or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence ? '' 
the prosecutor inquired immediately . 
To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people , and had heard him say so when they were alone . 
`` Did he say it to you alone once , or several times ? '' 
inquired the prosecutor , and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence . 
Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew , too , where that money had come from , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` And did you never , once , hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand , but less , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use ? '' 
`` No , I never heard that , '' answered Grushenka . 
It was explained further that Mitya had , on the contrary , often told her that he had n't a farthing . 
`` He was always expecting to get some from his father , '' said Grushenka in conclusion . 
`` Did he never say before you ... casually , or in a moment of irritation , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly , `` that he intended to make an attempt on his father 's life ? '' 
`` Ach , he did say so , '' sighed Grushenka . 
`` Once or several times ? '' 
`` He mentioned it several times , always in anger . '' 
`` And did you believe he would do it ? '' 
`` No , I never believed it , '' she answered firmly . 
`` I had faith in his noble heart . '' 
`` Gentlemen , allow me , '' cried Mitya suddenly , `` allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna , in your presence . '' 
`` You can speak , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch assented . 
`` Agrafena Alexandrovna ! '' 
Mitya got up from his chair , `` have faith in God and in me . 
I am not guilty of my father 's murder ! '' 
Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his chair . 
Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon . 
`` Thanks be to Thee , O Lord , '' she said , in a voice thrilled with emotion , and still standing , she turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added : `` As he has spoken now , believe it ! 
I know him . 
He 'll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy , but he 'll never deceive you against his conscience . 
He 's telling the whole truth , you may believe it . '' 
`` Thanks , Agrafena Alexandrovna , you 've given me fresh courage , '' Mitya responded in a quivering voice . 
As to the money spent the previous day , she declared that she did not know what sum it was , but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him . 
And to the question where he got the money , she said that he had told her that he had `` stolen '' it from Katerina Ivanovna , and that she had replied to that that he had n't stolen it , and that he must pay the money back next day . 
On the prosecutor 's asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday , or what he had squandered here a month ago , she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago , and that that was how she understood him . 
Grushenka was at last released , and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could be of any assistance to her , with horses for example , or if she would care for an escort , he ... would be - `` I thank you sincerely , '' said Grushenka , bowing to him , `` I 'm going with this old gentleman ; I am driving him back to town with me , and meanwhile , if you 'll allow me , I 'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
She went out . 
Mitya was calm , and even looked more cheerful , but only for a moment . 
He felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness . 
His eyes were closing with fatigue . 
The examination of the witnesses was , at last , over . 
They procceded to a revision of the protocol . 
Mitya got up , moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain , lay down on a large chest covered with a rug , and instantly fell asleep . 
He had a strange dream , utterly out of keeping with the place and the time . 
He was driving somewhere in the steppes , where he had been stationed long ago , and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses , through snow and sleet . 
He was cold , it was early in November , and the snow was falling in big wet flakes , melting as soon as it touched the earth . 
And the peasant drove him smartly , he had a fair , long beard . 
He was not an old man , somewhere about fifty , and he had on a grey peasant 's smock . 
Not far off was a village , he could see the black huts , and half the huts were burnt down , there were only the charred beams sticking up . 
And as they drove in , there were peasant women drawn up along the road , a lot of women , a whole row , all thin and wan , with their faces a sort of brownish colour , especially one at the edge , a tall , bony woman , who looked forty , but might have been only twenty , with a long thin face . 
And in her arms was a little baby crying . 
And her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them . 
And the child cried and cried , and held out its little bare arms , with its little fists blue from cold . 
`` Why are they crying ? 
Why are they crying ? '' 
Mitya asked , as they dashed gaily by . 
`` It 's the babe , '' answered the driver , `` the babe weeping . '' 
And Mitya was struck by his saying , in his peasant way , `` the babe , '' and he liked the peasant 's calling it a `` babe . '' 
There seemed more pity in it . 
`` But why is it weeping ? '' 
Mitya persisted stupidly , `` why are its little arms bare ? 
Why do n't they wrap it up ? '' 
`` The babe 's cold , its little clothes are frozen and do n't warm it . '' 
`` But why is it ? 
Why ? '' 
foolish Mitya still persisted . 
`` Why , they 're poor people , burnt out . 
They 've no bread . 
They 're begging because they 've been burnt out . '' 
`` No , no , '' Mitya , as it were , still did not understand . 
`` Tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there ? 
Why are people poor ? 
Why is the babe poor ? 
Why is the steppe barren ? 
Why do n't they hug each other and kiss ? 
Why do n't they sing songs of joy ? 
Why are they so dark from black misery ? 
Why do n't they feed the babe ? '' 
And he felt that , though his questions were unreasonable and senseless , yet he wanted to ask just that , and he had to ask it just in that way . 
And he felt that a passion of pity , such as he had never known before , was rising in his heart , that he wanted to cry , that he wanted to do something for them all , so that the babe should weep no more , so that the dark-faced , dried-up mother should not weep , that no one should shed tears again from that moment , and he wanted to do it at once , at once , regardless of all obstacles , with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs . 
`` And I 'm coming with you . 
I wo n't leave you now for the rest of my life , I 'm coming with you '' , he heard close beside him Grushenka 's tender voice , thrilling with emotion . 
And his heart glowed , and he struggled forward towards the light , and he longed to live , to live , to go on and on , towards the new , beckoning light , and to hasten , hasten , now , at once ! 
`` What ! 
Where ? '' 
he exclaimed opening his eyes , and sitting up on the chest , as though he had revived from a swoon , smiling brightly . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch was standing over him , suggesting that he should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it . 
Mitya guessed that he had been asleep an hour or more , but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
He was suddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head , which had n't been there when he had leant back , exhausted , on the chest . 
`` Who put that pillow under my head ? 
Who was so kind ? '' 
he cried , with a sort of ecstatic gratitude , and tears in his voice , as though some great kindness had been shown him . 
He never found out who this kind man was ; perhaps one of the peasant witnesses , or Nikolay Parfenovitch 's little secretary , had compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head ; but his whole soul was quivering with tears . 
He went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they liked . 
`` I 've had a good dream , gentlemen , '' he said in a strange voice , with a new light , as of joy , in his face . 
They Carry Mitya Away WHEN the protocol had been signed , Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him the `` Committal , '' setting forth , that in such a year , on such a day , in such a place , the investigating lawyer of such-and-such a district court , having examined so-and-so -LRB- to wit , Mitya -RRB- accused of this and of that -LRB- all the charges were carefully written out -RRB- and having considered that the accused , not pleading guilty to the charges made against him , had brought forward nothing in his defence , while the witnesses , so-and-so , and so-and-so , and the circumstances such-and-such testify against him , acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of the Statute Book , and so on , has ruled , that , in order to preclude so-and-so -LRB- Mitya -RRB- from all means of evading pursuit and judgment , he be detained in such-and-such a prison , which he hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same `` Committal '' to the deputy prosecutor , and so on , and so on . 
In brief , Mitya was informed that he was , from that moment , a prisoner , and that he would be driven at once to the town , and there shut up in a very unpleasant place . 
Mitya listened attentively , and only shrugged his shoulders . 
`` Well , gentlemen , I do n't blame you . 
I 'm ready ... . 
I understand that there 's nothing else for you to do . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him gently that he would be escorted at once by the rural police officer , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , who happened to be on the spot ... `` Stay , '' Mitya interrupted , suddenly , and impelled by uncontrollable feeling he pronounced , addressing all in the room : `` Gentlemen , we 're all cruel , we 're all monsters , we all make men weep , and mothers , and babes at the breast , but of all , let it be settled here , now , of all I am the lowest reptile ! 
I 've sworn to amend , and every day I 've done the same filthy things . 
I understand now that such men as I need a blow , a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose , and bind them by a force from without . 
Never , never should I have risen of myself ! 
But the thunderbolt has fallen . 
I accept the torture of accusation , and my public shame ; I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified . 
Perhaps I shall be purified , gentlemen ? 
But listen , for the last time , I am not guilty of my father 's blood . 
I accept my punishment , not because I killed him , but because I meant to kill him , and perhaps I really might have killed him . 
Still I mean to fight it out with you . 
I warn you of that . 
I 'll fight it out with you to the end , and then God will decide . 
Good-bye , gentlemen , do n't be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the examination . 
Oh , I was still such a fool then ... . 
In another minute I shall be a prisoner , but now , for the last time , as a free man , Dmitri Karamazov offers you his hand . 
Saying good-bye to you , I say it to all men . '' 
His voice quivered and he stretched out his hand , but Nikolay Parfenovitch , who happened to stand nearest to him , with a sudden , almost nervous movement , hid his hands behind his back . 
Mitya instantly noticed this , and started . 
He let his outstretched hand fall at once . 
`` The preliminary inquiry is not yet over , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered , somewhat embarrassed . 
`` We will continue it in the town , and I , for my part , of course , am ready to wish you all success ... in your defence ... . 
As a matter of fact , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , I 've always been disposed to regard you as , so to speak , more unfortunate than guilty . 
All of us here , if I may make bold to speak for all , we are all ready to recognise that you are , at bottom , a young man of honour , but , alas , one who has been carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch 's little figure was positively majestic by the time he had finished speaking . 
It struck Mitya that in another minute this `` boy '' would take his arm , lead him to another corner , and renew their conversation about `` girls . '' 
But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to execution . 
`` Gentlemen , you are good , you are humane , may I see her to say ` good-bye ' for the last time ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` Certainly , but considering ... in fact , now it 's impossible except in the presence of - '' `` Oh , well , if it must be so , it must ! '' 
Grushenka was brought in , but the farewell was brief , and of few words , and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
Grushenka made a deep bow to Mitya . 
`` I have told you I am yours , and I will be yours . 
I will follow you for ever , wherever they may send you . 
Farewell ; you are guiltless , though you 've been your own undoing . '' 
Her lips quivered , tears flowed from her eyes . 
`` Forgive me , Grusha , for my love , for ruining you , too , with my love . '' 
Mitya would have said something more , but he broke off and went out . 
He was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him . 
At the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day before with Andrey 's three horses , two carts stood in readiness . 
Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , a sturdy , thick-set man with a wrinkled face , was annoyed about something , some sudden irregularity . 
He was shouting angrily . 
He asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness . 
`` When I stood him drinks in the tavern , the man had quite a different face , '' thought Mitya , as he got in . 
At the gates there was a crowd of people , peasants , women , and drivers . 
Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too . 
All stared at Mitya . 
`` Forgive me at parting , good people ! '' 
Mitya shouted suddenly from the cart . 
`` Forgive us too ! '' 
he heard two or three voices . 
`` Good-bye to you , too , Trifon Borissovitch ! '' 
But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round . 
He was , perhaps , too busy . 
He , too , was shouting and fussing about something . 
It appeared that everything was not yet ready in the second cart , in which two constables were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
The peasant who had been ordered to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock , stoutly maintaining that it was not his turn to go , but Akim 's . 
But Akim was not to be seen . 
They ran to look for him . 
The peasant persisted and besought them to wait . 
`` You see what our peasants are , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
They 've no shame ! '' 
exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch . 
`` Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the day before yesterday . 
You 've drunk it all and now you cry out . 
I 'm simply surprised at your good-nature , with our low peasants , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , that 's all I can say . '' 
`` But what do we want a second cart for ? '' 
Mitya put in . 
`` Let 's start with the one , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch . 
I wo n't be unruly , I wo n't run away from you , old fellow . 
What do we want an escort for ? '' 
`` I 'll trouble you , sir , to learn how to speak to me if you 've never been taught . 
I 'm not ` old fellow ' to you , and you can keep your advice for another time ! '' 
Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely , as though glad to vent his wrath . 
Mitya was reduced to silence . 
He flushed all over . 
A moment later he felt suddenly very cold . 
The rain had ceased , but the dull sky was still overcast with clouds , and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face . 
`` I 've taken a chill , '' thought Mitya , twitching his shoulders . 
At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , too , got into the cart , sat down heavily , and , as though without noticing it , squeezed Mitya into the corner . 
It is true that he was out of humour and greatly disliked the task that had been laid upon him . 
`` Good-bye , Trifon Borissovitch ! '' 
Mitya shouted again , and felt himself , that he had not called out this time from good-nature , but involuntarily , from resentment . 
But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly , with both hands behind his back , and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face , he made no reply . 
`` Good-bye , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , good-bye ! '' 
he heard all at once the voice of Kalganov , who had suddenly darted out . 
Running up to the cart he held out his hand to Mitya . 
He had no cap on . 
Mitya had time to seize and press his hand . 
`` Good-bye , dear fellow ! 
I sha n't forget your generosity , '' he cried warmly . 
But the cart moved and their hands parted . 
The bell began ringing and Mitya was driven off . 
Kalganov ran back , sat down in a corner , bent his head , hid his face in his hands , and burst out crying . 
For a long while he sat like that , crying as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty . 
Oh , he believed almost without doubt in Mitya 's guilt . 
`` What are these people ? 
What can men be after this ? '' 
he exclaimed incoherently , in bitter despondency , almost despair . 
At that moment he had no desire to live . 
`` Is it worth it ? 
Is it worth it ? '' 
exclaimed the boy in his grief . 
Kolya Krassotkin IT was the beginning of November . 
There had been a hard frost , eleven degrees Reaumur , without snow , but a little dry snow had fallen on the frozen ground during the night , and a keen dry wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our town , especially about the market-place . 
It was a dull morning , but the snow had ceased . 
Not far from the market-place , close to Plotnikov 's shop , there stood a small house , very clean both without and within . 
It belonged to Madame Krassotkin , the widow of a former provincial secretary , who had been dead for fourteen years . 
His widow , still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two , was living in her neat little house on her private means . 
She lived in respectable seclusion ; she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition . 
She was about eighteen at the time of her husband 's death ; she had been married only a year and had just borne him a son . 
From the day of his death she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her precious treasure , her boy Kolya . 
Though she had loved him passionately those fourteen years , he had caused her far more suffering than happiness . 
She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day , afraid he would fall ill , would catch cold , do something naughty , climb on a chair and fall off it , and so on and so on . 
When Kolya began going to school , the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him so as to help him , and go through his lessons with him . 
She hastened to make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives , even made up to Kolya 's schoolfellows , and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being teased , laughed at , or beaten by them . 
She went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with being a `` mother 's darling . '' 
But the boy could take his own part . 
He was a resolute boy , `` tremendously strong , '' as was rumoured in his class , and soon proved to be the fact ; he was agile , strong-willed , and of an audacious and enterprising temper . 
He was good at lessons , and there was a rumour in the school that he could beat the teacher , Dardanelov , at arithmetic and universal history . 
Though he looked down upon everyone , he was a good comrade and not supercilious . 
He accepted his schoolfellows ' respect as his due , but was friendly with them . 
Above all , he knew where to draw the line . 
He could restrain himself on occasion , and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline . 
But he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school , and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation , inventing something , something effective and conspicuous . 
He was extremely vain . 
He knew how to make even his mother give way to him ; he was almost despotic in his control of her . 
She gave way to him , oh , she had given way to him for years . 
The one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her . 
She was always fancying that Kolya was `` unfeeling '' to her , and at times , dissolving into hysterical tears , she used to reproach him with his coldness . 
The boy disliked this , and the more demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him , the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them . 
Yet it was not intentional on his part but instinctive - it was his character . 
His mother was mistaken ; he was very fond of her . 
He only disliked `` sheepish sentimentality , '' as he expressed it in his schoolboy language . 
There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his father 's . 
Kolya was fond of reading , and had read several of them by himself . 
His mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play . 
And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for his age . 
Though the boy , as a rule , knew where to draw the line in his mischief , he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm . 
It is true there was nothing vicious in what he did , but a wild mad recklessness . 
It happened that July , during the summer holidays , that the mother and son went to another district , forty-five miles away , to spend a week with a distant relation , whose husband was an official at the railway station -LRB- the very station , the nearest one to our town , from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow -RRB- . 
There Kolya began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways , knowing that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge . 
But there happened to be some other boys in the place with whom he soon made friends . 
Some of them were living at the station , others in the neighbourhood ; there were six or seven of them , all between twelve and fifteen , and two of them came from our town . 
The boys played together , and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya 's stay at the station , a mad bet was made by the foolish boys . 
Kolya , who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence , was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due , and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed . 
It is true they made a preliminary investigation , from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without touching , but to lie there was no joke ! 
Kolya maintained stoutly that he would . 
At first they laughed at him , called him a little liar , a braggart , but that only egged him on . 
What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously , and were at first disposed to treat him as `` a small boy , '' not fit to associate with them , and that was an unendurable insult . 
And so it was resolved to go in the evening , half a mile from the station , so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station The boys assembled . 
It was a pitch-dark night without a moon . 
At the time fixed , Kolya lay down between the rails . 
The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment , their hearts beating with suspense , which was followed by alarm and remorse . 
At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station . 
Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness ; the monster roared as it approached . 
`` Run , run away from the rails , '' the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes , breathless with terror . 
But it was too late : the train darted up and flew past . 
The boys rushed to Kolya . 
He lay without moving . 
They began pulling at him , lifting him up . 
He suddenly got up and walked away without a word . 
Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them , but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness , as he confessed long after to his mother . 
In this way his reputation as `` a desperate character , '' was established for ever . 
He returned home to the station as white as a sheet . 
Next day he had a slight attack of nervous fever , but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself . 
The incident did not become known at once , but when they came back to the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters . 
But then Kolya 's mother hastened to entreat the masters on her boy 's behalf , and in the end Dardanelov , a respected and influential teacher , exerted himself in his favour , and the affair was ignored . 
Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor , who had been passionately in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past , and had once already , about a year previously , ventured , trembling with fear and the delicacy of his sentiments , to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage . 
But she refused him resolutely , feeling that to accept him would be an act of treachery to her son , though Dardanelov had , to judge from certain mysterious symptoms , reason for believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow . 
Kolya 's mad prank seemed to have broken the ice , and Dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession by a suggestion of hope . 
The suggestion , it is true , was a faint one , but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy . 
He was fond of the boy , though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win him over , and was severe and strict with him in class . 
Kolya , too , kept him at a respectful distance . 
He learned his lessons perfectly ; he was second in his class , was reserved with Dardanelov , and the whole class firmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he could `` beat '' even Dardanelov . 
Kolya did indeed ask him the question , `` Who founded Troy ? '' 
to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply , referring to the movements and migrations of races , to the remoteness of the period , to the mythical legends . 
But the question , `` Who had founded Troy ? '' 
that is , what individuals , he could not answer , and even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous . 
But the boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy . 
Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in Smaragdov , whose history was among the After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya 's attitude to his mother . 
When Anna Fyodorovna -LRB- Madame Krassotkin -RRB- heard of her son 's exploit , she almost went out of her mind with horror . 
She had such terrible attacks of hysterics , lasting with intervals for several days , that Kolya , seriously alarmed at last , promised on his honour that such pranks should never be repeated . 
He swore on his knees before the holy image , and swore by the memory of his father , at Madame Krassotkin 's instance , and the `` manly '' Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six . 
And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other 's arms sobbing . 
Next day Kolya woke up as `` unfeeling '' as before , but he had become more silent , more modest , sterner , and more thoughtful . 
Six weeks later , it is true , he got into another scrape , which even brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace , but it was a scrape of quite another kind , amusing , foolish , and he did not , as it turned out , take the leading part in it , but was only implicated in it . 
But of this later . 
His mother still fretted and trembled , but the more uneasy she became , the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov . 
It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov 's heart and , of course , despised him profoundly for his `` feelings '' ; he had in the past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother , hinting vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after . 
But from the time of the railway incident his behaviour in this respect also was changed ; he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother , which the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude . 
But at the slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya 's presence , she would flush as pink as a rose . 
At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling , or would investigate the state of his boots , or would shout angrily for `` Perezvon , '' the big , shaggy , mangy dog , which he had picked up a month before , brought home , and kept for some reason secretly indoors , not showing him to any of his schoolfellows . 
He bullied him frightfully , teaching him all sorts of tricks , so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he was absent at school , and when he came in , whined with delight , rushed about as if he were crazy , begged , lay down on the ground pretending to be dead , and so on ; in fact , showed all the tricks he had taught him , not at the word of command , but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful heart . 
I have forgotten , by the way , to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov . 
Ilusha had been defending his father when the schoolboys jeered at him , shouting the nickname `` wisp of tow . '' 
Children AND so on that frosty , snowy , and windy day in November , Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home . 
It was Sunday and there was no school . 
It had just struck eleven , and he particularly wanted to go out `` on very urgent business , '' but he was left alone in charge of the house , for it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and singular event . 
Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms , separated from the rest of the house by a passage , to a doctor 's wife with her two small children . 
This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna , and a great friend of hers . 
Her husband , the doctor , had taken his departure twelve months before , going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend , and for the last six months she had not heard a word from him . 
Had it not been for her friendship with Madame Krassotkin , which was some consolation to the forsaken lady , she would certainly have completely dissolved away in tears . 
And now , to add to her misfortunes , Katerina , her only servant , was suddenly moved the evening before to announce , to her mistress 's amazement , that she proposed to bring a child into the world before morning . 
It seemed almost miraculous to everyone that no one had noticed the probability of it before . 
The astounded doctor 's wife decided to move Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept by a midwife for such emergencies . 
As she set great store by her servant , she promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her . 
By the morning all Madame Krassotkin 's friendly sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal to someone for help in the case . 
So both the ladies were absent from home , the Krassotkins ' servant , Agafya , had gone out to the market , and Kolya was thus left for a time to protect and look after `` the kids , '' that is , the son and daughter of the doctor 's wife , who were left alone . 
Kolya was not afraid of taking care of the house , besides he had Perezvon , who had been told to lie flat , without moving , under the bench in the hall . 
Every time Kolya , walking to and fro through the rooms , came into the hall , the dog shook his head and gave two loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail , but alas ! 
the whistle did not sound to release him . 
Kolya looked sternly at the luckless dog , who relapsed again into obedient rigidity . 
The one thing that troubled Kolya was `` the kids . '' 
He looked , of course , with the utmost scorn on Katerina 's unexpected adventure , but he was very fond of the bereaved `` kiddies , '' and had already taken them a picture-book . 
Nastya , the elder , a girl of eight , could read , and Kostya , the boy , aged seven , was very fond of being read to by her . 
Krassotkin could , of course , have provided more diverting entertainment for them . 
He could have made them stand side by side and played soldiers with them , or sent them hiding all over the house . 
He had done so more than once before and was not above doing it , so much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses with the little lodgers at home , prancing with his head on one side like a trace-horse . 
But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust , pointing out that to play horses with boys of one 's own age , boys of thirteen , would certainly be disgraceful `` at this date , '' but that he did it for the sake of `` the kids '' because he liked them , and no one had a right to call him to account for his feelings . 
The two `` kids '' adored him . 
But on this occasion he was in no mood for games . 
He had very important business of his own before him , something almost mysterious . 
Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya , with whom he could have left the children , would not come back from market . 
He had several times already crossed the passage , opened the door of the lodgers ' room and looked anxiously at `` the kids '' who were sitting over the book , as he had bidden them . 
Every time he opened the door they grinned at him , hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing . 
But Kolya was bothered and did not go in . 
At last it struck eleven and he made up his mind , once for all , that if that `` damned '' Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he should go out without waiting for her , making `` the kids '' promise , of course , to be brave when he was away , not to be naughty , not to cry from fright . 
With this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar , slung his satchel round his shoulder , and , regardless of his mother 's constantly reiterated entreaties that he would always put on goloshes in such cold weather , he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on . 
Perezvon , seeing him in his outdoor clothes , began tapping nervously , yet vigorously , on the floor with his tail . 
Twitching all over , he even uttered a plaintive whine . 
But Kolya , seeing his dog 's passionate excitement , decided that it was a breach of discipline , kept him for another minute under the bench , and only when he had opened the door into the passage , whistled for him . 
The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously . 
Kolya opened the door to peep at `` the kids . '' 
They were both sitting as before at the table , not reading but warmly disputing about something . 
The children often argued together about various exciting problems of life , and Nastya , being the elder , always got the best of it . 
If Kostya did not agree with her , he almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin , and his verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them . 
This time the `` kids '' ' discussion rather interested Krassotkin , and he stood still in the passage to listen . 
The children saw he was listening and that made them dispute with even greater energy . 
`` I shall never , never believe , '' Nastya prattled , `` that the old women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen garden . 
It 's winter now and there are no cabbages , and so the old woman could n't have taken Katerina a daughter . '' 
Kolya whistled to himself . 
`` Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere , but only to those who are married . '' 
Kostya stared at Nastya and listened , pondering profoundly . 
`` Nastya , how silly you are ! '' 
he said at last , firmly and calmly . 
`` How can Katerina have a baby when she is n't married ? '' 
Nastya was exasperated . 
`` You know nothing about it , '' she snapped irritably . 
`` Perhaps she has a husband , only he is in prison , so now she 's got a baby . '' 
`` But is her husband in prison ? '' 
the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired gravely . 
`` Or , I tell you what , '' Nastya interrupted impulsively , completely rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis . 
`` She has n't a husband , you are right there , but she wants to be married , and so she 's been thinking of getting married , and thinking and thinking of it till now she 's got it , that is , not a husband but a baby . '' 
`` Well , perhaps so , '' Kostya agreed , entirely vanquished . 
`` But you did n't say so before . 
So how could I tell ? '' 
`` Come , kiddies , '' said Kolya , stepping into the room . 
`` You 're terrible people , I see . '' 
`` And Perezvon with you ! '' 
grinned Kostya , and began snapping his fingers and calling Perezvon . 
`` I am in a difficulty , kids , '' Krassotkin began solemnly , `` and you must help me . 
Agafya must have broken her leg , since she has not turned up till now , that 's certain . 
I must go out . 
Will you let me go ? '' 
The children looked anxiously at one another . 
Their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness , but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them . 
`` You wo n't be naughty while I am gone ? 
You wo n't climb on the cupboard and break your legs ? 
You wo n't be frightened alone and cry ? '' 
A look of profound despondency came into the children 's faces . 
`` And I could show you something as a reward , a little copper cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder . '' 
The children 's faces instantly brightened . 
`` Show us the cannon , '' said Kostya , beaming all over . 
Krassotkin put his hand in his satchel , and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table . 
`` Ah , you are bound to ask that ! 
Look , it 's on wheels . '' 
He rolled the toy on along the table . 
`` And it can be fired off , too . 
It can be loaded with shot and fired off . '' 
`` And it could kill anyone ? '' 
`` It can kill anyone ; you 've only got to aim at anybody , '' and Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put , where the shot should be rolled in , showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole , and told them that it kicked when it was fired . 
The children listened with intense interest . 
What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked . 
`` And have you got any powder ? '' 
Nastya inquired . 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Show us the powder , too , '' she drawled with a smile of entreaty . 
Krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder . 
He had some shot , too , in a screw of paper . 
He even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his hand . 
`` One has to be careful there 's no fire about , or it would blow up and kill us all , '' Krassotkin warned them sensationally . 
The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment . 
But Kostya liked the shot better . 
`` And does the shot burn ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` No , it does n't . '' 
`` Give me a little shot , '' he asked in an imploring voice . 
`` I 'll give you a little shot ; here , take it , but do n't show it to your mother till I come back , or she 'll be sure to think it 's gunpowder , and will die of fright and give you a thrashing . '' 
`` Mother never does whip us , '' Nastya observed at once . 
`` I know , I only said it to finish the sentence . 
And do n't you ever deceive your mother except just this once , until I come back . 
And so , kiddies , can I go out ? 
You wo n't be frightened and cry when I 'm gone ? '' 
`` We sha-all cry , '' drawled Kostya , on the verge of tears already . 
`` We shall cry , we shall be sure to cry , '' Nastya chimed in with timid haste . 
`` Oh , children , children , how fraught with peril are your years ! 
There 's no help for it , chickens ; I shall have to stay with you I do n't know how long . 
And time is passing , time is passing , oogh ! '' 
`` Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead ! '' 
Kostya begged . 
`` There 's no help for it , we must have recourse to Perezvon . 
Ici , Perezvon . '' 
And Kolya began giving orders to the dog , who performed all his tricks . 
He was a rough-haired dog , of medium size , with a coat of a sort of lilac-grey colour . 
He was blind in his right eye , and his left ear was torn . 
He whined and jumped , stood and walked on his hind legs , lay on his back with his paws in the air , rigid as though he were dead . 
While this last performance was going on , the door opened and Agafya , Madame Krassotkin 's servant , a stout woman of forty , marked with small-pox , appeared in the doorway . 
She had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand . 
Holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog . 
Though Kolya had been so anxious for her return , he did not cut short the performance , and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time , at last he whistled to him . 
The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty . 
`` Only think , a dog ! '' 
Agafya observed sententiously . 
`` Why are you late , female ? '' 
asked Krassotkin sternly . 
`` Female , indeed ! 
Go on with you , you brat . '' 
`` Brat ? '' 
`` Yes , a brat . 
What is it to you if I 'm late ; if I 'm late , you may be sure I have good reason , '' muttered Agafya , busying herself about the stove , without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice . 
She seemed quite pleased , in fact , to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master . 
`` Listen , you frivolous young woman , '' Krassotkin began , getting up from the sofa , `` can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides , that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence ? 
I am going out . '' 
`` And what am I going to swear for ? '' 
laughed Agafya . 
`` I shall look after them without that . '' 
`` No , you must swear on your eternal salvation . 
Else I sha n't go . '' 
`` Well , do n't then . 
What does it matter to me ? 
It 's cold out ; stay at home . '' 
`` Kids , '' Kolya turned to the children , `` this woman will stay with you till I come back or till your mother comes , for she ought to have been back long ago . 
She will give you some lunch , too . 
You 'll give them something , Agafya , wo n't you ? '' 
`` That I can do . '' 
`` Good-bye , chickens , I go with my heart at rest . 
And you , granny , '' he added gravely , in an undertone , as he passed Agafya , `` I hope you 'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman 's nonsense about Katerina . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Get along with you ! '' 
retorted Agafya , really angry this time . 
`` Ridiculous boy ! 
You want a whipping for saying such things , that 's what you want ! '' 
The Schoolboy BUT Kolya did not hear her . 
At last he could go out . 
As he went out at the gate he looked round him , shrugged up his shoulders , and saying `` It is freezing , '' went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market-place . 
When he reached the last house but one before the market-place he stopped at the gate , pulled a whistle out of his pocket , and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal . 
He had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven , wearing a warm , neat and even stylish coat , darted out to meet him . 
This was Smurov , a boy in the preparatory class -LRB- two classes below Kolya Krassotkin -RRB- , son of a well-to-do official . 
Apparently he was forbidden by his parents to associate with Krassotkin , who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy , so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly . 
He was - if the reader has not forgotten one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha . 
He was the one who told Alyosha about Ilusha . 
`` I 've been waiting for you for the last hour , Krassotkin , '' said Smurov stolidly , and the boys strode towards the market-place . 
`` I am late , '' answered Krassotkin . 
`` I was detained by circumstances . 
You wo n't be thrashed for coming with me ? '' 
`` Come , I say , I 'm never thrashed ! 
And you 've got Perezvon with you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You 're taking him , too ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Ah ! 
if it were only Zhutchka ! '' 
`` That 's impossible . 
Zhutchka 's non-existent . 
Zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity . '' 
`` Ah ! 
could n't we do this ? '' 
Smurov suddenly stood still . 
`` You see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy , greyish , smoky-looking dog like Perezvon . 
Could n't you tell him this is Zhutchka , and he might believe you ? '' 
`` Boy , shun a lie , that 's one thing ; even with a good object - that 's another . 
Above all , I hope you 've not told them anything about my coming . '' 
`` Heaven forbid ! 
I know what I am about . 
But you wo n't comfort him with Perezvon , '' said Smurov , with a sigh . 
`` You know his father , the captain , ` the wisp of tow , ' told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff pup , with a black nose , to-day . 
He thinks that would comfort Ilusha ; but I doubt it . '' 
`` And how is Ilusha ? '' 
`` Ah , he is bad , very bad ! 
I believe he 's in consumption : he is quite conscious , but his breathing ! 
His breathing 's gone wrong . 
The other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the room . 
He tried to walk , but he could n't stand . 
` Ah , I told you before , father , ' he said , ` that those boots were no good . 
I could never walk properly in them . ' 
He fancied it was his boots that made him stagger , but it was simply weakness , really . 
He wo n't live another week . 
Herzenstube is looking after him . 
Now they are rich again - they 've got heaps of money . 
`` They are rogues . '' 
`` Who are rogues ? '' 
`` Doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively , and also , of course , individually . 
I do n't believe in medicine . 
It 's a useless institution . 
I mean to go into all that . 
But what 's that sentimentality you 've got up there ? 
The whole class seems to be there every day . '' 
`` Not the whole class : it 's only ten of our fellows who go to see him every day . 
There 's nothing in that . '' 
`` What I do n't understand in all this is the part that Alexey Karamazov is taking in it . 
His brother 's going to be tried to-morrow or next day for such a crime , and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with boys . '' 
`` There 's no sentimentality about it . 
You are going yourself now to make it up with Ilusha . '' 
`` Make it up with him ? 
What an absurd expression ! 
But I allow no one to analyse my actions . '' 
`` And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you ! 
He has no idea that you are coming . 
Why was it , why was it you would n't come all this time ? '' 
Smurov cried with sudden warmth . 
`` My dear boy , that 's my business , not yours . 
I am going of myself because I choose to , but you 've all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov - there 's a difference , you know . 
And how do you know ? 
I may not be going to make it up at all . 
It 's a stupid expression . '' 
`` It 's not Karamazov at all ; it 's not his doing . 
Our fellows began going there of themselves . 
Of course , they went with Karamazov at first . 
And there 's been nothing of that sort of silliness . 
First one went , and then another . 
His father was awfully pleased to see us . 
You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies . 
He sees that Ilusha 's dying . 
And he seems so glad we 've made it up with Ilusha . 
Ilusha asked after you , that was all . 
He just asks and says no more . 
His father will go out of his mind or hang himself . 
He behaved like a madman before . 
You know he is a very decent man . 
We made a mistake then . 
It 's all the fault of that murderer who beat him then . '' 
`` Karamazov 's a riddle to me all the same . 
I might have made his acquaintance long ago , but I like to have a proper pride in some cases . 
Besides , I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify . '' 
Kolya subsided into dignified silence . 
Smurov , too , was silent . 
Smurov , of course , worshipped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a level with him . 
Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya 's saying that he was `` going of himself '' to see Ilusha . 
He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya 's suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day . 
They crossed the market-place , in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls . 
The market women were selling rolls , cottons and threads , etc. , in their booths . 
These Sunday markets were naively called `` fairs '' in the town , and there were many such fairs in the year . 
Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits , sniffing about first one side , then the other . 
When he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette . 
`` I like to watch such realistic scenes , Smurov , '' said Kolya suddenly . 
`` Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet ? 
It seems to be a law of their nature . '' 
`` Yes ; it 's a funny habit . '' 
`` No , it 's not funny ; you are wrong there . 
There 's nothing funny in nature , however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices . 
If dogs could reason and criticise us they 'd be sure to find just as much that would be funny to them , if not far more , in the social relations of men , their masters - far more , indeed . 
I repeat that , because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us . 
That 's Rakitin 's idea - a remarkable idea . 
I am a Socialist , Smurov . '' 
`` And what is a Socialist ? '' 
asked Smurov . 
`` That 's when all are equal and all have property in common , there are no marriages , and everyone has any religion and laws he likes best , and all the rest of it . 
You are not old enough to understand that yet . 
It 's cold , though . '' 
`` Yes , twelve degrees of frost . 
Father looked at the thermometer just now . '' 
`` Have you noticed , Smurov , that in the middle of winter we do n't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now , in the beginning of winter , when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees , especially when there is not much snow . 
It 's because people are not used to it . 
Everything is habit with men , everything even in their social and political relations . 
Habit is the great motive-power . 
What a funny-looking peasant ! '' 
Kolya pointed to a tall peasant , with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat , who was standing by his wagon , clapping together his hands , in their shapeless leather gloves , to warm them . 
His long fair beard was all white with frost . 
`` That peasant 's beard 's frozen , '' Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him . 
`` Lots of people 's beards are frozen , '' the peasant replied , calmly and sententiously . 
`` Do n't provoke him , '' observed Smurov . 
`` It 's all right ; he wo n't be cross ; he 's a nice fellow . 
Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . '' 
`` Is your name Matvey ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Did n't you know ? '' 
`` No , I did n't . 
It was a guess . '' 
`` You do n't say so ! 
You are a schoolboy , I suppose ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You get whipped , I expect ? '' 
`` Nothing to speak of - sometimes . '' 
`` Does it hurt ? '' 
`` Well , yes , it does . '' 
`` Ech , what a life ! '' 
The peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his heart . 
`` Good-bye , Matvey . '' 
`` Good-bye . 
You are a nice chap , that you are . '' 
The boys went on . 
`` That was a nice peasant , '' Kolya observed to Smurov . 
`` I like talking to the peasants , and am always glad to do them justice . '' 
`` Why did you tell a lie , pretending we are thrashed ? '' 
asked Smurov . 
`` I had to say that to please him . '' 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
`` You know , Smurov , I do n't like being asked the same thing twice . 
I like people to understand at the first word . 
Some things ca n't be explained . 
According to a peasant 's notions , schoolboys are whipped , and must be whipped . 
What would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped ? 
And if I were to tell him we are not , he 'd be disappointed . 
But you do n't understand that . 
One has to know how to talk to the peasants . '' 
`` Only do n't tease them , please , or you 'll get into another scrape as you did about that goose . '' 
`` So you 're afraid ? '' 
`` Do n't laugh , Kolya . 
Of course I 'm afraid . 
My father would be awfully cross . 
I am strictly forbidden to go out with you . '' 
`` Do n't be uneasy , nothing will happen this time . 
Hallo , Natasha ! '' 
he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths . 
`` Call me Natasha ! 
What next ! 
My name is Marya , '' the middle-aged marketwoman shouted at him . 
`` I am so glad it 's Marya . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` Ah , you young rascal ! 
A brat like you to carry on so ! '' 
`` I 'm in a hurry . 
I ca n't stay now . 
You shall tell me next Sunday . '' 
Kolya waved his hand at her , as though she had attacked him and not he her . 
`` I 've nothing to tell you next Sunday . 
You set upon me , you impudent young monkey . 
I did n't say anything , '' bawled Marya . 
`` You want a whipping , that 's what you want , you saucy jackanapes ! '' 
There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her . 
Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by . 
He was a young man , not a native of the town , with dark , curly hair and a long , pale face , marked with smallpox . 
He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap , and looked like a merchant 's clerk . 
He was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya . 
`` I know you ! '' 
he cried angrily , `` I know you ! '' 
Kolya stared at him . 
He could not recall when he could have had a row with the man . 
But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all . 
`` Do you ? '' 
he asked sarcastically . 
`` I know you ! 
I know you ! '' 
the man repeated idiotically . 
So much the better for you . 
Well , it 's time I was going . 
Good-bye ! '' 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? '' 
cried the man . 
`` You are at your saucy pranks again ? 
I know , you are at it again ! '' 
`` It 's not your business , brother , if I am at my saucy pranks again , '' said Kolya , standing still and scanning him . 
`` Not my business ? '' 
`` No ; it 's not your business . '' 
`` Whose then ? 
Whose then ? 
Whose then ? '' 
`` It 's Trifon Nikititch 's business , not yours . '' 
`` What Trifon Nikititch ? '' 
asked the youth , staring with loutish amazement at Kolya , but still as angry as ever . 
Kolya scanned him gravely . 
`` Have you been to the Church of the Ascension ? '' 
he suddenly asked him , with stern emphasis . 
`` What Church of Ascension ? 
What for ? 
No , I have n't , '' said the young man , somewhat taken aback . 
`` Do you know Sabaneyev ? '' 
Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely . 
`` What Sabaneyev ? 
No , I do n't know him . '' 
`` Well then you can go to the devil , '' said Kolya , cutting short the conversation ; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev . 
`` Stop , heigh ! 
What Sabaneyev ? '' 
the young man recovered from his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before . 
`` What did he say ? '' 
He turned to the market women with a silly stare . 
The women laughed . 
`` You can never tell what he 's after , '' said one of them . 
`` What Sabaneyev is it he 's talking about ? '' 
the young man repeated , still furious and brandishing his right arm . 
`` It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs , that 's who it must be , '' one of the women suggested . 
The young man stared at her wildly . 
`` For the Kuzmitchovs ? '' 
repeated another woman . 
`` But his name was n't Trifon . 
His name 's Kuzma , not Trifon ; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch , so it ca n't be the same . '' 
`` His name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev , it 's Tchizhov , '' put in suddenly a third woman , who had hitherto been silent , listening gravely . 
`` Alexey Ivanitch is his name . 
Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch . '' 
`` Not a doubt about it , it 's Tchizhov , '' a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement . 
The bewildered youth gazed from one to another . 
`` But what did he ask for , what did he ask for , good people ? '' 
he cried almost in desperation . '' 
` Do you know Sabaneyev ? ' 
says he . 
And who the devil 's to know who is Sabaneyev ? '' 
`` You 're a senseless fellow . 
I tell you it 's not Sabaneyev , but Tchizhov , Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov , that 's who it is ! '' 
one of the women shouted at him impressively . 
`` What Tchizhov ? 
Who is he ? 
Tell me , if you know . '' 
`` That tall , snivelling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer . '' 
`` And what 's your Tchizhov to do with me , good people , eh ? '' 
`` How can I tell what he 's to do with you ? '' 
put in another . 
`` You ought to know yourself what you want with him , if you make such a clamour about him . 
He spoke to you , he did not speak to us , you stupid . 
Do n't you really know him ? '' 
`` Know whom ? '' 
`` Tchizhov . '' 
`` The devil take Tchizhov and you with him . 
I 'll give him a hiding , that I will . 
He was laughing at me ! '' 
`` Will give Tchizhov a hiding ! 
More likely he will give you one . 
You are a fool , that 's what you are ! '' 
`` Not Tchizhov , not Tchizhov , you spiteful , mischievous woman . 
I 'll give the boy a hiding . 
Catch him , catch him , he was laughing at me The woman guffawed . 
But Kolya was by now a long way off , marching along with a triumphant air . 
Smurov walked beside him , looking round at the shouting group far behind . 
He too was in high spirits , though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya 's company . 
`` What Sabaneyev did you mean ? '' 
he asked Kolya , foreseeing what his answer would be . 
`` How do I know ? 
Now there 'll be a hubbub among them all day . 
I like to stir up fools in every class of society . 
There 's another blockhead , that peasant there . 
You know , they say ` there 's no one stupider than a stupid Frenchman , ' but a stupid Russian shows it in his face just as much . 
Ca n't you see it all over his face that he is a fool , that peasant , eh ? '' 
`` Let him alone , Kolya . 
Let 's go on . '' 
`` Nothing could stop me , now I am once off . 
Hey , good morning , peasant ! '' 
A sturdy-looking peasant , with a round , simple face and grizzled beard , who was walking by , raised his head and looked at the boy . 
He seemed not quite sober . 
`` Good morning , if you are not laughing at me , '' he said deliberately in reply . 
`` And if I am ? '' 
laughed Kolya . 
`` Well , a joke 's a joke . 
Laugh away . 
I do n't mind . 
There 's no harm in a joke . '' 
`` I beg your pardon , brother , it was a joke . '' 
`` Well , God forgive you ! '' 
`` Do you forgive me , too ? '' 
`` I quite forgive you . 
Go along . '' 
`` I say , you seem a clever peasant . '' 
`` Cleverer than you , '' the peasant answered unexpectedly , with the same gravity . 
`` I doubt it , '' said Kolya , somewhat taken aback . 
`` It 's true , though . '' 
`` Perhaps it is . '' 
`` It is , brother . '' 
`` Good-bye , peasant ! '' 
`` Good-bye ! '' 
`` There are all sorts of peasants , '' Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence . 
`` How could I tell I had hit on a clever one ? 
I am always ready to recognise intelligence in the peasantry . '' 
In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven . 
The boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov 's lodging , a considerable distance , quickly and almost in silence . 
Twenty paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him . 
`` One must sniff round a bit first , '' he observed to Smurov . 
`` Why ask him to come out ? '' 
Smurov protested . 
`` You go in ; they will be awfully glad to see you . 
What 's the sense of making friends in the frost out here ? '' 
`` I know why I want to see him out here in the frost , '' Kolya cut him short in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with `` small boys , '' and Smurov ran to do his bidding . 
The Lost Dog KOLYA leaned against the fence with an air of dignity , waiting for Alyosha to appear . 
Yes , he had long wanted to meet him . 
He had heard a great deal about him from the boys , but hitherto he had always maintained an appearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned , and he had even `` criticised '' what he heard about Alyosha . 
But secretely he had a great longing to make his acquaintance ; there was something sympathetic and attractive in all he was told about Alyosha . 
So the present moment was important : to begin with , he had to show himself at his best , to show his independence . 
`` Or he 'll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy , like the rest of them . 
And what are these boys to him ? 
I shall ask him when I get to know him . 
It 's a pity I am so short , though . 
Tuzikov is younger than I am , yet he is half a head taller . 
But I have a clever face . 
I am not good-looking . 
I know I 'm hideous , but I 've a clever face . 
I must n't talk too freely ; if I fall into his arms all at once , he may think - Tfoo ! 
how horrible if he should think - ! '' 
Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he was doing his utmost to assume the most independent air . 
What distressed him most was his being so short ; he did not mind so much his `` hideous '' face , as being so short . 
On the wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark to show his height , and every two months since he anxiously measured himself against it to see how much he had gained . 
But alas ! 
he grew very slowly , and this sometimes reduced him almost to despair . 
His face was in reality by no means `` hideous '' ; on the contrary , it was rather attractive , with a fair , pale skin , freckled . 
His small , lively grey eyes had a fearless look , and often glowed with feeling . 
He had rather high cheekbones ; small , very red , but not very thick , lips ; his nose was small and unmistakably turned up . 
`` I 've a regular pug nose , a regular pug nose , '' Kolya used to mutter to himself when he looked in the looking-glass , and he always left it with indignation . 
`` But perhaps I have n't got a clever face ? '' 
he sometimes thought , doubtful even of that . 
But it must not be supposed that his mind was preoccupied with his face and his height . 
On the contrary , however bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him , he quickly forgot them , and forgot them for a long time , `` abandoning himself entirely to ideas and to real life , '' as he formulated it to himself . 
Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya . 
Before he reached him , Kolya could see that he looked delighted . 
`` Can he be so glad to see me ? '' 
Kolya wondered , feeling pleased . 
We may note here , in passing , that Alyosha 's appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him last . 
He had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a wellcut coat , a soft , round hat , and his hair had been cropped short . 
All this was very becoming to him , and he looked quite handsome . 
His charming face always had a good-humoured expression ; but there was a gentleness and serenity in his good-humour . 
To Kolya 's surprise , Alyosha came out to him just as he was , without an overcoat . 
He had evidently come in haste . 
He held out his hand to Kolya at once . 
`` Here you are at last ! 
How anxious we 've been to see you ! '' 
`` There were reasons which you shall know directly . 
Anyway , I am glad to make your acquaintance . 
I 've long been hoping for an opportunity , and have heard a great deal about you , '' Kolya muttered , a little breathless . 
`` We should have met anyway . 
I 've heard a great deal about you , too ; but you 've been a long time coming here . '' 
`` Tell me , how are things going ? '' 
`` Ilusha is very ill . 
He is certainly dying . '' 
`` How awful ! 
You must admit that medicine is a fraud , Karamazov , '' cried Kolya warmly . 
`` Ilusha has mentioned you often , very often , even in his sleep , in delirium , you know . 
One can see that you used to be very , very dear to him ... before the incident ... with the knife ... . 
Then there 's another reason ... . 
Tell me , is that your dog ? '' 
`` Yes Perezvon . '' 
`` Not Zhutchka ? '' 
Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity . 
`` Is she lost for ever ? '' 
`` I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka . 
I 've heard all about it . '' 
Kolya smiled mysteriously . 
`` Listen , Karamazov , I 'll tell you all about it . 
That 's what I came for ; that 's what I asked you to come out here for , to explain the whole episode to you before we go in , '' he began with animation . 
`` You see , Karamazov , Ilusha came into the preparatory class last spring . 
Well , you know what our preparatory class is - a lot of small boys . 
They began teasing Ilusha at once . 
I am two classes higher up , and , of course , I only look on at them from a distance . 
I saw the boy was weak and small , but he would n't give in to them ; he fought with them . 
I saw he was proud , and his eyes were full of fire . 
I like children like that . 
And they teased him all the more . 
The worst of it was he was horribly dressed at the time , his breeches were too small for him , and there were holes in his boots . 
They worried him about it ; they jeered at him . 
That I ca n't stand . 
I stood up for him at once , and gave it to them hot . 
I beat them , but they adore me , do you know , Karamazov ? '' 
Kolya boasted impulsively ; `` but I am always fond of children . 
I 've two chickens in my hands at home now - that 's what detained me to-day . 
So they left off beating Ilusha and I took him under my protection . 
I saw the boy was proud . 
I tell you that , the boy was proud ; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me : he did my slightest bidding , obeyed me as though I were God , tried to copy me . 
In the intervals between the classes he used to run to me at once ' and I 'd go about with him . 
On Sundays , too . 
They always laugh when an older boy makes friends with a younger one like that ; but that 's a prejudice . 
If it 's my fancy , that 's enough . 
I am teaching him , developing him . 
Why should n't I develop him if I like him ? 
Here you , Karamazov , have taken up with all these nestlings . 
I see you want to influence the younger generation - to develop them , to be of use to them , and I assure you this trait in your character , which I knew by hearsay , attracted me more than anything . 
Let us get to the point , though . 
I noticed that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy , and you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality , and I have had it from a baby . 
There were contradictions in him , too : he was proud , but he was slavishly devoted to me , and yet all at once his eyes would flash and he 'd refuse to agree with me ; he 'd argue , fly into a rage . 
I used sometimes to propound certain ideas ; I could see that it was not so much that he disagreed with the ideas , but that he was simply rebelling against me , because I was cool in responding to his endearments . 
And so , in order to train him properly , the tenderer he was , the colder I became . 
I did it on purpose : that was my idea . 
My object was to form his character , to lick him into shape , to make a man of him ... and besides ... no doubt , you understand me at a word . 
Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession he was downcast and dejected , not because of my coldness , but for something else , something more important . 
I wondered what the tragedy was . 
I have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know Smerdyakov , who was footman to your late father - it was before his death , of course - and he taught the little fool a silly trick - that is , a brutal , nasty trick . 
He told him to take a piece of bread , to stick a pin in it , and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without biting it , and then to watch and see what would happen . 
So they prepared a piece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka , that shaggy dog there 's been such a fuss about . 
The people of the house it belonged to never fed it at all , though it barked all day . 
-LRB- Do you like that stupid barking , Karamazov ? 
I ca n't stand it . -RRB- 
So it rushed at the bread , swallowed it , and began to squeal ; it turned round and round and ran away , squealing as it ran out of sight . 
That was Ilusha 's own account of it . 
He confessed it to me , and cried bitterly . 
He hugged me , shaking all over . 
He kept on repeating ` He ran away squealing ' : the sight of that haunted him . 
He was tormented by remorse , I could see that . 
I took it seriously . 
I determined to give him a lesson for other things as well . 
So I must confess I was n't quite straightforward , and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than I was . 
` You 've done a nasty thing , ' I said , ` you are a scoundrel . 
I wo n't tell of it , of course , but I shall have nothing more to do with you for a time . 
I 'll think it over and let you know through Smurov ' - that 's the boy who 's just come with me ; he 's always ready to do anything for me - ` whether I will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up for good as a scoundrel . ' 
He was tremendously upset . 
I must own I felt I 'd gone too far as I spoke , but there was no help for it . 
I did what I thought best at the time . 
A day or two after , I sent Smurov to tell him that I would not speak to him again . 
That 's what we call it when two schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another . 
Secretly I only meant to send him to Coventry for a few days and then , if I saw signs of repentance , to hold out my hand to him again . 
That was my intention . 
But what do you think happened ? 
He heard Smurov 's message , his eyes flashed . 
` Tell Krassotkin for me , ' he cried , ` that I will throw bread with pins to all the dogs - all - all of them ! ' 
` So he 's going in for a little temper . 
We must smoke it out of him . ' 
And I began to treat him with contempt ; whenever I met him I turned away or smiled sarcastically . 
And just then that affair with his father happened . 
You remember ? 
You must realise that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already . 
The boys , seeing I 'd given him up , set on him and taunted him , shouting , ` Wisp of tow , wisp of tow ! ' 
And he had soon regular skirmishes with them , which I am very sorry for . 
They seem to have given him one very bad beating . 
One day he flew at them all as they were coming out of school . 
I stood a few yards off , looking on . 
And , I swear , I do n't remember that I laughed ; it was quite the other way , I felt awfully sorry for him ; in another minute I would have run up to take his part . 
But he suddenly met my eyes . 
I do n't know what he fancied ; but he pulled out a penknife , rushed at me , and struck at my thigh , here in my right leg . 
I did n't move . 
I do n't mind owning I am plucky sometimes , Karamazov . 
I simply looked at him contemptuously , as though to say , ` This is how you repay all my kindness ! 
Do it again if you like , I 'm at your service . ' 
But he did n't stab me again ; he broke down ; he was frightened at what he had done ; he threw away the knife , burst out crying , and ran away . 
I did not sneak on him , of course , and I made them all keep quiet , so it should n't come to the ears of the masters . 
I did n't even tell my mother till it had healed up . 
And the wound was a mere scratch . 
And then I heard that the same day he 'd been throwing stones and had bitten your finger - but you understand now what a state he was in ! 
Well , it ca n't be helped : it was stupid of me not to come and forgive him - that is , to make it up with him - when he was taken ill . 
I am sorry for it now . 
But I had a special reason . 
So now I 've told you all about it ... but I 'm afraid it was stupid of me . '' 
`` Oh , what a pity , '' exclaimed Alyosha , with feeling , `` that I did n't know before what terms you were on with him , or I 'd have come to you long ago to beg you to go to him with me . 
Would you believe it , when he was feverish he talked about you in delirium . 
I did n't know how much you were to him ! 
And you 've really not succeeded in finding that dog ? 
His father and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it . 
Would you believe it , since he 's been ill , I 've three times heard him repeat with tears , ` It 's because I killed Zhutchka , father , that I am ill now . 
God is punishing me for it . ' 
He ca n't get that idea out of his head . 
And if the dog were found and proved to be alive , one might almost fancy the joy would cure him . 
We have all rested our hopes on you . '' 
`` Tell me , what made you hope that I should be the one to find him ? '' 
Kolya asked , with great curiosity . 
`` Why did you reckon on me rather than anyone else ? '' 
`` There was a report that you were looking for the dog , and that you would bring it when you 'd found it . 
Smurov said something of the sort . 
We 've all been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive , that it 's been seen . 
The boys brought him a live hare : he just looked at it , with a faint smile , and asked them to set it free in the fields . 
And so we did . 
His father has just this moment come back , bringing him a mastiff pup , hoping to comfort him with that ; but I think it only makes it worse . '' 
`` Tell me , Karamazov , what sort of man is the father ? 
I know him , but what do you make of him - a mountebank , a buffoon ? '' 
`` Oh no ; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed . 
Buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom they dare n't speak the truth , from having been for years humiliated and intimidated by them . 
Believe me , Krassotkin , that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme . 
His whole life now is centred in Ilusha , and if Ilusha dies , he will either go mad with grief or kill himself . 
I feel almost certain of that when I look at him now . '' 
`` I understand you , Karamazov . 
I see you understand human nature , '' Kolya added , with feeling . 
`` And as soon as I saw you with a dog , I thought it was Zhutchka you were bringing . '' 
`` Wait a bit , Karamazov , perhaps we shall find it yet ; but this is Perezvon . 
I 'll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more than the mastiff pup . 
Wait a bit , Karamazov , you will know something in a minute . 
But , I say , I am keeping you here ! '' 
Kolya cried suddenly . 
`` You 've no overcoat on in this bitter cold . 
You see what an egoist I am . 
Oh , we are all egoists , Karamazov ! '' 
`` Do n't trouble ; it is cold , but I do n't often catch cold . 
Let us go in , though , and , by the way , what is your name ? 
I know you are called Kolya , but what else ? '' 
`` Nikolay - Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin , or , as they say in official documents , ` Krassotkin son . ' '' 
Kolya laughed for some reason , but added suddenly , `` Of course I hate my name Nikolay . '' 
`` Why so ? '' 
`` It 's so trivial , so ordinary . '' 
`` You are thirteen ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` No , fourteen - that is , I shall be fourteen very soon , in a fortnight . 
I 'll confess one weakness of mine , Karamazov , just to you , since it 's our first meeting , so that you may understand my character at once . 
I hate being asked my age , more than that ... and in fact ... there 's a libellous story going about me , that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys . 
It 's a fact that I did play with them , but it 's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own amusement . 
I have reasons for believing that you 've heard the story ; but I was n't playing for my own amusement , it was for the sake of the children , because they could n't think of anything to do by themselves . 
But they 've always got some silly tale . 
This is an awful town for gossip , I can tell you . '' 
`` But what if you had been playing for your own amusement , what 's the harm ? '' 
`` Come , I say , for my own amusement ! 
You do n't play horses , do you ? '' 
`` But you must look at it like this , '' said Alyosha , smiling . 
`` Grown-up people go to the theatre and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes are represented - sometimes there are robbers and battles , too - and is n't that just the same thing , in a different form , of course ? 
And young people 's games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in its first stage . 
You know , they spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young . 
And sometimes these games are much better than performances in the theatre ; the only difference is that people go there to look at the actors , while in these games the young people are the actors themselves . 
But that 's only natural . '' 
`` You think so ? 
Is that your idea ? '' 
Kolya looked at him intently . 
`` Oh , you know , that 's rather an interesting view . 
When I go home , I 'll think it over . 
I 'll admit I thought I might learn something from you . 
I 've come to learn of you , Karamazov , '' Kolya concluded , in a voice full of spontaneous feeling . 
`` And I of you , '' said Alyosha , smiling and pressing his hand . 
Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha . 
What struck him most was that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he were `` quite grown up . '' 
`` I 'll show you something directly , Karamazov ; it 's a theatrical performance , too , '' he said , laughing nervously . 
`` That 's why I 've come . '' 
`` Let us go first to the people of the house , on the left . 
All the boys leave their coats in there , because the room is small and hot . '' 
`` Oh , I 'm only coming in for a minute . 
I 'll keep on my overcoat . 
Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead . 
Ici , Perezvon , lie down and be dead ! 
You see how he 's dead . 
I 'll go in first and explore , then I 'll whistle to him when I think fit , and you 'll see , he 'll dash in like mad . 
Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment . 
I 'll arrange it all and you 'll see something . '' 
By Ilusha 's Bedside THE room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is already familiar to the reader . 
It was close and crowded at that moment with a number of visitors . 
Several boys were sitting with Ilusha , and though all of them , like Smurov , were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha , it was really the fact . 
All the art he had used had been to take them , one by one , to Ilusha , without `` sheepish sentimentality , '' appearing to do so casually and without design . 
It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his suffering . 
He was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy shown him by these boys , who had been his enemies . 
Krassotkin was the only one missing and his absence was a heavy load on Ilusha 's heart . 
Perhaps the bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing Krassotkin , who had been his one friend and protector . 
Clever little Smurov , who was the first to make it up with Ilusha , thought it was so . 
But when Smurov hinted to Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him about something , the latter cut him short , bidding Smurov tell `` Karamazov '' at once that he knew best what to do , that he wanted no one 's advice , and that , if he went to see Ilusha , he would choose his own time for he had `` his own reasons . '' 
That was a fortnight before this Sunday . 
That was why Alyosha had not been to see him , as he had meant to . 
But though he waited he sent Smurov to him twice again . 
Both times Krassotkin met him with a curt , impatient refusal , sending Alyosha a message not to bother him any more , that if he came himself , he , Krassotkin , would not go to Ilusha at all . 
Up to the very last day , Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that morning , and only the evening before , as he parted from Smurov , Kolya abruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning , for he would go with him to the Snegiryovs , but warned him on no account to say he was coming , as he wanted to drop in casually . 
Smurov obeyed . 
Smurov 's fancy that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya had dropped that `` they must be asses not to find the dog , if it was alive . '' 
When Smurov , waiting for an opportunity , timidly hinted at his guess about the dog , Krassotkin flew into a violent rage . 
`` I 'm not such an ass as to go hunting about the town for other people 's dogs when I 've got a dog of my own ! 
And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin ? 
Sheepish sentimentality , thats what it is ! 
For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikons in the corner . 
He had not been to school since the day he met Alyosha and bit his finger . 
He was taken ill the same day , though for a month afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and passage . 
But latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without help from his father . 
His father was terribly concerned about him . 
He even gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die . 
And often , especially after leading him round the room on his arm and putting him back to bed , he would run to a dark corner in the passage and , leaning his head against the wall , he would break into paroxysms of violent weeping , stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha . 
Returning to the room , he would usually begin doing something to amuse and comfort his precious boy : he would tell him stories , funny anecdotes , or would mimic comic people he had happened to meet , even imitate the howls and cries of animals . 
But Ilusha could not bear to see his father fooling and playing the buffoon . 
Though the boy tried not to show how he disliked it , he saw with an aching heart that his father was an object of contempt , and he was continually haunted by the memory of the `` wisp of tow '' and that `` terrible day . '' 
Nina , Ilusha 's gentle , crippled sister , did not like her father 's buffoonery either -LRB- Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg to study at the university -RRB- . 
But the half-imbecile mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or performing something . 
It was the only way she could be amused ; all the rest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now everyone had forgotten her , that no one treated her with respect , that she was slighted , and so on . 
But during the last few days she had completely changed . 
She began looking constantly at Ilusha 's bed in the corner and seemed lost in thought . 
She was more silent , quieter , and , if she cried , she cried quietly so as not to be heard . 
The captain noticed the change in her with mournful perplexity . 
The boys ' visits at first only angered her , but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her , and at last she liked them so much that , if the boys had given up coming , she would have felt dreary without them . 
When the children told some story or played a game , she laughed and clapped her hands . 
She called some of them to her and kissed them . 
She was particularly fond of Smurov . 
As for the captain , the presence in his room of the children , who came to cheer up Ilusha , filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy . 
He even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his depression and that that would hasten his recovery . 
In spite of his alarm about Ilusha , he had not , till lately , felt one minute 's doubt of his boy 's ultimate recovery . 
He met his little visitors with homage , waited upon them hand and foot ; he was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back , but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up . 
He began buying little things for them , gingerbread and nuts , gave them tea and cut them sandwiches . 
It must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money . 
He had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha had predicted he would . 
And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna , learning more about their circumstances and Ilusha 's illness , visited them herself , made the acquaintance of the family , and succeeded in fascinating the half-imbecile mother . 
Since then she had been lavish in helping them , and the captain , terror-stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying , forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance . 
All this time Doctor Herzenstube , who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna , came punctually every other day , but little was gained by his visits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly . 
But on that Sunday morning a new doctor was expected , who had come from Moscow , where he had a great reputation . 
Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense , not expressly for Ilusha , but for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter . 
But , as he had come , she had asked him to see Ilusha as well , and the captain had been told to expect him . 
He had n't the slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming , though he had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting . 
At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room , the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha 's bed , looking at a tiny mastiff pup , which had only been born the day before , though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha , who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka . 
Ilusha , who had heard three days before that he was to be presented with a puppy , not an ordinary puppy , but a pedigree mastiff -LRB- a very important point , of course -RRB- , tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased . 
But his father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had killed . 
The puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he , smiling sadly , stroked it with his thin , pale , wasted hand . 
Clearly he liked the puppy , but ... it was n't Zhutchka ; if he could have had Zhutchka and the puppy , too , then he would have been completely happy . 
`` Krassotkin ! '' 
cried one of the boys suddenly . 
He was the first to see him come in . 
Krassotkin 's entrance made a general sensation ; the boys moved away and stood on each side of the bed , so that he could get a full view of Ilusha . 
The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya . 
`` Please come in ... you are welcome ! '' 
he said hurriedly . 
`` Ilusha , Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you ! 
But Krassotkin , shaking hands with him hurriedly , instantly showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society . 
He turned first to the captain 's wife sitting in her armchair , who was very ill-humoured at the moment , and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and Ilusha 's bed and did not let her see the new puppy . 
With the greatest courtesy he made her a bow , scraping his foot , and turning to Nina , he made her , as the only other lady present , a similar bow . 
This polite behaviour made an extremely favourable impression on the deranged lady . 
`` There , . 
you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought up , '' she commented aloud , throwing up her hands ; `` But as for our other visitors they come in one on the top of another . '' 
`` How do you mean , mamma , one on the top of another , how is that ? '' 
muttered the captain affectionately , though a little anxious on her account . 
`` That 's how they ride in . 
They get on each other 's shoulders in the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family . 
Strange sort of visitors ! '' 
`` But who 's come in like that , mamma ? '' 
`` Why , that boy came in riding on that one 's back and this one on that one 's . '' 
Kolya was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy turned visibly paler . 
He raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya . 
Kolya had not seen his little friend for two months , and he was overwhelmed at the sight of him . 
He had never imagined that he would see such a wasted , yellow face , such enormous , feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands . 
He saw , with grieved surprise , Ilusha 's rapid , hard breathing and dry lips . 
He stepped close to him , held out his hand , and almost overwhelmed , he said : `` Well , old man ... how are you ? '' 
But his voice failed him , he could n't achieve an appearance of ease ; his face suddenly twitched and the corners of his mouth quivered . 
Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile , still unable to utter a word . 
Something moved Kolya to raise his hand and pass it over Ilusha 's hair . 
`` Never mind ! '' 
he murmured softly to him to cheer him up , or perhaps not knowing why he said it . 
For a minute they were silent again . 
`` Hallo , so you 've got a new puppy ? '' 
Kolya said suddenly , in a most callous voice . 
`` Ye-es , '' answered Ilusha in a long whisper , gasping for breath . 
`` A black nose , that means he 'll be fierce , a good house-dog , '' Kolya observed gravely and stolidly , as if the only thing he cared about was the puppy and its black nose . 
But in reality he still had to do his utmost to control his feelings not to burst out crying like a child , and do what he would he could not control it . 
`` When it grows up , you 'll have to keep it on the chain , I 'm sure . '' 
`` He 'll be a huge dog ! '' 
cried one of the boys . 
`` Of course he will , '' `` a mastiff , '' `` large , '' `` like this , '' `` as big as a calf , '' shouted several voices . 
`` As big as a calf , as a real calf , '' chimed in the captain . 
`` I got one like that on purpose , one of the fiercest breed , and his parents are huge and very fierce , they stand as high as this from the floor ... . 
Sit down here , on Ilusha 's bed , or here on the bench . 
You are welcome , we 've been hoping to see you a long time ... . 
You were so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed , at Ilusha 's feet . 
Though he had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his way , now he completely lost the thread of it . 
`` No ... I came with Perezvon . 
I 've got a dog now , called Perezvon . 
A Slavonic name . 
He 's out there ... if I whistle , he 'll run in . 
I 've brought a dog , too , '' he said , addressing Ilusha all at once . 
`` Do you remember Zhutchka , old man ? '' 
he suddenly fired the question at him . 
Ilusha 's little face quivered . 
He looked with an agonised expression at Kolya . 
Alyosha , standing at the door , frowned and signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka , but he did not or would not notice . 
`` Where ... is Zhutchka ? '' 
Ilusha asked in a broken voice . 
`` Oh well , my boy , your Zhutchka 's lost and done for ! '' 
Ilusha did not speak , but he fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya . 
Alyosha , catching Kolya 's eye , signed to him vigourously again , but he turned away his eyes pretending not to have noticed . 
`` It must have run away and died somewhere . 
It must have died after a meal like that , '' Kolya pronounced pitilessly , though he seemed a little breathless . 
`` But I 've got a dog , Perezvon ... A Slavonic name ... I 've brought him to show you . '' 
`` I do n't want him ! '' 
said Ilusha suddenly . 
`` No , no , you really must see him ... it will amuse you . 
I brought him on purpose ... . 
He 's the same sort of shaggy dog ... . 
You allow me to call in my dog , madam ? '' 
He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov , with inexplicable excitement in his manner . 
`` I do n't want him , I do n't want him ! '' 
cried Ilusha , with a mournful break in his voice . 
There was a reproachful light in his eyes . 
`` You 'd better , '' the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he had just sat down , `` you 'd better ... another time , '' he muttered , but Kolya could not be restrained . 
He hurriedly shouted to Smurov , `` Open the door , '' and as soon as it was open , he blew his whistle . 
Perezvon dashed headlong into the room . 
`` Jump , Perezvon , beg ! 
Beg ! '' 
shouted Kolya , jumping up , and the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha 's bedside . 
What followed was a surprise to everyone : Ilusha started , lurched violently forward , bent over Perezvon and gazed at him , faint with suspense . 
`` It 's ... Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried suddenly , in a voice breaking with joy and suffering . 
`` And who did you think it was ? '' 
Krassotkin shouted with all his might , in a ringing , happy voice , and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to Ilusha . 
`` Look , old man , you see , blind of one eye and the left ear is torn , just the marks you described to me . 
It was by that I found him . 
I found him directly . 
He did not belong to anyone ! '' 
he explained , to the captain , to his wife , to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha . 
`` He used to live in the Fedotovs ' backyard . 
Though he made his home there , they did not feed him . 
He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I found him ... . 
You see , old man , he could n't have swallowed what you gave him . 
If he had , he must have died , he must have ! 
So he must have spat it out , since he is alive . 
You did not see him do it . 
But the pin pricked his tongue , that is why he squealed . 
He ran away squealing and you thought he 'd swallowed it . 
He might well squeal , because the skin of dogs ' mouths is so tender ... tenderer than in men , much tenderer ! '' 
Kolya cried impetuously , his face glowing and radiant with delight . 
Ilusha could not speak . 
White as a sheet , he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya , with his great eyes almost starting out of his head . 
And if Krassotkin , who had no suspicion of it , had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child 's health , nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him . 
But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realised it . 
As for the captain he behaved like a small child . 
`` Zhutchka ! 
It 's Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried in a blissful voice , `` Ilusha , this is Zhutchka , your Zhutchka ! 
Mamma , this is Zhutchka ! '' 
He was almost weeping . 
`` And I never guessed ! '' 
cried Smurov regretfully . 
`` Bravo , Krassotkin ! 
I said he 'd find the dog and here he 's found him . '' 
`` Here he 's found him ! '' 
another boy repeated gleefully . 
`` Krassotkin 's a brick ! 
cried a third voice . 
`` He 's a brick , he 's a brick ! '' 
cried the other boys , and they began clapping . 
`` Wait , wait , '' Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all . 
`` I 'll tell you how it happened , that 's the whole point . 
I found him , I took him home and hid him at once . 
I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to anyone till to-day . 
Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight , but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess . 
And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks . 
You should only see all the things he can do ! 
I trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog , in good condition , old man , so as to be able to say to you , ` See , old man , what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now ! ' 
Have n't you a bit of meat ? 
He 'll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing . 
A piece of meat , have n't you got any ? '' 
The captain ran across the passage to the landlady , where their cooking was done . 
Not to lose precious time , Kolya , in desperate haste , shouted to Perezvon , `` Dead ! '' 
And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air . 
The boys laughed , Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile , but the person most delighted with the dog 's performance was `` mamma . '' 
She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it , `` Perezvon , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Nothing will make him get up , nothing ! '' 
Kolya cried triumphantly , proud of his success . 
`` He wo n't move for all the shouting in the world , but if I call to him , he 'll jump up in a minute . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
The dog leapt up and bounded about , whining with delight . 
The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef . 
`` Is it hot ? '' 
Kolya inquired hurriedly , with a business-like air , taking the meat . 
`` Dogs do n't like hot things . 
No , it 's all right . 
Look , everybody , look , Ilusha , look , old man ; why are n't you looking ? 
He does not look at him , now I 've brought him . '' 
The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose . 
The luckless dog had to stand without moving , with the meat on his nose , as long as his master chose to keep him , without a movement , perhaps for half an hour . 
But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment . 
`` Paid for ! '' 
cried Kolya , and the meat passed in a flash from the dog 's nose to his mouth . 
The audience , of course , expressed enthusiasm and surprise . 
`` Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha , with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice . 
`` Simply for that ! '' 
answered Kolya , with perfect simplicity . 
`` I wanted to show him in all his glory . '' 
`` Perezvon ! 
Perezvon , '' called Ilusha suddenly , snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog . 
`` What is it ? 
Let him jump up on the bed ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha . 
The boy threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek . 
Ilusha crept close to him , stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog 's shaggy coat . 
`` Dear , dear ! '' 
kept exclaiming the captain . 
Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed . 
`` Ilusha , I can show you another trick . 
I 've brought you a little cannon . 
You remember , I told you about it before and you said how much you 'd like to see it . 
Well , here , I 've brought it to you . '' 
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon . 
He hurried , because he was happy himself . 
Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off , now he hurried on , regardless of all consideration . 
`` You are all happy now , '' he felt , `` so here 's something to make you happier ! '' 
He was perfectly enchanted himself . 
`` I 've been coveting this thing for a long while ; it 's for you , old man , it 's for you . 
It belonged to Morozov , it was no use to him , he had it from his brother . 
I swopped a book from father 's book-case for it , A Kinsman of Mahomet , or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago , before they had any censorship . 
And Morozov has a taste for such things . 
He was grateful to me , too ... '' Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it . 
Ilusha raised himself , and , with his right arm still round the dog , he gazed enchanted at the toy . 
The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too , and that it could be fired off at once `` if it wo n't alarm the ladies . '' 
`` Mamma '' immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted . 
She was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap . 
She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired , without any idea of what she had been asked . 
Kolya showed the powder and the shot . 
The captain , as a military man , undertook to load it , putting in a minute quantity of powder . 
He asked that the shot might be put off till another time . 
The cannon was put on the floor , aiming towards an empty part of the room , three grains of powder were thrust into the touchhole and a match was put to it . 
A magnificent explosion followed . 
Mamma was startled , but at once laughed with delight . 
The boys gazed in speechless triumph . 
But the captain , looking at Ilusha , was more enchanted than any of them . 
Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha , together with the powder and the shot . 
`` I got it for you , for you ! 
I 've been keeping it for you a long time , '' he repeated once more in his delight . 
`` Oh , give it to me ! 
No , give me the cannon ! '' 
mamma began begging like a little child . 
Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it . 
Kolya was disconcerted . 
The captain fidgeted uneasily . 
`` Mamma , mamma , '' he ran to her , `` the cannon 's yours , of course , but let Ilusha have it , because it 's a present to him , but it 's just as good as yours . 
Ilusha will always let you play with it ; it shall belong to both of you , both of you . '' 
`` No , I do n't want it to belong to both of us ; I want it to be mine altogether , not Ilusha 's , '' persisted mamma , on the point of tears . 
`` Take it , mother , here , keep it ! '' 
Ilusha cried . 
`` Krassotkin , may I give it to my mother ? '' 
he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face , as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to someone else . 
`` Of course you may , '' Krassotkin assented heartily , and , taking the cannon from Ilusha , he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow . 
She was so touched that she cried . 
`` Ilusha , darling , he 's the one who loves his mammal '' she said tenderly , and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again . 
`` Mamma , let me kiss your hand . '' 
The captain darted up to her at once and did so . 
`` And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy , '' said the grateful lady , pointing to Krassotkin . 
`` And I 'll bring you as much powder as you like , Ilusha . 
We make the powder ourselves now . 
Borovikov found out how it 's made - twenty-four parts of saltpetre , ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal . 
It 's all pounded together , mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve-that 's how it 's done . '' 
`` Smurov told me about your powder , only father says it 's not real gunpowder , '' responded Ilusha . 
`` Not real ? '' 
Kolya flushed . 
`` It burns . 
I do n't know , of course . '' 
`` No , I did n't mean that , '' put in the captain with a guilty face . 
`` I only said that real powder is not made like that , but that 's nothing , it can be made so . '' 
`` I do n't know , you know best . 
We lighted some in a pomatum pot , it burned splendidly , it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash . 
But that was only the paste , and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best , I do n't know ... And Bulkin 's father thrashed him on account of our powder , did you hear ? '' 
he turned to Ilusha . 
`` We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his bed . 
His father saw it . 
He said it might explode , and thrashed him on the spot . 
He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters . 
He is not allowed to go about with me now , no one is allowed to go about with me now . 
Smurov is not allowed to either ; I 've got a bad name with everyone . 
They say I 'm a ` desperate character , ' '' Kolya smiled scornfully . 
`` It all began from what happened on the railway . '' 
`` Ah , we 've heard of that exploit of yours , too , '' cried the captain . 
`` How could you lie still on the line ? 
Is it possible you were n't the least afraid , lying there under the train ? 
Were n't you frightened ? '' 
The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya . 
`` N - not particularly , '' answered Kolya carelessly . 
`` What 's blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose , '' he said , turning again to Ilusha - but though he assumed an unconcerned air as he talked , he still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up . 
`` Ah ! 
I heard about the goose ! '' 
Ilusha laughed , beaming all over . 
`` They told me , but I did n't understand . 
Did they really take you to the court ? '' 
`` The most stupid , trivial affair , they made a mountain of a mole-hill as they always do , '' Kolya began carelessly . 
`` I was walking through the market-place here one day , just when they 'd driven in the geese . 
I stopped and looked at them . 
All at once a fellow , who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov 's now , looked at me and said , ` What are you looking at the geese for ? ' 
I looked at him ; he was a stupid , moon-faced fellow of twenty . 
I am always on the side of the peasantry , you know . 
I like talking to the peasants ... . 
We 've dropped behind the peasants that 's an axiom . 
I believe you are laughing , Karamazov ? '' 
`` No , Heaven forbid , I am listening , '' said Alyosha with a most good-natured air , and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured . '' 
`` My theory , Karamazov , is clear and simple , '' he hurried on again , looking pleased . 
`` I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their due , but I am not for spoiling them , that is a sine qua non ... But I was telling you about the goose . 
So I turned to the fool and answered , ' I am wondering what the goose thinks about . ' 
He looked at me quite stupidly , ` And what does the goose think about ? ' 
he asked . 
` Do you see that cart full of oats ? ' 
I said . 
` The oats are dropping out of the sack , and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up - do you see ? ' ' 
I see that quite well , ' he said . 
` Well , ' said I , ` if that cart were to move on a little , would it break the goose 's neck or not ? ' 
` It 'd be sure to break it , ' and he grinned all over his face , highly delighted . 
` Come on , then , ' said I , ` let 's try . ' 
` Let 's , ' he said . 
And it did not take us long to arrange : he stood at the bridle without being noticed , and I stood on one side to direct the goose . 
And the owner was n't looking , he was talking to someone , so I had nothing to do , the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself , under the cart , just under the wheel . 
I winked at the lad , he tugged at the bridle , and crack . 
The goose 's neck was broken in half . 
And , as luck would have it , all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once . 
` You did that on purpose ! ' 
` No , not on purpose . ' 
` Yes , you did , on purpose ! ' 
Well , they shouted , ` Take him to the justice of the peace ! ' 
They took me , too . 
` You were there , too , ' they said , ` you helped , you 're known all over the market ! ' 
And , for some reason , I really am known all over the market , '' Kolya added conceitedly . 
`` We all went off to the justice 's , they brought the goose , too . 
The fellow was crying in a great funk , simply blubbering like a woman . 
And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number of geese like that . 
Well , of course , there were witnesses . 
The justice of the peace settled it in a minute , that the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the goose , and the fellow to have the goose . 
And he was warned not to play such pranks again . 
And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman . 
` It was n't me , ' he said , ` it was he egged me on , ' and he pointed to me . 
I answered with the utmost composure that I had n't egged him on , that I simply stated the general proposition , had spoken hypothetically . 
The justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself once for having smiled . 
` I 'll complain to your masters of you , so that for the future you may n't waste your time on such general propositions , instead of sitting at your books and learning your lessons . ' 
He did n't complain to the masters , that was a joke , but the matter noised abroad and came to the ears of the masters . 
Their ears are long , you know ! 
The classical master , Kolbasnikov , was particularly shocked about it , but Dardanelov got me off again . 
But Kolbasnikov is savage with everyone now like a green ass . 
Did you know , Ilusha , he is just married , got a dowry of a thousand roubles , and his bride 's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree . 
The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it : Astounding news has reached the class , Kolbasnikov has been an ass . 
And so on , awfully funny , I 'll bring it to you later on . 
I say nothing against Dardanelov , he is a learned man , there 's no doubt about it . 
I respect men like that and it 's not because he stood up for me . '' 
`` But you took him down about the founders of Troy ! '' 
Smurov put in suddenly , proud of Krassotkin at such a moment . 
He was particularly pleased with the story of the goose . 
`` Did you really take him down ? '' 
the captain inquired , in a flattering way . 
`` On the question who founded Troy ? 
We heard of it , Ilusha told me about it at the time . '' 
`` He knows everything , father , he knows more than any of us ! '' 
put in Ilusha ; `` he only pretends to be like that , but really he is top in every subject ... '' Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness . 
`` Oh , that 's all nonsense about Troy , a trivial matter . 
I consider this an unimportant question , '' said Kolya with haughty humility . 
He had by now completely recovered his dignity , though he was still a little uneasy . 
He felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose , for instance , with too little reserve , while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word all the time . 
And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him , and thought he was showing off before him . 
If he dared to think anything like that , Kolya would - `` I regard the question as quite a trivial one , '' he rapped out again , proudly . 
`` And I know who founded Troy , '' a boy , who had not spoken before , said suddenly , to the surprise of everyone . 
He was silent and seemed to be shy . 
He was a pretty boy of about eleven , called Kartashov . 
He was sitting near the door . 
Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement . 
The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret for the whole school , a secret which could only be discovered by reading Smaragdov , and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya . 
One day , when Kolya 's back was turned , Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov , which lay among Kolya 's books , and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation of Troy . 
This was a good time ago , but he felt uneasy and could not bring himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy , afraid of what might happen and of Krassotkin 's somehow putting him to shame over it . 
But now he could n't resist saying it . 
For weeks he had been longing to . 
`` Well , who did found it ? '' 
Kolya , turning to him with haughty superciliousness . 
He saw from his face that he really did know and at once made up his mind how to take it . 
There was so to speak , a discordant note in the general harmony . 
`` Troy was founded by Teucer , Dardanus , Ilius and Tros , '' the boy rapped out at once , and in the same instant he blushed , blushed so , that it was painful to look at him . 
But the boys stared at him , stared at him for a whole minute , and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya , who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure . 
`` In what sense did they found it ? '' 
he deigned to comment at last . 
`` And what is meant by founding a city or a state ? 
What do they do ? 
Did they go and each lay a brick , do you suppose ? '' 
There was laughter . 
The offending boy turned from pink to crimson . 
He was silent and on the point of tears . 
Kolya held him so for a minute . 
`` Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a nationality , you must first understand what you mean by it , '' he admonished him in stern , incisive tones . 
`` But I attach no consequence to these old wives ' tales and I do n't think much of universal history in general , '' he added carelessly , addressing the company generally . 
`` Universal history ? '' 
the captain inquired , looking almost scared . 
`` Yes , universal history ! 
It 's the study of the successive follies of mankind and nothing more . 
The only subjects I respect are mathematics and natural science , '' said Kolya . 
He was showing off and he stole a glance at Alyosha ; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there . 
But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before . 
If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him , but Alyosha was silent and `` it might be the silence of contempt , '' and that finally irritated Kolya . 
`` The classical languages , too ... they are simply madness , nothing more . 
You seem to disagree with me again , Karamazov ? '' 
`` I do n't agree , '' said Alyosha , with a faint smile . 
`` The study of the classics , if you ask my opinion , is simply a police measure , that 's simply why it has been introduced into our schools . '' 
By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again . 
`` Latin and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect . 
It was dull before , so what could they do to make things duller ? 
It was senseless enough before , so what could they do to make it more senseless ? 
So they thought of Greek and Latin . 
That 's my opinion , I hope I shall never change it , '' Kolya finished abruptly . 
His cheeks were flushed . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Smurov suddenly , in a ringing tone of conviction . 
He had listened attentively . 
`` And yet he is first in Latin himself , '' cried one of the group of boys suddenly . 
`` Yes , father , he says that and yet he is first in Latin , '' echoed Ilusha . 
`` What of it ? '' 
Kolya thought fit to defend himself , though the praise was very sweet to him . 
`` I am fagging away at Latin because I have to , because I promised my mother to pass my examination , and I think that whatever you do , it 's worth doing it well . 
But in my soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud ... . 
You do n't agree , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Why ` fraud ' ? '' 
Alyosha smiled again . 
`` Well , all the classical authors have been translated into all languages , so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin , but solely as a police measure , to stupefy the intelligence . 
So what can one call it but a fraud ? '' 
`` Why , who taught you all this ? '' 
cried Alyosha , surprised at last . 
`` In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being taught . 
Besides , what I said just now about the classics being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class . '' 
`` The doctor has come ! '' 
cried Nina , who had been silent till then . 
A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate . 
The captain , who had been expecting the doctor all the morning , rushed headlong out to meet him . 
`` Mamma '' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air . 
Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight . 
Nina , from her invalid chair , anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy . 
The boys hurriedly took leave . 
Some of them promised to come again in the evening . 
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed . 
`` I wo n't go away , I wo n't go away , '' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha . 
`` I 'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor 's gone , I 'll come back with Perezvon . '' 
But by now the doctor had entered , an important-looking person with long , dark whiskers and a shiny , shaven chin , wearing a bearskin coat . 
As he crossed the threshold he stopped , taken aback ; he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place . 
`` How is this ? 
Where am I ? '' 
he muttered , not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap . 
The crowd , the poverty of the room , the washing hanging on a line in the corner , puzzled him . 
The captain , bent double , was bowing low before him . 
`` It 's here , sir , here , sir , '' he muttered cringingly ; `` it 's here , you 've come right , you were coming to us ... '' `` Sne-gi-ryov ? '' 
the doctor said loudly and pompously . 
`` Mr. Snegiryov - is that you ? '' 
`` That 's me , sir ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his coat , displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck . 
The captain caught the fur coat in the air , and the doctor took off his cap . 
`` Where is the patient ? '' 
he asked emphatically . 
Precocity `` WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him ? '' 
Kolya asked quickly . 
`` What a repulsive mug , though , has n't he ? 
I ca n't endure medicine ! '' 
`` Ilusha is dying . 
I think that 's certain , '' answered Alyosha , mournfully . 
`` They are rogues ! 
Medicine 's a fraud ! 
I am glad to have made your acquaintance , though , Karamazov . 
I wanted to know you for a long time . 
I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances . '' 
Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative , but he felt ill at ease . 
Alyosha noticed this , smiled , and pressed his hand . 
`` I 've long learned to respect you as a rare person , '' Kolya muttered again , faltering and uncertain . 
`` I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery . 
I know you are a mystic , but ... that has n't put me off . 
Contact with real life will cure you ... . 
It 's always so with characters like yours . '' 
`` What do you mean by mystic ? 
Cure me of what ? '' 
Alyosha was rather astonished . 
`` Oh , God and all the rest of it . '' 
`` What , do n't you believe in God ? '' 
`` Oh , I 've nothing against God . 
Of course , God is only a hypothesis , but ... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all that ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented , '' added Kolya , beginning to blush . 
He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was `` grown up . '' 
`` I have n't the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him , '' Kolya thought indignantly . 
And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed . 
`` I must confess I ca n't endure entering on such discussions , '' he said with a final air . 
`` It 's possible for one who does n't believe in God to love mankind , do n't you think so ? 
Voltaire did n't believe in God and loved mankind ? '' 
-LRB- `` I am at it again , '' he thought to himself . -RRB- 
`` Voltaire believed in God , though not very much , I think , and I do n't think he loved mankind very much either , '' said Alyosha quietly , gently , and quite naturally , as though he were talking to someone of his own age , or even older . 
Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha 's apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire . 
He seemed to be leaving the question for him , little Kolya , to settle . 
`` Have you read Voltaire ? '' 
Alyosha finished . 
`` No , not to say read ... . 
But I 've read Candide in the Russian translation ... in an absurd , grotesque , old translation . . 
-LRB- At it again ! 
again ! -RRB- '' 
`` And did you understand it ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , everything ... . 
That is ... Why do you suppose I should n't understand it ? 
There 's a lot of nastiness in it , of course ... . 
Of course I can understand that it 's a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea ... '' Kolya was getting mixed by now . 
`` I am a Socialist , Karamazov , I am an incurable Socialist , '' he announced suddenly , apropos of nothing . 
`` A Socialist ? '' 
laughed Alyosha . 
`` But when have you had time to become one ? 
Why , I thought you were only thirteen ? '' 
Kolya winced . 
`` In the first place I am not thirteen , but fourteen , fourteen in a fortnight , '' he flushed angrily , `` and in the second place I am at a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it ? 
The question is what are my convictions , not what is my age , is n't it ? '' 
`` When you are older , you 'll understand for yourself the influence of age on convictions . 
I fancied , too , that you were not expressing your own ideas , '' Alyosha answered serenely and modestly , but Kolya interrupted him hotly : `` Come , you want obedience and mysticism . 
You must admit that the Christian religion , for instance , has only been of use to the rich and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery . 
That 's so , is n't it ? '' 
`` Ah , I know where you read that , and I am sure someone told you so ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` I say , what makes you think I read it ? 
And certainly no one told so . 
I can think for myself ... . 
I am not opposed to Christ , if you like . 
He was a most humane person , and if He were alive to-day , He would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists , and would perhaps play a conspicuous part ... . 
There 's no doubt about that . '' 
`` Oh , where , where did you get that from ? 
What fool have you made friends with ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` Come , the truth will out ! 
It has so chanced that I have often talked to Mr. Rakitin , of course , but ... old Byelinsky said that , too , so they say . '' 
`` Byelinsky ? 
I do n't remember . 
He has n't written that anywhere . '' 
`` If he did n't write it , they say he said it . 
I heard that from a. . . 
but never mind . '' 
`` And have you read Byelinsky ? '' 
`` Well , no ... I have n't read all of him , but ... I read the passage about Tatyana , why she did n't go off with Onyegin . '' 
`` Did n't go off with Onyegin ? 
Surely you do n't ... understand that already ? '' 
`` Why , you seem to take me for little Smurov , '' said Kolya , with a grin of irritation . 
`` But please do n't suppose I am such a revolutionist . 
I often disagree with Mr. Rakitin . 
Though I mention Tatyana , I am not at all for the emancipation of women . 
I acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey . 
Les femmes tricottent , * Napoleon said . '' 
Kolya , for some reason , smiled , `` And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with that pseudo-great man . 
I think , too , that to leave one 's own country and fly to America is mean , worse than mean - silly . 
Why go to America when one may be of great service to humanity here ? 
Now especially . 
There 's a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us . 
That 's what I answered . '' 
* Let the women knit . 
`` What do you mean ? 
Answered whom ? 
Has someone suggested your going to America already ? '' 
`` I must own , they 've been at me to go , but I declined . 
That 's between ourselves , of course , Karamazov ; do you hear , not a word to anyone . 
I say this only to you . 
I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge . 
Long will you remember The house at the Chain bridge . 
Do you remember ? 
It 's splendid . 
Why are you laughing ? 
You do n't suppose I am fibbing , do you ? '' 
-LRB- `` What if he should find out that I 've only that one number of The Bell in father 's book case , and have n't read any more of it ? '' 
Kolya thought with a shudder . -RRB- 
`` Oh no , I am not laughing and do n't suppose for a moment that you are lying . 
No , indeed , I ca n't suppose so , for all this , alas ! 
is perfectly true . 
But tell me , have you read Pushkin - Onyegin , for instance ? 
... You spoke just now of Tatyana . '' 
`` No , I have n't read it yet , but I want to read it . 
I have no prejudices , Karamazov ; I want to hear both sides . 
What makes you ask ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Karamazov , have you an awful contempt for me ? '' 
Kolya rapped out suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha , as though he were on drill . 
`` Be so kind as to tell me , without beating about the bush . '' 
`` I have a contempt for you ? '' 
Alyosha looked at him wondering . 
`` What for ? 
I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life . '' 
`` Do n't be anxious about my nature , '' Kolya interrupted , not without complacency . 
`` But it 's true that I am stupidly sensitive , crudely sensitive . 
You smiled just now , and I fancied you seemed to - '' `` Oh , my smile meant something quite different . 
I 'll tell you why I smiled . 
Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia , on our students and schoolboys of to-day . 
` Show a Russian schoolboy , ' he writes , ' a map of the stars , which he knows nothing about , and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it . ' 
No knowledge and unbounded conceit - that 's what the German meant to say about the Russian schoolboy . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perfectly right , '' Kolya laughed suddenly , `` exactly so ! 
Bravo the German ! 
But he did not see the good side , what do you think ? 
Conceit may be , that comes from youth , that will be corrected if need be , but , on the other hand , there is an independent spirit almost from childhood , boldness of thought and conviction , and not the spirit of these sausage makers , grovelling before authority ... . 
But the German was right all the same . 
Bravo the German ! 
But Germans want strangling all the same . 
Though they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled . '' 
`` Strangled , what for ? '' 
smiled Alyosha . 
`` Well , perhaps I am talking nonsense , I agree . 
I am awfully childish sometimes , and when I am pleased about anything I ca n't restrain myself and am ready to talk any stuff . 
But , I say , we are chattering away here about nothing , and that doctor has been a long time in there . 
But perhaps he 's examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina . 
I liked that Nina , you know . 
She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away , ` Why did n't you come before ? ' 
And in such a voice , so reproachfully ! 
I think she is awfully nice and pathetic . '' 
`` Yes , yes ! 
Well , you 'll be coming often , you will see what she is like . 
It would do you a great deal of good to know people like that , to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people , '' Alyosha observed warmly . 
`` That would have more effect on you than anything . '' 
`` Oh , how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner ! '' 
Kolya exclaimed , with bitter feeling . 
`` Yes , it 's a great pity . 
You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you . 
And how he fretted for you to come ! '' 
`` Do n't tell me ! 
You make it worse ! 
But it serves me right . 
What kept me from coming was my conceit , my egoistic vanity , and the beastly wilfulness , which I never can get rid of , though I 've been struggling with it all my life . 
I see that now . 
I am a beast in lots of ways , Karamazov ! '' 
`` No , you have a charming nature , though it 's been distorted , and I quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous , morbidly sensitive boy , '' Alyosha answered warmly . 
`` And you say that to me ! '' 
cried Kolya ; `` and would you believe it , I thought - I 've thought several times since I 've been here - that you despised me ! 
If only you knew how I prize your opinion ! '' 
`` But are you really so sensitive ? 
At your age ! 
Would you believe it , just now , when you were telling your story , I thought , as I watched you , that you must be very sensitive ! '' 
`` You thought so ? 
What an eye you 've got , I say ! 
I bet that was when I was talking about the goose . 
That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off , and for a moment I quite hated you for it , and began talking like a fool . 
Then I fancied - just now , here - when I said that if there were no God He would have to be invented , that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge , especially as I got that phrase out of a book . 
But I swear I was n't showing off out of vanity , though I really do n't know why . 
Because I was so pleased ? 
Yes , I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it 's perfectly disgraceful for anyone to be gushing directly they are pleased , I know that . 
But I am convinced now that you do n't despise me ; it was all my imagination . 
Oh , Karamazov , I am profoundly unhappy . 
I sometimes fancy all sorts of things , that everyone is laughing at me , the whole world , and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things . '' 
`` And you worry everyone about you , '' smiled Alyosha . 
`` Yes , I worry everyone about me , especially my mother . 
Karamazov , tell me , am I very ridiculous now ? '' 
`` Do n't think about that , do n't think of it at all ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` And what does ridiculous mean ? 
Is n't everyone constantly being or seeming ridiculous ? 
Besides , nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous , and that makes them unhappy . 
All I am surprised at is that you should be feeling that so early , though I 've observed it for some time past , , not only in you . 
Nowadays the very children have begun to suffer from it . 
It 's almost a sort of insanity . 
The devil has taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation ; it 's simply the devil , '' added Alyosha , without a trace of the smile that Kolya , staring at him , expected to see . 
`` You are like everyone else , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , `` that is , like very many others . 
Only you must not be like everybody else , that 's all . '' 
`` Even if everyone is like that ? '' 
`` Yes , even if everyone is like that . 
You be the only one not like it . 
You really are not like everyone else , here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad and even ridiculous . 
And who will admit so much in these days ? 
No one . 
And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self-criticism . 
Do n't be like everyone else , even if you are the only one . '' 
`` Splendid ! 
I was not mistaken in you . 
You know how to console one . 
Oh , how I have longed to know you , Karamazov ! 
I 've long been eager for this meeting . 
Can you really have thought about me , too ? 
You said just now that you thought of me , too ? '' 
`` Yes , I 'd heard of you and had thought of you , too ... and if it 's partly vanity that makes you ask , it does n't matter . '' 
`` Do you know , Karamazov , our talk has been like a declaration of love , '' said Kolya , in a bashful and melting voice . 
`` That 's not ridiculous , is it ? '' 
`` Not at all ridiculous , and if it were , it would n't matter , because it 's been a good thing . '' 
Alyosha smiled brightly . 
`` But do you know , Karamazov , you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself , now ... . 
I see it by your eyes . '' 
Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness . 
`` Why ashamed ? '' 
`` Well , why are you blushing ? '' 
`` It was you made me blush , '' laughed Alyosha , and he really did blush . 
`` Oh , well , I am a little , goodness knows why , I do n't know ... '' he muttered , almost embarrassed . 
`` Oh , how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed ! 
Because you are just like me , '' cried Kolya , in positive ecstasy . 
His cheeks glowed , his eyes beamed . 
`` You know , Kolya , you will be very unhappy in your life , '' something made Alyosha say suddenly . 
`` I know , I know . 
How you know it all before hand ! '' 
Kolya agreed at once . 
`` But you will bless life on the whole , all the same . '' 
`` Just so , hurrah ! 
You are a prophet . 
Oh , we shall get on together , Karamazov ! 
Do you know , what delights me most , is that you treat me quite like an equal . 
But we are not equals , no , we are not , you are better ! 
But we shall get on . 
Do you know , all this last month , I 've been saying to myself , ` Either we shall be friends at once , for ever , or we shall part enemies to the grave ! ' '' 
`` And saying that , of course , you loved me , '' Alyosha laughed gaily . 
`` I did . 
I loved you awfully . 
I 've been loving and dreaming of you . 
And how do you know it all beforehand ? 
Ah , here 's the doctor . 
Goodness ! 
What will he tell us ? 
Look at his face ! '' 
Ilusha THE doctor came out of the room again , muffled in his fur coat and with his cap on his head . 
His face looked almost angry and disgusted , as though he were afraid of getting dirty . 
He cast a cursory glance round the passage , looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so . 
Alyosha waved from the door to the coachman , and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up . 
The captain darted out after the doctor , and , bowing apologetically , stopped him to get the last word . 
The poor fellow looked utterly crushed ; there was a scared look in his eyes . 
`` Your Excellency , your Excellency ... is it possible ? '' 
he began , but could not go on and clasped his hands in despair . 
Yet he still gazed imploringly at the doctor , as though a word from him might still change the poor boy 's fate . 
`` I ca n't help it , I am not God ! '' 
the doctor answered offhand , though with the customary impressiveness . 
`` Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon , soon ? '' 
`` You must be prepared for anything , '' said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones , and dropping his eyes , he was about to step out to the coach . 
`` Your Excellency , for Christ 's sake ! '' 
the terror-stricken captain stopped him again . 
`` Your Excellency ! 
But can nothing , absolutely nothing save him now ? '' 
`` It 's not in my hands now , '' said the doctor impatiently , `` but h 'm ! 
... '' he stopped suddenly . 
`` If you could , for instance ... send ... your patient ... at once , without delay '' -LRB- the words `` at once , without delay , '' the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start -RRB- `` to Syracuse , the change to the new be-ne-ficial `` To Syracuse ! '' 
cried the captain , unable to grasp what was said . 
`` Syracuse is in Sicily , '' Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation . 
The doctor looked at him . 
`` Sicily ! 
Your Excellency , '' faltered the captain , `` but you 've seen '' - he spread out his hands , indicating his surroundings - `` mamma and my family ? '' 
`` N-no , SiciIy is not the place for the family , the family should go to Caucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus , and your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her rheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist Lepelletier ; I could give you a note to him , and then ... there might be a change - '' `` Doctor , doctor ! 
But you see ! '' 
The captain flung wide his hands again despairingly , indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage . 
`` Well , that 's not my business , '' grinned the doctor . 
`` I have only told you the answer of medical science to your question as to possible `` Do n't be afraid , apothecary , my dog wo n't bite you , '' Kolya rapped out loudly , noticing the doctor 's rather uneasy glance at Perezvon , who was standing in the doorway . 
There was a wrathful note in Kolya 's voice . 
He used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose , and , as he explained afterwards , used it `` to insult him . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
The doctor flung up his head , staring with surprise at Kolya . 
`` Who 's this ? '' 
he addressed Alyosha , as though asking him to explain . 
`` It 's Perezvon 's master , do n't worry about me , '' Kolya said incisively again . 
`` Perezvon ? '' 
* repeated the doctor , perplexed . 
* i.e. a chime of bells . 
`` He hears the bell , but where it is he can not tell . 
Good-bye , we shall meet in Syracuse . '' 
`` Who 's this ? 
Who 's this ? '' 
The doctor flew into a terrible rage . 
`` He is a schoolboy , doctor , he is a mischievous boy ; take no notice of him , '' said Alyosha , frowning and speaking quickly . 
`` Kolya , hold your tongue ! '' 
he cried to Krassotkin . 
`` Take no notice of him , doctor , '' he repeated , rather impatiently . 
`` He wants a thrashing , a good thrashing ! '' 
The doctor stamped in a perfect fury . 
`` And you know , apothecary , my Perezvon might bite ! '' 
said Kolya , turning pale , with quivering voice and flashing eyes . 
`` Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Kolya , if you say another word , I 'll have nothing more to do with you , '' Alyosha cried peremptorily . 
`` There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin - this is the man , '' Kolya pointed to Alyosha . 
`` I obey him , good-bye ! '' 
He stepped forward , opened the door , and quickly went into the inner room . 
Perezvon flew after him . 
The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement , looking at Alyosha ; then , with a curse , he went out quickly to the carriage , repeating aloud , `` This is ... this is ... I do n't know what it is ! '' 
The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage . 
Alyosha followed Kolya into the room . 
He was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his father . 
A minute later the captain , too , came back . 
`` Father , father , come ... we ... '' Ilusha faltered in violent excitement , but apparently unable to go on , he flung his wasted arms , found his father and Kolya , uniting them in one embrace , and hugging them as tightly as he could . 
The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs , and Kolya 's lips and chin twitched . 
`` Father , father ! 
How sorry I am for you ! '' 
Ilusha moaned bitterly . 
`` Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we shall be happy ... the doctor ... '' the captain began . 
`` Ah , father ! 
I know what the new doctor said to you about me ... . 
I saw ! '' 
cried Ilusha , and again he hugged them both with all his strength , hiding his face on his father 's shoulder . 
`` Father , do n't cry , and when I die get a good boy , another one ... choose one of them all , a good one , call him Ilusha and love him instead of me ... '' `` Hush , old man , you 'll get well , '' Krassotkin cried suddenly , in a voice that sounded angry . 
`` But do n't ever forget me , father , '' Ilusha went on , `` come to my grave ... and father , bury me by our big stone , where we used to go for our walk , and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... I shall expect you ... . 
Father , father ! '' 
His voice broke . 
They were all three silent , still embracing . 
Nina was crying , quietly in her chair , and at last seeing them all crying , `` mamma , '' too , burst into tears . 
`` Ilusha ! 
Ilusha ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha 's embrace . 
`` Good-bye , old man , mother expects me back to dinner , '' he said quickly . 
`` What a pity I did not tell her ! 
She will be dreadfully anxious ... But after dinner I 'll come back to you for the whole day , for the whole evening , and I 'll tell you all sorts of things , all sorts of things . 
And I 'll bring Perezvon , but now I will take him with me , because he will begin to howl when I am away and bother you . 
Good-bye ! 
And he ran out into the passage . 
He did n't want to cry , but in the passage he burst into tears . 
Alyosha found him crying . 
`` Kolya , you must be sure to keep your word and come , or he will be terribly disappointed , '' Alyosha said emphatically . 
`` I will ! 
Oh , how I curse myself for not having come before '' muttered Kolya , crying , and no longer ashamed of it . 
At that moment the captain flew out of the room , and at once closed the door behind him . 
His face looked frenzied , his lips were trembling . 
He stood before the two and flung up his arms . 
`` I do n't want a good boy ! 
I do n't want another boy ! '' 
he muttered in a wild whisper , clenching his teeth . 
`` If I forget thee , knees before the wooden bench . 
Pressing his fists against his head , he began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries , doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in the room . 
Kolya ran out into the street . 
`` Good-bye , Karamazov ? 
Will you come yourself ? '' 
he cried sharply and angrily to Alyosha . 
`` I will certainly come in the evening . '' 
`` What was that he said about Jerusalem ? 
... What did he mean by that ? '' 
`` It 's from the Bible . 
` If I forget thee , Jerusalem , ' that is , if I forget all that is most precious to me , if I let anything take its place , then may - '' `` I understand , that 's enough ! 
Mind you come ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
he cried with positive ferocity to the dog , and with rapid strides he went home . 
At Grushenka 's ALYOSHA went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov 's house to see Grushenka , who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an urgent message begging him to come . 
Questioning Fenya , Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day . 
During the two months that had passed since Mitya 's arrest , Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov 's house , both from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya . 
Three days after Mitya 's arrest , Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks . 
For one whole week she was unconscious . 
She was very much changed - thinner and a little sallow , though she had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out . 
But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than before , and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her . 
A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face . 
There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her , and a steadfast , fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her . 
There was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming face a look of concentrated thought , almost austere at the first glance . 
There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity . 
It seemed strange to Alyosha , too , that in spite of the calamity that had overtaken the poor girl , betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a terrible crime , almost at the instant of their betrothal , in spite of her illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya , Grushenka had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness . 
There was a soft light in the once proud eyes , though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her heart . 
The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever - Katerina Ivanovna , of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium . 
Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her . 
Yet Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his prison , though she might have done it whenever she liked . 
All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha , for he was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking advice . 
Sometimes he was unable to say anything . 
Full of anxiety he entered her lodging . 
She was at home . 
She had returned from seeing Mitya half an hour before , and from the rapid movement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been expecting him with great impatience . 
A pack of cards dealt for a game of `` fools '' lay on the table . 
A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay , half reclining , on it . 
He wore a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap , and was evidently ill and weak , though he was smiling blissfully . 
When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before , he had simply stayed on and was still staying with her . 
He arrived with her in rain and sleet , sat down on the sofa , drenched and scared , and gazed mutely at her with a timid , appealing smile . 
Grushenka , who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever , almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half hour after her arrival . 
Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently : he laughed a pitiful , helpless little laugh . 
She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat . 
All that day he sat in the same place , almost without stirring . 
When it got dark and the shutters were closed , Fenya asked her mistress : `` Is the gentleman going to stay the night , mistress ? '' 
`` Yes ; make him a bed on the sofa , '' answered Grushenka . 
Questioning him more in detail , Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go , and that `` Mr. Kalganov , my benefactor , told me straight that he would n't receive me again and gave me five roubles . '' 
`` Well , God bless you , you 'd better stay , then , '' Grushenka decided in her grief , smiling compassionately at him . 
Her smile wrung the old man 's heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears . 
And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since . 
He did not leave the house even when she was ill . 
Fenya and her grandmother , the cook , did not turn him out , but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa . 
Grushenka had grown used to him , and coming back from seeing Mitya -LRB- whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well -RRB- she would sit down and begin talking to `` Maximushka '' about trifling matters , to keep her from thinking of her sorrow . 
The old man turned out to be a good story-teller on occasions , so that at last he became necessary to her . 
Grushenka saw scarcely anyone else beside Alyosha , who did not come every day and never stayed long . 
Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time , `` at his last gasp '' as they said in the town , and he did , in fact , die a week after Mitya 's trial . 
Three weeks before his death , feeling the end approaching , he made his sons , their wives and children , come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again . 
From that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came , `` The master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him . '' 
But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him . 
`` You 've come at last ! '' 
she cried , flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha , `` and Maximushka 's been scaring me that perhaps you would n't come . 
Ah , how I need you ! 
Sit down to the table . 
What will you have coffee ? '' 
`` Yes , please , '' said Alyosha , sitting down at the table . 
`` I am very hungry . '' 
`` That 's right . 
Fenya , Fenya , coffee , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` It 's been made a long time ready for you . 
And bring some little pies , and mind they are hot . 
Do you know , we 've had a storm over those pies to-day . 
I took them to the prison for him , and would you believe it , he threw them back to me : he would not eat them . 
He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it . 
So I said to him : ' I shall leave them with the warder ; if you do n't eat them before evening , it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you ! ' 
With that I went away . 
We quarrelled again , would you believe it ? 
Whenever I go we quarrel . '' 
Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation . 
Maximov , feeling nervous , at once smiled and looked on the floor . 
`` What did you quarrel about this time ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` I did n't expect it in the least . 
Only fancy , he is jealous of the Pole . 
` Why are you keeping him ? ' 
he said . 
` So you 've begun keeping him . ' 
He is jealous , jealous of me all the time , jealous eating and sleeping ! 
He even took into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week . '' 
`` But he knew about the Pole before ? '' 
`` Yes , but there it is . 
He has known about him from the very beginning but to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him . 
I am ashamed to repeat what he said . 
Silly fellow ! 
Rakitin went in as I came out . 
Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on . 
What do you think ? '' 
she added carelessly . 
`` He loves you , that 's what it is ; he loves you so much . 
And now he is particularly worried . '' 
`` I should think he might be , with the trial to-morrow . 
And I went to him to say something about to-morrow , for I dread to think what 's going to happen then . 
You say that he is worried , but how worried I am ! 
And he talks about the Pole ! 
He 's too silly ! 
He is not jealous of Maximushka yet , anyway . '' 
`` My wife was dreadfully jealous over me , too , '' Maximov put in his word . 
`` Jealous of you ? '' 
Grushenka laughed in spite of herself . 
`` Of whom could she have been jealous ? '' 
`` Of the servant girls . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Maximushka , I am in no laughing mood now ; I feel angry . 
Do n't ogle the pies . 
I sha n't give you any ; they are not good for you , and I wo n't give you any vodka either . 
I have to look after him , too , just as though I kept an almshouse , '' she laughed . 
`` I do n't deserve your kindness . 
I am a worthless creature , '' said Maximov , with tears in his voice . 
`` You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me . '' 
`` Ech , everyone is of use , Maximushka , and how can we tell who 's of most use ? 
If only that Pole did n't exist , Alyosha . 
He 's taken it into his head to fall ill , too , to-day . 
I 've been to see him also . 
And I shall send him some pies , too , on purpose . 
I had n't sent him any , but Mitya accused me of it , so now I shall send some ! 
Ah , here 's Fenya with a letter ! 
Yes , it 's from the Poles - begging again ! 
Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles . 
In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum , with a promise to repay it within three months , signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well . 
Grushenka had received many such letters , accompanied by such receipts , from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence . 
But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness . 
The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one , written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal . 
It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half , unable to make head or tail of it . 
She could not attend to letters then . 
The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period . 
Grushenka left that letter , too , unanswered . 
A whole series of letters had followed - one every day - all as pompous and rhetorical , but the loan asked for , gradually diminishing , dropped to a hundred roubles , than to twenty-five , to ten , and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both . 
Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them , and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging . 
She found the two Poles in great poverty , almost destitution , without food or fuel , without cigarettes , in debt to their landlady . 
The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared . 
But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self-assertion , with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches . 
Grushenka simply laughed , and gave her former admirer ten roubles . 
Then , laughing , she told Mitya of it and he was not in the least jealous . 
But ever since , the Poles had attached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had always sent them small sums . 
And now that day Mitya had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous . 
`` Like a fool , I went round to him just for a minute , on the way to see Mitya , for he is ill , too , my Pole , '' Grushenka began again with nervous haste . 
`` I was laughing , telling Mitya about it . 
` Fancy , ' I said , ` my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar . 
He thought I would be touched and marry him ! ' 
Mitya leapt up swearing ... . 
So , there , I 'll send them the pies ! 
Fenya , is it that little girl they 've sent ? 
Here , give her three roubles and pack up a dozen pies in a paper and tell her to take them . 
And you , Alyosha , be sure to tell Mitya that I did send them the pies . '' 
`` I would n't tell him for anything , '' said Alyosha , smiling . 
`` Ech ! 
You think he is unhappy about it . 
Why , he 's jealous on purpose . 
He does n't care , '' said Grushenka bitterly . 
`` On purpose ? '' 
queried Alyosha . 
`` I tell you you are silly , Alyosha . 
You know nothing about it , with all your cleverness . 
I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me . 
I would be offended if he were not jealous . 
I am like that . 
I am not offended at jealousy . 
I have a fierce heart , too . 
I can be jealous myself . 
Only what offends me is that he does n't love me at all . 
I tell you he is jealous now on purpose . 
Am I blind ? 
Do n't I see ? 
He began talking to me just now of that woman , of Katerina , saying she was this and that , how she had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him , to try and save him ; how she had ordered the best counsel , the most learned one , too . 
So he loves her , if he 'll praise her to my face , more shame to him ! 
He 's treated me badly himself , so he attacked me , to make out I am in fault first and to throw it all on me . 
` You were with your Pole before me , so I ca n't be blamed for Katerina , ' that 's what it amounts to . 
He wants to throw the whole blame on me . 
He attacked me on purpose , on purpose , I tell you , but I 'll - '' Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do . 
She hid her eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently . 
`` He does n't love Katerina Ivanovna , '' said Alyosha firmly . 
`` Well , whether he loves her or not , I 'll soon find out for myself , '' said Grushenka , with a menacing note in her voice , taking the handkerchief from her eyes . 
Her face was distorted . 
Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene , it had become sullen and spiteful . 
`` Enough of this foolishness , '' she said suddenly ; `` it 's not for that I sent for you . 
Alyosha , darling , to-morrow - what will happen to-morrow ? 
That 's what worries me ! 
And it 's only me it worries ! 
I look at everyone and no one is thinking of it . 
No one cares about it . 
Are you thinking about it even ? 
To-morrow he 'll be tried , you know . 
Tell me , how will he be tried ? 
You know it 's the valet , the valet killed him ! 
Good heavens ! 
Can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him ? 
They have n't troubled the valet at all , have they ? '' 
`` He 's been severely cross-examined , '' observed Alyosha thoughtfully ; `` but everyone came to the conclusion it was not he . 
Now he is lying very ill . 
He has been ill ever since that attack . 
Really ill , '' added Alyosha . 
`` Oh , dear ! 
could n't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself ? 
He 's been brought from Petersburg for three thousand roubles , they say . '' 
`` We gave these three thousand together - Ivan , Katerina Ivanovna and I - but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself . 
The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more , but the case has become known all over Russia ; it 's talked of in all the papers and journals . 
Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing , because the case has become so notorious . 
I saw him yesterday . '' 
`` Well ? 
Did you talk to him ? '' 
Grushenka put in eagerly . 
`` He listened and said nothing . 
He told me that he had already formed his opinion . 
But he promised to give my words consideration . '' 
`` Consideration ! 
Ah , they are swindlers ! 
They 'll ruin him . 
And why did she send for the doctor ? '' 
`` As an expert . 
They want to prove that Mitya 's mad and committed the murder when he did n't know what he was doing , '' Alyosha smiled gently , `` but Mitya wo n't agree to that . '' 
`` Yes ; but that would be the truth if he had killed him ! '' 
cried Grushenka . 
`` He was mad then , perfectly mad , and that was my fault , wretch that I am ! 
But , of course , he did n't do it , he did n't do it ! 
And they are all against him , the whole town . 
Even Fenya 's evidence went to prove he had done it . 
And the people at the shop , and that official , and at the tavern , too , before , people had heard him say so ! 
They are all , all against him , all crying out against him . '' 
`` Yes , there 's a fearful accumulation of evidence , '' Alyosha observed grimly . 
`` And Grigory - Grigory Vassilyevitch - sticks to his story that the door was open , persists that he saw it - there 's no shaking him . 
I went and talked to him myself . 
He 's rude about it , too . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perhaps the strongest evidence against him , '' said Alyosha . 
`` And as for Mitya 's being mad , he certainly seems like it now , '' Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air . 
`` Do you know , Alyosha , I 've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time . 
I go to him every day and simply wonder at him . 
Tell me , now , what do you suppose he 's always talking about ? 
He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it . 
I fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I could n't understand in my foolishness . 
Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe - that is , about some child . 
` Why is the babe poor ? ' 
he said . 
` It 's for that babe I am going to Siberia now . 
I am not a murderer , but I must go to Siberia ! ' 
What that meant , what babe , I could n't tell for the life of me . 
Only I cried when he said it , because he said it so nicely . 
He cried himself , and I cried , too . 
He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me . 
What did it mean , Alyosha , tell me ? 
What is this babe ? '' 
`` It must be Rakitin , who 's been going to see him lately , '' smiled Alyosha , `` though ... that 's not Rakitin 's doing . 
I did n't see Mitya yesterday . 
I 'll see him to-day . '' 
`` No , it 's not Rakitin ; it 's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him . 
It 's his going to see him , that 's what it is , '' Grushenka began , and suddenly broke off . 
Alyosha gazed at her in amazement . 
`` Ivan 's going ? 
Has he been to see him ? 
Mitya told me himself that Ivan has n't been once . '' 
`` There ... there ! 
What a girl I am ! 
Blurting things out ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , confused and suddenly blushing . 
`` Stay , Alyosha , hush ! 
Since I 've said so much I 'll tell the whole truth - he 's been to see him twice , the first directly he arrived . 
He galloped here from Moscow at once , of course , before I was taken ill ; and the second time was a week ago . 
He told Mitya not to tell you about it , under any circumstances ; and not to tell anyone , in fact . 
He came secretly . '' 
Alyosha sat plunged in thought , considering something . 
The news evidently impressed him . 
`` Ivan does n't talk to me of Mitya 's case , '' he said slowly . 
`` He 's said very little to me these last two months . 
And whenever I go to see him , he seems vexed at my coming , so I 've not been to him for the last three weeks . 
H 'm ! 
... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week . '' 
`` There has been a change , '' Grushenka assented quickly . 
`` They have a secret , they have a secret ! 
Mitya told me himself there was a secret , and such a secret that Mitya ca n't rest . 
Before then , he was cheerful - and , indeed , he is cheerful now - but when he shakes his head like that , you know , and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand , I know there is something on his mind worrying him ... . 
I know ! 
He was cheerful before , though , indeed , he is cheerful to-day . '' 
`` But you said he was worried . '' 
`` Yes , he is worried and yet cheerful . 
He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again . 
And you know , Alyosha , I am constantly wondering at him - with this awful thing hanging over him , he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself . '' 
`` And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan ? 
Did he say , ` Do n't tell him ' ? '' 
`` Yes , he told me , ` Do n't tell him . ' 
It 's you that Mitya 's most afraid of . 
Because it 's a secret : he said himself it was a secret . 
Alyosha , darling , go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me , '' Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness . 
`` Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that 's in store for me . 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
`` You think it 's something to do with you ? 
If it were , he would n't have told you there was a secret . '' 
`` I do n't know . 
Perhaps he wants to tell me , but does n't dare to . 
He warns me . 
There is a secret , he tells me , but he wo n't tell me what it is . '' 
`` What do you think yourself ? '' 
`` What do I think ? 
It 's the end for me , that 's what I think . 
They all three have been plotting my end , for Katerina 's in it . 
It 's all Katerina , it all comes from her . 
She is this and that , and that means that I am not . 
He tells me that beforehand - warns me . 
He is planning to throw me over , that 's the whole secret . 
They 've planned it together , the three of them - Mitya , Katerina , and Ivan Fyodorovitch . 
Alyosha , I 've been wanting to ask you a long time . 
A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina , because he often goes to see her . 
Did he tell me the truth or not ? 
Tell me , on your conscience , tell me the worst . '' 
`` I wo n't tell you a lie . 
Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna , I think . '' 
`` Oh , that 's what I thought ! 
He is lying to me , shameless deceiver , that 's what it is ! 
And he was jealous of me just now , so as to put the blame on me afterwards . 
He is stupid , he ca n't disguise what he is doing ; he is so open , you know ... . 
But I 'll give it to him , I 'll give it to him ! 
` You believe I did it , ' he said . 
He said that to me , to me . 
He reproached me with that ! 
God forgive him ! 
You wait , I 'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial ! 
I 'll just say a word then ... I 'll tell everything then ! '' 
And again she cried bitterly . 
`` This I can tell you for certain , Grushenka , '' Alyosha said , getting up . 
`` First , that he loves you , loves you more than anyone in the world , and you only , believe me . 
I know . 
I do know . 
The second thing is that I do n't want to worm his secret out of him , but if he 'll tell me of himself to-day , I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you . 
Then I 'll come to you to-day and tell you . 
Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it , and that the secret is about something else . 
That 's certain . 
It is n't likely it 's about Katerina Ivanovna , it seems to me . 
Good-bye for now . '' 
Alyosha shook hands with her . 
Grushenka was still crying . 
He saw that she put little faith in his consolation , but she was better for having had her sorrow out , for having spoken of it . 
He was sorry to leave her in such a state of mind , but he was in haste . 
He had a great many things to do still . 
The Injured Foot THE first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov , and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late for Mitya . 
Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three weeks : her foot had for some reason swollen up , and though she was not in bed , she lay all day half-reclining on the couch in her boudoir , in a fascinating but decorous deshabille . 
Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that , in spite of her illness , Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy - topknots , ribbons , loose wrappers had made their appearance , and he had an inkling of the reason , though he dismissed such ideas from his mind as frivolous . 
During the last two months the young official , Perhotin , had become a regular visitor at the house . 
Alyosha had not called for four days and he was in haste to go straight to Lise , as it was with her he had to speak , for Lise had sent a maid to him the previous day specially asking him to come to her `` about something very important , '' a request which , for certain reasons , had interest for Alyosha . 
But while the maid went to take his name in to Lise , Madame Hohlakov heard of his arrival from someone , and immediately sent to beg him to come to her `` just for one minute . '' 
Alyosha reflected that it was better to accede to the mamma 's request , or else she would be sending down to Lise 's room every minute that he was there . 
Madame Hohlakov was lying on a couch . 
She was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement . 
She greeted Alyosha with cries of rapture . 
`` It 's ages , ages , perfect ages since I 've seen you ! 
It 's a whole week - only think of it ! 
Ah , but you were here only four days ago , on Wednesday . 
You have come to see Lise . 
I 'm sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe , without my hearing you . 
My dear , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , if you only knew how worried I am about her ! 
But of that later , though that 's the most important thing , of that later . 
Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , I trust you implicitly with my Lise . 
Since the death of Father Zossima - God rest his soul ! '' 
-LRB- she crossed herself -RRB- - `` I look upon you as a monk , though you look charming in your new suit . 
Where did you find such a tailor in these parts ? 
No , no , that 's not the chief thing - of that later . 
Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha ; an old woman like me may take liberties , '' she smiled coquettishly ; `` but that will do later , too . 
The important thing is that I should n't forget what is important . 
Please remind me of it yourself . 
As soon as my tongue runs away with me , you just say ` the important thing ? ' 
Ach ! 
how do I know now what is of most importance ? 
Ever since Lise took back her promise - her childish promise , Alexey Fyodorovitch - to marry you , you 've realised , of course , that it was only the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair - thank God , she can walk now ! 
... that-new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother , who will to-morrow - but why speak of to-morrow ? 
I am ready to die at the very thought of to-morrow . 
Ready to die of curiosity ... . 
That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise ... . 
I paid him fifty roubles for the visit . 
But that 's not the point , that 's not the point again . 
You see , I 'm mixing everything up . 
I am in such a hurry . 
Why am I in a hurry ? 
I do n't understand . 
It 's awful how I seem growing unable to understand anything . 
Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle . 
I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away , and that will be all I shall see of you . 
Goodness ! 
Why are we sitting here and no coffee ? 
Yulia , Glafira , coffee ! '' 
Alyosha made haste to thank her , and said that he had only just had coffee . 
`` Where ? '' 
`` At Agrfena Alexandrovna 's . '' 
`` At ... at that woman 's ? 
Ah , it 's she has brought ruin on everyone . 
I know nothing about it though . 
They say she has become a saint , though it 's rather late in the day . 
She had better have done it before . 
What use is it now ? 
Hush , hush , Alexey Fyodorovitch , for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing . 
This awful trial ... I shall certainly go , I am making arrangements . 
I shall be carried there in my chair ; besides I can sit up . 
I shall have people with me . 
And , you know , I am a witness . 
How shall I speak , how shall I speak ? 
I do n't know what I shall say . 
One has to take an oath , has n't one ? '' 
`` Yes ; but I do n't think you will be able to go . '' 
`` I can sit up . 
Ah , you put me out ! 
Ah ! 
this trial , this savage act , and then they are all going to Siberia , some are getting married , and all this so quickly , so quickly , everything 's changing , and at last - nothing . 
All grow old and have death to look forward to . 
Well , so be it ! 
I am weary . 
This Katya , cette charmante personne , has disappointed all my hopes . 
Now she is going to follow one of your brothers to Siberia , and your other brother is going to follow her , and will live in the nearest town , and they will all torment one another . 
It drives me out of my mind . 
Worst of all - the publicity . 
The story has been told a million times over in all the papers in Moscow and Petersburg . 
Ah ! 
yes , would you believe it , there 's a paragraph that I was ' a dear friend ' of your brother 's - , I ca n't repeat the horrid word . 
just fancy , just fancy ! '' 
`` Impossible ! 
Where was the paragraph ? 
What did it say ? '' 
`` I 'll show you directly . 
I got the paper and read it yesterday . 
Here , in the Petersburg paper Gossip . 
The paper began coming out this year . 
I am awfully fond of gossip , and I take it in , and now it pays me out - this is what gossip comes to ! 
Here it is , here , this passage . 
Read it . '' 
And she handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her pillow . 
It was not exactly that she was upset , she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head . 
The paragraph was very typical , and must have been a great shock to her , but , fortunately perhaps , she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that moment , and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper . 
Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all over Russia . 
And , good heavens ! 
what wild rumours about his brother , about the Karamazovs , and about himself he had read in the course of those two months , among other equally credible items ! 
One paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery and become a monk , in horror at his brother 's crime . 
Another contradicted this , and stated that he and his elder , Father Zossima , had broken into the monastery chest and `` made tracks from the monastery . '' 
The present paragraph in the paper Gossip was under the heading , `` The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk . '' 
-LRB- That , alas ! 
was the name of our little town . 
I had hitherto kept it concealed . -RRB- 
It was brief , and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it . 
No names appeared , in fact . 
It was merely stated that the criminal , whose approaching trial was making such a sensation - retired army captain , an idle swaggerer , and reactionary bully - was continually involved in amorous intrigues , and particularly popular with certain ladies `` who were pining in solitude . '' 
One such lady , a pining widow , who tried to seem young though she had a grown-up daughter , was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the crime she offered him three thousand roubles , on condition that he would elope with her to the gold mines . 
But the criminal , counting on escaping punishment , had preferred to murder his father to get the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his pining lady . 
This playful paragraph finished , of course , with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom . 
Reading it with curiosity , Alyosha folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov . 
`` Well , that must be me , '' she hurried on again . 
`` Of course I am meant . 
Scarcely more than an hour before , I suggested gold mines to him , and here they talk of ` middle-aged charms ' as though that were my motive ! 
He writes that out of spite ! 
God Almighty forgive him for the middle-aged charms , as I forgive him ! 
You know it 's - Do you know who it is ? 
It 's your friend Rakitin . '' 
`` Perhaps , '' said Alyosha , `` though I 've heard nothing about it . '' 
`` It 's he , it 's he ! 
No ` perhaps ' about it . 
You know I turned him out of the house ... . 
You know all that story , do n't you ? '' 
`` I know that you asked him not to visit you for the future , but why it was , I have n't heard ... from you , at least . '' 
`` Ah , then you 've heard it from him ! 
He abuses me , I suppose , abuses me dreadfully ? '' 
`` Yes , he does ; but then he abuses everyone . 
But why you 've given him up I , have n't heard from him either . 
I meet him very seldom now , indeed . 
We are not friends . '' 
`` Well , then , I 'll tell you all about it . 
There 's no help for it , I 'll confess , for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame . 
Only a little , little point , so little that perhaps it does n't count . 
You see , my dear boy '' - Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming , though enigmatic , smile played about her lips - `` you see , I suspect ... You must forgive me , Alyosha . 
I am like a mother to you ... No , no ; quite the contrary . 
I speak to you now as though you were my father - mother 's quite out of place . 
Well , it 's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima , that 's just it . 
I called you a monk just now . 
Well , that poor young man , your friend , Rakitin -LRB- Mercy on us ! 
I ca n't be angry with him . 
I feel cross , but not very -RRB- , that frivolous young man , would you believe it , seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me . 
I only noticed it later . 
At first - a month ago - he only began to come oftener to see me , almost every day ; though , of course , we were acquainted before . 
I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me , and I began to notice things with surprise . 
You know , two months ago , that modest , charming , excellent young man , Ilyitch Perhotin , who 's in the service here , began to be a regular visitor at the house . 
You met him here ever so many times yourself . 
And he is an excellent , earnest young man , is n't he ? 
He comes once every three days , not every day -LRB- though I should be glad to see him every day -RRB- , and always so well dressed . 
Altogether , I love young people , Alyosha , talented , modest , like you , and he has almost the mind of a statesman , he talks so charmingly , and I shall certainly , certainly try and get promotion for him . 
He is a future diplomat . 
On that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night . 
And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots , and always stretches them out on the carpet ... . 
He began hinting at his feelings , in fact , and one day , as he was going , he squeezed my hand terribly hard . 
My foot began to swell directly after he pressed my hand like that . 
He had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before , and would you believe it , he is always gibing at him , growling at him , for some reason . 
I simply looked at the way they went on together and laughed inwardly . 
So I was sitting here alone - no , I was laid up then . 
Well , I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in , and only fancy ! 
brought me some verses of his own composition - a short poem , on my bad foot : that is , he described my foot in a poem . 
Wait a minute - how did it go ? 
A captivating little foot . 
It began somehow like that . 
I can never remember poetry . 
I 've got it here . 
I 'll show it to you later . 
But it 's a charming thing - charming ; and , you know , it 's not only about the foot , it had a good moral , too , a charming idea , only I 've forgotten it ; in fact , it was just the thing for an album . 
So , of course , I thanked him , and he was evidently flattered . 
I 'd hardly had time to thank him when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch , and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as night . 
I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way , for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses . 
I had a presentiment of it ; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in . 
I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and did n't say who was the author . 
But I am convinced that he guessed , though he wo n't own it to this day , and declares he had no idea . 
But he says that on purpose . 
Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once , and fell to criticising it . 
` Wretched doggerel , ' he said they were , ` some divinity student must have written them , ' and with such vehemence , such vehemence ! 
Then , instead of laughing , your friend flew into a rage . 
` Good gracious ! ' 
I thought , ` they 'll fly at each other . ' 
` It was I who wrote them , ' said he . ' 
I wrote them as a joke , ' he said , ` for I think it degrading to write verses ... . 
But they are good poetry . 
They want to put a monument to your Pushkin for writing about women 's feet , while I wrote with a moral purpose , and you , ' said he , ` are an advocate of serfdom . 
You 've no humane ideas , ' said he . 
` You have no modern enlightened feelings , you are uninfluenced by progress , you are a mere official , ' he said , ` and you take bribes . ' 
Then I began screaming and imploring them . 
And , you know , Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward . 
He at once took up the most gentlemanly tone , looked at him sarcastically , listened , and apologised . 
` I 'd no idea , ' said he . ' 
I should n't have said it , if I had known . 
I should have praised it . 
Poets are all so irritable , ' he said . 
In short , he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone . 
He explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic . 
I thought he was in earnest . 
Only as I lay there , just as before you now , I thought , ` Would it , or would it not , be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house ? ' 
And , would you believe it , I lay here , shut my eyes , and wondered , would it be the proper thing or not . 
I kept worrying and worrying , and my heart began to beat , and I could n't make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not . 
One voice seemed to be telling me , ` Speak , ' and the other ` No , do n't speak . ' 
And no sooner had the second voice said that than I cried out , and fainted . 
Of course , there was a fuss . 
I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin , ` It 's painful for me to say it , but I do n't wish to see you in my house again . ' 
So I turned him out . 
Ah ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , I know myself I did wrong . 
I was putting it on . 
I was n't angry with him at all , really ; but I suddenly fancied - that was what did it - that it would be such a fine scene ... . 
And yet , believe me , it was quite natural , for I really shed tears and cried for several days afterwards , and then suddenly , one afternoon , I forgot all about it . 
So it 's a fortnight since he 's been here , and I kept wondering whether he would come again . 
I wondered even yesterday , then suddenly last night came this Gossip . 
I read it and gasped . 
Who could have written it ? 
He must have written it . 
He went home , sat down , wrote it on the spot , sent it , and they put it in . 
It was a fortnight ago , you see . 
But , Alyosha , it 's awful how I keep talking and do n't say what I want to say . 
the words come of themselves ! '' 
`` It 's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day , '' Alyosha faltered . 
`` To be sure , to be sure ! 
You bring it all back to me . 
Listen , what is an aberration ? '' 
`` What aberration ? '' 
asked Alyosha , wondering . 
`` In the legal sense . 
An aberration in which everything is pardonable . 
Whatever you do , you will be acquitted at once . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I 'll tell you . 
This Katya ... Ah ! 
she is a charming , charming creature , only I never can make out who it is she is in love with . 
She was with me some time ago and I could n't get anything out of her . 
Especially as she wo n't talk to me except on the surface now . 
She is always talking about my health and nothing else , and she takes up such a tone with me , too . 
I simply said to myself , ` Well so be it . 
I do n't care ' ... Oh , yes . 
I was talking of aberration . 
This doctor has come . 
You know a doctor has come ? 
Of course , you know it - the one who discovers madmen . 
You wrote for him . 
No , it was n't you , but Katya . 
It 's all Katya 's doing . 
Well , you see , a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration . 
He may be conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration . 
And there 's no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration . 
They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed . 
It 's all the good effect of the reformed law courts . 
The doctor has been here and questioned me about that evening , about the gold mines . 
` How did he seem then ? ' 
he asked me . 
He must have been in a state of aberration . 
He came in shouting , ` Money , money , three thousand ! 
Give me three thousand ! ' 
and then went away and immediately did the murder . ' 
I do n't want to murder him , ' he said , and he suddenly went and murdered him . 
That 's why they 'll acquit him , because he struggled against it and yet he murdered him . '' 
`` But he did n't murder him , '' Alyosha interrupted rather sharply . 
He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience . 
`` Yes , I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him . '' 
`` Grigory ? '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Yes , yes ; it was Grigory . 
He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down , and then got up , saw the door open , went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch . '' 
`` But why , why ? '' 
`` Suffering from aberration . 
When he recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head , he was suffering from aberration : he went and committed the murder . 
As for his saying he did n't , he very likely does n't remember . 
Only , you know , it 'll be better , ever so much better , if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him . 
And that 's how it must have been , though I say it was Grigory . 
It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch , and that 's better , ever so much better ! 
Oh ! 
not better that a son should have killed his father , I do n't defend that . 
Children ought to honour their parents , and yet it would be better if it were he , as you 'd have nothing to cry over then , for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious , but did not know what he was doing . 
Let them acquit him - that 's so humane , and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are . 
I knew nothing about it , but they say they have been so a long time . 
And when I heard it yesterday , I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at once . 
And if he is acquitted , make him come straight from the law courts to dinner with me , and I 'll have a party of friends , and we 'll drink to the reformed law courts . 
I do n't believe he 'd be dangerous ; besides , I 'll invite a great many friends , so that he could always be led out if he did anything . 
And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in another town , for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best judges . 
And , besides , who is n't suffering from aberration nowadays ? 
- you , I , all of us , are in a state of aberration , and there are ever so many examples of it : a man sits singing a song , suddenly something annoys him , he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across , and no one blames him for it . 
I read that lately , and all the doctors confirm it . 
The doctors are always confirming ; they confirm , - anything . 
Why , my Lise is in a state of aberration . 
She made me cry again yesterday , and the day before , too , and to-day I suddenly realised that it 's all due to aberration . 
Oh , Lise grieves me so ! 
I believe she 's quite mad . 
Why did she send for you ? 
Did she send for you or did you come of yourself ? '' 
`` Yes , she sent for me , and I am just going to her . '' 
Alyosha got up resolutely . 
`` Oh , my dear , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , perhaps that 's what 's most important , '' Madame Hohlakov cried , suddenly bursting into tears . 
`` God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart , and it 's no matter her sending for you on the sly , without telling her mother . 
But forgive me , I ca n't trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch , though I still consider him the most chivalrous young man . 
But only fancy , he 's been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it ! '' 
`` How ? 
What ? 
When ? '' 
Alyosha was exceedingly surprised . 
He had not sat down again and listened standing . 
`` I will tell you ; that 's perhaps why I asked you to come , for I do n't know now why I did ask you to come . 
Well , Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me twice , since he came back from Moscow . 
First time he came as a friend to call on me , and the second time Katya was here and he came because he heard she was here . 
I did n't , of course , expect him to come often , knowing what a lot he has to do as it is , vous comprenez , cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa . 
-LRB- You know , this affair and your father 's terrible death . -RRB- 
But I suddenly heard he 'd been here again , not to see me but to see Lise . 
That 's six days ago now . 
He came , stayed five minutes , and went away . 
And I did n't hear of it till three days afterwards , from Glafira , so it was a great shock to me . 
I sent for Lise directly . 
She laughed . 
` He thought you were asleep , ' she said , ` and came in to me to ask after your health . ' 
Of course , that 's how it happened . 
But Lise , Lise , mercy on us , how she distresses me ! 
Would you believe it , one night , four days ago , just after you saw her last time , and had gone away , she suddenly had a fit , screaming , shrieking , hysterics ! 
Why is it I never have hysterics ? 
Then , next day another fit , and the same thing on the third , and yesterday too , and then yesterday that aberration . 
She suddenly screamed out , ' I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch . 
I insist on your never letting him come to the house again . ' 
I was struck dumb at these amazing words , and answered , ` On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent young man , a young man of such learning too , and so unfortunate ? ' 
- for all this business is a misfortune , is n't it ? ' 
She suddenly burst out laughing at my words , and so rudely , you know . 
Well , I was pleased ; I thought I had amused her and the fits would pass off , especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his strange visits without my knowledge , and meant to ask him for an explanation . 
But early this morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and , would you believe it , slapped her in the face . 
That 's monstrous ; I am always polite to my servants . 
And an hour later she was hugging Yulia 's feet and kissing them . 
She sent a message to me that she was n't coming to me at all , and would never come and see me again , and when I dragged myself down to her , she rushed to kiss me , crying , and as she kissed me , she pushed me out of the room without saying a word , so I could n't find out what was the matter . 
Now , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch , I rest all my hopes on you , and , of course , my whole life is in your hands . 
I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything from her , as you alone can , and come back and tell me - me , her mother , for you understand it will be the death of me , simply the death of me , if this goes on , or else I shall run away . 
I can stand no more . 
I have patience ; but I may lose patience , and then ... then something awful will happen . 
Ah , dear me ! 
At last , Pyotr Ilyitch ! '' 
cried Madame Hohlakov , beaming all over as she saw Perhotin enter the room . 
`` You are late , you are late ! 
Well , sit down , speak , put us out of suspense . 
What does the counsel say . 
Where are you off to , Alexey Fyodorovitch ? '' 
`` To Lise . '' 
`` Oh , yes . 
You wo n't forget , you wo n't forget what I asked you ? 
It 's a question of life and death ! 
`` Of course , I wo n't forget , if I can ... but I am so late , '' muttered Alyosha , beating a hasty retreat . 
`` No , be sure , be sure to come in ; do n't say ` If you can . ' 
I shall die if you do n't , '' Madame Hohlakov called after him , but Alyosha had already left the room . 
A Little Demon GOING in to Lise , he found her half reclining in the invalid-chair , in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk . 
She did not move to meet him , but her sharp , keen eyes were simply riveted on his face . 
There was a feverish look in her eyes , her face was pale and yellow . 
Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three days . 
She was positively thinner . 
She did not hold out her hand to him . 
He touched the thin , long fingers which lay motionless on her dress , then he sat down facing her , without a word . 
`` I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison , '' Lise said curtly , `` and mamma 's kept you there for hours ; she 's just been telling you about me and Yulia . '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` I 've been listening . 
Why do you stare at me ? 
I want to listen and I do listen , there 's no harm in that . 
I do n't apologise . '' 
`` You are upset about something ? '' 
`` On the contrary , I am very happy . 
I 've only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your wife . 
You are not fit to be a husband . 
If I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after you , you 'd take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back , too . 
If you were forty , you would still go on taking my love-letters for me . '' 
She suddenly laughed . 
`` There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you , '' Alyosha smiled to her . 
`` The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you . 
What 's more , I do n't want to feel ashamed with you , just with you . 
Alyosha , why is it I do n't respect you ? 
I am very fond of you , but I do n't respect you . 
If I respected you , I should n't talk to you without shame , should I ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't believe it . '' 
Lise laughed nervously again ; she spoke rapidly . 
`` I sent your brother , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , some sweets in prison . 
Alyosha , you know , you are quite pretty ! 
I shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you . '' 
`` Why did you send for me to-day , Lise ? '' 
`` I wanted to tell you of a longing I have . 
I should like some one to torture me , marry me and then torture me , deceive me and go away . 
I do n't want to be happy . '' 
`` You are in love with disorder ? '' 
`` Yes , I want disorder . 
I keep wanting to set fire to the house . 
I keep imagining how I 'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly ; it must be on the sly . 
They 'll try to put it out , but it 'll go on burning . 
And I shall know and say nothing . 
Ah , what silliness ! 
And how bored I am ! '' 
She waved her hand with a look of repulsion . 
`` It 's your luxurious life , '' said Alyosha , softly '' `` Is it better , then , to be poor ? '' 
`` Yes , it is better . '' 
`` That 's what your monk taught you . 
That 's not true . 
Let me be rich and all the rest poor , I 'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to anyone else . 
Ach , do n't speak , do n't say anything '' ; she shook her hand at him , though Alyosha had not opened his mouth . 
`` You 've told me all that before , I know it all by heart . 
It bores me . 
If I am ever poor , I shall murder somebody , and even if I am rich , I may murder someone , perhaps - why do nothing ! 
But do you know , I should like to reap , cut the rye ? 
I 'll marry you , and you shall become a peasant , a real peasant ; we 'll keep a colt , shall we ? 
Do you know Kalganov ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` He is always wandering about , dreaming . 
He says , ` Why live in real life ? 
It 's better to dream . 
One can dream the most delightful things , but real life is a bore . ' 
But he 'll be married soon for all that ; he 's been making love to me already . 
Can you spin tops ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , he 's just like a top : he wants to be wound up and set spinning and then to be lashed , lashed , lashed with a whip . 
If I marry him , I 'll keep him spinning all his life . 
You are not ashamed to be with me ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` You are awfully cross , because I do n't talk about holy things . 
I do n't want to be holy . 
What will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin ? 
You must know all about that . '' 
`` God will censure you . '' 
Alyosha was watching her steadily . 
`` That 's just what I should like . 
I would go up and they would censure me , and I would burst out laughing in their faces . 
I should dreadfully like to set fire to the house , Alyosha , to our house ; you still do n't believe me ? '' 
`` Why ? 
There are children of twelve years old , who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire , too . 
It 's a sort of disease . '' 
`` That 's not true , that 's not true ; there may be children , but that 's not what I mean . '' 
`` You take evil for good ; it 's a passing crisis ; it 's the result of your illness , perhaps . '' 
`` You do despise me , though ! 
It 's simply that I do n't want to do good , I want to do evil , and it has nothing to do with illness . '' 
`` Why do evil ? '' 
`` So that everything might be destroyed . 
Ah , how nice it would be if everything were destroyed ! 
You know , Alyosha , I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad , and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly everyone would find it out . 
Everyone will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all . 
That would be awfully nice . 
Why would it be so nice , Alyosha ? '' 
`` I do n't know . 
It 's a craving to destroy something good or , as you say , to set fire to something . 
It happens sometimes . '' 
`` I not only say it , I shall do it . '' 
`` I believe you . '' 
`` Ah , how I love you for saying you believe me . 
And you are not lying one little bit . 
But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to annoy you ? '' 
`` No , I do n't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it , too . '' 
`` There is a little . 
I never can tell lies to you , '' she declared , with a strange fire in her eyes . 
What struck Alyosha above everything was her earnestness . 
There was not a trace of humour or jesting in her face now , though , in old days , fun and gaiety never deserted her even at her most `` earnest '' moments . 
`` There are moments when people love crime , '' said Alyosha thoughtfully . 
`` Yes , yes ! 
You have uttered my thought ; they love crime , everyone loves crime , they love it always , not at some ` moments . ' 
You know , it 's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since . 
They all declare that they hate evil , but secretly they all love it . '' 
`` And are you still reading nasty books ? '' 
`` Yes , I am . 
Mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and I steal them . '' 
`` Are n't you ashamed to destroy yourself ? '' 
`` I want to destroy myself . 
There 's a boy here , who lay down between the railway lines when the train was passing . 
Lucky fellow ! 
Listen , your brother is being tried now for murdering his father and everyone loves his having killed his father . '' 
`` Loves his having killed his father ? '' 
`` Yes , loves it ; everyone loves it ! 
Everybody says it 's so awful , but secretly they simply love it . 
I for one love it . '' 
`` There is some truth in what you say about everyone , '' said Alyosha softly . 
`` Oh , what ideas you have ! '' 
Lise shrieked in delight . 
`` And you a monk , too ! 
You would n't believe how I respect you , Alyosha , for never telling lies . 
Oh , I must tell you a funny dream of mine . 
I sometimes dream of devils . 
It 's night ; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place , in all the corners , under the table , and they open the doors ; there 's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me . 
And they are just coming , just seizing me . 
But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back , though they do n't go away altogether , they stand at the doors and in the corners , waiting . 
And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud , and so I begin , and then they come crowding back to me , delighted , and seize me again and I cross myself again and they all draw back . 
It 's awful fun , it takes one 's breath away . '' 
`` I 've had the same dream , too , '' said Alyosha suddenly . 
`` Really ? '' 
cried Lise , surprised . 
`` I say , Alyosha , do n't laugh , that 's awfully important . 
Could two different people have the same dream ? '' 
`` It seems they can . '' 
`` Alyosha , I tell you , it 's awfully important , '' Lise went on , with really excessive amazement . 
`` It 's not the dream that 's important , but your having the same dream as me . 
You never lie to me , do n't lie now ; is it true ? 
You are not laughing ? '' 
`` It 's true . '' 
Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent . 
`` Alyosha , come and see me , come and see me more often , '' she said suddenly , in a supplicating voice . 
`` I 'll always come to see you , all my life , '' answered Alyosha firmly . 
`` You are the only person I can talk to , you know , '' Lise began again . 
`` I talk to no one but myself and you . 
Only you in the whole world . 
And to you more readily than to myself . 
And I am not a bit ashamed with you , not a bit . 
Alyosha , why am I not ashamed with you , not a bit ? 
Alyosha , is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` There 's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew , who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands , and then crucified him on the wall , hammered nails into him and crucified him , and afterwards , when he was tried , he said that the child died soon , within four hours . 
That was ` soon ' ! 
He said the child moaned , kept on moaning and he stood admiring it . 
That 's nice ! '' 
`` Nice ? '' 
`` Nice ; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him . 
He would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him eating pineapple compote . 
I am awfully fond of pineapple compote . 
Do you like it ? '' 
Alyosha looked at her in silence . 
Her pale , sallow face was suddenly contorted , her eyes burned . 
`` You know , when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night . 
I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned -LRB- a child of four years old understands , you know -RRB- , and all the while the thought of pineapple compote haunted me . 
In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person , begging him particularly to come and see me . 
He came and I suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple compote . 
All about it , all , and said that it was nice . 
He laughed and said it really was nice . 
Then he got up and went away . 
He was only here five minutes . 
Did he despise me ? 
Did he despise me ? 
Tell me , tell me , Alyosha , did he despise me or not ? '' 
She sat up on the couch , with flashing eyes . 
`` Tell me , '' Alyosha asked anxiously , `` did you send for that person ? '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` Did you send him a letter ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Simply to ask about that , about that child ? '' 
`` No , not about that at all . 
But when he came , I asked him about that at once . 
He answered , laughed , got up and went away . '' 
`` That person behaved honourably , '' Alyosha murmured . 
`` And did he despise me ? 
Did he laugh at me ? '' 
`` No , for perhaps he believes in the pineapple compote himself . 
He is very ill now , too , Lise . '' 
`` Yes , he does believe in it , '' said Lise , with flashing eyes . 
`` He does n't despise anyone , '' Alyosha went on . 
`` Only he does not believe anyone . 
If he does n't believe in people , of course , he does despise them . '' 
`` Then he despises me , me ? '' 
`` You , too . '' 
`` Good . '' 
Lise seemed to grind her teeth . 
`` When he went out laughing , I felt that it was nice to be despised . 
The child with fingers cut off is nice , and to be despised is nice ... '' And she laughed in Alyosha 's face , a feverish malicious laugh . 
`` Do you know , Alyosha , do you know , I should like - Alyosha , save me ! '' 
She suddenly jumped from the couch , rushed to him and seized him with both hands . 
`` Save me ! '' 
she almost groaned . 
`` Is there anyone in the world I could tell what I 've told you ? 
I 've told you the truth , the truth . 
I shall kill myself , because I loathe everything ! 
I do n't want to live , because I loathe everything ! 
I loathe everything , everything . 
Alyosha , why do n't you love me in the least ? '' 
she finished in a frenzy . 
`` But I do love you ! '' 
answered Alyosha warmly . 
`` And will you weep over me , will you ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Not because I wo n't be your wife , but simply weep for me ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Thank you ! 
It 's only your tears I want . 
Everyone else may punish me and trample me under foot , everyone , everyone , not excepting anyone . 
For I do n't love anyone . 
Do you hear , not anyone ! 
On the contrary , I hate him ! 
Go , Alyosha ; it 's time you went to your brother '' ; she tore herself away from him suddenly . 
`` How can I leave you like this ? '' 
said Alyosha , almost in alarm . 
`` Go to your brother , the prison will be shut ; go , here 's your hat . 
Give my love to Mitya , go , go ! '' 
And she almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door . 
He looked at her with pained surprise , when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right hand , a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed . 
He glanced at it and instantly read the address , `` To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov . '' 
He looked quickly at Lise . 
Her face had become almost menacing . 
`` Give it to him , you must give it to him ! '' 
she ordered him , trembling and beside herself . 
`` To-day , at once , or I 'll poison myself ! 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
And she slammed the door quickly . 
The bolt clicked . 
Alyosha put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs , without going back to Madame Hohlakov ; forgetting her , in fact . 
As soon as Alyosha had gone , Lise unbolted the door , opened it a little , put her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might , pinching her finger . 
Ten seconds after , releasing her finger , she walked softly , slowly to her chair , sat up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail . 
Her lips were quivering and she kept whispering rapidly to herself : `` I am a wretch , wretch , wretch , wretch ! '' 
A Hymn and a Secret IT was quite late -LRB- days are short in November -RRB- when Alyosha rang at the prison gate . 
It was beginning to get dusk . 
But Alyosha knew that he would be admitted without difficulty . 
Things were managed in our little town , as everywhere else . 
At first , of course , on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry , relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities . 
But later , though the formalities were not relaxed , exceptions were made for some , at least , of Mitya 's visitors . 
So much so , that sometimes the interviews with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically tete-a-tete . 
These exceptions , however , were few in number ; only Grushenka , Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this . 
But the captain of the police , Mihail Mihailovitch , was very favourably disposed to Grushenka . 
His abuse of her at Mokroe weighed on the old man 's conscience , and when he learned the whole story , he completely changed his view of her . 
And strange to say , though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt , yet after Mitya was once in prison , the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him . 
`` He was a man of good heart , perhaps , '' he thought , `` who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation . '' 
His first horror had been succeeded by pity . 
As for Alyosha , the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for a long time . 
Rakitin , who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner , was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the `` police captain 's young ladies , '' as he called them , and was always hanging about their house . 
He gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent , too , who , though scrupulous in the performance of his duties , was a kindhearted old man . 
Alyosha , again , had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent , who was fond of talking to him , generally on sacred subjects . 
He respected Ivan Fyodorovitch , and stood in awe of his opinion , though he was a great philosopher himself ; `` self-taught , '' of course . 
But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him . 
During the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels , and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend . 
He used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours together with him and with the monks . 
So even if Alyosha were late at the prison , he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made easy . 
Besides , everyone in the prison , down to the humblest warder , had grown used to Alyosha . 
The sentry , of course , did not trouble him so long as the authorities were satisfied . 
When Mitya was summoned from his cell , he always went downstairs , to the place set aside for interviews . 
As Alyosha entered the room he came upon Rakitin , who was just taking leave of Mitya . 
They were both talking loudly . 
Mitya was laughing heartily as he saw him out , while Rakitin seemed grumbling . 
Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha , especially of late . 
He scarcely spoke to him , and bowed to him stiffly . 
Seeing Alyosha enter now , he frowned and looked away , as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his big , warm , fur-trimmed overcoat . 
Then he began looking at once for his umbrella . 
`` I must mind not to forget my belongings , '' he muttered , simply to say something . 
`` Mind you do n't forget other people 's belongings , '' said Mitya , as a joke , and laughed at once at his own wit . 
Rakitin fired up instantly . 
`` You 'd better give that advice to your own family , who 've always been a slave-driving lot , and not to Rakitin , '' he cried , suddenly trembling with anger . 
`` What 's the matter ? 
I was joking , '' cried Mitya . 
`` Damn it all ! 
They are all like that . '' 
He turned to Alyosha , nodding towards Rakitin 's hurriedly retreating figure . 
`` He was sitting here , laughing and cheerful , and all at once he boils up like that . 
He did n't even nod to you . 
Have you broken with him completely ? 
Why are you so late ? 
I 've not been simply waiting , but thirsting for you the whole morning . 
But never mind . 
We 'll make up for it now . '' 
`` Why does he come here so often ? 
Surely you are not such great friends ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
He , too , nodded at the door through which Rakitin had disappeared . 
`` Great friends with Rakitin ? 
No , not as much as that . 
Is it likely - a pig like that ? 
He considers I am ... a blackguard . 
They ca n't understand a joke either , that 's the worst of such people . 
They never understand a joke , and their souls are dry , dry and flat ; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here . 
But he is a clever fellow , very clever . 
Well , Alexey , it 's all over with me now . '' 
He sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him . 
`` Yes , the trial 's to-morrow . 
Are you so hopeless , brother ? '' 
Alyosha said , with an apprehensive feeling . 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
said Mitya , looking at him rather uncertainly . 
`` Oh , you mean the trial ! 
Damn it all ! 
Till now we 've been talking of things that do n't matter , about this trial , but I have n't said a word to you about the chief thing . 
Yes , the trial is to-morrow ; but it was n't the trial I meant , when I said it was all over with me . 
Why do you look at me so critically ? '' 
`` What do you mean , Mitya ? '' 
`` Ideas , ideas , that 's all ! 
Ethics ! 
What is ethics ? '' 
`` Ethics ? '' 
asked Alyosha , wondering . 
`` Yes ; is it a science ? '' 
`` Yes , there is such a science ... but ... I confess I ca n't explain to you what sort of science it is . '' 
`` Rakitin knows . 
Rakitin knows a lot , damn him ! 
He 's not going to be a monk . 
He means to go to Petersburg . 
There he 'll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency . 
Who knows , he may be of use and make his own career , too . 
Ough ! 
they are first-rate , these people , at making a career ! 
Damn ethics , I am done for , Alexey , I am , you man of God ! 
I love you more than anyone . 
It makes my heart yearn to look at you . 
Who was Karl Bernard ? '' 
`` Karl Bernard ? '' 
Alyosha was surprised again . 
`` No , not Karl . 
Stay , I made a mistake . 
Claude Bernard . 
What was he ? 
Chemist or what ? '' 
`` He must be a savant , '' answered Alyosha ; `` but I confess I ca n't tell you much about him , either . 
I 've heard of him as a savant , but what sort I do n't know . '' 
`` Well , damn him , then ! 
I do n't know either , '' swore Mitya . 
`` A scoundrel of some sort , most likely . 
They are all scoundrels . 
And Rakitin will make his way . 
Rakitin will get on anywhere ; he is another Bernard . 
Ugh , these Bernards ! 
They are all over the place . '' 
`` But what is the matter ? '' 
Alyosha asked insistently . 
`` He wants to write an article about me , about my case , and so begin his literary career . 
That 's what he comes for ; he said so himself . 
He wants to prove some theory . 
He wants to say ` he could n't help murdering his father , he was corrupted by his environment , ' and so on . 
He explained it all to me . 
He is going to put in a tinge of Socialism , he says . 
But there , damn the fellow , he can put in a tinge if he likes , I do n't care . 
He ca n't bear Ivan , he hates him . 
He 's not fond of you , either . 
But I do n't turn him out , for he is a clever fellow . 
Awfully conceited , though . 
I said to him just now , ' The Karamazovs are not blackguards , but philosophers ; for all true Russians are philosophers , and though you 've studied , you are not a philosopher - you are a low fellow . ' 
He laughed , so maliciously . 
And I said to him , ` De ideabus non est disputandum . ' 
* Is n't that rather good ? 
I can set up for being a classic , you see ! '' 
Mitya laughed suddenly . 
* There 's no disputing ideas . 
`` Why is it all over with you ? 
You said so just now , '' Alyosha interposed . 
`` Why is it all over with me ? 
H 'm ! 
... The fact of it is ... if you take it as a whole , I am sorry to lose God - that 's why it is . '' 
`` What do you mean by ` sorry to lose God ' ? '' 
`` Imagine : inside , in the nerves , in the head - that is , these nerves are there in the brain ... -LRB- damn them ! -RRB- 
there are sort of little tails , the little tails of those nerves , and as soon as they begin quivering ... that is , you see , I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering , those little tails ... and when they quiver , then an image appears ... it does n't appear at once , but an instant , a second , passes ... and then something like a moment appears ; that is , not a moment - devil take the moment ! 
- but an image ; that is , an object , or an action , damn it ! 
That 's why I see and then think , because of those tails , not at all because I 've got a soul , and that I am some sort of image and likeness . 
All that is nonsense ! 
Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday , brother , and it simply bowled me over . 
It 's magnificent , Alyosha , this science ! 
A new man 's arising - that I understand ... . 
And yet I am sorry to lose God ! '' 
`` Well , that 's a good thing , anyway , '' said Alyosha . 
`` That I am sorry to lose God ? 
It 's chemistry , brother , chemistry ! 
There 's no help for it , your reverence , you must make way for chemistry . 
And Rakitin does dislike God . 
Ough ! 
does n't he dislike Him ! 
That 's the sore point with all of them . 
But they conceal it . 
They tell lies . 
They pretend . 
` Will you preach this in your reviews ? ' 
I asked him . 
` Oh , well , if I did it openly , they wo n't let it through , ` he said . 
He laughed . 
` But what will become of men then ? ' 
I asked him , ` without God and immortal life ? 
All things are lawful then , they can do what they like ? ' 
` Did n't you know ? ' 
he said laughing , ' a clever man can do what he likes , ' he said . ' 
A clever man knows his way about , but you 've put your foot in it , committing a murder , and now you are rotting in prison . ' 
He says that to my face ! 
A regular pig ! 
I used to kick such people out , but now I listen to them . 
He talks a lot of sense , too . 
Writes well . 
He began reading me an article last week . 
I copied out three lines of it . 
Wait a minute . 
Here it is . '' 
Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read : '' ` In order to determine this question , it is above all essential to put one 's personality in contradiction to one 's reality . ' 
Do you understand that ? '' 
`` No , I do n't , '' said Alyosha . 
He looked at Mitya and listened to him with curiosity . 
`` I do n't understand either . 
It 's dark and obscure , but intellectual . 
` Everyone writes like that now , ' he says , ` it 's the effect of their environment . ' 
They are afraid of the environment . 
He writes poetry , too , the rascal . 
He 's written in honour of Madame Hohlakov 's foot . 
Ha ha ha ! '' 
`` I 've heard about it , '' said Alyosha . 
`` Have you ? 
And have you heard the poem ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I 've got it . 
Here it is . 
I 'll read it to you . 
You do n't know - I have n't told you - there 's quite a story about it . 
He 's a rascal ! 
Three weeks ago he began to tease me . 
` You 've got yourself into a mess , like a fool , for the sake of three thousand , but I 'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand . 
I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg . ' 
And he told me he was courting Madame Hohlakov . 
She had n't much brains in her youth , and now at forty she has lost what she had . 
` But she 's awfully sentimental , ' he says ; ` that 's how I shall get hold of her . 
When I marry her , I shall take her to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper . ' 
And his mouth was simply watering , the beast , not for the widow , but for the hundred and fifty thousand . 
And he made me believe it . 
He came to see me every day . 
` She is coming round , ' he declared . 
He was beaming with delight . 
And then , all of a sudden , he was turned out of the house . 
Perhotin 's carrying everything before him , bravo ! 
I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him out of the house . 
And he had written this doggerel . 
` It 's the first time I 've soiled my hands with writing poetry , ' he said . 
` It 's to win her heart , so it 's in a good cause . 
When I get hold of the silly woman 's fortune , I can be of great social utility . ' 
They have this social justification for every nasty thing they do ! 
` Anyway it 's better than your Pushkin 's poetry , ' he said , ` for I 've managed to advocate enlightenment even in that . ' 
I understand what he means about Pushkin , I quite see that , if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about women 's feet . 
But was n't Rakitin stuck up about his doggerel ! 
The vanity of these fellows ! 
` On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my affections ' - he thought of that for a title . 
He 's a waggish fellow . 
A captivating little foot , Though swollen and red and tender ! 
The doctors come and plasters put , But still they can not mend her . 
Yet , 't is not for her foot I dread - A theme for Pushkin 's muse more fit - It 's not her foot , it is her head : I tremble for her loss of wit ! 
For as her foot swells , strange to say , Her intellect is on the wane - Oh , for some remedy I pray That may restore both foot and brain ! 
He is a pig , a regular pig , but he 's very arch , the rascal ! 
And he really has put in a progressive idea . 
And was n't he angry when she kicked him out ! 
He was gnashing his teeth ! '' 
`` He 's taken his revenge already , '' said Alyosha . 
`` He 's written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov . '' 
And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in Gossip . 
`` That 's his doing , that 's his doing ! '' 
Mitya assented , frowning . 
`` That 's him ! 
These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been written about Grushenka , for instance ... . 
And about Katya , too ... . 
H 'm ! 
He walked across the room with a harassed air . 
`` Brother , I can not stay long , '' Alyosha said , after a pause . 
`` To-morrow will be a great and awful day for you , the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you , you walk about here , talking of I do n't know what ... '' `` No , do n't be amazed at me , '' Mitya broke in warmly . 
`` Am I to talk of that stinking dog ? 
Of the murderer ? 
We 've talked enough of him . 
I do n't want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta ! 
God will kill him , you will see . 
Hush ! '' 
He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him . 
His eyes glowed . 
`` Rakitin would n't understand it , '' he began in a sort of exaltation ; `` but you , you 'll understand it all . 
That 's why I was thirsting for you . 
You see , there 's so much I 've been wanting to tell you for ever so long , here , within these peeling walls , but I have n't said a word about what matters most ; the moment never seems to have come . 
Now I can wait no longer . 
I must pour out my heart to you . 
Brother , these last two months I 've found in myself a new man . 
A new man has risen up in me . 
He was hidden in me , but would never have come to the surface , if it had n't been for this blow from heaven . 
I am afraid ! 
And what do I care if I spend twenty years in the mines , breaking ore with a hammer ? 
I am not a bit afraid of that - it 's something else I am afraid of now : that that new man may leave me . 
Even there , in the mines , underground , I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side , and I may make friends with him , for even there one may live and love and suffer . 
One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict , one may wait upon him for years , and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul , a feeling , suffering creature ; one may bring forth an angel , create a hero ! 
There are so many of them , hundreds of them , and we are all to blame for them . 
Why was it I dreamed of that ` babe ' at such a moment ? 
` Why is the babe so poor ? ' 
That was a sign to me at that moment . 
It 's for the babe I 'm going . 
Because we are all responsible for all . 
For all the ` babes , ' for there are big children as well as little children All are ` babes . ' 
I go for all , because someone must go for all . 
I did n't kill father , but I 've got to go . 
I accept it . 
It 's all come to me here , here , within these peeling walls . 
There are numbers of them there , hundreds of them underground , with hammers in their hands . 
Oh , yes , we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom , but then , in our great sorrow , we shall rise again to joy , without which man can not live nor God exist , for God gives joy : it 's His privilege - a grand one . 
Ah , man should be dissolved in prayer ! 
What should I be underground there without God ? 
Rakitin 's laughing ! 
If they drive God from the earth , we shall shelter Him underground . 
One can not exist in prison without God ; it 's even more impossible than out of prison . 
And then we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God , with Whom is joy . 
Hail to God and His joy ! 
I love Him ! '' 
Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech . 
He turned pale , his lips quivered , and tears rolled down his cheeks . 
`` Yes , life is full , there is life even underground , '' he began again . 
`` You would n't believe , Alexey , how I want to live now , what a thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling walls . 
Rakitin does n't understand that ; all he cares about is building a house and letting flats . 
But I 've been longing for you . 
And what is suffering ? 
I am not afraid of it , even if it were beyond reckoning . 
I am not afraid of it now . 
I was afraid of it before . 
Do you know , perhaps I wo n't answer at the trial at all ... . 
And I seem to have such strength in me now , that I think I could stand anything , any suffering , only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment , ' I exist . ' 
In thousands of agonies - I exist . 
I 'm tormented on the rack - but I exist ! 
Though I sit alone on a pillar - I exist ! 
I see the sun , and if I do n't see the sun , I know it 's there . 
And there 's a whole life in that , in knowing that the sun is there . 
Alyosha , my angel , all these philosophies are the death of me . 
Damn them ! 
Brother Ivan - '' `` What of brother Ivan ? '' 
interrupted Alyosha , but Mitya did not hear . 
`` You see , I never had any of these doubts before , but it was all hidden away in me . 
It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were surging up in me , that I used to drink and fight and rage . 
It was to stifle them in myself , to still them , to smother them . 
Ivan is not Rakitin , there is an idea in him . 
Ivan is a sphinx and is silent ; he is always silent . 
It 's God that 's worrying me . 
That 's the only thing that 's worrying me . 
What if He does n't exist ? 
What if Rakitin 's right - that it 's an idea made up by men ? 
Then if He does n't exist , man is the chief of the earth , of the universe . 
Magnificent ! 
Only how is he going to be good without God ? 
That 's the question . 
I always come back to that . 
For whom is man going to love then ? 
To whom will he be thankful ? 
To whom will he sing the hymn ? 
Rakitin laughs . 
Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God . 
Well , only a snivelling idiot can maintain that . 
I ca n't understand it . 
Life 's easy for Rakitin . 
` You 'd better think about the extension of civic rights , or even of keeping down the price of meat . 
You will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that , than by philosophy . ' 
I answered him , ` Well , but you , without a God , are more likely to raise the price of meat , if it suits you , and make a rouble on every copeck . ' 
He lost his temper . 
But after all , what is goodness ? 
Answer me that , Alexey . 
Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman , so it 's a relative thing . 
Or is n't it ? 
Is it not relative ? 
A treacherous question ! 
You wo n't laugh if I tell you it 's kept me awake two nights . 
I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it . 
Vanity ! 
Ivan has no God . 
He has an idea . 
It 's beyond me . 
But he is silent . 
I believe he is a Freemason . 
I asked him , but he is silent . 
I wanted to drink from the springs of his soul - he was silent . 
But once he did drop a word . '' 
`` What did he say ? '' 
Alyosha took it up quickly . 
`` I said to him , ` Then everything is lawful , if it is so ? ' 
He frowned . 
` Fyodor Pavlovitch , our papa , ' he said , ` was a pig , but his ideas were right enough . ' 
That was what he dropped . 
That was all he said . 
That was going one better than Rakitin . '' 
`` Yes , '' Alyosha assented bitterly . 
`` When was he with you ? '' 
`` Of that later ; now I must speak of something else . 
I have said nothing about Ivan to you before . 
I put it off to the last . 
When my business here is over and the verdict has been given , then I 'll tell you something . 
I 'll tell you everything . 
We 've something tremendous on hand ... . 
And you shall be my judge in it . 
But do n't begin about that now ; be silent . 
You talk of to-morrow , of the trial ; but , would you believe it , I know nothing about it . '' 
`` Have you talked to the counsel ? '' 
`` What 's the use of the counsel ? 
I told him all about it . 
He 's a soft , city-bred rogue - a Bernard ! 
But he does n't believe me - not a bit of it . 
Only imagine , he believes I did it . 
I see it . 
` In that case , ' I asked him , ` why have you come to defend me ? ' 
Hang them all ! 
They 've got a doctor down , too , want to prove I 'm mad . 
I wo n't have that ! 
Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her ` duty ' to the end , whatever the strain ! '' 
Mitya smiled bitterly . 
`` The cat ! 
Hard-hearted creature ! 
She knows that I said of her at Mokroe that she was a woman of ` great wrath . ' 
They repeated it . 
Yes , the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea . 
Grigory sticks to his point . 
Grigory 's honest , but a fool . 
Many people are honest because they are fools : that 's Rakitin 's idea . 
Grigory 's my enemy . 
And there are some people who are better as foes than friends . 
I mean Katerina Ivanovna . 
I am afraid , oh , I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand . 
She 'll pay it back to the last farthing . 
I do n't want her sacrifice ; they 'll put me to shame at the trial . 
I wonder how I can stand it . 
Go to her , Alyosha , ask her not to speak of that in the court , ca n't you ? 
But damn it all , it does n't matter ! 
I shall get through somehow . 
I do n't pity her . 
It 's her own doing . 
She deserves what she gets . 
I shall have my own story to tell , Alexey . '' 
He smiled bitterly again . 
`` Only ... only Grusha , Grusha ! 
Good Lord ! 
Why should she have such suffering to bear ? '' 
he exclaimed suddenly , with tears . 
`` Grusha 's killing me ; the thought of her 's killing me , killing me . 
She was with me just now ... '' `` She told me she was very much grieved by you to-day . '' 
`` I know . 
Confound my temper ! 
It was jealousy . 
I was sorry , I kissed her as she was going . 
I did n't ask her forgiveness . '' 
`` Why did n't you ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully . 
`` God preserve you , my dear boy , from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love . 
From one you love especially , however greatly you may have been in fault . 
For a woman - devil only knows what to make of a woman ! 
I know something about them , anyway . 
But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman . 
Say , ' I am sorry , forgive me , ' and a shower of reproaches will follow ! 
Nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly , she 'll humble you to the dust , bring forward things that have never happened , recall everything , forget nothing , add something of her own , and only then forgive you . 
And even the best , the best of them do it . 
She 'll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head . 
They are ready to flay you alive , I tell you , every one of them , all these angels without whom we can not live ! 
I tell you plainly and openly , dear boy , every decent man ought to be under some woman 's thumb . 
That 's my conviction - not conviction , but feeling . 
A man ought to be magnanimous , and it 's no disgrace to a man ! 
No disgrace to a hero , not even a Caesar ! 
But do n't ever beg her pardon all the same for anything . 
Remember that rule given you by your brother Mitya , who 's come to ruin through women . 
No , I 'd better make it up to Grusha somehow , without begging pardon . 
I worship her , Alexey , worship her . 
Only she does n't see it . 
No , she still thinks I do n't love her enough . 
And she tortures me , tortures me with her love . 
The past was nothing ! 
In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me , but now I 've taken all her soul into my soul and through her I 've become a man myself . 
Will they marry us ? 
If they do n't , I shall die of jealousy . 
I imagine something every day ... . 
What did she say to you about me ? '' 
Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day . 
Mitya listened , made him repeat things , and seemed pleased . 
`` Then she is not angry at my being jealous ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` She is a regular woman ! 
` I 've a fierce heart myself ! ' 
Ah , I love such fierce hearts , though I ca n't bear anyone 's being jealous of me . 
I ca n't endure it . 
We shall fight . 
But I shall love her , I shall love her infinitely . 
Will they marry us ? 
Do they let convicts marry ? 
That 's the question . 
And without her I ca n't exist ... '' Mitya walked frowning across the room . 
It was almost dark . 
He suddenly seemed terribly worried . 
`` So there 's a secret , she says , a secret ? 
We have got up a plot against her , and Katya is mixed up in it , she thinks . 
No , my good Grushenka , that 's not it . 
You are very wide of the mark , in your foolish feminine way . 
Alyosha , darling , well , here goes ! 
I 'll tell you our secret ! '' 
He looked round , went close up quickly to Alyosha , who was standing before him , and whispered to him with an air of mystery , though in reality no one could hear them : the old warder was dozing in the corner , and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard . 
`` I will tell you all our secret , '' Mitya whispered hurriedly . 
`` I meant to tell you later , for how could I decide on anything without you ? 
You are everything to me . 
Though I say that Ivan is superior to us , you are my angel . 
It 's your decision will decide it . 
Perhaps it 's you that is superior and not Ivan . 
You see , it 's a question of conscience , question of the higher conscience - the secret is so important that I ca n't settle it myself , and I 've put it off till I could speak to you . 
But anyway it 's too early to decide now , for we must wait for the verdict . 
As soon as the verdict is given , you shall decide my fate . 
Do n't decide it now . 
I 'll tell you now . 
You listen , but do n't decide . 
Stand and keep quiet . 
I wo n't tell you everything . 
I 'll only tell you the idea , without details , and you keep quiet . 
Not a question , not a movement . 
You agree ? 
But , goodness , what shall I do with your eyes ? 
I 'm afraid your eyes will tell me your decision , even if you do n't speak . 
Oo ! 
I 'm afraid ! 
Alyosha , listen ! 
Ivan suggests my escaping . 
I wo n't tell you the details : it 's all been thought out : it can all be arranged . 
Hush , do n't decide . 
I should go to America with Grusha . 
You know I ca n't live without Grusha ! 
What if they wo n't let her follow me to Siberia ? 
Do they let convicts get married ? 
Ivan thinks not . 
And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer ? 
I should only smash my skull with the hammer ! 
But , on the other hand , my conscience ? 
I should have run away from suffering . 
A sign has come , I reject the sign . 
I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it . 
Ivan says that in America , ` with the goodwill , ' I can be of more use than underground . 
But what becomes of our hymn from underground ? 
What 's America ? 
America is vanity again ! 
And there 's a lot of swindling in America , too , I expect . 
I should have run away from crucifixion ! 
I tell you , you know , Alexey , because you are the only person who can understand this . 
There 's no one else . 
It 's folly , madness to others , all I 've told you of the hymn . 
They 'll say I 'm out of my mind or a fool . 
I am not out of my mind and I am not a fool . 
Ivan understands about the hymn , too . 
He understands , only he does n't answer - he does n't speak . 
He does n't believe in the hymn . 
Do n't speak , do n't speak . 
I see how you look ! 
You have already decided . 
Do n't decide , spare me ! 
I ca n't live without Grusha . 
Wait till after the trial ! '' 
Mitya ended beside himself . 
He held Alyosha with both hands on his shoulders , and his yearning , feverish eyes were fixed on his brother 's . 
`` They do n't let convicts marry , do they ? '' 
he repeated for the third time in a supplicating voice . 
Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved . 
`` Tell me one thing , '' he said . 
`` Is Ivan very keen on it , and whose idea was it ? '' 
`` His , his , and he is very keen on it . 
He did n't come to see me at first , then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away . 
He is awfully keen on it . 
He does n't ask me , but orders me to escape . 
He does n't doubt of my obeying him , though I showed him all my heart as I have to you , and told him about the hymn , too . 
He told me he 'd arrange it ; he 's found out about everything . 
But of that later . 
He 's simply set on it . 
It 's all a matter of money : he 'll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for America . 
And he says we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand . '' 
`` And he told you on no account to tell me ? '' 
Alyosha asked again . 
`` To tell no one , and especially not you ; on no account to tell you . 
He is afraid , no doubt , that you 'll stand before me as my conscience . 
Do n't tell him I told you . 
Do n't tell him , for anything . '' 
`` You are right , '' Alyosha pronounced ; `` it 's impossible to decide anything before the trial is over . 
After the trial you 'll decide of yourself . 
Then you 'll find that new man in yourself and he will decide . '' 
`` A new man , or a Bernard who 'll decide a la Bernard , for I believe I 'm a contemptible Bernard myself , '' said Mitya , with a bitter grin . 
`` But , brother , have you no hope then of being acquitted ? '' 
Mitya shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head . 
`` Alyosha , darling , it 's time you were going , '' he said , with a sudden haste . 
`` There 's the superintendent shouting in the yard . 
He 'll be here directly . 
We are late ; it 's irregular . 
Embrace me quickly . 
Kiss me ! 
Sign me with the cross , darling , for the cross I have to bear to-morrow . '' 
They embraced and kissed . 
`` Ivan , '' said Mitya suddenly , `` suggests my escaping ; but , of course , he believes I did it . '' 
A mournful smile came on to his lips . 
`` Have you asked him whether he believes it ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` No , I have n't . 
I wanted to , but I could n't . 
I had n't the courage . 
But I saw it from his eyes . 
Well , good-bye ! '' 
Once more they kissed hurriedly , and Alyosha was just going out , when Mitya suddenly called him back . 
`` Stand facing me ! 
That 's right ! '' 
And again he seized Alyosha , putting both hands on his shoulders . 
His face became suddenly quite pale , so that it was dreadfully apparent , even through the gathering darkness . 
His lips twitched , his eyes fastened upon Alyosha . 
`` Alyosha , tell me the whole truth , as you would before God . 
Do you believe I did it ? 
Do you , do you in yourself , believe it ? 
The whole truth , do n't lie ! '' 
he cried desperately . 
Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha , and he felt something like a stab at his heart . 
`` Hush ! 
What do you mean ? '' 
he faltered helplessly . 
`` The whole truth , the whole , do n't lie ! '' 
repeated Mitya . 
`` I 've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer ! '' 
broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha 's breast , and he raised his right hand in the air , as though calling God to witness his words . 
Mitya 's whole face was lighted up with bliss . 
`` Thank you ! '' 
he articulated slowly , as though letting a sigh escape him after fainting . 
`` Now you have given me new life . 
Would you believe it , till this moment I 've been afraid to ask you , you , even you . 
Well , go ! 
You 've given me strength for to-morrow . 
God bless you ! 
Come , go along ! 
Love Ivan ! '' 
was Mitya 's last word . 
Alyosha went out in tears . 
Such distrustfulness in Mitya , such lack of confidence even to him , to Alyosha - all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother . 
Intense , infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly . 
There was a poignant ache in his torn heart . 
`` Love Ivan '' - he suddenly recalled Mitya 's words . 
And he was going to Ivan . 
He badly wanted to see Ivan all day . 
He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya , and more than ever now . 
Not You , Not You ! 
ON the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living . 
There was light in the windows . 
He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in . 
He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week . 
But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her , especially on the eve of the terrible day . 
Ringing , and mounting the staircase , which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern , he saw a man coming down , and as they met , he recognised him as his brother . 
So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna . 
`` Ah , it 's only you , '' said Ivan dryly . 
`` Well , good-bye ! 
You are going to her ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I do n't advise you to ; she 's upset and you 'll upset her more . '' 
A door was instantly flung open above , and a voice cried suddenly : `` No , no ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , have you come from him ? '' 
`` Yes , I have been with him . '' 
`` Has he sent me any message ? 
Come up , Alyosha , and you , Ivan Fyodorovitch , you must come back , you must . 
Do you hear ? '' 
There was such a peremptory note in Katya 's voice that Ivan , after a moment 's hesitation , made up his mind to go back with Alyosha . 
`` She was listening , '' he murmured angrily to himself , but Alyosha heard it . 
`` Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on , '' said Ivan , going into the drawing-room . 
`` I wo n't sit down . 
I wo n't stay more than a minute . '' 
`` Sit down , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' said Katerina Ivanovna , though she remained standing . 
She had changed very little during this time , but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes . 
Alyosha remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment . 
`` What did he ask you to tell me ? '' 
`` Only one thing , '' said Alyosha , looking her straight in the face , `` that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what '' -LRB- he was a little confused -RRB- '' ... passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that I bowed down to the ground for that money ! '' 
She broke into a bitter laugh . 
`` Why , is he afraid for me or for himself ? 
He asks me to spare - whom ? 
Him or myself ? 
Tell me , Alexey Fyodorovitch ! '' 
Alyosha watched her intently , trying to understand her . 
`` Both yourself and him , '' he answered softly . 
`` I am glad to hear it , '' she snapped out maliciously , and she suddenly blushed . 
`` You do n't know me yet , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' she said menacingly . 
`` And I do n't know myself yet . 
Perhaps you 'll want to trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow . '' 
`` You will give your evidence honourably , '' said Alyosha ; `` that 's all that 's wanted . '' 
`` Women are often dishonourable , '' she snarled . 
`` Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no , he is still a human being to me ! 
But did he do it ? 
Is he the murderer ? '' 
she cried , all of a sudden , hysterically , turning quickly to Ivan . 
Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before , perhaps only a moment before he came in , and not for the first time , but for the hundredth , and that they had ended by quarrelling . 
`` I 've been to see Smerdyakov ... . 
It was you , you who persuaded me that he murdered his father . 
It 's only you I believed '' she continued , still addressing Ivan . 
He gave her a sort of strained smile . 
Alyosha started at her tone . 
He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them . 
`` Well , that 's enough , anyway , '' Ivan cut short the conversation . 
`` I am going . 
I 'll come to-morrow . '' 
And turning at once , he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs . 
With an imperious gesture , Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands . 
`` Follow him ! 
Overtake him ! 
Do n't leave him alone for a minute ! '' 
she said , in a hurried whisper . 
`` He 's mad ! 
Do n't you know that he 's mad ? 
He is in a fever , nervous fever . 
The doctor told me so . 
Go , run after him ... '' Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan , who was not fifty paces ahead of him . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
He turned quickly on Alyosha , seeing that he was running after him . 
`` She told you to catch me up , because I 'm mad . 
I know it all by heart , '' he added irritably . 
`` She is mistaken , of course ; but she is right that you are ill , '' said Alyosha . 
`` I was looking at your face just now . 
You look very ill , Ivan . '' 
Ivan walked on without stopping . 
Alyosha followed him . 
`` And do you know , Alexey Fyodorovitch , how people do go out of their minds ? '' 
Ivan asked in a a voice suddenly quiet , without a trace of irritation , with a note of the simplest curiosity . 
`` No , I do n't . 
I suppose there are all kinds of insanity . '' 
`` And can one observe that one 's going mad oneself ? '' 
`` I imagine one ca n't see oneself clearly in such circumstances , '' Alyosha answered with surprise . 
Ivan paused for half a minute . 
`` If you want to talk to me , please change the subject , '' he said suddenly . 
`` Oh , while I think of it , I have a letter for you , '' said Alyosha timidly , and he took Lise 's note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan . 
They were just under a lamp-post . 
Ivan recognised the handwriting at once . 
`` Ah , from that little demon ! '' 
he laughed maliciously , and , without opening the envelope , he tore it into bits and threw it in the air . 
The bits were scattered by the wind . 
`` She 's not sixteen yet , I believe , and already offering herself , '' he said contemptuously , striding along the street again . 
`` How do you mean , offering herself ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` As wanton women offer themselves , to be sure . '' 
`` How can you , Ivan , how can you ? '' 
Alyosha cried warmly , in a grieved voice . 
`` She is a child ; you are insulting a child ! 
She is ill ; she is very ill , too . 
She is on the verge of insanity , too , perhaps ... . 
I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would save her . '' 
`` You 'll hear nothing from me . 
If she is a child , I am not her nurse . 
Be quiet , Alexey . 
Do n't go on about her . 
I am not even thinking about it . '' 
They were silent again for a moment . 
`` She will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her how to act to-morrow at the trial , '' he said sharply and angrily again . 
`` You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Whether she 's to save Mitya or ruin him . 
She 'll pray for light from above . 
She ca n't make up her mind for herself , you see . 
She has not had time to decide yet . 
She takes me for her nurse , too . 
She wants me to sing lullabies to her . '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna loves you , brother , '' said Alyosha sadly . 
`` Perhaps ; but I am not very keen on her . '' 
`` She is suffering . 
Why do you ... sometimes say things to her that give her hope ? '' 
Alyosha went on , with timid reproach . 
`` I know that you 've given her hope . 
Forgive me for speaking to you like this , '' he added . 
`` I ca n't behave to her as I ought - break off altogether and tell her so straight out , '' said Ivan , irritably . 
`` I must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer . 
If I break off with her now , she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial , for she hates him and knows she hates him . 
It 's all a lie - lie upon lie ! 
As long as I do n't break off with her , she goes on hoping , and she wo n't ruin that monster , knowing how I want to get him out of trouble . 
If only that damned verdict would come ! '' 
The words `` murderer '' and `` monster '' echoed painfully in Alyosha 's heart . 
`` But how can she ruin Mitya ? '' 
he asked , pondering on Ivan 's words . 
`` What evidence can she give that would ruin Mitya ? '' 
`` You do n't know that yet . 
She 's got a document in her hands , in Mitya 's own writing , that proves conclusively that he did murder Fyodor Pavlovitch . '' 
`` That 's impossible ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` Why is it impossible ? 
I 've read it myself . '' 
`` There ca n't be such a document ! '' 
Alyosha repeated warmly . 
`` There ca n't be , because he 's not the murderer . 
It 's not he murdered father , not he ! '' 
Ivan suddenly stopped . 
`` Who is the murderer then , according to you ? '' 
he asked , with apparent coldness . 
There was even a supercilious note in his voice . 
`` You know who , '' Alyosha pronounced in a low , penetrating voice . 
`` Who ? 
You mean the myth about that crazy idiot , the epileptic , Smerdyakov ? '' 
Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over . 
`` You know who , '' broke helplessly from him . 
He could scarcely breathe . 
`` Who ? 
Who ? '' 
Ivan cried almost fiercely . 
All his restraint suddenly vanished . 
`` I only know one thing , '' Alyosha went on , still almost in a whisper , `` it was n't you killed father . '' '' 
` Not you ' ! 
What do you mean by ` not you ' ? '' 
Ivan was thunderstruck . 
`` It was not you killed father , not you ! 
Alyosha repeated firmly . 
The silence lasted for half a minute . 
`` I know I did n't . 
Are you raving ? '' 
said Ivan , with a pale , distorted smile . 
His eyes were riveted on Alyosha . 
They were standing again under a lamp-post . 
`` No , Ivan . 
You 've told yourself several times that you are the murderer . '' 
`` When did I say so ? 
I was in Moscow ... . 
When have I said so ? '' 
Ivan faltered helplessly . 
`` You 've said so to yourself many times , when you 've been alone during these two dreadful months , '' Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before . 
Yet he was speaking now , as it were , not of himself , not of his own will , but obeying some irresistible command . 
`` You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else . 
But you did n't do it : you are mistaken : you are not the murderer . 
Do you hear ? 
It was not you ! 
God has sent me to tell you so . '' 
They were both silent . 
The silence lasted a whole long minute . 
They were both standing still , gazing into each other 's eyes . 
They were both pale . 
Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over , and clutched Alyosha 's shoulder . 
`` You 've been in my room ! '' 
he whispered hoarsely . 
`` You 've been there at night , when he came ... . 
Confess ... have you seen him , have you seen him ? '' 
`` Whom do you mean - Mitya ? '' 
Alyosha asked , bewildered . 
`` Not him , damn the monster ! '' 
Ivan shouted , in a frenzy , `` Do you know that he visits me ? 
How did you find out ? 
Speak ! '' 
`` Who is he ? 
I do n't know whom you are talking about , '' Alyosha faltered , beginning to be alarmed . 
`` Yes , you do know . 
or how could you - ? 
It 's impossible that you do n't know . '' 
Suddenly he seemed to check himself . 
He stood still and seemed to reflect . 
A strange grin contorted his lips . 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha began again , in a shaking voice , `` I have said this to you , because you 'll believe my word , I know that . 
I tell you once and for all , it 's not you . 
You hear , once for all ! 
God has put it into my heart to say this to you , even though it may make you hate me from this hour . '' 
But by now Ivan had apparently regained his self-control . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' he said , with a cold smile , `` I ca n't endure prophets and epileptics - messengers from God especially - and you know that only too well . 
I break off all relations with you from this moment and probably for ever . 
I beg you to leave me at this turning . 
It 's the way to your lodgings , too . 
You 'd better be particularly careful not to come to me to-day ! 
Do you hear ? '' 
He turned and walked on with a firm step , not looking back . 
`` Brother , '' Alyosha called after him , `` if anything happens to you to-day , turn to me before anyone ! '' 
But Ivan made no reply . 
Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross roads , till Ivan had vanished into the darkness . 
Then he turned and walked slowly homewards . 
Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings ; neither of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's empty house . 
Alyosha had a furnished room in the house of some working people . 
Ivan lived some distance from him . 
He had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady , the widow of an official . 
But his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning . 
Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late , and very fond of being alone . 
He did everything for himself in the one room he lived in , and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode . 
He reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell , when he suddenly stopped . 
He felt that he was trembling all over with anger . 
Suddenly he let go of the bell , turned back with a curse , and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction . 
He walked a mile and a half to a tiny , slanting , wooden house , almost a hut , where Marya Kondratyevna , the neighbour who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar , was now lodging . 
She had sold their little house , and was now living here with her mother . 
Smerdyakov , who was ill - almost dying-had been with them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch 's death . 
It was to him Ivan was going now , drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting . 
The First Interview with Smerdyakov THIS was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his return from Moscow . 
The first time he had seen him and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival , then he had visited him once more , a fortnight later . 
But his visits had ended with that second one , so that it was now over a month since he had seen him . 
And he had scarcely heard anything of him . 
Ivan had only returned five days after his father 's death , so that he was not present at the funeral , which took place the day before he came back . 
The cause of his delay was that Alyosha , not knowing his Moscow address , had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him , and she , not knowing his address either , telegraphed to her sister and aunt , reckoning on Ivan 's going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow . 
But he did not go to them till four days after his arrival . 
When he got the telegram , he had , of course , set off post-haste to our town . 
The first to meet him was Alyosha , and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that , in opposition to the general opinion of the town , he refused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya , and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer . 
Later on , after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor , and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest , he was still more surprised at Alyosha , and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya , of whom Alyosha , as Ivan knew , was very fond . 
By the way , let us say a word or two of Ivan 's feeling to his brother Dmitri . 
He positively disliked him ; at most , felt sometimes a compassion for him , and even that was mixed with great contempt , almost repugnance . 
Mitya 's whole personality , even his appearance , was extremely unattractive to him . 
Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna 's love for his brother . 
Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival , and that interview , far from shaking Ivan 's belief in his guilt , positively strengthened it . 
He found his brother agitated , nervously excited . 
Mitya had been talkative , but very absent-minded and incoherent . 
He used violent language , accused Smerdyakov , and was fearfully muddled . 
He talked principally about the three thousand roubles , which he said had been `` stolen '' from him by his father . 
`` The money was mine , it was my money , '' Mitya kept repeating . 
`` Even if I had stolen it , I should have had the right . '' 
He hardly contested the evidence against him , and if he tried to turn a fact to his advantage , it was in an absurd and incoherent way . 
He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or anyone else . 
Quite the contrary , he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him ; he was continually firing up and abusing everyone . 
He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory 's evidence about the open door , and declared that it was `` the devil that opened it . '' 
But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact . 
He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview , telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that `` everything was lawful , '' to suspect and question him . 
Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion . 
Immediately after that interview with Mitya , Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov . 
In the railway train on his way from Moscow , he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away . 
Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious . 
when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing , for the time , of that conversation . 
He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov , who was at that time in the hospital . 
Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky , the doctor he met in the hospital , confidently asserted in reply to Ivan 's persistent questions , that Smerdyakov 's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine , and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe . 
They gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one , the fits persisting and recurring several times , so that the patient 's life was positively in danger , and it was only now , after they had applied remedies , that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive . 
`` Though it might well be , '' added Doctor Herzenstube , `` that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period , if not permanently . '' 
On Ivan 's asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad , they told him that this was not yet the case , in the full sense of the word , but that certain abnormalities were perceptible . 
Ivan decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were . 
At the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient . 
Smerdyakov was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward . 
There was only one other bed in the room , and in it lay a tradesman of the town , swollen with dropsy , who was obviously almost dying ; he could be no hindrance to their conversation . 
Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan , and for the first instant seemed nervous . 
So at least Ivan fancied . 
But that was only momentary . 
For the rest of the time he was struck , on the contrary , by Smerdyakov 's composure . 
From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he was very ill . 
He was very weak ; he spoke slowly , seeming to move his tongue with difficulty ; he was much thinner and sallower.Throughout the interview , which lasted twenty minutes , he kept complaining of headache and of pain in all his limbs . 
His thin emasculate face seemed to have become so tiny ; his hair was ruffled , and his crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft . 
But in the left eye , which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something , Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged . 
`` It 's always worth while speaking to a clever man . '' 
Ivan was reminded of that at once . 
He sat down on the stool at his feet . 
Smerdyakov , with painful effort , shifted his position in bed , but he was not the first to speak . 
He remained dumb , and did not even look much interested . 
`` Can you . 
talk to me ? '' 
asked Ivan . 
`` I wo n't tire you much . '' 
`` Certainly I can , '' mumbled Smerdyakov , in a faint voice . 
`` Has your honour been back long ? '' 
he added patronisingly , as though encouraging a nervous visitor . 
`` I only arrived to-day ... . 
To see the mess you are in here . '' 
Smerdyakov sighed . 
`` Why do you sigh ? 
You knew of it all along , '' Ivan blurted out . 
Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while . 
`` How could I help knowing ? 
It was clear beforehand . 
But how could I tell it would turn out like that ? '' 
`` What would turn out ? 
Do n't prevaricate ! 
You 've foretold you 'd have a fit ; on the way down to the cellar , you know . 
You mentioned the very spot . '' 
`` Have you said so at the examination yet ? '' 
Smerdyakov queried with composure . 
Ivan felt suddenly angry . 
`` No , I have n't yet , but I certainly shall . 
You must explain a great deal to me , my man ; and let me tell you , I am not going to let you play with me ! '' 
`` Why should I play with you , when I put my whole trust in you , as in God Almighty ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with the same composure , only for a moment closing his eyes . 
`` In the first place , '' began Ivan , `` I know that epileptic fits ca n't be told beforehand . 
I 've inquired ; do n't try and take me in . 
You ca n't foretell the day and the hour . 
How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand , and about the cellar , too ? 
How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit , if you did n't sham a fit on purpose ? '' 
`` I had to go to the cellar anyway , several times a day , indeed , '' Smerdyakov drawled deliberately . 
`` I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago . 
It 's quite true you ca n't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand , but you can always have a presentiment of it . '' 
`` But you did foretell the day and the hour ! '' 
`` In regard to my epilepsy , sir , you had much better inquire of the doctors here . 
You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham ; it 's no use my saying any more about it . '' 
`` And the cellar ? 
How could you know beforehand of the cellar ? '' 
`` You do n't seem able to get over that cellar ! 
As I was going down to the cellar , I was in terrible dread and doubt . 
What frightened me most was losing you and being left without defence in all the world . 
So I went down into the cellar thinking , ` Here , it 'll come on directly , it 'll strike me down directly , shall I fall ? ' 
And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying . 
All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before , when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar , I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch , the investigating lawyer , and it 's all been written down in the protocol . 
And the doctor here , Mr. Varvinsky , maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on , the apprehension that I might fall . 
It was just then that the fit seized me . 
And so they 've written it down , that it 's just how it must have happened , simply from my fear . '' 
As he finished , Smerdyakov . 
drew a deep breath , as though exhausted . 
`` Then you have said all that in your evidence ? '' 
said Ivan , somewhat taken aback . 
He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation , and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself . 
`` What have I to be afraid of ? 
Let them write down the whole truth , '' Smerdyakov pronounced firmly . 
`` And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate ? '' 
`` No , not to say every word . '' 
`` And did you tell them that you can sham fits , as you boasted then ? '' 
`` No , I did n't tell them that either . '' 
`` Tell me now , why did you send me then to Tchermashnya ? '' 
`` I was afraid you 'd go away to Moscow ; Tchermashnya is nearer , anyway . '' 
`` You are lying ; you suggested my going away yourself ; you told me to get out of the way of trouble . '' 
`` That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you , foreseeing trouble in the house , to spare you . 
Only I wanted to spare myself even more . 
That 's why I told you to get out of harm 's way , that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house , and would remain at home to protect your father . '' 
`` You might have said it more directly , you blockhead ! '' 
Ivan suddenly fired up . 
`` How could I have said it more directly then ? 
It was simply my fear that made me speak , and you might have been angry , too . 
I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money , for he considered it as good as his own ; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this ? 
I thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master 's mattress in the envelope , and you see , he 's murdered him . 
How could you guess it either , sir ? '' 
`` But if you say yourself that it could n't be guessed , how could I have guessed and stayed at home ? 
You contradict yourself ! '' 
said Ivan , pondering . 
`` You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow . '' 
`` How could I guess it from that ? '' 
Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted , and again he was silent for a minute . 
`` You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya , that I wanted to have you nearer , for Moscow 's a long way off , and Dmitri Fyodorovitch , knowing you are not far off , would not be so bold . 
And if anything had happened , you might have come to protect me , too , for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch 's illness , and that I was afraid of having a fit . 
And when I explained those knocks to you , by means of which one could go in to the deceased , and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me , I thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do something , and so would n't go to Tchermashnya even , but would stay . '' 
`` He talks very coherently , '' thought Ivan , `` though he does mumble ; what 's the derangement of his faculties that Herzenstube talked of ? '' 
`` You are cunning with me , damn you ! '' 
he exclaimed , getting angry . 
`` But I thought at the time that you quite guessed , '' Smerdyakov parried with the simplest air . 
`` If I 'd guessed , I should have stayed , '' cried Ivan . 
`` Why , I thought that it was because you guessed , that you went away in such a hurry , only to get out of trouble , only to run away and save yourself in your fright . '' 
`` You think that everyone is as great a coward as yourself ? '' 
`` Forgive me , I thought you were like me . '' 
`` Of course , I ought to have guessed , '' Ivan said in agitation ; `` and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying , you are lying again , '' he cried , suddenly recollecting . 
`` Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me , ` It 's always worth while speaking to a clever man ' ? 
So you were glad I went away , since you praised me ? '' 
Smerdyakov sighed again and again . 
A trace of colour came into his face . 
`` If I was pleased , '' he articulated rather breathlessly , `` it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow , but to Tchermashnya . 
For it was nearer , anyway . 
Only when I said these words to you , it was not by way of praise , but of reproach . 
You did n't understand it . '' 
`` What reproach ? '' 
`` Why , that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father , and would not protect us , for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand . '' 
`` Damn you ! '' 
Ivan swore again . 
`` Stay , did you tell the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer about those knocks ? '' 
`` I told them everything just as it was . '' 
Ivan wondered inwardly again . 
`` If I thought of anything then , '' he began again , `` it was solely of some wickedness on your part . 
Dmitri might kill him , but that he would steal - I did not believe that then ... . 
But I was prepared for any wickedness from you . 
You told me yourself you could sham a fit . 
What did you say that for ? '' 
`` It was just through my simplicity , and I never have shammed a fit on purpose in my life . 
And I only said so then to boast to you . 
It was just foolishness . 
I liked you so much then , and was open-hearted with you . '' 
`` My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft . '' 
`` What else is left for him to do ? '' 
said Smerdyakov , with a bitter grin . 
`` And who will believe him with all the proofs against him ? 
Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open . 
What can he say after that ? 
But never mind him ! 
He is trembling to save himself . '' 
He slowly ceased speaking ; then suddenly , as though on reflection , added : `` And look here again . 
He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands - I 've heard that already . 
But as to my being clever at shamming a fit : should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one , if I really had had such a design against your father ? 
If I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand ? 
And to his son , too ! 
Upon my word ! 
Is that likely ? 
As if that could be ; such a thing has never happened . 
No one hears this talk of ours now , except Providence itself , and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me completely by doing so , for who would be likely to be such a criminal , if he is so open-hearted beforehand ? 
Anyone can see that . '' 
`` Well , '' and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation , struck by Smerdyakov 's last argument . 
`` I do n't suspect you at all , and I think it 's absurd , indeed , to suspect you . 
On the contrary , I am grateful to you for setting my mind at rest . 
Now I am going , but I 'll come again . 
Meanwhile , good-bye . 
Get well . 
Is there anything you want ? '' 
`` I am very thankful for everything . 
Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me , and provides me anything I want , according to her kindness . 
Good people visit me every day . '' 
`` Good-bye . 
But I sha n't say anything of your being able to sham a fit , and I do n't advise you to , either , '' something made Ivan say suddenly . 
`` I quite understand . 
And if you do n't speak of that , I shall say nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate . '' 
Then it happened that Ivan went out , and only when he had gone a dozen steps along the corridor , he suddenly felt that there was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov 's last words . 
He was almost on the point of turning back , but it was only a passing impulse , and muttering , `` Nonsense ! '' 
he went out of the hospital . 
His chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not Smerdyakov , but Mitya , who had committed the murder , though he might have been expected to feel the opposite . 
He did not want to analyse the reason for this feeling , and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his sensations . 
He felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something . 
In the following days he became convinced of Mitya 's guilt , as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him . 
There was evidence of people of no importance , Fenya and her mother , for instance , but the effect of it was almost overpowering . 
As to Perhotin , the people at the tavern , and at Plotnikov 's shop , as well as the witnesses at Mokroe , their evidence seemed conclusive . 
It was the details that were so damning . 
The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory 's evidence as to the open door . 
Grigory 's wife , Marfa , in answer to Ivan 's questions , declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall , `` He was not three paces from our bed , '' and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning , `` He was moaning the whole time , moaning continually . '' 
Talking to Herzenstube , and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad , but only rather weak , Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile . 
`` Do you know how he spends his time now ? '' 
he asked ; `` learning lists of French words by heart . 
He has an exercise-book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by someone , he he he ! '' 
Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts . 
He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion . 
Only one thing was strange , however . 
Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer , and that `` in all probability '' Smerdyakov was . 
Ivan always felt that Alyosha 's opinion meant a great deal to him , and so he was astonished at it now . 
Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan , that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions . 
This , too , struck Ivan particularly . 
But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that . 
On his return from Moscow , he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna . 
This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan 's , which left its mark on all the rest of his life : this would furnish the subject for another novel , which I may perhaps never write . 
But I can not omit to mention here that when Ivan , on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha , as I 've related already , told him , `` I am not keen on her , '' it was an absolute lie : he loved her madly , though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her . 
Many causes helped to bring about this feeling . 
Shattered by what had happened with Mitya , she rushed on Ivan 's return to meet him as her one salvation . 
She was hurt , insulted and humiliated in her feelings . 
And here the man had come back to her , who had loved her so ardently before -LRB- oh ! 
she knew that very well -RRB- , and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own . 
But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved , in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her . 
She was continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted Mitya , and in moments of discord and violent anger -LRB- and they were numerous -RRB- she told Ivan so plainly . 
This was what he had called to Alyosha `` lies upon lies . '' 
There was , of course , much that was false in it , and that angered Ivan more than anything ... . 
But of all this later . 
He did , in fact , for a time almost forget Smerdyakov 's existence , and yet , a fortnight after his first visit to him , he began to be haunted by the same strange thoughts as before . 
It 's enough to say that he was continually asking himself , why was it that on that last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch 's house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his father was doing below ? 
Why had he recalled that afterwards with repulsion ? 
Why next morning , had he been suddenly so depressed on the journey ? 
Why , as he reached Moscow , had he said to himself , `` I am a scoundrel '' ? 
And now he almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts would make him even forget Katerina Ivanovna , so completely did they take possession of him again . 
It was just after fancying this , that he met Alyosha in the street . 
He stopped him at once , and put a question to him : `` Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father , and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved ` the right to desire ' ? 
... Tell me , did you think then that I desired father 's death or not ? '' 
`` I did think so , '' answered Alyosha , softly . 
`` It was so , too ; it was not a matter of guessing . 
But did n't you fancy then that what I wished was just that one reptile should devour another ' ; that is , just that Dmitri should kill father , and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about ? '' 
Alyosha turned rather pale , and looked silently into his brother 's face . 
`` Speak ! '' 
cried Ivan , `` I want above everything to know what you thought then . 
I want the truth , the truth ! '' 
He drew a deep breath , looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came . 
`` Forgive me , I did think that , too , at the time , '' whispered Alyosha , and he did not add one softening phrase . 
`` Thanks , '' snapped Ivan , and , leaving Alyosha , he went quickly on his way . 
From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him , so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him . 
Immediately after that meeting with him , Ivan had not gone home , but went straight to Smerdyakov again . 
The Second Visit to Smerdyakov BY that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital . 
Ivan knew his new lodging , the dilapidated little wooden house , divided in two by a passage , on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother , and on the other , Smerdyakov . 
No one knew on what terms he lived with them , whether as a friend or as a lodger . 
It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna 's betrothed , and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging . 
Both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly superior to themselves . 
Ivan knocked , and , on the door being opened , went straight into the passage . 
By Marya Kondratyevna 's directions he went straight to the better room on the left , occupied by Smerdyakov . 
There was a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot . 
The walls were gay with blue paper , which was a good deal used however , and in the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers , so that there was a continual rustling from them . 
The furniture was very scanty : two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table . 
The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it . 
There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little windows . 
In the corner there was a case of ikons . 
On the table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it , and a tray with two cups . 
But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out . 
He was sitting at the table on a bench . 
He was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen . 
There was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick , but with a composite candle . 
Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov 's face that he had completely recovered from his illness . 
His face was fresher , fuller , his hair stood up jauntily in front , and was plastered down at the sides . 
He was sitting in a parti-coloured , wadded dressing-gown , rather dirty and frayed , however . 
He had spectacles on his nose , which Ivan had never seen him wearing before . 
This trifling circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan 's anger : `` A creature like that and wearing spectacles ! '' 
Smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor through his spectacles ; then he slowly took them off and rose from the bench , but by no means respectfully , almost lazily , doing the least possible required by common civility . 
All this struck Ivan instantly ; he took it all in and noted it at once - most of all the look in Smerdyakov 's eyes , positively malicious , churlish and haughty . 
`` What do you want to intrude for ? '' 
it seemed to say ; `` we settled everything then ; why have you come again ? '' 
Ivan could scarcely control himself . 
`` It 's hot here , '' he said , still standing , and unbuttoned his overcoat . 
`` Take off your coat , '' Smerdyakov conceded . 
Ivan took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands . 
He took a chair , moved it quickly to the table and sat down . 
Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him . 
`` To begin with , are we alone ? '' 
Ivan asked sternly and impulsively . 
`` Can they overhear us in there ? '' 
`` No one can hear anything . 
You 've seen for yourself : there 's a passage . '' 
`` Listen , my good fellow ; what was that you babbled , as I was leaving the hospital , that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits , you would n't tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate ? 
What do you mean by all ? 
What could you mean by it ? 
Were you threatening me ? 
Have I entered into some sort of compact with you ? 
Do you suppose I am afraid of you ? '' 
Ivan said this in a perfect fury , giving him to understand with obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show his cards . 
Smerdyakov 's eyes gleamed resentfully , his left eye winked , and he at once gave his answer , with his habitual composure and deliberation . 
`` You want to have everything above-board ; very well , you shall have it , '' he seemed to say . 
`` This is what I meant then , and this is why I said that , that you , knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent , left him to his fate , and that people might n't after that conclude any evil about your feelings and perhaps of something else , too - that 's what I promised not to tell the authorities . '' 
Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself , yet there was something in his voice , determined and emphatic , resentful and insolently defiant . 
He stared impudently at Ivan . 
A mist passed before Ivan 's eyes for the first moment . 
`` How ? 
What ? 
Are you out of your mind ? '' 
`` I 'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties . '' 
`` Do you suppose I knew of the murder ? '' 
Ivan cried at last , and he brought his fist violently on the table . 
`` What do you mean by ` something else , too ' ? 
Speak , scoundrel ! '' 
Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare . 
`` Speak , you stinking rogue , what is that ` something else , too ' ? '' 
`` The ` something else ' I meant was that you probably , too , were very desirous of your parent 's death . '' 
Ivan jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder , so that he fell back against the wall . 
In an instant his face was bathed in tears . 
Saying , `` It 's a shame , sir , to strike a sick man , '' he dried his eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping . 
A minute passed . 
`` That 's enough ! 
Leave off , '' Ivan said peremptorily , sitting down again . 
`` Do n't put me out of all patience . '' 
Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes . 
Every line of his puckered face reflected the insult he had just received . 
`` So you thought then , you scoundrel , that together with Dmitri I meant to kill my father ? '' 
`` I did n't know what thoughts were in your mind then , '' said Smerdyakov resentfully ; `` and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that very point . '' 
`` To sound what , what ? '' 
`` Why , that very circumstance , whether you wanted your father to be murdered or not . '' 
What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive , insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered . 
`` It was you murdered him ? '' 
he cried suddenly . 
Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously . 
`` You know of yourself , for a fact , that it was n't I murdered him . 
And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again . '' 
`` But why , why had you such a suspicion about me at the time ? '' 
`` As you know already , it was simply from fear . 
For I was in such a position , shaking with fear , that I suspected everyone . 
I resolved to sound you , too , for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother , then the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly , too . '' 
`` Look here , you did n't say that a fortnight ago . '' 
`` I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital , only I thought you 'd understand without wasting words , and that being such a sensible man you would n't care to talk of it openly . '' 
`` What next ! 
Come answer , answer , I insist : what was it ... what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul ? '' 
`` As for the murder , you could n't have done that and did n't want to , but as for wanting someone else to do it , that was just what you did want . '' 
`` And how coolly , how coolly he speakst But why should I have wanted it ; what grounds had I for wanting it ? '' 
`` What grounds had you ? 
What about the inheritance ? '' 
said Smerdyakov sarcastically , and , as it were , vindictively . 
`` Why , after your parent 's death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you , and very likely more , but if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady , Agrafena Alexandrovna , she would have had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding , for she 's plenty of sense , so that your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three of you . 
And were they far from a wedding , either ? 
Not a hair 's - breadth : that lady had only to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church , with his tongue out . '' 
Ivan restrained himself with painful effort . 
`` Very good , '' he commented at last . 
`` You see , I have n't jumped up , I have n't knocked you down , I have n't killed you . 
Speak on . 
So , according to you , I had fixed on Dmitri to do it ; I was reckoning on him ? '' 
`` How could you help reckoning on him ? 
If he killed him , then he would lose all the rights of a nobleman , his rank and property , and would go off to exile ; so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts ; so you 'd each have not forty , but sixty thousand each . 
There 's not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` What I put up with from you ! 
Listen , scoundrel , if I had reckoned on anyone then , it would have been on you , not on Dmitri , and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the time ... . 
I remember my impression ! 
`` I thought , too , for a minute , at the time , that you were reckoning on me as well , '' said Smerdyakov , with a sarcastic grin . 
`` So that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind . 
For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away , you as good as said to me , ` You can murder my parent , I wo n't hinder you ! '' ' 
`` You scoundrel ! 
So that 's how you understood it ! '' 
`` It was all that going to Tchermashnya . 
Why ! 
You were meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father 's entreaties to go to Tchermashnya - and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once ! 
What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya ? 
Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason , simply at my word , it shows that you must have expected something from me . '' 
No , I swear I did n't ! '' 
shouted Ivan , grinding his teeth . 
`` You did n't ? 
Then you ought , as your father 's son , to have had me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least , to have given me a punch in the face on the spot , but you were not a bit angry , if you please , and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away , which was utterly absurd , for you ought to have stayed to save your parent 's life . 
How could I help drawing my conclusions ? '' 
Ivan sat scowling , both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees . 
`` Yes , I am sorry I did n't punch you in the face , '' he said with a bitter smile . 
`` I could n't have taken you to the lock-up just then . 
Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against you ? 
But the punch in the face ... oh , I 'm sorry I did n't think of it . 
Though blows are forbidden , I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly . '' 
Smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish . 
`` In the ordinary occasions of life , '' he said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch 's table , `` in the ordinary occasions of life , blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law , and people have given them up , but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows , not only among us but all over the world , be it even the fullest republic of France , just as in the time of Adam and Eve , and they never will leave off , but you , even in an exceptional case , did not dare . '' 
`` What are you learning French words for ? '' 
Ivan nodded towards the exercise-book lying on the table . 
`` Why should n't I learn them so as to improve my education , supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe ? '' 
`` Listen , monster . '' 
Ivan 's eyes flashed and he trembled all over . 
`` I am not afraid of your accusations ; you can say what you like about me , and if I do n't beat you to death , it 's simply because I suspect you of that crime and I 'll drag you to justice . 
I 'll unmask you . '' 
`` To my thinking , you 'd better keep quiet , for what can you accuse me of , considering my absolute innocence ? 
And who would believe you ? 
Only if you begin , I shall tell everything , too , for I must defend myself . '' 
`` Do you think I am afraid of you now ? '' 
`` If the court does n't believe all I 've said to you just now , the public will , and you will be ashamed . '' 
`` That 's as much as to say , ` It 's always worth while speaking to a sensible man , ' eh ? '' 
snarled Ivan . 
`` You hit the mark , indeed . 
And you 'd better be sensible . '' 
Ivan got up , shaking all over with indignation , put on his coat , and without replying further to Smerdyakov , without even looking at him , walked quickly out of the cottage . 
The cool evening air refreshed him . 
There was a bright moon in the sky . 
A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul . 
`` Shall I go at once and give information against Smerdyakov ? 
But what information can I give ? 
He is not guilty , anyway . 
On the contrary , he 'll accuse me . 
And in fact , why did I set off for Tchermashnya then ? 
What for ? 
What for ? '' 
Ivan asked himself . 
`` Yes , of course , I was expecting something and he is right ... '' And he remembered for the hundredth time how , on the last night in his father 's house , he had listened on the stairs . 
But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed . 
`` Yes , I expected it then , that 's true ! 
I wanted the murder , I did want the murder ! 
Did I want the murder ? 
Did I want it ? 
I must kill Smerdyakov ! 
If I do n't dare kill Smerdyakov now , life is not worth living ! '' 
Ivan did not go home , but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed her by his appearance . 
He was like a madman . 
He repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov , every syllable of it . 
He could n't be calmed , however much she tried to soothe him : he kept walking about the room , speaking strangely , disconnectedly . 
At last he sat down , put his elbows on the table , leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange sentence : `` If it 's not Dmitri , but Smerdyakov who 's the murderer , I share his guilt , for I put him up to it . 
Whether I did , I do n't know yet . 
But if he is the murderer , and not Dmitri , then , of course , I am the murderer , too . '' 
When Katerina Ivanovna heard that , she got up from her seat without a word , went to her writing-table , opened a box standing on it , took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan . 
This was the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a `` conclusive proof '' that Dmitri had killed his father . 
It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk , on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the monastery , after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna 's , when Grushenka had insulted her . 
Then , parting from Alyosha , Mitya had rushed to Grushenka . 
I do n't know whether he saw her , but in the evening he was at the Metropolis , where he got thoroughly drunk . 
Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself . 
It was a wordy , disconnected , frantic letter , a drunken letter , in fact . 
It was like the talk of a drunken man , who , on his return home , begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted , what a rascal had just insulted him , what a fine fellow he is on the other hand , and how he will pay that scoundrel out ; and all that at great length , with great excitement and incoherence , with drunken tears and blows on the table . 
The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind . 
It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it . 
There was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest . 
The letter ran as follows : FATAL KATYA : To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell , woman of great wrath , but farewell , too , my love ! 
Let us make an end ! 
To-morrow I shall try and get it from everyone , and if I ca n't borrow it , I give you my word of honour I shall go to my father and break his skull and take the money from under the pillow , if only Ivan has gone . 
It I have to go to Siberia for it , I 'll give you back your three thousand . 
And farewell . 
I bow down to the ground before you , for I 've been a scoundrel to you . 
Forgive me ! 
No , better not forgive me , you 'll be happier and so shall I ! 
Better Siberia than your love , for I love another woman and you got to know her too well to-day , so how can you forgive ? 
I will murder the man who 's robbed me ! 
I 'll leave you all and go to the East so as to see no one again . 
Not her either , for you are not my only tormentress ; she is too . 
Farewel ! 
P.S. - I write my curse , but I adore you ! 
I hear it in my heart . 
One string is left , and it vibrates . 
Better tear my heart in two ! 
I shall kill myself , but first of all that cur . 
I shall tear three thousand from him and fling it to you . 
Though I 've been a scoundrel to you , I am not a thief ! 
You can expect three thousand . 
The cur keeps it under his mattress , in pink ribbon . 
I am not a thief , but I 'll murder my thief . 
Katya , do n't look disdainful . 
Dmitri is not a thief ! 
but a murderer ! 
He has murdered his father and ruined himself to hold his ground , rather than endure your pride . 
And he does n't love you . 
P.P.S. - I kiss your feet , farewel ! 
P.P.P.S. - Katya , pray to God that someone 'll give me the money . 
Then I shall not be steeped in gore , and if no one does - I shall ! 
Kill me ! 
Your slave and enemy , D. KARAMAZOV When Ivan read this `` document '' he was convinced . 
So then it was his brother , not Smerdyakov . 
And if not Smerdyakov , then not he , Ivan . 
This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof . 
There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya 's guilt . 
The suspicion never occurred to Ivan , by the way , that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov , and , indeed , such a theory did not fit in with the facts . 
Ivan was completely reassured . 
The next morning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt . 
A few days later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions . 
He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him . 
So passed a month . 
He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov , but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind . 
`` He 'll end in madness , '' the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him , and Ivan remembered this . 
During the last week of that month Ivan himself began to feel very ill . 
He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial . 
And just at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained . 
They were like two enemies in love with one another . 
Katerina Ivanovna 's `` returns '' to Mitya , that is , her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favour , drove Ivan to perfect frenzy . 
Strange to say , until that last scene described above , when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna , Ivan had never once , during that month , heard her express a doubt of Mitya 's guilt , in spite of those `` returns '' that were so hateful to him . 
It is remarkable , too , that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more every day , he realised that it was not on account of Katya 's `` returns '' that he hated him , but just because he was the murderer of his father . 
He was conscious of this and fully recognised it to himself Nevertheless , he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape - a plan he had obviously thought over a long time . 
He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov 's , that it was to his , Ivan 's , advantage that his brother should be convicted , as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha 's from forty to sixty thousand roubles . 
He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya 's escape . 
On his return from seeing him , he was very mournful and dispirited ; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya 's escape , not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand , but for another reason . 
`` Is it because I am as much a murderer at heart ? '' 
he asked himself . 
Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul . 
His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month . 
But of that later ... . 
When , after his conversation with Alyosha , Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov , he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation . 
He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha 's presence : `` It was you , you , persuaded me of his '' -LRB- that is , Mitya 's -RRB- `` guilt ! '' 
Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it . 
He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the murderer ; on the contrary , he had suspected himself in her presence , that time when he came back from Smerdyakov . 
It was she , she , who had produced that `` document '' and proved his brother 's guilt . 
And now she suddenly exclaimed : `` I 've been at Smerdyakov 's myself ! '' 
When had she been there ? 
Ivan had known nothing of it . 
So she was not at all so sure of Mitya 's guilt ! 
And what could Smerdyakov have told her ? 
What , what , had he said to her ? 
His heart burned with violent anger . 
He could not understand how he could , half an hour before , have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment . 
He let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov . 
`` I shall kill him , perhaps , this time , '' he thought on the way . 
The Third and Last Interview with Smerdyakov WHEN he was half-way there , the keen dry wind that had been blowing early that morning rose again , and a fine dry snow began falling thickly . 
It did not lie on the ground , but was whirled about by the wind , and soon there was a regular snowstorm . 
There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of the town where Smerdyakov lived . 
Ivan strode alone in the darkness , unconscious of the storm , instinctively picking out his way . 
His head ached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples . 
He felt that his hands were twitching convulsively . 
Not far from Marya Kondratyevna 's cottage , Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant . 
He was wearing a coarse and patched coat , and was walking in zigzags , grumbling and swearing to himself . 
Then suddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice : Ach , Vanka 's gone to Petersburg ; I wo n't wait till he comes back . 
But he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again ; then he would begin the same song again . 
Ivan felt an intense hatred for him before he had thought about him at all . 
Suddenly he realised his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down . 
At that moment they met , and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt against Ivan , who pushed him back furiously . 
The peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground . 
He uttered one plaintive `` O - oh ! '' 
and then was silent . 
Ivan stepped up to him . 
He was lying on his back , without movement or consciousness . 
`` He will be frozen , '' thought Ivan , and he went on his way to Smerdyakov 's . 
In the passage , Marya Kondratyevna , who ran out to open the door with a candle in her hand , whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill ; `` It 's not that he 's laid up , but he seems not himself , and he even told us to take the tea away ; he would n't have any . '' 
`` Why , does he make a row ? '' 
asked Ivan coarsely . 
`` Oh dear no , quite the contrary , he 's very quiet . 
Only please do n't talk to him too long , '' Marya Kondratyevna begged him . 
Ivan opened the door and stepped into the room . 
It was over-heated as before , but there were changes in the room . 
One of the benches at the side had been removed , and in its place had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa , on which a bed had been made up , with fairly clean white pillows . 
Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa , wearing the same dressing-gown . 
The table had been brought out in front of the sofa , so that there was hardly room to move . 
On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover , but Smerdyakov was not reading it . 
He seemed to be sitting doing nothing . 
He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze , and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming . 
There was a great change in his face ; he was much thinner and sallower . 
His eyes were sunken and there were blue marks under them . 
`` Why , you really are ill ? '' 
Ivan stopped short . 
`` I wo n't keep you long , I wont even take off my coat .
