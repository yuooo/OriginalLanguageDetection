Come now ! 
we must have a snooze all the same . '' 
However , he asked them no questions . 
What was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place ! 
The elder of the two children , who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood , uttered this exclamation : -- `` It 's queer , all the same . 
Mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on Palm Sunday . '' 
`` Bosh , '' said Gavroche . 
`` Mamma , '' resumed the elder , `` is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss. '' `` Tanflute ! '' 
retorted Gavroche . 
Meanwhile he had halted , and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained . 
At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied , but which was triumphant , in reality . 
`` Let us be calm , young ` uns . 
Here 's supper for three . '' 
And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou . 
Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement , he pushed both of them before him into the baker 's shop , and flung his sou on the counter , crying : -- `` Boy ! 
five centimes ' worth of bread . '' 
The baker , who was the proprietor in person , took up a loaf and a knife . 
`` In three pieces , my boy ! '' 
went on Gavroche . 
And he added with dignity : -- `` There are three of us . '' 
And seeing that the baker , after scrutinizing the three customers , had taken down a black loaf , he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great Frederick 's snuff on the tip of his thumb , and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker 's face : -- `` Keksekca ? '' 
Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation of Gavroche 's to the baker a Russian or a Polish word , or one of those savage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river , athwart the solitudes , are warned that it is a word which they -LSB- our readers -RSB- utter every day , and which takes the place of the phrase : `` Qu'est - ce que c'est que cela ? '' 
The baker understood perfectly , and replied : -- `` Well ! 
It 's bread , and very good bread of the second quality . '' 
`` You mean larton brutal -LSB- black bread -RSB- ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , calmly and coldly disdainful . 
`` White bread , boy ! 
white bread -LSB- larton savonne -RSB- ! 
I 'm standing treat . '' 
The baker could not repress a smile , and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche . 
`` Come , now , baker 's boy ! '' 
said he , `` what are you taking our measure like that for ? '' 
All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure . 
When the bread was cut , the baker threw the sou into his drawer , and Gavroche said to the two children : -- `` Grub away . '' 
The little boys stared at him in surprise . 
Gavroche began to laugh . 
`` Ah ! 
hullo , that 's so ! 
they do n't understand yet , they 're too small . '' 
And he repeated : -- `` Eat away . '' 
At the same time , he held out a piece of bread to each of them . 
And thinking that the elder , who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation , deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite , he added , as be handed him the largest share : -- `` Ram that into your muzzle . '' 
One piece was smaller than the others ; he kept this for himself . 
The poor children , including Gavroche , were famished . 
As they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls , they blocked up the shop of the baker , who , now that they had paid their money , looked angrily at them . 
`` Let 's go into the street again , '' said Gavroche . 
They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille . 
From time to time , as they passed the lighted shop-windows , the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord . 
`` Well , he is a very green ` un , '' said Gavroche . 
Then , becoming thoughtful , he muttered between his teeth : -- `` All the same , if I had charge of the babes I 'd lock 'em up better than that . '' 
Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread , and had reached the angle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets , at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of La Force was visible : -- `` Hullo , is that you , Gavroche ? '' 
said some one . 
`` Hullo , is that you , Montparnasse ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
A man had just accosted the street urchin , and the man was no other than Montparnasse in disguise , with blue spectacles , but recognizable to Gavroche . 
`` The bow-wows ! '' 
went on Gavroche , `` you 've got a hide the color of a linseed plaster , and blue specs like a doctor . 
You 're putting on style , ` pon my word ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
ejaculated Montparnasse , `` not so loud . '' 
And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops . 
The two little ones followed mechanically , holding each other by the hand . 
When they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere , sheltered from the rain and from all eyes : -- `` Do you know where I 'm going ? '' 
demanded Montparnasse . 
`` To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret , '' -LSB- 36 -RSB- replied Gavroche . 
-LSB- 36 -RSB- The scaffold . 
`` Joker ! '' 
And Montparnasse went on : -- `` I 'm going to find Babet . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche , `` so her name is Babet . '' 
Montparnasse lowered his voice : -- `` Not she , he . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Babet . '' 
`` Yes , Babet . '' 
`` I thought he was buckled . '' 
`` He has undone the buckle , '' replied Montparnasse . 
And he rapidly related to the gamin how , on the morning of that very day , Babet , having been transferred to La Conciergerie , had made his escape , by turning to the left instead of to the right in `` the police office . '' 
Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill . 
`` What a dentist ! '' 
he cried . 
Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet 's flight , and ended with : -- `` Oh ! 
That 's not all . '' 
Gavroche , as he listened , had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in his hand , and mechanically pulled at the upper part , and the blade of a dagger made its appearance . 
`` Ah ! '' 
he exclaimed , pushing the dagger back in haste , `` you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois . '' 
Montparnasse winked . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
resumed Gavroche , `` so you 're going to have a bout with the bobbies ? '' 
`` You ca n't tell , '' replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air . 
`` It 's always a good thing to have a pin about one . '' 
Gavroche persisted : -- `` What are you up to to-night ? '' 
Again Montparnasse took a grave tone , and said , mouthing every syllable : `` Things . '' 
And abruptly changing the conversation : -- `` By the way ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Something happened t ` other day . 
Fancy . 
I meet a bourgeois . 
He makes me a present of a sermon and his purse . 
I put it in my pocket . 
A minute later , I feel in my pocket . 
There 's nothing there . '' 
`` Except the sermon , '' said Gavroche . 
`` But you , '' went on Montparnasse , `` where are you bound for now ? '' 
Gavroche pointed to his two proteges , and said : -- `` I 'm going to put these infants to bed . '' 
`` Whereabouts is the bed ? '' 
`` At my house . '' 
`` Where 's your house ? '' 
`` At my house . '' 
`` So you have a lodging ? '' 
`` Yes , I have . '' 
`` And where is your lodging ? '' 
`` In the elephant , '' said Gavroche . 
Montparnasse , though not naturally inclined to astonishment , could not restrain an exclamation . 
`` In the elephant ! '' 
`` Well , yes , in the elephant ! '' 
retorted Gavroche . 
`` Kekcaa ? '' 
This is another word of the language which no one writes , and which every one speaks . 
Kekcaa signifies : Quest que c'est que cela a ? 
-LSB- What 's the matter with that ? -RSB- 
The urchin 's profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and good sense . 
He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to Gavroche 's lodging . 
`` Of course , '' said he , `` yes , the elephant . 
Is it comfortable there ? '' 
`` Very , '' said Gavroche . 
`` It 's really bully there . 
There ai n't any draughts , as there are under the bridges . '' 
`` How do you get in ? '' 
`` Oh , I get in . '' 
`` So there is a hole ? '' 
demanded Montparnasse . 
`` Parbleu ! 
I should say so . 
But you must n't tell . 
It 's between the fore legs . 
The bobbies have n't seen it . '' 
`` And you climb up ? 
Yes , I understand . '' 
`` A turn of the hand , cric , crac , and it 's all over , no one there . '' 
After a pause , Gavroche added : -- `` I shall have a ladder for these children . '' 
Montparnasse burst out laughing : -- `` Where the devil did you pick up those young ` uns ? '' 
Gavroche replied with great simplicity : -- `` They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of . '' 
Meanwhile , Montparnasse had fallen to thinking : -- `` You recognized me very readily , '' he muttered . 
He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton , and thrust one up each of his nostrils . 
This gave him a different nose . 
`` That changes you , '' remarked Gavroche , `` you are less homely so , you ought to keep them on all the time . '' 
Montparnasse was a handsome fellow , but Gavroche was a tease . 
`` Seriously , '' demanded Montparnasse , `` how do you like me so ? '' 
The sound of his voice was different also . 
In a twinkling , Montparnasse had become unrecognizable . 
`` Oh ! 
Do play Porrichinelle for us ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche . 
The two children , who had not been listening up to this point , being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses , drew near at this name , and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration . 
Unfortunately , Montparnasse was troubled . 
He laid his hand on Gavroche 's shoulder , and said to him , emphasizing his words : `` Listen to what I tell you , boy ! 
if I were on the square with my dog , my knife , and my wife , and if you were to squander ten sous on me , I would n't refuse to work , but this is n't Shrove Tuesday . '' 
This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin . 
He wheeled round hastily , darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention , and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off . 
Gavroche allowed an : `` Ah ! 
good ! '' 
to escape him , but immediately suppressed it , and shaking Montparnasse 's hand : -- `` Well , good evening , '' said he , `` I 'm going off to my elephant with my brats . 
Supposing that you should need me some night , you can come and hunt me up there . 
I lodge on the entresol . 
There is no porter . 
You will inquire for Monsieur Gavroche . '' 
`` Very good , '' said Montparnasse . 
And they parted , Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the Greve , and Gavroche towards the Bastille . 
The little one of five , dragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche , turned his head back several times to watch `` Porrichinelle '' as he went . 
The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche of the presence of the policeman , contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms . 
This syllable , dig , uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase , means : `` Take care , we can no longer talk freely . '' 
There was besides , in Montparnasse 's sentence , a literary beauty which was lost upon Gavroche , that is mon dogue , ma dague et ma digue , a slang expression of the Temple , which signifies my dog , my knife , and my wife , greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century when Moliere wrote and Callot drew . 
Twenty years ago , there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the Place de la Bastille , near the basin of the canal , excavated in the ancient ditch of the fortress-prison , a singular monument , which has already been effaced from the memories of Parisians , and which deserved to leave some trace , for it was the idea of a `` member of the Institute , the General-in-chief of the army of Egypt . '' 
We say monument , although it was only a rough model . 
But this model itself , a marvellous sketch , the grandiose skeleton of an idea of Napoleon 's , which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown , on each occasion , still further from us , had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect . 
It was an elephant forty feet high , constructed of timber and masonry , bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house , formerly painted green by some dauber , and now painted black by heaven , the wind , and time . 
In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place , the broad brow of the colossus , his trunk , his tusks , his tower , his enormous crupper , his four feet , like columns produced , at night , under the starry heavens , a surprising and terrible form . 
It was a sort of symbol of popular force . 
It was sombre , mysterious , and immense . 
It was some mighty , visible phantom , one knew not what , standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the Bastille . 
Few strangers visited this edifice , no passer-by looked at it . 
It was falling into ruins ; every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it . 
`` The aediles , '' as the expression ran in elegant dialect , had forgotten it ever since 1814 . 
There it stood in its corner , melancholy , sick , crumbling , surrounded by a rotten palisade , soiled continually by drunken coachmen ; cracks meandered athwart its belly , a lath projected from its tail , tall grass flourished between its legs ; and , as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years , by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns , it stood in a hollow , and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it . 
It was unclean , despised , repulsive , and superb , ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois , melancholy in the eyes of the thinker . 
There was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out , and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated . 
As we have said , at night , its aspect changed . 
Night is the real element of everything that is dark . 
As soon as twilight descended , the old elephant became transfigured ; he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows . 
Being of the past , he belonged to night ; and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur . 
This rough , squat , heavy , hard , austere , almost misshapen , but assuredly majestic monument , stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity , has disappeared , and left to reign in peace , a sort of gigantic stove , ornamented with its pipe , which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers , very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes . 
It is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power . 
This epoch will pass away , people have already begun to understand that , if there can be force in a boiler , there can be no force except in the brain ; in other words , that which leads and drags on the world , is not locomotives , but ideas . 
Harness locomotives to ideas , -- that is well done ; but do not mistake the horse for the rider . 
At all events , to return to the Place de la Bastille , the architect of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster ; the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze . 
This stove-pipe , which has been baptized by a sonorous name , and called the column of July , this monument of a revolution that miscarried , was still enveloped in 1832 , in an immense shirt of woodwork , which we regret , for our part , and by a vast plank enclosure , which completed the task of isolating the elephant . 
It was towards this corner of the place , dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp , that the gamin guided his two `` brats . '' 
The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality , and that twenty years ago , the tribunals were called upon to judge , under the charge of vagabondage , and mutilation of a public monument , a child who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the Bastille . 
This fact noted , we proceed . 
On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus , Gavroche comprehended the effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small , and said : -- `` Do n't be scared , infants . '' 
Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant 's enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach . 
The two children , somewhat frightened , followed Gavroche without uttering a word , and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter . 
There , extended along the fence , lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber-yard . 
Gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor , and placed it against one of the elephant 's forelegs . 
Near the point where the ladder ended , a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished . 
Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests , and said to them : -- `` Climb up and go in . '' 
The two little boys exchanged terrified glances . 
`` You 're afraid , brats ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche . 
And he added : -- `` You shall see ! '' 
He clasped the rough leg of the elephant , and in a twinkling , without deigning to make use of the ladder , he had reached the aperture . 
He entered it as an adder slips through a crevice , and disappeared within , and an instant later , the two children saw his head , which looked pale , appear vaguely , on the edge of the shadowy hole , like a wan and whitish spectre . 
`` Well ! '' 
he exclaimed , `` climb up , young ` uns ! 
You 'll see how snug it is here ! 
Come up , you ! '' 
he said to the elder , `` I 'll lend you a hand . '' 
The little fellows nudged each other , the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time , and then , it was raining very hard . 
The elder one undertook the risk . 
The younger , on seeing his brother climbing up , and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast , felt greatly inclined to cry , but he did not dare . 
The elder lad climbed , with uncertain steps , up the rungs of the ladder ; Gavroche , in the meanwhile , encouraging him with exclamations like a fencing-master to his pupils , or a muleteer to his mules . 
`` Do n't be afraid ! 
-- That 's it ! 
-- Come on ! 
-- Put your feet there ! 
-- Give us your hand here ! 
-- Boldly ! '' 
And when the child was within reach , he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the arm , and pulled him towards him . 
`` Nabbed ! '' 
said he . 
The brat had passed through the crack . 
`` Now , '' said Gavroche , `` wait for me . 
Be so good as to take a seat , Monsieur . '' 
And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it , he slipped down the elephant 's leg with the agility of a monkey , landed on his feet in the grass , grasped the child of five round the body , and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder , then he began to climb up behind him , shouting to the elder : -- `` I 'm going to boost him , do you tug . '' 
And in another instant , the small lad was pushed , dragged , pulled , thrust , stuffed into the hole , before he had time to recover himself , and Gavroche , entering behind him , and repulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass , began to clap his hands and to cry : -- `` Here we are ! 
Long live General Lafayette ! '' 
This explosion over , he added : -- `` Now , young ` uns , you are in my house . '' 
Gavroche was at home , in fact . 
Oh , unforeseen utility of the useless ! 
Charity of great things ! 
Goodness of giants ! 
This huge monument , which had embodied an idea of the Emperor 's , had become the box of a street urchin . 
The brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus . 
The bourgeois decked out in their Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille , were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes : `` What 's the good of that ? '' 
It served to save from the cold , the frost , the hail , and rain , to shelter from the winds of winter , to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever , and from slumber in the snow which produces death , a little being who had no father , no mother , no bread , no clothes , no refuge . 
It served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed . 
It served to diminish public crime . 
It was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut . 
It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon , invaded by vermin and oblivion , covered with warts , with mould , and ulcers , tottering , worm-eaten , abandoned , condemned , a sort of mendicant colossus , asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads , had taken pity on that other mendicant , the poor pygmy , who roamed without shoes to his feet , without a roof over his head , blowing on his fingers , clad in rags , fed on rejected scraps . 
That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good for . 
This idea of Napoleon , disdained by men , had been taken back by God . 
That which had been merely illustrious , had become august . 
In order to realize his thought , the Emperor should have had porphyry , brass , iron , gold , marble ; the old collection of planks , beams and plaster sufficed for God . 
The Emperor had had the dream of a genius ; in that Titanic elephant , armed , prodigious , with trunk uplifted , bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters , he wished to incarnate the people . 
God had done a grander thing with it , he had lodged a child there . 
The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside , being concealed , as we have stated , beneath the elephant 's belly , and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it . 
`` Let 's begin , '' said Gavroche , `` by telling the porter that we are not at home . '' 
And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartments , he took a plank and stopped up the aperture . 
Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity . 
The children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle . 
The chemical match was not yet in existence ; at that epoch the Fumade steel represented progress . 
A sudden light made them blink ; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats . 
The cellar rat , which emitted more smoke than light , rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible . 
Gavroche 's two guests glanced about them , and the sensation which they experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the great tun of Heidelberg , or , better still , like what Jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale . 
An entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them . 
Above , a long brown beam , whence started at regular distances , massive , arching ribs , represented the vertebral column with its sides , stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails , and vast spiders ' webs stretching from side to side , formed dirty diaphragms . 
Here and there , in the corners , were visible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive , and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement . 
Fragments which had fallen from the elephant 's back into his belly had filled up the cavity , so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor . 
The smaller child nestled up against his brother , and whispered to him : -- `` It 's black . '' 
This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche . 
The petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary . 
`` What 's that you are gabbling about there ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Are you scoffing at me ? 
Are you turning up your noses ? 
Do you want the tuileries ? 
Are you brutes ? 
Come , say ! 
I warn you that I do n't belong to the regiment of simpletons . 
Ah , come now , are you brats from the Pope 's establishment ? '' 
A little roughness is good in cases of fear . 
It is reassuring . 
The two children drew close to Gavroche . 
Gavroche , paternally touched by this confidence , passed from grave to gentle , and addressing the smaller : -- `` Stupid , '' said he , accenting the insulting word , with a caressing intonation , `` it 's outside that it is black . 
Outside it 's raining , here it does not rain ; outside it 's cold , here there 's not an atom of wind ; outside there are heaps of people , here there 's no one ; outside there ai n't even the moon , here there 's my candle , confound it ! '' 
The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror ; but Gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation . 
`` Quick , '' said he . 
And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room . 
There stood his bed . 
Gavroche 's bed was complete ; that is to say , it had a mattress , a blanket , and an alcove with curtains . 
The mattress was a straw mat , the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff , very warm and almost new . 
This is what the alcove consisted of : -- Three rather long poles , thrust into and consolidated , with the rubbish which formed the floor , that is to say , the belly of the elephant , two in front and one behind , and united by a rope at their summits , so as to form a pyramidal bundle . 
This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it , but artistically applied , and held by fastenings of iron wire , so that it enveloped all three holes . 
A row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it . 
This grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries . 
Gavroche 's bed stood as in a cage , behind this net . 
The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent . 
This trellis-work took the place of curtains . 
Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front , and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart . 
`` Down on all fours , brats ! '' 
said Gavroche . 
He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution , then he crawled in after them , pulled the stones together , and closed the opening hermetically again . 
All three had stretched out on the mat . 
Gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` go to sleep ! 
I 'm going to suppress the candelabra . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche , pointing to the netting , `` what 's that for ? '' 
`` That , '' answered Gavroche gravely , `` is for the rats . 
Go to sleep ! '' 
Nevertheless , he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures , and he continued : -- `` It 's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes . 
It 's used for fierce animals . 
There 's a whole shopful of them there . 
All you 've got to do is to climb over a wall , crawl through a window , and pass through a door . 
You can get as much as you want . '' 
As he spoke , he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket , and the little one murmured : -- `` Oh ! 
how good that is ! 
It 's warm ! '' 
Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket . 
`` That 's from the Jardin des Plantes , too , '' said he . 
`` I took that from the monkeys . '' 
And , pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying , a very thick and admirably made mat , he added : -- `` That belonged to the giraffe . '' 
After a pause he went on : -- `` The beasts had all these things . 
I took them away from them . 
It did n't trouble them . 
I told them : ` It 's for the elephant . ' '' 
He paused , and then resumed : -- `` You crawl over the walls and you do n't care a straw for the government . 
So there now ! '' 
The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid and ingenious being , a vagabond like themselves , isolated like themselves , frail like themselves , who had something admirable and all-powerful about him , who seemed supernatural to them , and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank , mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles . 
`` Monsieur , '' ventured the elder timidly , `` you are not afraid of the police , then ? '' 
Gavroche contented himself with replying : -- `` Brat ! 
Nobody says ` police , ' they say ` bobbies . ' '' 
The smaller had his eyes wide open , but he said nothing . 
As he was on the edge of the mat , the elder being in the middle , Gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done , and heightened the mat under his head with old rags , in such a way as to form a pillow for the child . 
Then he turned to the elder : -- `` Hey ! 
We 're jolly comfortable here , ai n't we ? '' 
`` Ah , yes ! '' 
replied the elder , gazing at Gavroche with the expression of a saved angel . 
The two poor little children who had been soaked through , began to grow warm once more . 
`` Ah , by the way , '' continued Gavroche , `` what were you bawling about ? '' 
And pointing out the little one to his brother : -- `` A mite like that , I 've nothing to say about , but the idea of a big fellow like you crying ! 
It 's idiotic ; you looked like a calf . '' 
`` Gracious , replied the child , `` we have no lodging . '' 
`` Bother ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , `` you do n't say ` lodgings , ' you say ` crib . ' '' 
`` And then , we were afraid of being alone like that at night . '' 
`` You do n't say ` night , ' you say ` darkmans . ' '' 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the child . 
`` Listen , '' went on Gavroche , `` you must never bawl again over anything . 
I 'll take care of you . 
You shall see what fun we 'll have . 
In summer , we 'll go to the Glaciere with Navet , one of my pals , we 'll bathe in the Gare , we 'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz , -- that makes the laundresses raging . 
They scream , they get mad , and if you only knew how ridiculous they are ! 
We 'll go and see the man-skeleton . 
And then I 'll take you to the play . 
I 'll take you to see Frederick Lemaitre . 
I have tickets , I know some of the actors , I even played in a piece once . 
There were a lot of us fellers , and we ran under a cloth , and that made the sea . 
I 'll get you an engagement at my theatre . 
We 'll go to see the savages . 
They ai n't real , those savages ai n't . 
They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles , and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white . 
Then , we 'll go to the Opera . 
We 'll get in with the hired applauders . 
The Opera claque is well managed . 
I would n't associate with the claque on the boulevard . 
At the Opera , just fancy ! 
some of them pay twenty sous , but they 're ninnies . 
They 're called dishclouts . 
And then we 'll go to see the guillotine work . 
I 'll show you the executioner . 
He lives in the Rue des Marais . 
Monsieur Sanson . 
He has a letter-box at his door . 
Ah ! 
we 'll have famous fun ! '' 
At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche 's finger , and recalled him to the realities of life . 
`` The deuce ! '' 
said he , `` there 's the wick giving out . 
Attention ! 
I ca n't spend more than a sou a month on my lighting . 
When a body goes to bed , he must sleep . 
We have n't the time to read M. Paul de Kock 's romances . 
And besides , the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochere , and all the bobbies need to do is to see it . '' 
`` And then , '' remarked the elder timidly , -- he alone dared talk to Gavroche , and reply to him , `` a spark might fall in the straw , and we must look out and not burn the house down . '' 
`` People do n't say ` burn the house down , ' '' remarked Gavroche , `` they say ` blaze the crib . ' '' 
The storm increased in violence , and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder . 
`` You 're taken in , rain ! '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house . 
Winter is a stupid ; it wastes its merchandise , it loses its labor , it ca n't wet us , and that makes it kick up a row , old water-carrier that it is . '' 
This allusion to the thunder , all the consequences of which Gavroche , in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century , accepted , was followed by a broad flash of lightning , so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack . 
Almost at the same instant , the thunder rumbled with great fury . 
The two little creatures uttered a shriek , and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced , but Gavroche turned his bold face to them , and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh . 
`` Calm down , children . 
Do n't topple over the edifice . 
That 's fine , first-class thunder ; all right . 
That 's no slouch of a streak of lightning . 
Bravo for the good God ! 
Deuce take it ! 
It 's almost as good as it is at the Ambigu . '' 
That said , he restored order in the netting , pushed the two children gently down on the bed , pressed their knees , in order to stretch them out at full length , and exclaimed : -- `` Since the good God is lighting his candle , I can blow out mine . 
Now , babes , now , my young humans , you must shut your peepers . 
It 's very bad not to sleep . 
It 'll make you swallow the strainer , or , as they say , in fashionable society , stink in the gullet . 
Wrap yourself up well in the hide ! 
I 'm going to put out the light . 
Are you ready ? '' 
`` Yes , '' murmured the elder , `` I 'm all right . 
I seem to have feathers under my head . '' 
`` People do n't say ` head , ' '' cried Gavroche , `` they say ` nut ' . '' 
The two children nestled close to each other , Gavroche finished arranging them on the mat , drew the blanket up to their very ears , then repeated , for the third time , his injunction in the hieratical tongue : -- `` Shut your peepers ! '' 
And he snuffed out his tiny light . 
Hardly had the light been extinguished , when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay . 
It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound , as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire . 
This was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries . 
The little five-year-old boy , on hearing this hubbub overhead , and chilled with terror , jogged his brother 's elbow ; but the elder brother had already shut his peepers , as Gavroche had ordered . 
Then the little one , who could no longer control his terror , questioned Gavroche , but in a very low tone , and with bated breath : -- `` Sir ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche , who had just closed his eyes . 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` It 's the rats , '' replied Gavroche . 
And he laid his head down on the mat again . 
The rats , in fact , who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant , and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned , had been held in awe by the flame of the candle , so long as it had been lighted ; but as soon as the cavern , which was the same as their city , had returned to darkness , scenting what the good story-teller Perrault calls `` fresh meat , '' they had hurled themselves in throngs on Gavroche 's tent , had climbed to the top of it , and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap . 
Still the little one could not sleep . 
`` Sir ? '' 
he began again . 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` What are rats ? '' 
`` They are mice . '' 
This explanation reassured the child a little . 
He had seen white mice in the course of his life , and he was not afraid of them . 
Nevertheless , he lifted up his voice once more . 
`` Sir ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche again . 
`` Why do n't you have a cat ? '' 
`` I did have one , '' replied Gavroche , `` I brought one here , but they ate her . '' 
This second explanation undid the work of the first , and the little fellow began to tremble again . 
The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time : -- `` Monsieur ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` Who was it that was eaten ? '' 
`` The cat . '' 
`` And who ate the cat ? '' 
`` The rats . '' 
`` The mice ? '' 
`` Yes , the rats . '' 
The child , in consternation , dismayed at the thought of mice which ate cats , pursued : -- `` Sir , would those mice eat us ? '' 
`` Would n't they just ! '' 
ejaculated Gavroche . 
The child 's terror had reached its climax . 
But Gavroche added : -- `` Do n't be afraid . 
They ca n't get in . 
And besides , I 'm here ! 
Here , catch hold of my hand . 
Hold your tongue and shut your peepers ! '' 
At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow 's hand across his brother . 
The child pressed the hand close to him , and felt reassured . 
Courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves . 
Silence reigned round them once more , the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats ; at the expiration of a few minutes , they came raging back , but in vain , the three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more . 
The hours of the night fled away . 
Darkness covered the vast Place de la Bastille . 
A wintry gale , which mingled with the rain , blew in gusts , the patrol searched all the doorways , alleys , enclosures , and obscure nooks , and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant ; the monster , erect , motionless , staring open-eyed into the shadows , had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed ; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children . 
In order to understand what is about to follow , the reader must remember , that , at that epoch , the Bastille guard-house was situated at the other end of the square , and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel . 
Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn , a man turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run , made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of July , and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant . 
If any light had illuminated that man , it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain . 
Arrived beneath the elephant , he uttered a peculiar cry , which did not belong to any human tongue , and which a paroquet alone could have imitated . 
Twice he repeated this cry , of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea : -- `` Kirikikiou ! '' 
At the second cry , a clear , young , merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant : -- `` Yes ! '' 
Almost immediately , the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside , and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant 's leg , and fell briskly near the man . 
It was Gavroche . 
The man was Montparnasse . 
As for his cry of Kirikikiou , -- that was , doubtless , what the child had meant , when he said : -- `` You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche . '' 
On hearing it , he had waked with a start , had crawled out of his `` alcove , '' pushing apart the netting a little , and carefully drawing it together again , then he had opened the trap , and descended . 
The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom : Montparnasse confined himself to the remark : -- `` We need you . 
Come , lend us a hand . '' 
The lad asked for no further enlightenment . 
`` I 'm with you , '' said he . 
And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine , whence Montparnasse had emerged , winding rapidly through the long file of market-gardeners ' carts which descend towards the markets at that hour . 
The market-gardeners , crouching , half-asleep , in their wagons , amid the salads and vegetables , enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain , did not even glance at these strange pedestrians . 
THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force : -- An escape had been planned between Babet , Brujon , Guelemer , and Thenardier , although Thenardier was in close confinement . 
Babet had arranged the matter for his own benefit , on the same day , as the reader has seen from Montparnasse 's account to Gavroche . 
Montparnasse was to help them from outside . 
Brujon , after having passed a month in the punishment cell , had had time , in the first place , to weave a rope , in the second , to mature a plan . 
In former times , those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands , were composed of four stone walls , a stone ceiling , a flagged pavement , a camp bed , a grated window , and a door lined with iron , and were called dungeons ; but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible ; nowadays they are composed of an iron door , a grated window , a camp bed , a flagged pavement , four stone walls , and a stone ceiling , and are called chambers of punishment . 
A little light penetrates towards mid-day . 
The inconvenient point about these chambers which , as the reader sees , are not dungeons , is that they allow the persons who should be at work to think . 
So Brujon meditated , and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope . 
As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne courtyard , he was placed in the New Building . 
The first thing he found in the New Building was Guelemer , the second was a nail ; Guelemer , that is to say , crime ; a nail , that is to say , liberty . 
Brujon , of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea , was , with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor , a polished , intelligent sprig , and a thief , who had a caressing glance , and an atrocious smile . 
His glance resulted from his will , and his smile from his nature . 
His first studies in his art had been directed to roofs . 
He had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead , who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called double pickings . 
The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape , was that the roofers were re-laying and re-jointing , at that very moment , a portion of the slates on the prison . 
The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts . 
Up above there were scaffoldings and ladders ; in other words , bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty . 
The New Building , which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world , was the weak point in the prison . 
The walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood , because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds . 
In spite of this antiquity , the authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners , of placing there `` the hard cases , '' as they say in prison parlance .
