Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind . 
His twin plots , the one with the nuns , the one for the convent , the other against it , the other with M. Madeleine , had succeeded , to all appearance . 
Jean Valjean 's composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious . 
Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success . 
What remained to be done was a mere nothing . 
Within the last two years , he had made good Father Mestienne , a chubby-cheeked person , drunk at least ten times . 
He played with Father Mestienne . 
He did what he liked with him . 
He made him dance according to his whim . 
Mestienne 's head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent 's will . 
Fauchelevent 's confidence was perfect . 
At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery , Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse , and said half aloud , as he rubbed his big hands : -- `` Here 's a fine farce ! '' 
All at once the hearse halted ; it had reached the gate . 
The permission for interment must be exhibited . 
The undertaker 's man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery . 
During this colloquy , which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes , some one , a stranger , came and placed himself behind the hearse , beside Fauchelevent . 
He was a sort of laboring man , who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm . 
Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
he demanded . 
`` The man replied : -- `` The grave-digger . '' 
If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast , he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made . 
`` The grave-digger ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You ? '' 
`` I. '' `` Father Mestienne is the grave-digger . '' 
`` He was . '' 
`` What ! 
He was ? '' 
`` He is dead . '' 
Fauchelevent had expected anything but this , that a grave-digger could die . 
It is true , nevertheless , that grave-diggers do die themselves . 
By dint of excavating graves for other people , one hollows out one 's own . 
Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open . 
He had hardly the strength to stammer : -- `` But it is not possible ! '' 
`` It is so . '' 
`` But , '' he persisted feebly , `` Father Mestienne is the grave-digger . '' 
`` After Napoleon , Louis XVIII . 
After Mestienne , Gribier . 
Peasant , my name is Gribier . '' 
Fauchelevent , who was deadly pale , stared at this Gribier . 
He was a tall , thin , livid , utterly funereal man . 
He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger . 
Fauchelevent burst out laughing . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said he , `` what queer things do happen ! 
Father Mestienne is dead , but long live little Father Lenoir ! 
Do you know who little Father Lenoir is ? 
He is a jug of red wine . 
It is a jug of Surene , morbigou ! 
of real Paris Surene ? 
Ah ! 
So old Mestienne is dead ! 
I am sorry for it ; he was a jolly fellow . 
But you are a jolly fellow , too . 
Are you not , comrade ? 
We 'll go and have a drink together presently . '' 
The man replied : -- `` I have been a student . 
I passed my fourth examination . 
I never drink . '' 
The hearse had set out again , and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery . 
Fauchelevent had slackened his pace . 
He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity . 
The grave-digger walked on in front of him . 
Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review . 
He was one of those men who , though very young , have the air of age , and who , though slender , are extremely strong . 
`` Comrade ! '' 
cried Fauchelevent . 
The man turned round . 
`` I am the convent grave-digger . '' 
`` My colleague , '' said the man . 
Fauchelevent , who was illiterate but very sharp , understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man , with a fine talker . 
He muttered : `` So Father Mestienne is dead . '' 
The man replied : -- `` Completely . 
The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the time is up . 
It was Father Mestienne 's turn . 
Father Mestienne died . '' 
Fauchelevent repeated mechanically : `` The good God -- '' `` The good God , '' said the man authoritatively . 
`` According to the philosophers , the Eternal Father ; according to the Jacobins , the Supreme Being . '' 
`` Shall we not make each other 's acquaintance ? '' 
stammered Fauchelevent . 
`` It is made . 
You are a peasant , I am a Parisian . '' 
`` People do not know each other until they have drunk together . 
He who empties his glass empties his heart . 
You must come and have a drink with me . 
Such a thing can not be refused . '' 
`` Business first . '' 
Fauchelevent thought : `` I am lost . '' 
They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns ' corner . 
The grave-digger resumed : -- `` Peasant , I have seven small children who must be fed . 
As they must eat , I can not drink . '' 
And he added , with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well : -- `` Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst . '' 
The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees , quitted the grand alley , turned into a narrow one , entered the waste land , and plunged into a thicket . 
This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture . 
Fauchelevent slackened his pace , but he could not detain the hearse . 
Fortunately , the soil , which was light and wet with the winter rains , clogged the wheels and retarded its speed . 
He approached the grave-digger . 
`` They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine , '' murmured Fauchelevent . 
`` Villager , '' retorted the man , `` I ought not be a grave-digger . 
My father was a porter at the Prytaneum -LSB- Town-Hall -RSB- . 
He destined me for literature . 
But he had reverses . 
He had losses on ` change . 
I was obliged to renounce the profession of author . 
But I am still a public writer . '' 
`` So you are not a grave-digger , then ? '' 
returned Fauchelevent , clutching at this branch , feeble as it was . 
`` The one does not hinder the other . 
I cumulate . '' 
Fauchelevent did not understand this last word . 
`` Come have a drink , '' said he . 
Here a remark becomes necessary . 
Fauchelevent , whatever his anguish , offered a drink , but he did not explain himself on one point ; who was to pay ? 
Generally , Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid . 
An offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave-digger , and it was necessary to make this offer , but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais in the dark , and that not unintentionally . 
As for himself , Fauchelevent did not wish to pay , troubled as he was . 
The grave-digger went on with a superior smile : -- `` One must eat . 
I have accepted Father Mestienne 's reversion . 
One gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes . 
To the labor of the hand I join the labor of the arm . 
I have my scrivener 's stall in the market of the Rue de Sevres . 
You know ? 
the Umbrella Market . 
All the cooks of the Red Cross apply to me . 
I scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers . 
In the morning I write love letters ; in the evening I dig graves . 
Such is life , rustic . '' 
The hearse was still advancing . 
Fauchelevent , uneasy to the last degree , was gazing about him on all sides . 
Great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow . 
`` But , '' continued the grave-digger , `` a man can not serve two mistresses . 
I must choose between the pen and the mattock . 
The mattock is ruining my hand . '' 
The hearse halted . 
The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach , then the priest . 
One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth , beyond which an open grave was visible . 
`` What a farce this is ! '' 
repeated Fauchelevent in consternation . 
BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS Who was in the coffin ? 
The reader knows . 
Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there , and he could almost breathe . 
It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest . 
Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been progressing , and progressing favorably , since the preceding day . 
He , like Fauchelevent , counted on Father Mestienne . 
He had no doubt as to the end . 
Never was there a more critical situation , never more complete composure . 
The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace . 
It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean Valjean 's tranquillity . 
From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow , and he had followed , all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death . 
Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank , Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out , then driven off . 
He knew , from the diminution in the jolting , when they left the pavements and reached the earth road . 
He had divined , from a dull noise , that they were crossing the bridge of Austerlitz . 
At the first halt , he had understood that they were entering the cemetery ; at the second halt , he said to himself : -- `` Here is the grave . '' 
Suddenly , he felt hands seize the coffin , then a harsh grating against the planks ; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity . 
Then he experienced a giddiness . 
The undertaker 's man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance , and had lowered the head before the foot . 
He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless . 
He had just touched the bottom . 
He had a certain sensation of cold . 
A voice rose above him , glacial and solemn . 
He heard Latin words , which he did not understand , pass over him , so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one : -- `` Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere , evigilabunt ; alii in vitam aeternam , et alii in approbrium , ut videant semper . '' 
A child 's voice said : -- `` De profundis . '' 
The grave voice began again : -- `` Requiem aeternam dona ei , Domine . '' 
The child 's voice responded : -- `` Et lux perpetua luceat ei . '' 
He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him . 
It was probably the holy water . 
He thought : `` This will be over soon now . 
Patience for a little while longer . 
The priest will take his departure . 
Fauchelevent will take Mestienne off to drink . 
I shall be left . 
Then Fauchelevent will return alone , and I shall get out . 
That will be the work of a good hour . '' 
The grave voice resumed `` Requiescat in pace . '' 
And the child 's voice said : -- `` Amen . '' 
Jean Valjean strained his ears , and heard something like retreating footsteps . 
`` There , they are going now , '' thought he . 
`` I am alone . '' 
All at once , he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder . 
It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin . 
A second shovelful fell . 
One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up . 
A third shovelful of earth fell . 
Then a fourth . 
There are things which are too strong for the strongest man . 
Jean Valjean lost consciousness . 
IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING : DO N'T LOSE THE CARD This is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean . 
When the hearse had driven off , when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure , Fauchelevent , who had not taken his eyes from the grave-digger , saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel , which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt . 
Then Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve . 
He placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger , crossed his arms and said : -- `` I am the one to pay ! '' 
The grave-digger stared at him in amazement , and replied : -- `` What 's that , peasant ? '' 
Fauchelevent repeated : -- `` I am the one who pays ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` For the wine . '' 
`` What wine ? '' 
`` That Argenteuil wine . '' 
`` Where is the Argenteuil ? '' 
`` At the Bon Coing . '' 
`` Go to the devil ! '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin . 
The coffin gave back a hollow sound . 
Fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself . 
He shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle : -- `` Comrade ! 
Before the Bon Coing is shut ! '' 
The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel . 
Fauchelevent continued . 
`` I will pay . '' 
And he seized the man 's arm . 
`` Listen to me , comrade . 
I am the convent grave-digger , I have come to help you . 
It is a business which can be performed at night . 
Let us begin , then , by going for a drink . '' 
And as he spoke , and clung to this desperate insistence , this melancholy reflection occurred to him : `` And if he drinks , will he get drunk ? '' 
`` Provincial , '' said the man , `` if you positively insist upon it , I consent . 
We will drink . 
After work , never before . '' 
And he flourished his shovel briskly . 
Fauchelevent held him back . 
`` It is Argenteuil wine , at six . '' 
`` Oh , come , '' said the grave-digger , `` you are a bell-ringer . 
Ding dong , ding dong , that 's all you know how to say . 
Go hang yourself . '' 
And he threw in a second shovelful . 
Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying . 
`` Come along and drink , '' he cried , `` since it is I who pays the bill . '' 
`` When we have put the child to bed , '' said the grave-digger . 
He flung in a third shovelful . 
Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added : -- `` It 's cold to-night , you see , and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet . '' 
At that moment , as he loaded his shovel , the grave-digger bent over , and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped . 
Fauchelevent 's wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket , and there it stopped . 
The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon ; there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket . 
The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain , traversed Fauchelevent 's pupils . 
An idea had just occurred to him . 
He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind , without the grave-digger , who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth , observing it , and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it . 
The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave . 
Just as he turned round to get the fifth , Fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said : -- `` By the way , you new man , have you your card ? '' 
The grave-digger paused . 
`` What card ? '' 
`` The sun is on the point of setting . '' 
`` That 's good , it is going to put on its nightcap . '' 
`` The gate of the cemetery will close immediately . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Have you your card ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my card ? '' 
said the grave-digger . 
And he fumbled in his pocket . 
Having searched one pocket , he proceeded to search the other . 
He passed on to his fobs , explored the first , returned to the second . 
`` Why , no , '' said he , `` I have not my card . 
I must have forgotten it . '' 
`` Fifteen francs fine , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger turned green . 
Green is the pallor of livid people . 
`` Ah ! 
Jesus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-a-bas-la-lune ! '' 
-LSB- 17 -RSB- he exclaimed . 
`` Fifteen francs fine ! '' 
-LSB- 17 -RSB- Jesus-my-God-bandy-leg -- down with the moon ! 
`` Three pieces of a hundred sous , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger dropped his shovel . 
Fauchelevent 's turn had come . 
`` Ah , come now , conscript , '' said Fauchelevent , `` none of this despair . 
There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave . 
Fifteen francs is fifteen francs , and besides , you may not be able to pay it . 
I am an old hand , you are a new one . 
I know all the ropes and the devices . 
I will give you some friendly advice . 
One thing is clear , the sun is on the point of setting , it is touching the dome now , the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more . '' 
`` That is true , '' replied the man . 
`` Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave , it is as hollow as the devil , this grave , and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut . '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` In that case , a fine of fifteen francs . '' 
`` Fifteen francs . '' 
`` But you have time . 
Where do you live ? '' 
`` A couple of steps from the barrier , a quarter of an hour from here . 
No. 87 Rue de Vaugirard . '' 
`` You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed . '' 
`` That is exactly so . '' 
`` Once outside the gate , you gallop home , you get your card , you return , the cemetery porter admits you . 
As you have your card , there will be nothing to pay . 
And you will bury your corpse . 
I 'll watch it for you in the meantime , so that it shall not run away . '' 
`` I am indebted to you for my life , peasant . '' 
`` Decamp ! '' 
said Fauchelevent . 
The grave-digger , overwhelmed with gratitude , shook his hand and set off on a run . 
When the man had disappeared in the thicket , Fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance , then he leaned over the grave , and said in a low tone : -- `` Father Madeleine ! '' 
There was no reply . 
Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder . 
He tumbled rather than climbed into the grave , flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried : -- `` Are you there ? '' 
Silence in the coffin . 
Fauchelevent , hardly able to draw his breath for trembling , seized his cold chisel and his hammer , and pried up the coffin lid . 
Jean Valjean 's face appeared in the twilight ; it was pale and his eyes were closed . 
Fauchelevent 's hair rose upright on his head , he sprang to his feet , then fell back against the side of the grave , ready to swoon on the coffin . 
He stared at Jean Valjean . 
Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless . 
Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh : -- `` He is dead ! '' 
And , drawing himself up , and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders , he cried : -- `` And this is the way I save his life ! '' 
Then the poor man fell to sobbing . 
He soliloquized the while , for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural . 
Powerful emotion often talks aloud . 
`` It is Father Mestienne 's fault . 
Why did that fool die ? 
What need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it ? 
It is he who has killed M. Madeleine . 
Father Madeleine ! 
He is in the coffin . 
It is quite handy . 
All is over . 
Now , is there any sense in these things ? 
Ah ! 
my God ! 
he is dead ! 
Well ! 
and his little girl , what am I to do with her ? 
What will the fruit-seller say ? 
The idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this ! 
When I think how he put himself under that cart ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Pardine ! 
He was suffocated , I said so . 
He would n't believe me . 
Well ! 
Here 's a pretty trick to play ! 
He is dead , that good man , the very best man out of all the good God 's good folks ! 
And his little girl ! 
Ah ! 
In the first place , I wo n't go back there myself . 
I shall stay here . 
After having done such a thing as that ! 
What 's the use of being two old men , if we are two old fools ! 
But , in the first place , how did he manage to enter the convent ? 
That was the beginning of it all . 
One should not do such things . 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Madeleine ! 
Monsieur Madeleine ! 
Monsieur le Maire ! 
He does not hear me . 
Now get out of this scrape if you can ! '' 
And he tore his hair . 
A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance . 
It was the cemetery gate closing . 
Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean , and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit . 
Jean Valjean 's eyes were open and gazing at him . 
To see a corpse is alarming , to behold a resurrection is almost as much so . 
Fauchelevent became like stone , pale , haggard , overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion , not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one , and staring at Jean Valjean , who was gazing at him . 
`` I fell asleep , '' said Jean Valjean . 
And he raised himself to a sitting posture . 
Fauchelevent fell on his knees . 
`` Just , good Virgin ! 
How you frightened me ! '' 
Then he sprang to his feet and cried : -- `` Thanks , Father Madeleine ! '' 
Jean Valjean had merely fainted . 
The fresh air had revived him . 
Joy is the ebb of terror . 
Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as Jean Valjean had . 
`` So you are not dead ! 
Oh ! 
How wise you are ! 
I called you so much that you came back . 
When I saw your eyes shut , I said : ` Good ! 
there he is , stifled , ' I should have gone raving mad , mad enough for a strait jacket . 
They would have put me in Bicetre . 
What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead ? 
And your little girl ? 
There 's that fruit-seller , -- she would never have understood it ! 
The child is thrust into your arms , and then -- the grandfather is dead ! 
What a story ! 
good saints of paradise , what a tale ! 
Ah ! 
you are alive , that 's the best of it ! '' 
`` I am cold , '' said Jean Valjean . 
This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality , and there was pressing need of it . 
The souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves , although they did not realize it , and there was about them something uncanny , which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place . 
`` Let us get out of here quickly , '' exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
He fumbled in his pocket , and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself . 
`` But first , take a drop , '' said he . 
The flask finished what the fresh air had begun , Jean Valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy , and regained full possession of his faculties . 
He got out of the coffin , and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid again . 
Three minutes later they were out of the grave . 
Moreover , Fauchelevent was perfectly composed . 
He took his time . 
The cemetery was closed . 
The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to be apprehended . 
That `` conscript '' was at home busily engaged in looking for his card , and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings , since it was in Fauchelevent 's pocket . 
Without a card , he could not get back into the cemetery . 
Fauchelevent took the shovel , and Jean Valjean the pick-axe , and together they buried the empty coffin . 
When the grave was full , Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean : -- `` Let us go . 
I will keep the shovel ; do you carry off the mattock . '' 
Night was falling . 
Jean Valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking . 
He had stiffened himself in that coffin , and had become a little like a corpse . 
The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks . 
He had , in a manner , to thaw out , from the tomb . 
`` You are benumbed , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` It is a pity that I have a game leg , for otherwise we might step out briskly . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
replied Jean Valjean , `` four paces will put life into my legs once more . '' 
They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed . 
On arriving before the closed gate and the porter 's pavilion Fauchelevent , who held the grave-digger 's card in his hand , dropped it into the box , the porter pulled the rope , the gate opened , and they went out . 
`` How well everything is going ! '' 
said Fauchelevent ; `` what a capital idea that was of yours , Father Madeleine ! '' 
They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world . 
In the neighborhood of the cemetery , a shovel and pick are equal to two passports . 
The Rue Vaugirard was deserted . 
`` Father Madeleine , '' said Fauchelevent as they went along , and raising his eyes to the houses , `` Your eyes are better than mine . 
Show me No. 87 . '' 
`` Here it is , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` There is no one in the street , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` Give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me . '' 
Fauchelevent entered No. 87 , ascended to the very top , guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret , and knocked in the dark , at the door of an attic . 
A voice replied : `` Come in . '' 
It was Gribier 's voice . 
Fauchelevent opened the door . 
The grave-digger 's dwelling was , like all such wretched habitations , an unfurnished and encumbered garret . 
A packing-case -- a coffin , perhaps -- took the place of a commode , a butter-pot served for a drinking-fountain , a straw mattress served for a bed , the floor served instead of tables and chairs . 
In a corner , on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet , a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap . 
The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned . 
One would have said that there had been an earthquake `` for one . '' 
The covers were displaced , the rags scattered about , the jug broken , the mother had been crying , the children had probably been beaten ; traces of a vigorous and ill-tempered search . 
It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card , and had made everybody in the garret , from the jug to his wife , responsible for its loss . 
He wore an air of desperation . 
But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success . 
He entered and said : -- `` I have brought you back your shovel and pick . '' 
Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction . 
`` Is it you , peasant ? '' 
`` And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery . '' 
And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor . 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
demanded Gribier . 
`` The meaning of it is , that you dropped your card out of your pocket , that I found it on the ground after you were gone , that I have buried the corpse , that I have filled the grave , that I have done your work , that the porter will return your card to you , and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs . 
There you have it , conscript . '' 
`` Thanks , villager ! '' 
exclaimed Gribier , radiant . 
`` The next time I will pay for the drinks . '' 
A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY An hour later , in the darkness of night , two men and a child presented themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus . 
The elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped . 
They were Fauchelevent , Jean Valjean , and Cosette . 
The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer 's in the Rue du Chemin-Vert , where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day . 
Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing . 
She trembled to such a degree that she wept . 
She had neither eaten nor slept . 
The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions , without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze . 
Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days . 
She divined that they were passing through a crisis . 
She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to `` be good . '' 
Who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words , pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being : Say nothing ! 
Fear is mute . 
Moreover , no one guards a secret like a child . 
But when , at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours , she beheld Jean Valjean again , she gave vent to such a cry of joy , that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry , would have guessed that it issued from an abyss . 
Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words . 
All the doors opened . 
Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in . 
The porter , who had received his instructions , opened the little servant 's door which connected the courtyard with the garden , and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago , in the wall at the bottom of the court , which faced the carriage entrance . 
The porter admitted all three of them through this door , and from that point they reached the inner , reserved parlor where Fauchelevent , on the preceding day , had received his orders from the prioress . 
The prioress , rosary in hand , was waiting for them . 
A vocal mother , with her veil lowered , stood beside her . 
A discreet candle lighted , one might almost say , made a show of lighting the parlor . 
The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review . 
There is nothing which examines like a downcast eye . 
Then she questioned him : -- `` You are the brother ? '' 
`` Yes , reverend Mother , '' replied Fauchelevent . 
`` What is your name ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Ultime Fauchelevent . '' 
He really had had a brother named Ultime , who was dead . 
`` Where do you come from ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` From Picquigny , near Amiens . '' 
`` What is your age ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Fifty . '' 
`` What is your profession ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Gardener . '' 
`` Are you a good Christian ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Every one is in the family . '' 
`` Is this your little girl ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Yes , reverend Mother . '' 
`` You are her father ? '' 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` Her grandfather . '' 
The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice `` He answers well . '' 
Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word . 
The prioress looked attentively at Cosette , and said half aloud to the vocal mother : -- `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor , then the prioress turned round and said : -- `` Father Fauvent , you will get another knee-cap with a bell . 
Two will be required now . '' 
On the following day , therefore , two bells were audible in the garden , and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils . 
At the extreme end of the garden , under the trees , two men , Fauvent and another man , were visible as they dug side by side . 
An enormous event . 
Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other : `` He is an assistant gardener . '' 
The vocal mothers added : `` He is a brother of Father Fauvent . '' 
Jean Valjean was , in fact , regularly installed ; he had his belled knee-cap ; henceforth he was official . 
His name was Ultime Fauchelevent . 
The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress 's observation upon Cosette : `` She will grow up ugly . '' 
The prioress , that pronounced prognosticator , immediately took a fancy to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil .
