He asked to be conducted to M. d'Herblay . 
Two soldiers , at a signal from a sergeant , marched him between them , and escorted him . 
Aramis was upon the quay . 
The envoy presented himself before the bishop of Vannes . 
The darkness was almost absolute , notwithstanding the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following Aramis in his rounds . 
`` Well , Jonathan , from whom do you come ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , from those who captured me . '' 
`` Who captured you ? '' 
`` You know , monseigneur , we set out in search of our comrades ? '' 
`` Yes ; and afterwards ? '' 
`` Well ! 
monseigneur , within a short league we were captured by a chasse maree belonging to the king . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Of which king ? '' 
cried Porthos . 
Jonathan started . 
`` Speak ! '' 
continued the bishop . 
`` We were captured , monseigneur , and joined to those who had been taken yesterday morning . '' 
`` What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , to prevent us from telling you , '' replied Jonathan . 
Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend . 
`` And they have released you to-day ? '' 
asked he . 
`` That I might tell you they have captured us , monsieur . '' 
`` Trouble upon trouble , '' thought honest Porthos . 
During this time Aramis was reflecting . 
`` Humph ! '' 
said he , `` then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the coasts ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Who commands it ? '' 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos . 
`` I believe that is the name . '' 
`` And did he give you this letter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Bring the torches nearer . '' 
`` It is his writing , '' said Porthos . 
Aramis eagerly read the following lines : `` Order of the king to take Belle-Isle ; or to put the garrison to the sword , if they resist ; order to make prisoners of all the men of the garrison ; signed , D'ARTAGNAN , who , the day before yesterday , arrested M. Fouquet , for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile . '' 
Aramis turned pale , and crushed the paper in his hands . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Nothing , my friend , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Jonathan ? '' 
`` Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Did you speak to M. d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` That for ampler information , he would speak with monseigneur . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` On board his own vessel . '' 
`` On board his vessel ! '' 
and Porthos repeated , `` On board his vessel ! '' 
`` M. le mousquetaire , '' continued Jonathan , `` told me to take you both on board my canoe , and bring you to him . '' 
`` Let us go at once , '' exclaimed Porthos . 
`` Dear D'Artagnan ! '' 
But Aramis stopped him . 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
cried he . 
`` Who knows that it is not a snare ? '' 
`` Of the other king 's ? '' 
said Porthos , mysteriously . 
`` A snare , in fact ! 
That 's what it is , my friend . '' 
`` Very possibly ; what is to be done , then ? 
If D'Artagnan sends for us - '' `` Who assures you that D'Artagnan sends for us ? '' 
`` Well , but - but his writing - '' `` Writing is easily counterfeited . 
This looks counterfeited - unsteady - '' `` You are always right ; but , in the meantime , we know nothing . '' 
Aramis was silent . 
`` It is true , '' said the good Porthos , `` we do not want to know anything . '' 
`` What shall I do ? '' 
asked Jonathan . 
`` You will return on board this captain 's vessel . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I comprehend ! '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Yes , monseigneur , '' replied Jonathan ; `` but if the captain should refuse to come to Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` If he refuses , as we have cannon , we will make use of them . '' 
`` What ! 
against D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` If it is D'Artagnan , Porthos , he will come . 
Go , Jonathan , go ! '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I no longer comprehend anything , '' murmured Porthos . 
`` I will make you comprehend it all , my dear friend ; the time for it has come ; sit down upon this gun-carriage , open your ears , and listen well to me . '' 
`` Oh ! 
pardieu ! 
I will listen , no fear of that . '' 
`` May I depart , monseigneur ? '' 
cried Jonathan . 
`` Yes , begone , and bring back an answer . 
Allow the canoe to pass , you men there ! '' 
And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet . 
Aramis took Porthos by the hand , and commenced his explanations . 
: Explanations by Aramis . 
`` What I have to say to you , friend Porthos , will probably surprise you , but it may prove instructive . '' 
`` I like to be surprised , '' said Porthos , in a kindly tone ; `` do not spare me , therefore , I beg . 
I am hardened against emotions ; do n't fear , speak out . '' 
`` It is difficult , Porthos - difficult ; for , in truth , I warn you a second time , I have very strange things , very extraordinary things , to tell you . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you speak so well , my friend , that I could listen to you for days together . 
Speak , then , I beg - and - stop , I have an idea : I will , to make your task more easy , I will , to assist you in telling me such things , question you . '' 
`` I shall be pleased at your doing so . '' 
`` What are we going to fight for , Aramis ? '' 
`` If you ask me many such questions as that - if you would render my task the easier by interrupting my revelations thus , Porthos , you will not help me at all . 
So far , on the contrary , that is the very Gordian knot . 
But , my friend , with a man like you , good , generous , and devoted , the confession must be bravely made . 
I have deceived you , my worthy friend . '' 
`` You have deceived me ! '' 
`` Good Heavens ! 
yes . '' 
`` Was it for my good , Aramis ? '' 
`` I thought so , Porthos ; I thought so sincerely , my friend . '' 
`` Then , '' said the honest seigneur of Bracieux , `` you have rendered me a service , and I thank you for it ; for if you had not deceived me , I might have deceived myself . 
In what , then , have you deceived me , tell me ? '' 
`` In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV. , at this moment , is directing his efforts . '' 
`` The usurper ! '' 
said Porthos , scratching his head . 
`` That is - well , I do not quite clearly comprehend ! '' 
`` He is one of the two kings who are contending fro the crown of France . '' 
`` Very well ! 
Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` You have hit the matter in one word . '' 
`` It follows that - '' `` It follows that we are rebels , my poor friend . '' 
`` The devil ! 
the devil ! '' 
cried Porthos , much disappointed . 
`` Oh ! 
but , dear Porthos , be calm , we shall still find means of getting out of the affair , trust me . '' 
`` It is not that which makes me uneasy , '' replied Porthos ; `` that which alone touches me is that ugly word rebels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
but - '' `` And so , according to this , the duchy that was promised me - '' `` It was the usurper that was to give it to you . '' 
`` And that is not the same thing , Aramis , '' said Porthos , majestically . 
`` My friend , if it had only depended upon me , you should have become a prince . '' 
Porthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way . 
`` That is where you have been wrong , '' continued he , `` in deceiving me ; for that promised duchy I reckoned upon . 
Oh ! 
I reckoned upon it seriously , knowing you to be a man of your word , Aramis . '' 
`` Poor Porthos ! 
pardon me , I implore you ! '' 
`` So , then , '' continued Porthos , without replying to the bishop 's prayer , `` so then , it seems , I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV . ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I will settle all that , my good friend , I will settle all that . 
I will take it on myself alone ! '' 
`` Aramis ! '' 
`` No , no , Porthos , I conjure you , let me act . 
No false generosity ! 
No inopportune devotedness ! 
You knew nothing of my projects . 
You have done nothing of yourself . 
With me it is different . 
I alone am the author of this plot . 
I stood in need of my inseparable companion ; I called upon you , and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device , ` All for one , one for all . ' 
My crime is that I was an egotist . '' 
`` Now , that is a word I like , '' said Porthos ; `` and seeing that you have acted entirely for yourself , it is impossible for me to blame you . 
It is natural . '' 
And upon this sublime reflection , Porthos pressed his friend 's hand cordially . 
In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul , Aramis felt his own littleness . 
It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before real superiority of heart , which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind . 
He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend . 
`` Now , '' said Porthos , `` that we have come to an explanation , now that I am perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV. , I think , my friend , it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of all this . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth . 
The king Louis XIV . 
has no longer now but one enemy : that enemy is myself , myself alone . 
I have made you a prisoner , you have followed me , to-day I liberate you , you fly back to your prince . 
You can perceive , Porthos , there is not one difficulty in all this . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` I am quite sure of it . '' 
`` Then why , '' said the admirable good sense of Porthos , `` then why , if we are in such an easy position , why , my friend , do we prepare cannon , muskets , and engines of all sorts ? 
It seems to me it would be much more simple to say to Captain d'Artagnan : ` My dear friend , we have been mistaken ; that error is to be repaired ; open the door to us , let us pass through , and we will say good-bye . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
that ! '' 
said Aramis , shaking his head . 
`` Why do you say ` that ' ? 
Do you not approve of my plan , my friend ? '' 
`` I see a difficulty in it . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` The hypothesis that D'Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us to defend ourselves . '' 
`` What ! 
defend ourselves against D'Artagnan ? 
Folly ! 
Against the good D'Artagnan ! '' 
Aramis once more replied by shaking his head . 
`` Porthos , '' at length said he , `` if I have had the matches lighted and the guns pointed , if I have had the signal of alarm sounded , if I have called every man to his post upon the ramparts , those good ramparts of Belle - Isle which you have so well fortified , it was not for nothing . 
Wait to judge ; or rather , no , do not wait - '' `` What can I do ? '' 
`` If I knew , my friend , I would have told you . '' 
`` But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves : - a boat , and away for France - where - '' `` My dear friend , '' said Aramis , smiling with a strong shade of sadness , `` do not let us reason like children ; let us be men in council and in execution . 
- But , hark ! 
I hear a hail for landing at the port . 
Attention , Porthos , serious attention ! '' 
`` It is D'Artagnan , no doubt , '' said Porthos , in a voice of thunder , approaching the parapet . 
`` Yes , it is I , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , running lightly up the steps of the mole , and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which his two friends waited for him . 
As soon as he came towards them , Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D'Artagnan , treading apparently in his very steps . 
The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole , when half-way up . 
His companions imitated him . 
`` Make your men draw back , '' cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis ; `` let them retire out of hearing . '' 
This order , given by Porthos , was executed immediately . 
Then D'Artagnan , turning towards him who followed him : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` we are no longer on board the king 's fleet , where , in virtue of your order , you spoke so arrogantly to me , just now . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the officer , `` I did not speak arrogantly to you ; I simply , but rigorously , obeyed instructions . 
I was commanded to follow you . 
I follow you . 
I am directed not to allow you to communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do ; I am in duty bound , accordingly , to overhear your conversations . '' 
D'Artagnan trembled with rage , and Porthos and Aramis , who heard this dialogue , trembled likewise , but with uneasiness and fear . 
D'Artagnan , biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him exasperation , closely to be followed by an explosion , approached the officer . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , so much the more impressive , that , affecting calm , it threatened tempest - `` monsieur , when I sent a canoe hither , you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle . 
You produced an order to that effect ; and , in my turn , I instantly showed you the note I had written . 
When the skipper of the boat sent by me returned , when I received the reply of these two gentlemen '' -LRB- and he pointed to Aramis and Porthos -RRB- , `` you heard every word of what the messenger said . 
All that was plainly in your orders , all that was well executed , very punctually , was it not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' stammered the officer ; `` yes , without doubt , but - '' `` Monsieur , '' continued D'Artagnan , growing warm - `` monsieur , when I manifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle , you demanded to accompany me ; I did not hesitate ; I brought you with me . 
You are now at Belle-Isle , are you not ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; but - '' `` But - the question no longer is of M. Colbert , who has given you that order , or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions ; the question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d'Artagnan , and who is alone with M. d'Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet of salt water ; a bad position for that man , a bad position , monsieur ! 
I warn you . '' 
`` But , monsieur , if I am a restraint upon you , '' said the officer , timidly , and almost faintly , `` it is my duty which - '' `` Monsieur , you have had the misfortune , either you or those that sent you , to insult me . 
It is done . 
I can not seek redress from those who employ you , - they are unknown to me , or are at too great a distance . 
But you are under my hand , and I swear that if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen , I swear to you by my name , I will cleave your head in two with my sword , and pitch you into the water . 
Oh ! 
it will happen ! 
it will happen ! 
I have only been six times angry in my life , monsieur , and all five preceding times I killed my man . '' 
The officer did not stir ; he became pale under this terrible threat , but replied with simplicity , `` Monsieur , you are wrong in acting against my orders . '' 
Porthos and Aramis , mute and trembling at the top of the parapet , cried to the musketeer , `` Good D'Artagnan , take care ! '' 
D'Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence , raised his foot with ominous calmness to mount the stair , and turned round , sword in hand , to see if the officer followed him . 
The officer made a sign of the cross and stepped up . 
Porthos and Aramis , who knew their D'Artagnan , uttered a cry , and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already heard . 
But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand , - `` Monsieur , '' said he to the officer , in an agitated voice , `` you are a brave man . 
You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to you now . '' 
`` Speak , Monsieur d'Artagnan , speak , '' replied the officer . 
`` These gentlemen we have just seen , and against whom you have orders , are my friends . '' 
`` I know they are , monsieur . '' 
`` You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions prescribe . '' 
`` I understand your reserve . '' 
`` Very well ; permit me , then , to converse with them without a witness . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , if I yield to your request , if I do that which you beg me , I break my word ; but if I do not do it , I disoblige you . 
I prefer the one dilemma to the other . 
Converse with your friends , and do not despise me , monsieur , for doing this for your sake , whom I esteem and honor ; do not despise me for committing for you , and you alone , an unworthy act . '' 
D'Artagnan , much agitated , threw his arm round the neck of the young man , and then went up to his friends . 
The officer , enveloped in his cloak , sat down on the damp , weed-covered steps . 
`` Well ! '' 
said D'Artagnan to his friends , `` such is my position , judge for yourselves . '' 
All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth . 
`` What is the meaning of all these preparations ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Not any , I assure you , my dear captain ; for , in fact , I have done nothing , no more has Aramis , '' the worthy baron hastened to say . 
D'Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate , which penetrated that hardened heart . 
`` Dear Porthos ! '' 
cried the bishop of Vannes . 
`` You see what is being done against you , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` interception of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle . 
Your means of transport seized . 
If you had endeavored to fly , you would have fallen into the hands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions , on the watch for you . 
The king wants you to be taken , and he will take you . '' 
D'Artagnan tore at his gray mustache . 
Aramis grew somber , Porthos angry . 
`` My idea was this , '' continued D'Artagnan : `` to make you both come on board , to keep you near me , and restore you your liberty . 
But now , who can say , when I return to my ship , I may not find a superior ; that I may not find secret orders which will take from me my command , and give it to another , who will dispose of me and you without hope of help ? '' 
`` We must remain at Belle-Isle , '' said Aramis , resolutely ; `` and I assure you , for my part , I will not surrender easily . '' 
Porthos said nothing . 
D'Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend . 
`` I have another trial to make of this officer , of this brave fellow who accompanies me , and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy ; for it denotes an honest man , who , though an enemy , is a thousand times better than a complaisant coward . 
Let us try to learn from him what his instructions are , and what his orders permit or forbid . '' 
`` Let us try , '' said Aramis . 
D'Artagnan went to the parapet , leaned over towards the steps of the mole , and called the officer , who immediately came up . 
`` Monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each other , `` monsieur , if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here , what would you do ? '' 
`` I should not oppose it , monsieur ; but having direct explicit orders to put them under guard , I should detain them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` That 's all over , '' said Aramis , gloomily . 
Porthos did not stir . 
`` But still take Porthos , '' said the bishop of Vannes . 
`` He can prove to the king , and I will help him do so , and you too , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that he had nothing to do with this affair . '' 
`` Hum ! '' 
said D'Artagnan . 
`` Will you come ? 
Will you follow me , Porthos ? 
The king is merciful . '' 
`` I want time for reflection , '' said Porthos . 
`` You will remain here , then ? '' 
`` Until fresh orders , '' said Aramis , with vivacity . 
`` Until we have an idea , '' resumed D'Artagnan ; `` and I now believe that will not be long , for I have one already . '' 
`` Let us say adieu , then , '' said Aramis ; `` but in truth , my good Porthos , you ought to go . '' 
`` No , '' said the latter , laconically . 
`` As you please , '' replied Aramis , a little wounded in his susceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion . 
`` Only I am reassured by the promise of an idea from D'Artagnan , an idea I fancy I have divined . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the musketeer , placing his ear near Aramis 's mouth . 
The latter spoke several words rapidly , to which D'Artagnan replied , `` That is it , precisely . '' 
`` Infallible ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` During the first emotion this resolution will cause , take care of yourself , Aramis . '' 
`` Oh ! 
do n't be afraid . '' 
`` Now , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan to the officer , `` thanks , a thousand thanks ! 
You have made yourself three friends for life . '' 
`` Yes , '' added Aramis . 
Porthos alone said nothing , but merely bowed . 
D'Artagnan , having tenderly embraced his two old friends , left Belle-Isle with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had saddled him . 
Thus , with the exception of the explanation with which the worthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied , nothing had changed in appearance in the fate of one or the other , `` Only , '' said Aramis , `` there is D'Artagnan 's idea . '' 
D'Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea he had discovered . 
Now , we know that whatever D'Artagnan did examine , according to custom , daylight was certain to illuminate . 
As to the officer , now grown mute again , he had full time for meditation . 
Therefore , on putting his foot on board his vessel , moored within cannon - shot of the island , the captain of the musketeers had already got together all his means , offensive and defensive . 
He immediately assembled his council , which consisted of the officers serving under his orders . 
These were eight in number ; a chief of the maritime forces ; a major directing the artillery ; an engineer , the officer we are acquainted with , and four lieutenants . 
Having assembled them , D'Artagnan arose , took of his hat , and addressed them thus : `` Gentlemen , I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer , and I have found in it a good and solid garrison ; moreover , preparations are made for a defense that may prove troublesome . 
I therefore intend to send for two of the principal officers of the place , that we may converse with them . 
Having separated them from their troops and cannon , we shall be better able to deal with them ; particularly by reasoning with them . 
Is not this your opinion , gentlemen ? '' 
The major of artillery rose . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , with respect , but firmness , `` I have heard you say that the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense . 
The place is then , as you know , determined on rebellion ? '' 
D'Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply ; but he was not the man to allow himself to be subdued by a trifle , and resumed : `` Monsieur , '' said he , `` your reply is just . 
But you are ignorant that Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet 's , and that former monarchs gave the right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people . '' 
The major made a movement . 
`` Oh ! 
do not interrupt me , '' continued D'Artagnan . 
`` You are going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the English was not a right to arm themselves against their king . 
But it is not M. Fouquet , I suppose , who holds Belle-Isle at this moment , since I arrested M. Fouquet the day before yesterday . 
Now the inhabitants and defenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest . 
You would announce it to them in vain . 
It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary , so unexpected , that they would not believe you . 
A Breton serves his master , and not his masters ; he serves his master till he has seen him dead . 
Now the Bretons , as far as I know , have not seen the body of M. Fouquet . 
It is not , then , surprising they hold out against that which is neither M. Fouquet nor his signature . '' 
The major bowed in token of assent . 
`` That is why , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I propose to cause two of the principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel . 
They will see you , gentlemen ; they will see the forces we have at our disposal ; they will consequently know to what they have to trust , and the fate that attends them , in case of rebellion . 
We will affirm to them , upon our honor , that M. Fouquet is a prisoner , and that all resistance can only be prejudicial to them . 
We will tell them that at the first cannon fired , there will be no further hope of mercy from the king . 
Then , or so at least I trust , they will resist no longer . 
They will yield up without fighting , and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue . '' 
The officer who had followed D'Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to speak , but D'Artagnan interrupted him . 
`` Yes , I know what you are going to tell me , monsieur ; I know that there is an order of the king 's to prevent all secret communications with the defenders of Belle-Isle , and that is exactly why I do not offer to communicate except in presence of my staff . '' 
And D'Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers , who knew him well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension . 
The officers looked at each other as if to read each other 's opinions in their eyes , with the intention of evidently acting , should they agree , according to the desire of D'Artagnan . 
And already the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos and Aramis , when the king 's officer drew from a pocket a folded paper , which he placed in the hands of D'Artagnan . 
This paper bore upon its superscription the number 1 . 
`` What , more ! '' 
murmured the surprised captain . 
`` Read , monsieur , '' said the officer , with a courtesy that was not free from sadness . 
D'Artagnan , full of mistrust , unfolded the paper , and read these words : `` Prohibition to M. d'Artagnan to assemble any council whatever , or to deliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners shot . 
Signed - LOUIS . '' 
D'Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole body , and with a gracious smile : `` That is well , monsieur , '' said he ; `` the king 's orders shall be complied with . '' 
: Result of the Ideas of the King , and the Ideas of D'Artagnan . 
The blow was direct . 
It was severe , mortal . 
D'Artagnan , furious at having been anticipated by an idea of the king 's , did not despair , however , even yet ; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle , he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends . 
`` Gentlemen , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the king has charged some other than myself with his secret orders , it must be because I no longer possess his confidence , and I should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions . 
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king . 
I tender it before you all , enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of France , in such a way as not to compromise the safety of the forces his majesty has confided to me . 
For this purpose , return all to your posts ; within an hour , we shall have the ebb of the tide . 
To your posts , gentlemen ! 
I suppose , '' added he , on seeing that all prepared to obey him , except the surveillant officer , `` you have no orders to object , this time ? '' 
And D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words . 
This plan would prove the safety of his friends . 
The blockade once raised , they might embark immediately , and set sail for England or Spain , without fear of being molested . 
Whilst they were making their escape , D'Artagnan would return to the king ; would justify his return by the indignation which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him ; he would be sent back with full powers , and he would take Belle-Isle ; that is to say , the cage , after the birds had flown . 
But to this plan the officer opposed a further order of the king 's . 
It was thus conceived : `` From the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving in his resignation , he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the expedition , and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to no longer obey him . 
Moreover , the said Monsieur d'Artagnan , having lost that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle , shall set out immediately for France , accompanied by the officer who will have remitted the message to him , and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he is answerable . '' 
Brave and careless as he was , D'Artagnan turned pale . 
Everything had been calculated with a depth of precognition which , for the first time in thirty years , recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible logic of the great cardinal . 
He leaned his head on his hand , thoughtful , scarcely breathing . 
`` If I were to put this order in my pocket , '' thought he , `` who would know it , what would prevent my doing it ? 
Before the king had had time to be informed , I should have saved those poor fellows yonder . 
Let us exercise some small audacity ! 
My head is not one of those the executioner strikes off for disobedience . 
We will disobey ! '' 
But at the moment he was about to adopt this plan , he saw the officers around him reading similar orders , which the passive agent of the thoughts of that infernal Colbert had distributed to them . 
This contingency of his disobedience had been foreseen - as all the rest had been . 
`` Monsieur , '' said the officer , coming up to him , `` I await your good pleasure to depart . '' 
`` I am ready , monsieur , '' replied D'Artagnan , grinding his teeth . 
The officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d'Artagnan and himself . 
At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage . 
`` How , '' stammered he , `` will you carry on the directions of the different corps ? '' 
`` When you are gone , monsieur , '' replied the commander of the fleet , `` it is to me the command of the whole is committed . '' 
`` Then , monsieur , '' rejoined Colbert 's man , addressing the new leader , `` it is for you that this last order remitted to me is intended . 
Let us see your powers . '' 
`` Here they are , '' said the officer , exhibiting the royal signature . 
`` Here are your instructions , '' replied the officer , placing the folded paper in his hands ; and turning round towards D'Artagnan , `` Come , monsieur , '' said he , in an agitated voice -LRB- such despair did he behold in that man of iron -RRB- , `` do me the favor to depart at once . '' 
`` Immediately ! '' 
articulated D'Artagnan , feebly , subdued , crushed by implacable impossibility . 
And he painfully subsided into the little boat , which started , favored by wind and tide , for the coast of France . 
The king 's guards embarked with him . 
The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes quickly , and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough to incline the king to mercy . 
The bark flew like a swallow . 
D'Artagnan distinctly saw the land of France profiled in black against the white clouds of night . 
`` Ah ! 
monsieur , '' said he , in a low voice , to the officer to whom , for an hour , he had ceased speaking , `` what would I give to know the instructions for the new commander ! 
They are all pacific , are they not ? 
and - '' He did not finish ; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the waves , another , and two or three still louder . 
D'Artagnan shuddered . 
`` They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle , '' replied the officer . 
The canoe had just touched the soil of France . 
: The Ancestors of Porthos . 
When D'Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos , the latter returned to the principal fort , in order to converse with greater liberty . 
Porthos , still thoughtful , was a restraint on Aramis , whose mind had never felt itself more free . 
`` Dear Porthos , '' said he , suddenly , `` I will explain D'Artagnan 's idea to you . '' 
`` What idea , Aramis ? '' 
`` An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours . '' 
`` Ah ! 
indeed ! '' 
said Porthos , much astonished . 
`` Let us hear it . '' 
`` Did you remark , in the scene our friend had with the officer , that certain orders constrained him with regard to us ? '' 
`` Yes , I did notice that . '' 
`` Well ! 
D'Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king , and during the confusion that will result from his absence , we will get away , or rather you will get away , Porthos , if there is possibility of flight for only one . '' 
Here Porthos shook his head and replied : `` We will escape together , Aramis , or we will stay together . '' 
`` Thine is a right , a generous heart , '' said Aramis , `` only your melancholy uneasiness affects me . '' 
`` I am not uneasy , '' said Porthos . 
`` Then you are angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you . '' 
`` Then why , my friend , do you put on such a dismal countenance ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; I am making my will . '' 
And while saying these words , the good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis . 
`` Your will ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
`` What , then ! 
do you think yourself lost ? '' 
`` I feel fatigued . 
It is the first time , and there is a custom in our family . '' 
`` What is it , my friend ? '' 
`` My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` then your grandfather must have been Samson himself . '' 
`` No ; his name was Antoine . 
Well ! 
he was about my age , when , setting out one day for the chase , he felt his legs weak , the man who had never known what weakness was before . '' 
`` What was the meaning of that fatigue , my friend ? '' 
`` Nothing good , as you will see ; for having set out , complaining still of weakness of the legs , he met a wild boar , which made head against him ; he missed him with his arquebuse , and was ripped up by the beast and died immediately . '' 
`` There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself , dear Porthos . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you will see . 
My father was as strong again as I am . 
He was a rough soldier , under Henry III . 
and Henry IV. ; his name was not Antoine , but Gaspard , the same as M. de Coligny . 
Always on horseback , he had never known what lassitude was . 
One evening , as he rose from table , his legs failed him . '' 
`` He had supped heartily , perhaps , '' said Aramis , `` and that was why he staggered . '' 
`` Bah ! 
A friend of M. de Bassompierre , nonsense ! 
No , no , he was astonished at this lassitude , and said to my mother , who laughed at him , ` Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar , as the late M. du Vallon , my father did ? ' '' 
`` Well ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Well , having this weakness , my father insisted upon going down into the garden , instead of going to bed ; his foot slipped on the first stair , the staircase was steep ; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed . 
The hinge gashed his temple ; and he was stretched out dead upon the spot . '' 
Aramis raised his eyes to his friend : `` These are two extraordinary circumstances , '' said he ; `` let us not infer that there may succeed a third . 
It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious , my brave Porthos . 
Besides , when were your legs known to fail ? 
Never have you stood so firm , so haughtily ; why , you could carry a house on your shoulders . '' 
`` At this moment , '' said Porthos , `` I feel myself pretty active ; but at times I vacillate ; I sink ; and lately this phenomenon , as you say , has occurred four times . 
I will not say this frightens me , but it annoys me . 
Life is an agreeable thing . 
I have money ; I have fine estates ; I have horses that I love ; I have also friends that I love : D'Artagnan , Athos , Raoul , and you . '' 
The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship . 
Aramis pressed his hand : `` We will still live many years , '' said he , `` to preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men . 
Trust yourself to me , my friend ; we have no reply from D'Artagnan , that is a good sign . 
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas . 
On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! '' 
`` That is a grand idea . 
What shall we gain by it ? '' 
`` We shall gain this - nobody knows that grotto , or rather its issue , except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island ; we shall gain this - that if the island is occupied , the scouts , seeing no bark upon the shore , will never imagine we can escape , and will cease to watch . '' 
`` I understand . '' 
`` Well ! 
that weakness in the legs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
better , much , just now . '' 
`` You see , then , plainly , that everything conspires to give us quietude and hope . 
D'Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free . 
No royal fleet or descent to be dreaded . 
Vive Dieu ! 
Porthos , we have still half a century of magnificent adventure before us , and if I once touch Spanish ground , I swear to you , '' added the bishop with terrible energy , `` that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be . '' 
`` We live by hope , '' said Porthos , enlivened by the warmth of his companion . 
All at once a cry resounded in their ears : `` To arms ! 
to arms ! '' 
This cry , repeated by a hundred throats , piercing the chamber where the two friends were conversing , carried surprise to one , and uneasiness to the other . 
Aramis opened the window ; he saw a crowd of people running with flambeaux . 
Women were seeking places of safety , the armed population were hastening to their posts . 
`` The fleet ! 
the fleet ! '' 
cried a soldier , who recognized Aramis . 
`` The fleet ? '' 
repeated the latter . 
`` Within half cannon-shot , '' continued the soldier . 
`` To arms ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` To arms ! '' 
repeated Porthos , formidably . 
And both rushed forth towards the mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries .
