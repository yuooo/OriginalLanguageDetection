my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , I should be very glad to sleep . '' 
`` Who hinders you ? '' 
`` Why , you in the first place . '' 
`` I ? 
Oh , monseigneur ! '' 
`` No doubt you do . 
Is it at Nantes as at Paris ? 
Do you not come in the king 's name ? '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , monseigneur , '' replied the captain , `` leave the king alone ! 
The day on which I shall come on the part of the king , for the purpose you mean , take my word for it , I will not leave you long in doubt . 
You will see me place my hand on my sword , according to the ordonnance , and you will hear my say at once , in ceremonial voice , ` Monseigneur , in the name of the king , I arrest you ! ' '' 
`` You promise me that frankness ? '' 
said the superintendent . 
`` Upon my honor ! 
But we have not come to that , believe me . '' 
`` What makes you think that , M. d'Artagnan ? 
For my part , I think quite the contrary . '' 
`` I have heard speak of nothing of the kind , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Indeed , no . 
You are an agreeable man , in spite of your fever . 
The king should not , can not help loving you , at the bottom of his heart . '' 
Fouquet 's expression implied doubt . 
`` But M. Colbert ? '' 
said he ; `` does M. Colbert love me as much as you say ? '' 
`` I am not speaking of M. Colbert , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He is an exceptional man . 
He does not love you ; so much is very possible ; but , mordioux ! 
the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little trouble . '' 
`` Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend ? '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` and that , upon my life ! 
I have never met with a man of your intelligence , and heart ? '' 
`` You are pleased to say so , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Why did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment ? '' 
`` Blind that we are ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Your voice is getting hoarse , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` drink , monseigneur , drink ! '' 
And he offered him a cup of tisane , with the most friendly cordiality ; Fouquet took it , and thanked him by a gentle smile . 
`` Such things only happen to me , '' said the musketeer . 
`` I have passed ten years under your very beard , while you were rolling about tons of gold . 
You were clearing an annual pension of four millions ; you never observed me ; and you find out there is such a person in the world , just at the moment you - '' `` Just at the moment I am about to fall , '' interrupted Fouquet . 
`` That is true , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` But you thought so ; and that is the same thing . 
Well ! 
if I fall , take my word as truth , I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself , as I strike my brow , ` Fool ! 
fool ! 
- stupid mortal ! 
You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand , and you did not employ him , you did not enrich him ! ' '' 
`` You overwhelm me , '' said the captain . 
`` I esteem you greatly . '' 
`` There exists another man , then , who does not think as M. Colbert thinks , '' said the surintendant . 
`` How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination ! 
He is worse than fever ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have good cause , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Judge for yourself . '' 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters , and the hypocritical persecution of Colbert . 
`` Is not this a clear sign of my ruin ? '' 
D'Artagnan became very serious . 
`` That is true , '' he said . 
`` Yes ; it has an unsavory odor , as M. de Treville used to say . '' 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look . 
`` Am I not clearly designated in that , captain ? 
Is not the king bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris , where I have so many creatures , and to possess himself of Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` Where M. d'Herblay is , '' added D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet raised his head . 
`` As for me , monseigneur , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I can assure you the king has said nothing to me against you . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` The king commanded me to set out for Nantes , it is true ; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres . '' 
`` My friend . '' 
`` To M. de Gesvres , yes , monseigneur , '' continued the musketeer , whose eye s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips . 
`` The king , moreover , commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers , which is apparently superfluous , as the country is quite quiet . '' 
`` A brigade ! '' 
said Fouquet , raising himself upon his elbow . 
`` Ninety-six horsemen , yes , monseigneur . 
The same number as were employed in arresting MM . 
de Chalais , de Cinq-Mars , and Montmorency . '' 
Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? '' 
`` I ? 
- to what end ? 
Are you threatened ? 
Only there really is an order with respect to carriages and boats - '' `` An order ? '' 
`` Yes ; but it can not concern you - a simple measure of police . '' 
`` What is it , captain ? 
- what is it ? '' 
`` To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes , without a pass , signed by the king . '' 
`` Great God ! 
but - '' D'Artagnan began to laugh . 
`` All that is not to be put into execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes . 
So that you see plainly , monseigneur , the order in nowise concerns you . '' 
Fouquet became thoughtful , and D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation . 
`` It is evident , by my thus confiding to you the orders which have been given to me , that I am friendly towards you , and that I am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you . '' 
`` Without doubt ! 
- without doubt ! '' 
said Fouquet , still absent . 
`` Let us recapitulate , '' said the captain , his glance beaming with earnestness . 
`` A special guard about the castle , in which your lodging is to be , is it not ? '' 
`` Do you know the castle ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment . 
He had not reached the steps of the vestibule , when Fouquet , quite beside himself , hung to the bell-rope , and shouted , `` My horses ! 
- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale . 
`` Let us be gone ! 
Let us be gone ! '' 
cried Fouquet , as soon as he saw him . 
`` It is too late ! '' 
said the surintendant 's poor friend . 
`` Too late ! 
- why ? '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the castle . 
`` What does that mean , Gourville ? '' 
`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup . 
D'Artagnan , when the king had passed under the arch , directed his steps towards the house Fouquet was in ; but so slowly , and stopping so frequently to speak to his musketeers , drawn up like a hedge , that it might be said he was counting the seconds , or the steps , before accomplishing his object . 
Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the court . 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , on perceiving him , `` are you still there , monseigneur ? '' 
And that word still completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had paid him . 
The surintendant sighed deeply . 
`` Good heavens ! 
yes , monsieur , '' replied he . 
`` The arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed . '' 
`` Oh , then you know that the king has arrived ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , I have seen him ; and this time you come from him - '' `` To inquire after you , monseigneur ; and , if your health is not too bad , to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle . '' 
`` Directly , Monsieur d'Artagnan , directly ! '' 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
said the captain , `` now the king is come , there is no more walking for anybody - no more free will ; the password governs all now , you as much as me , me as much as you . '' 
Fouquet heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage , so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by D'Artagnan , whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . 
: How the King , Louis XIV. , Played His Little Part . 
As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of Nantes , a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect , and gave him a letter . 
D'Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet , and pushed him away , but the message had been given to the surintendant . 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it , and instantly a vague terror , which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate , was painted on the countenance of the first minister . 
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm , and passed on towards the king 's apartments . 
D'Artagnan , through the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs , saw , as he went up behind Fouquet , the man who had delivered the note , looking round him on the place and making signs to several persons , who disappeared in the adjacent streets , after having themselves repeated the signals . 
Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken , - a terrace which abutted on the little corridor , at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located . 
Here D'Artagnan passed on before the surintendant , whom , till that time , he had respectfully accompanied , and entered the royal cabinet . 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Louis XIV. , who , on perceiving him , threw on to the table covered with papers a large green cloth . 
`` The order is executed , sire . '' 
`` And Fouquet ? '' 
`` Monsieur le surintendant follows me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` In ten minutes let him be introduced , '' said the king , dismissing D'Artagnan again with a gesture . 
The latter retired ; but had scarcely reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for him , when he was recalled by the king 's bell . 
`` Did he not appear astonished ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Who , sire ? '' 
`` Fouquet , '' replied the king , without saying monsieur , a peculiarity which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions . 
`` No , sire , '' replied he . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
And a second time Louis dismissed D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide . 
He reperused his note , conceived thus : `` Something is being contrived against you . 
Perhaps they will not dare to carry it out at the castle ; it will be on your return home . 
The house is already surrounded by musketeers . 
Do not enter . 
A white horse is in waiting for you behind the esplanade ! '' 
Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville . 
Not being willing that , if any evil happened to himself , this paper should compromise a faithful friend , the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand morsels , spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace . 
D'Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps in space . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` the king awaits you . '' 
Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor , where MM . 
de Brienne and Rose were at work , whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan , seated on a chair , likewise in the corridor , appeared to be waiting for orders , with feverish impatience , his sword between his legs . 
It appeared strange to Fouquet that MM . 
Brienne , Rose , and de Saint-Aignan , in general so attentive and obsequious , should scarcely take the least notice , as he , the surintendant , passed . 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers , he whom the king no longer called anything but Fouquet ? 
He raised his head , determined to look every one and everything bravely in the face , and entered the king 's apartment , where a little bell , which we already know , had already announced him to his majesty . 
The king , without rising , nodded to him , and with interest : `` Well ! 
how are you , Monsieur Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am in a high fever , '' replied the surintendant ; `` but I am at the king 's service . '' 
`` That is well ; the States assemble to-morrow ; have you a speech ready ? '' 
Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment . 
`` I have not , sire , '' replied he ; `` but I will improvise one . 
I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . '' 
The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? '' 
`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . '' 
`` Rest yourself , Monsieur Fouquet , do not throw away your strength ; the session of the States will be short , and when my secretaries shall have closed it , I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a fortnight . '' 
`` Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the States ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` Not to me , the surintendant of the finances ? '' 
`` Rest yourself , I beg you ; that is all I have to say to you . '' 
Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head . 
He was evidently busy with some uneasy thought . 
This uneasiness struck the king . 
`` Are you angry at having to rest yourself , M. Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , sire , I am not accustomed to take rest . '' 
`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he . 
`` If his first word is severe , '' again thought Fouquet ; `` if he becomes angry , or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext , how shall I extricate myself ? 
Let us smooth the declivity a little . 
Gourville was right . '' 
`` Sire , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the point of dispensing with my labor , may I not be allowed to be absent from the council of to-morrow ? 
I could pass the day in bed , and will entreat the king to grant me his physician , that we may endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever . '' 
`` So be it , Monsieur Fouquet , it shall be as you desire ; you shall have a holiday to-morrow , you shall have the physician , and shall be restored to health . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
said Fouquet , bowing . 
Then , opening his game : `` Shall I not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle - Isle ? '' 
And he looked Louis full in the face , to judge of the effect of such a proposal . 
The king blushed again . 
`` Do you know , '' replied he , endeavoring to smile , `` that you have just said , ` My residence of Belle-Isle ' ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Well ! 
do you not remember , '' continued the king in the same cheerful tone , `` that you gave me Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` That is true again , sire . 
Only , as you have not taken it , you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it . '' 
`` I mean to do so . '' 
`` That was , besides , your majesty 's intention as well as mine ; and I can not express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the king 's regiments from Paris to help take possession . '' 
The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that alone . 
`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . '' 
`` You have a boat of your own , nevertheless ? '' 
`` I have five ; but they are all in port , or at Paimboeuf ; and to join them , or bring them hither , would require at least twenty-four hours . 
Have I any occasion to send a courier ? 
Must I do so ? '' 
`` Wait a little , put an end to the fever , - wait till to-morrow . '' 
`` That is true . 
Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred other ideas ? '' 
replied Fouquet , now perfectly convinced and very pale . 
The king started , and stretched his hand out towards his little bell , but Fouquet prevented his ringing . 
`` Sire , '' said he , `` I have an ague - I am trembling with cold . 
If I remain a moment longer , I shall most likely faint . 
I request your majesty 's permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes . '' 
`` Indeed , you are in a shiver ; it is painful to behold ! 
Come , Monsieur Fouquet , begone ! 
I will send to inquire after you . '' 
`` Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness . 
In an hour I shall be better . '' 
`` I will call some one to reconduct you , '' said the king . 
`` As you please , sire ; I would gladly take the arm of any one . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , ringing his little bell . 
`` Oh , sire , '' interrupted Fouquet , laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold , `` would you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings ? 
An equivocal honor that , sire ! 
A simple footman , I beg . '' 
`` And why , M. Fouquet ? 
M. d'Artagnan conducts me often , and extremely well ! '' 
`` Yes , but when he conducts you , sire , it is to obey you ; whilst me - '' `` Go on ! '' 
`` If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers , it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
replied the king , who became paler than Fouquet himself , - `` arrested ! 
oh ! '' 
`` And why should they not say so ? '' 
continued Fouquet , still laughing ; `` and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it . '' 
This sally disconcerted the monarch . 
Fouquet was skillful enough , or fortunate enough , to make Louis XIV . 
recoil before the appearance of the deed he meditated . 
M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed , without at all comprehending what was going on . 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment , affecting all the slowness of a man who walks with difficulty . 
When once out of the castle , `` I am saved ! '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , disloyal king , you shall see Belle-Isle , but it shall be when I am no longer there . '' 
He disappeared , leaving D'Artagnan with the king . 
`` Captain , '' said the king , `` you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` He is going to his lodgings again . 
You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . '' 
`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed . 
`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . '' 
`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by . 
So much the worse ! 
Now I have orders , I will obey those orders , and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested . 
He is at the castle of Angers , this very M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you have not got him yet , captain . '' 
`` That concerns me ; every one to his trade , sire ; only , once more , reflect ! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet , sire ? '' 
`` Yes , a thousand times , yes ! '' 
`` In writing , sire , then . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
D'Artagnan read it , bowed to the king , and left the room . 
From the height of the terrace he perceived Gourville , who went by with a joyous air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
: The White Horse and the Black . 
`` That is rather surprising , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` Gourville running about the streets so gayly , when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger ; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace , and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant . 
Gourville is rubbing his hands ; that is because he has done something clever . 
Whence comes M. Gourville ? 
Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes . 
Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead ? '' 
And D'Artagnan followed , along the tops of the houses of Nantes , dominated by the castle , the line traced by the streets , as he would have done upon a topographical plan ; only , instead of the dead , flat paper , the living chart rose in relief with the cries , the movements , and the shadows of men and things . 
Beyond the inclosure of the city , the great verdant plains stretched out , bordering the Loire , and appeared to run towards the pink horizon , which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of the marshes . 
Immediately outside the gates of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic hand . 
D'Artagnan , who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by crossing the terrace , was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of Nantes . 
One step more , and he was about to descend the stairs , take his trellised carriage , and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
But chance decreed , at the moment of plunging into the staircase , that he was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said the musketeer to himself ; `` a horse galloping , - a runaway horse , no doubt . 
What a rate he is going at ! '' 
The moving point became detached from the road , and entered into the fields . 
`` A white horse , '' continued the captain , who had just observed the color thrown luminously against the dark ground , `` and he is mounted ; it must be some boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him . '' 
These reflections , rapid as lightning , simultaneous with visual perception , D'Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first steps of the staircase . 
Some morsels of paper were spread over the stairs , and shone out white against the dirty stones . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the captain to himself , `` here are some of the fragments of the note torn by M. Fouquet . 
Poor man ! 
he has given his secret to the wind ; the wind will have no more to do with it , and brings it back to the king . 
Decidedly , Fouquet , you play with misfortune ! 
the game is not a fair one , - fortune is against you . 
The star of Louis XIV . 
obscures yours ; the adder is stronger and more cunning than the squirrel . '' 
D'Artagnan picked up one of these morsels of paper as he descended . 
`` Gourville 's pretty little hand ! '' 
cried he , whilst examining one of the fragments of the note ; `` I was not mistaken . '' 
And he read the word `` horse . '' 
`` Stop ! '' 
said he ; and he examined another , upon which there was not a letter traced . 
Upon a third he read the word `` white ; '' `` white horse , '' repeated he , like a child that is spelling . 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
cried the suspicious spirit , `` a white horse ! '' 
And , like that grain of powder which , burning , dilates into ten thousand times its volume , D'Artagnan , enlightened by ideas and suspicions , rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace . 
The white horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire , at the extremity of which , melting into the vapors of the water , a little sail appeared , wave-balanced like a water-butterfly . 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried the musketeer , `` only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across plowed lands ; there is but one Fouquet , a financier , to ride thus in open day upon a white horse ; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make his escape towards the sea , while there are such thick forests on land , and there is but one D'Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet , who has half an hour 's start , and who will have gained his boat within an hour . '' 
This being said , the musketeer gave orders that the carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a thicket situated just outside the city . 
He selected his best horse , jumped upon his back , galloped along the Rue aux Herbes , taking , not the road Fouquet had taken , but the bank itself of the Loire , certain that he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance , and , at the intersection of the two lines , come up with the fugitive , who could have no suspicion of being pursued in that direction . 
In the rapidity of the pursuit , and with the impatience of the avenger , animating himself as in war , D'Artagnan , so mild , so kind towards Fouquet , was surprised to find himself become ferocious - almost sanguinary . 
For a long time he galloped without catching sight of the white horse . 
His rage assumed fury , he doubted himself , - he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some subterranean road , or that he had changed the white horse for one of those famous black ones , as swift as the wind , which D'Artagnan , at Saint - Mande , had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and their fleetness . 
At such moments , when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring from them , when the saddle had become burning hot , when the galled and spurred horse reared with pain , and threw behind him a shower of dust and stones , D'Artagnan , raising himself in his stirrups , and seeing nothing on the waters , nothing beneath the trees , looked up into the air like a madman . 
He was losing his senses . 
In the paroxysms of eagerness he dreamt of aerial ways , - the discovery of following century ; he called to his mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him from the prisons of Crete . 
A hoarse sigh broke from his lips , as he repeated , devoured by the fear of ridicule , `` I ! 
I ! 
duped by a Gourville ! 
I ! 
They will say that I am growing old , - they will say I have received a million to allow Fouquet to escape ! '' 
And he again dug his spurs into the sides of his horse : he had ridden astonishingly fast . 
Suddenly , at the extremity of some open pasture-ground , behind the hedges , he saw a white form which showed itself , disappeared , and at last remained distinctly visible against the rising ground . 
D'Artagnan 's heart leaped with joy . 
He wiped the streaming sweat from his brow , relaxed the tension of his knees , - by which the horse breathed more freely , - and , gathering up his reins , moderated the speed of the vigorous animal , his active accomplice on this man-hunt . 
He had then time to study the direction of the road , and his position with regard to Fouquet . 
The superintendent had completely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground . 
He felt the necessity of gaining a firmer footing , and turned towards the road by the shortest secant line . 
D'Artagnan , on his part , had nothing to do but to ride straight on , concealed by the sloping shore ; so that he would cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him . 
Then the real race would begin , - then the struggle would be in earnest . 
D'Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time . 
He observed that the superintendent had relaxed into a trot , which was to say , he , too , was favoring his horse . 
But both of them were too much pressed for time to allow them to continue long at that pace . 
The white horse sprang off like an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground . 
D'Artagnan dropped his head , and his black horse broke into a gallop . 
Both followed the same route ; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded . 
Fouquet had not yet perceived D'Artagnan . 
But on issuing from the slope , a single echo struck the air ; it was that of the steps of D'Artagnan 's horse , which rolled along like thunder . 
Fouquet turned round , and saw behind him , within a hundred paces , his enemy bent over the neck of his horse . 
There could be no doubt - the shining baldrick , the red cassock - it was a musketeer . 
Fouquet slackened his hand likewise , and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself . 
`` Oh , but , '' thought D'Artagnan , becoming very anxious , `` that is not a common horse M. Fouquet is upon - let us see ! '' 
And he attentively examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the courser . 
Round full quarters - a thin long tail - large hocks - thin legs , as dry as bars of steel - hoofs hard as marble . 
He spurred his own , but the distance between the two remained the same . 
D'Artagnan listened attentively ; not a breath of the horse reached him , and yet he seemed to cut the air . 
The black horse , on the contrary , began to puff like any blacksmith 's bellows . 
`` I must overtake him , if I kill my horse , '' thought the musketeer ; and he began to saw the mouth of the poor animal , whilst he buried the rowels of his merciless spurs into his sides . 
The maddened horse gained twenty toises , and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet . 
`` Courage ! '' 
said the musketeer to himself , `` courage ! 
the white horse will perhaps grow weaker , and if the horse does not fall , the master must pull up at last . '' 
But horse and rider remained upright together , gaining ground by difficult degrees . 
D'Artagnan uttered a wild cry , which made Fouquet turn round , and added speed to the white horse . 
`` A famous horse ! 
a mad rider ! '' 
growled the captain . 
`` Hola ! 
mordioux ! 
Monsieur Fouquet ! 
stop ! 
in the king 's name ! '' 
Fouquet made no reply . 
`` Do you hear me ? '' 
shouted D'Artagnan , whose horse had just stumbled . 
`` Pardieu ! '' 
replied Fouquet , laconically ; and rode on faster . 
D'Artagnan was nearly mad ; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his eyes . 
`` In the king 's name ! '' 
cried he again , `` stop , or I will bring you down with a pistol-shot ! '' 
`` Do ! '' 
replied Fouquet , without relaxing his speed . 
D'Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it , hoping that the double click of the spring would stop his enemy . 
`` You have pistols likewise , '' said he , `` turn and defend yourself . '' 
Fouquet did turn round at the noise , and looking D'Artagnan full in the face , opened , with his right hand , the part of his dress which concealed his body , but he did not even touch his holsters .
