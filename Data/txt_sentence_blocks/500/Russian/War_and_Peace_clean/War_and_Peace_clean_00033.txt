Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went out of the room to change her costume . 
In the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats . 
Anatole moved a chair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside her , but the count , who never lost sight of her , took the seat himself . 
Anatole sat down behind her . 
Mademoiselle George , with her bare , fat , dimpled arms , and a red shawl draped over one shoulder , came into the space left vacant for her , and assumed an unnatural pose . 
Enthusiastic whispering was audible . 
Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her son . 
In some places she raised her voice , in others she whispered , lifting her head triumphantly ; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds , rolling her eyes . 
`` Adorable ! 
divine ! 
delicious ! '' 
was heard from every side . 
Natasha looked at the fat actress , but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her . 
She only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world - so remote from her old world -- a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad , reasonable or senseless . 
Behind her sat Anatole , and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy . 
After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded Mademoiselle George , expressing their enthusiasm . 
`` How beautiful she is ! '' 
Natasha remarked to her father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress . 
`` I do n't think so when I look at you ! '' 
said Anatole , following Natasha . 
He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him . 
`` You are enchanting ... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased ... '' `` Come , come , Natasha ! '' 
said the count , as he turned back for his daughter . 
`` How beautiful she is ! '' 
Natasha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes . 
After giving several recitations , Mademoiselle George left , and Countess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom . 
The count wished to go home , but Helene entreated him not to spoil her improvised ball , and the Rostovs stayed on . 
Anatole asked Natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her . 
During the ecossaise , which she also danced with him , Anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves , but merely gazed at her . 
Natasha lifted her frightened eyes to him , but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not , whilst looking at him , say what she had to say . 
She lowered her eyes . 
`` Do n't say such things to me . 
I am betrothed and love another , '' she said rapidly ... . 
She glanced at him . 
Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said . 
`` Do n't speak to me of that ! 
What can I do ? '' 
said he . 
`` I tell you I am madly , madly , in love with you ! 
Is it my fault that you are enchanting ? 
... It 's our turn to begin . '' 
Natasha , animated and excited , looked about her with wide-open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual . 
She understood hardly anything that went on that evening . 
They danced the ecossaise and the Grossvater . 
Her father asked her to come home , but she begged to remain . 
Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to , she felt his eyes upon her . 
Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress , that Helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother 's love , and that she again met Anatole in the little sitting room . 
Helene had disappeared leaving them alone , and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice : `` I can not come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see you ? 
I love you madly . 
Can I never ... ? '' 
and , blocking her path , he brought his face close to hers . 
His large , glittering , masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them . 
`` Natalie ? '' 
he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed . 
`` Natalie ? '' 
`` I do n't understand . 
I have nothing to say , '' her eyes replied . 
Burning lips were pressed to hers , and at the same instant she felt herself released , and Helene 's footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in the room . 
Natasha looked round at her , and then , red and trembling , threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward the door . 
`` One word , just one , for God 's sake ! '' 
cried Anatole . 
She paused . 
She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer . 
`` Natalie , just a word , only one ! '' 
he kept repeating , evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them . 
Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room . 
The Rostovs went away without staying for supper . 
After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night . 
She was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew . 
She loved Prince Andrew -- she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him . 
But she also loved Anatole , of that there was no doubt . 
`` Else how could all this have happened ? '' 
thought she . 
`` If , after that , I could return his smile when saying good-by , if I was able to let it come to that , it means that I loved him from the first . 
It means that he is kind , noble , and splendid , and I could not help loving him . 
What am I to do if I love him and the other one too ? '' 
she asked herself , unable to find an answer to these terrible questions . 
Morning came with its cares and bustle . 
Everyone got up and began to move about and talk , dressmakers came again . 
Marya Dmitrievna appeared , and they were called to breakfast . 
Natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes , as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her , and tried to appear the same as usual . 
After breakfast , which was her best time , Marya Dmitrievna sat down in her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her . 
`` Well , friends , I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice , '' she began . 
`` Yesterday , as you know , I went to see Prince Bolkonski . 
Well , I had a talk with him ... . 
He took it into his head to begin shouting , but I am not one to be shouted down . 
I said what I had to say ! '' 
`` Well , and he ? '' 
asked the count . 
`` He ? 
He 's crazy ... he did not want to listen . 
But what 's the use of talking ? 
As it is we have worn the poor girl out , '' said Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` My advice to you is finish your business and go back home to Otradnoe ... and wait there . '' 
`` Oh , no ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` Yes , go back , '' said Marya Dmitrievna , `` and wait there . 
If your betrothed comes here now -- there will be no avoiding a quarrel ; but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you . '' 
Count Rostov approved of this suggestion , appreciating its reasonableness . 
If the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on ; and if not , the wedding , against his wishes , could only be arranged at Otradnoe . 
`` That is perfectly true . 
And I am sorry I went to see him and took her , '' said the old count . 
`` No , why be sorry ? 
Being here , you had to pay your respects . 
But if he wo n't -- that 's his affair , '' said Marya Dmitrievna , looking for something in her reticule . 
`` Besides , the trousseau is ready , so there is nothing to wait for ; and what is not ready I 'll send after you . 
Though I do n't like letting you go , it is the best way . 
So go , with God 's blessing ! '' 
Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to Natasha . 
It was a letter from Princess Mary . 
`` She has written to you . 
How she torments herself , poor thing ! 
She 's afraid you might think that she does not like you . '' 
`` But she does n't like me , '' said Natasha . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense ! '' 
cried Marya Dmitrievna . 
`` I sha n't believe anyone , I know she does n't like me , '' replied Natasha boldly as she took the letter , and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown . 
`` Do n't answer like that , my good girl ! '' 
she said . 
`` What I say is true ! 
Write an answer ! '' 
Natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary 's letter . 
Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them . 
Whatever her father 's feelings might be , she begged Natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother , for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything . 
`` Do not think , however , '' she wrote , `` that my father is ill-disposed toward you . 
He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven ; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy . '' 
Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time when she could see her again . 
After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it . 
`` Dear Princess , '' she wrote in French quickly and mechanically , and then paused . 
What more could she write after all that had happened the evening before ? 
`` Yes , yes ! 
All that has happened , and now all is changed , '' she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her . 
`` Must I break off with him ? 
Must I really ? 
That 's awful ... '' and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her . 
After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary 's letter . 
`` Can it be that it is all over ? '' 
she thought . 
`` Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before ? '' 
She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength , and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin . 
She vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew 's wife , and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination , and at the same time , aglow with excitement , recalled every detail of yesterday 's interview with Anatole . 
`` Why could that not be as well ? '' 
she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment . 
`` Only so could I be completely happy ; but now I have to choose , and I ca n't be happy without either of them . 
Only , '' she thought , `` to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible . 
But with that one nothing is spoiled . 
But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew 's love , in which I have lived so long ? '' 
`` Please , Miss ! '' 
whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air . 
`` A man told me to give you this - '' and she handed Natasha a letter . 
`` Only , for Christ 's sake ... '' the girl went on , as Natasha , without thinking , mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from Anatole , of which , without taking in a word , she understood only that it was a letter from him -- from the man she loved . 
Yes , she loved him , or else how could that have happened which had happened ? 
And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand ? 
With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter which Dolokhov had composed for Anatole , and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling . 
`` Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed ; to be loved by you or to die . 
There is no other way for me , '' the letter began . 
Then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him -- for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her -- but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes , and no human power could hinder their bliss . 
Love would conquer all . 
He would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth . 
`` Yes , yes ! 
I love him ! '' 
thought Natasha , reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it . 
That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs ' and proposed to take the girls with her . 
Natasha , pleading a headache , remained at home . 
On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha 's room , and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa . 
Open on the table , beside her lay Anatole 's letter . 
Sonya picked it up and read it . 
As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha , trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading , but did not find it . 
Her face was calm , gentle , and happy . 
Clutching her breast to keep herself from choking , Sonya , pale and trembling with fear and agitation , sat down in an armchair and burst into tears . 
`` How was it I noticed nothing ? 
How could it go so far ? 
Can she have left off loving Prince Andrew ? 
And how could she let Kuragin go to such lengths ? 
He is a deceiver and a villain , that 's plain ! 
What will Nicholas , dear noble Nicholas , do when he hears of it ? 
So this is the meaning of her excited , resolute , unnatural look the day before yesterday , yesterday , and today , '' thought Sonya . 
`` But it ca n't be that she loves him ! 
She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from . 
Probably she is offended by it . 
She could not do such a thing ! '' 
Sonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha , again scanning her face . 
`` Natasha ! '' 
she said , just audibly . 
Natasha awoke and saw Sonya . 
`` Ah , you 're back ? '' 
And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening , she embraced her friend , but noticing Sonya 's look of embarrassment , her own face expressed confusion and suspicion . 
`` Sonya , you 've read that letter ? '' 
she demanded . 
`` Yes , '' answered Sonya softly . 
Natasha smiled rapturously . 
`` No , Sonya , I ca n't any longer ! '' 
she said . 
`` I ca n't hide it from you any longer . 
You know , we love one another ! 
Sonya , darling , he writes ... Sonya ... '' Sonya stared open-eyed at Natasha , unable to believe her ears . 
`` And Bolkonski ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Ah , Sonya , if you only knew how happy I am ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` You do n't know what love is ... '' `` But , Natasha , can that be all over ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question . 
`` Well , then , are you refusing Prince Andrew ? '' 
said Sonya . 
`` Oh , you do n't understand anything ! 
Do n't talk nonsense , just listen ! '' 
said Natasha , with momentary vexation . 
`` But I ca n't believe it , '' insisted Sonya . 
`` I do n't understand . 
How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly ... Why , you have only seen him three times ! 
Natasha , I do n't believe you , you 're joking ! 
In three days to forget everything and so ... '' `` Three days ? '' 
said Natasha . 
`` It seems to me I 've loved him a hundred years . 
It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before . 
You ca n't understand it ... . 
Sonya , wait a bit , sit here , '' and Natasha embraced and kissed her . 
`` I had heard that it happens like this , and you must have heard it too , but it 's only now that I feel such love . 
It 's not the same as before . 
As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave , and that I could not help loving him . 
Yes , his slave ! 
Whatever he orders I shall do . 
You do n't understand that . 
What can I do ? 
What can I do , Sonya ? '' 
cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened expression . 
`` But think what you are doing , '' cried Sonya . 
`` I ca n't leave it like this . 
This secret correspondence ... How could you let him go so far ? '' 
she went on , with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal . 
`` I told you that I have no will , '' Natasha replied . 
`` Why ca n't you understand ? 
I love him ! '' 
`` Then I wo n't let it come to that ... I shall tell ! '' 
cried Sonya , bursting into tears . 
`` What do you mean ? 
For God 's sake ... If you tell , you are my enemy ! '' 
declared Natasha . 
`` You want me to be miserable , you want us to be separated ... '' When she saw Natasha 's fright , Sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend . 
`` But what has happened between you ? '' 
she asked . 
`` What has he said to you ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
Natasha did not answer her questions . 
`` For God 's sake , Sonya , do n't tell anyone , do n't torture me , '' Natasha entreated . 
`` Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters ! 
I have confided in you ... '' `` But why this secrecy ? 
Why does n't he come to the house ? '' 
asked Sonya . 
`` Why does n't he openly ask for your hand ? 
You know Prince Andrew gave you complete freedom -- if it is really so ; but I do n't believe it ! 
Natasha , have you considered what these secret reasons can be ? '' 
Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment . 
Evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it . 
`` I do n't know what the reasons are . 
But there must be reasons ! '' 
Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously . 
`` If there were reasons ... '' she began . 
But Natasha , guessing her doubts , interrupted her in alarm . 
`` Sonya , one ca n't doubt him ! 
One ca n't , one ca n't ! 
Do n't you understand ? '' 
she cried . 
`` Does he love you ? '' 
`` Does he love me ? '' 
Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend 's lack of comprehension . 
`` Why , you have read his letter and you have seen him . '' 
`` But if he is dishonorable ? '' 
`` He ! 
dishonorable ? 
If you only knew ! '' 
exclaimed Natasha . 
`` If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you ; and if you wo n't do this , I will . 
I will write to him , and I will tell Papa ! '' 
said Sonya resolutely . 
`` But I ca n't live without him ! '' 
cried Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I do n't understand you . 
And what are you saying ! 
Think of your father and of Nicholas . '' 
`` I do n't want anyone , I do n't love anyone but him . 
How dare you say he is dishonorable ? 
Do n't you know that I love him ? '' 
screamed Natasha . 
`` Go away , Sonya ! 
I do n't want to quarrel with you , but go , for God 's sake go ! 
You see how I am suffering ! '' 
Natasha cried angrily , in a voice of despair and repressed irritation . 
Sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room . 
Natasha went to the table and without a moment 's reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning . 
In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end ; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom , she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her , but that she could not be his wife . 
At that moment this all seemed quite easy , simple , and clear to Natasha . 
On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country , but on Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow . 
On the day the count left , Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the Karagins ' , and Marya Dmitrievna took them there . 
At that party Natasha again met Anatole , and Sonya noticed that she spoke to him , trying not to be overheard , and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever . 
When they got home Natasha was the first to begin the explanation Sonya expected . 
`` There , Sonya , you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him , '' Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised . 
`` We have had an explanation today . '' 
`` Well , what happened ? 
What did he say ? 
Natasha , how glad I am you 're not angry with me ! 
Tell me everything -- the whole truth . 
What did he say ? '' 
Natasha became thoughtful . 
`` Oh , Sonya , if you knew him as I do ! 
He said ... He asked me what I had promised Bolkonski . 
He was glad I was free to refuse him . '' 
Sonya sighed sorrowfully . 
`` But you have n't refused Bolkonski ? '' 
said she . 
`` Perhaps I have . 
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski . 
Why do you think so badly of me ? '' 
`` I do n't think anything , only I do n't understand this ... '' `` Wait a bit , Sonya , you 'll understand everything . 
You 'll see what a man he is ! 
Now do n't think badly of me or of him . 
I do n't think badly of anyone : I love and pity everybody . 
But what am I to do ? '' 
Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her . 
The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha 's face became , the more serious and stern grew Sonya 's . 
`` Natasha , '' said she , `` you asked me not to speak to you , and I have n't spoken , but now you yourself have begun . 
I do n't trust him , Natasha . 
Why this secrecy ? '' 
`` Again , again ! '' 
interrupted Natasha . 
`` Natasha , I am afraid for you ! '' 
`` Afraid of what ? '' 
`` I am afraid you 're going to your ruin , '' said Sonya resolutely , and was herself horrified at what she had said . 
Anger again showed in Natasha 's face . 
`` And I 'll go to my ruin , I will , as soon as possible ! 
It 's not your business ! 
It wo n't be you , but I , who 'll suffer . 
Leave me alone , leave me alone ! 
I hate you ! '' 
`` Natasha ! '' 
moaned Sonya , aghast . 
`` I hate you , I hate you ! 
You 're my enemy forever ! '' 
And Natasha ran out of the room . 
Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her . 
With the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house , taking up now one occupation , now another , and at once abandoning them . 
Hard as it was for Sonya , she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight . 
The day before the count was to return , Sonya noticed that Natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past , whom Sonya took to be Anatole . 
Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state . 
She answered questions at random , began sentences she did not finish , and laughed at everything . 
After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha 's door timidly waiting to let her pass . 
She let the girl go in , and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered . 
Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening . 
Sonya knocked at her door . 
Natasha did not let her in . 
`` She will run away with him ! '' 
thought Sonya . 
`` She is capable of anything . 
There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today . 
She cried as she said good-by to Uncle , '' Sonya remembered . 
`` Yes , that 's it , she means to elope with him , but what am I to do ? '' 
thought she , recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natasha had some terrible intention . 
`` The count is away . 
What am I to do ? 
Write to Kuragin demanding an explanation ? 
But what is there to oblige him to reply ? 
Write to Pierre , as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune ? 
... But perhaps she really has already refused Bolkonski -- she sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday . 
And Uncle is away ... '' To tell Marya Dmitrievna who had such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible . 
`` Well , anyway , '' thought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage , `` now or never I must prove that I remember the family 's goodness to me and that I love Nicholas . 
Yes ! 
If I do n't sleep for three nights I 'll not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced , '' thought she . 
Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov 's . 
The plan for Natalie Rostova 's abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dolokhov a few days before , and on the day that Sonya , after listening at Natasha 's door , resolved to safeguard her , it was to have been put into execution . 
Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening . 
Kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka , where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them . 
At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad , and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses . 
Anatole had a passport , an order for post horses , ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with Dolokhov 's help . 
Two witnesses for the mock marriage -- Khvostikov , a retired petty official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions , and Makarin , a retired hussar , a kindly , weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for Kuragin -- were sitting at tea in Dolokhov 's front room . 
In his large study , the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with Persian rugs , bearskins , and weapons , sat Dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots , at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money . 
Anatole , with uniform unbuttoned , walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting , through the study to the room behind , where his French valet and others were packing the last of his things . 
Dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down . 
`` Well , '' he said , `` Khvostikov must have two thousand . '' 
`` Give it to him , then , '' said Anatole . 
`` Makarka '' -LRB- their name for Makarin -RRB- `` will go through fire and water for you for nothing . 
So here are our accounts all settled , '' said Dolokhov , showing him the memorandum . 
`` Is that right ? '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' returned Anatole , evidently not listening to Dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face . 
Dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile : `` Do you know ? 
You 'd really better drop it all . 
There 's still time ! '' 
`` Fool , '' retorted Anatole . 
`` Do n't talk nonsense ! 
If you only knew ... it 's the devil knows what ! '' 
`` No , really , give it up ! '' 
said Dolokhov . 
`` I am speaking seriously . 
It 's no joke , this plot you 've hatched . '' 
`` What , teasing again ? 
Go to the devil ! 
Eh ? '' 
said Anatole , making a grimace . 
`` Really it 's no time for your stupid jokes , '' and he left the room . 
Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out . 
`` You wait a bit , '' he called after him . 
`` I 'm not joking , I 'm talking sense . 
Come here , come here ! '' 
Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov , trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily . 
`` Now listen to me . 
I 'm telling you this for the last time . 
Why should I joke about it ? 
Did I hinder you ? 
Who arranged everything for you ? 
Who found the priest and got the passport ? 
Who raised the money ? 
I did it all . '' 
`` Well , thank you for it . 
Do you think I am not grateful ? '' 
And Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov . 
`` I helped you , but all the same I must tell you the truth ; it is a dangerous business , and if you think about it -- a stupid business . 
Well , you 'll carry her off -- all right ! 
Will they let it stop at that ? 
It will come out that you 're already married . 
Why , they 'll have you in the criminal court ... '' `` Oh , nonsense , nonsense ! '' 
Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace . 
`` Did n't I explain to you ? 
What ? '' 
And Anatole , with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning , repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov a hundred times . 
`` Did n't I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion : if this marriage is invalid , '' he went on , crooking one finger , `` then I have nothing to answer for ; but if it is valid , no matter ! 
Abroad no one will know anything about it . 
Is n't that so ? 
And do n't talk to me , do n't , do n't . '' 
`` Seriously , you 'd better drop it ! 
You 'll only get yourself into a mess ! '' 
`` Go to the devil ! '' 
cried Anatole and , clutching his hair , left the room , but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dolokhov with his feet turned under him . 
`` It 's the very devil ! 
What ? 
Feel how it beats ! '' 
He took Dolokhov 's hand and put it on his heart . 
`` What a foot , my dear fellow ! 
What a glance ! 
A goddess ! '' 
he added in French . 
`` What ? '' 
Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him -- evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him . 
`` Well and when the money 's gone , what then ? '' 
`` What then ? 
Eh ? '' 
repeated Anatole , sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future . 
`` What then ? 
... Then , I do n't know ... . 
But why talk nonsense ! '' 
He glanced at his watch . 
`` It 's time ! '' 
Anatole went into the back room . 
`` Now then ! 
Nearly ready ? 
You 're dawdling ! '' 
he shouted to the servants . 
Dolokhov put away the money , called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey , and went into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting . 
Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively , while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself . 
`` Come and eat something . 
Have a drink ! '' 
Dolokhov shouted to him from the other room . 
`` I do n't want to , '' answered Anatole continuing to smile . 
`` Come ! 
Balaga is here . '' 
Anatole rose and went into the dining room . 
Balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas . 
More than once when Anatole 's regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening , brought him to Moscow by daybreak , and driven him back again the next night . 
More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape when pursued . 
More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and `` ladykins '' as he called the cocottes . 
More than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by `` my gentlemen '' as he called them . 
He had ruined more than one horse in their service . 
More than once they had beaten him , and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira , which he loved ; and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia . 
They often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies ' , and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands . 
In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year , and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy . 
But he liked them ; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour , liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian , and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets . 
He liked to hear those wild , tipsy shouts behind him : `` Get on ! 
Get on ! '' 
when it was impossible to go any faster . 
He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who , more dead than alive , was already hurrying out of his way . 
`` Real gentlemen ! '' 
he considered them . 
Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked . 
With others Balaga bargained , charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours ' drive , and rarely drove himself , generally letting his young men do so . 
But with `` his gentlemen '' he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work . 
Only a couple of times a year -- when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand -- he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him . 
The gentlemen always made him sit down . 
`` Do help me out , Theodore Ivanych , sir , '' or `` your excellency , '' he would say . 
`` I am quite out of horses . 
Let me have what you can to go to the fair . '' 
And Anatole and Dolokhov , when they had money , would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles . 
Balaga was a fair-haired , short , and snub-nosed peasant of about twenty-seven ; red-faced , with a particularly red thick neck , glittering little eyes , and a small beard . 
He wore a fine , dark-blue , silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin . 
On entering the room now he crossed himself , turning toward the front corner of the room , and went up to Dolokhov , holding out a small , black hand . 
`` Theodore Ivanych ! '' 
he said , bowing . 
`` How d'you do , friend ? 
Well , here he is ! '' 
`` Good day , your excellency ! '' 
he said , again holding out his hand to Anatole who had just come in . 
`` I say , Balaga , '' said Anatole , putting his hands on the man 's shoulders , `` do you care for me or not ? 
Eh ?
