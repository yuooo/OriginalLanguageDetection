`` Where is the Emperor ? 
Where is Kutuzov ? '' 
Rostov kept asking everyone he could stop , but got no answer from anyone . 
At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer . 
`` Eh , brother ! 
They 've all bolted long ago ! '' 
said the soldier , laughing for some reason and shaking himself free . 
Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk , Rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him . 
The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded . 
`` It ca n't be ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` It must have been someone else . '' 
`` I saw him myself . '' 
replied the man with a self-confident smile of derision . 
`` I ought to know the Emperor by now , after the times I 've seen him in Petersburg . 
I saw him just as I see you ... . 
There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything . 
How they made the four black horses fly ! 
Gracious me , they did rattle past ! 
It 's time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych . 
I do n't think Ilya drives anyone except the Tsar ! '' 
Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on , when a wounded officer passing by addressed him : `` Who is it you want ? '' 
he asked . 
`` The commander in chief ? 
He was killed by a cannon ball -- struck in the breast before our regiment . '' 
`` Not killed -- wounded ! '' 
another officer corrected him . 
`` Who ? 
Kutuzov ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Not Kutuzov , but what 's his name -- well , never mind ... there are not many left alive . 
Go that way , to that village , all the commanders are there , '' said the officer , pointing to the village of Hosjeradek , and he walked on . 
Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going . 
The Emperor was wounded , the battle lost . 
It was impossible to doubt it now . 
Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him , in which he saw turrets and a church . 
What need to hurry ? 
What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov , even if they were alive and unwounded ? 
`` Take this road , your honor , that way you will be killed at once ! '' 
a soldier shouted to him . 
`` They 'd kill you there ! '' 
`` Oh , what are you talking about ? '' 
said another . 
`` Where is he to go ? 
That way is nearer . '' 
Rostov considered , and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed . 
`` It 's all the same now . 
If the Emperor is wounded , am I to try to save myself ? '' 
he thought . 
He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen . 
The French had not yet occupied that region , and the Russians -- the uninjured and slightly wounded -- had left it long ago . 
All about the field , like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland , lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres . 
The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans , sometimes feigned -- or so it seemed to Rostov . 
He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men , and he felt afraid -- afraid not for his life , but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates . 
The French , who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at , on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots . 
The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rostov 's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself . 
He remembered his mother 's last letter . 
`` What would she feel , '' thought he , `` if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me ? '' 
In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle , who though still in some confusion were less disordered . 
The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away . 
Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost . 
No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutuzov was . 
Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct , others that it was not , and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor 's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy , who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor 's suite . 
One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left , and thither Rostov rode , not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience . 
When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops , he saw , near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it , two men on horseback facing the ditch . 
One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostov ; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse -LRB- which Rostov fancied he had seen before -RRB- rode up to the ditch , struck his horse with his spurs , and giving it the rein leaped lightly over . 
Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse 's hind hoofs . 
Turning the horse sharply , he again jumped the ditch , and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes , evidently suggesting that he should do the same . 
The rider , whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention , made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch . 
`` But it ca n't be he , alone in the midst of this empty field ! '' 
thought Rostov . 
At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory . 
The Emperor was pale , his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow , but the charm , the mildness of his features , was all the greater . 
Rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false . 
He was happy to be seeing him . 
He knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver . 
But as a youth in love trembles , is unnerved , and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights , but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with her , so Rostov , now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world , did not know how to approach the Emperor , and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient , unseemly , and impossible to do so . 
`` What ! 
It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent ! 
A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow ; besides , what can I say to him now , when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him ? '' 
Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall . 
Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions , they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph , generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds , and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved . 
`` Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost ? 
No , certainly I must not approach him , I must not intrude on his reflections . 
Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him , '' Rostov decided ; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away , continually looking back at the Tsar , who still remained in the same attitude of indecision . 
While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away , Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot , and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him , offered his services , and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot . 
The Emperor , wishing to rest and feeling unwell , sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him . 
Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor , evidently weeping , covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll 's hand . 
`` And I might have been in his place ! '' 
thought Rostov , and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor , he rode on in utter despair , not knowing where to or why he was now riding . 
His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause his grief . 
He might ... not only might but should , have gone up to the sovereign . 
It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it ... `` What have I done ? '' 
thought he . 
And he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor , but there was no one beyond the ditch now . 
Only some carts and carriages were passing by . 
From one of the drivers he learned that Kutuzov 's staff were not far off , in the village the vehicles were going to . 
Rostov followed them . 
In front of him walked Kutuzov 's groom leading horses in horsecloths . 
Then came a cart , and behind that walked an old , bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat . 
`` Tit ! 
I say , Tit ! '' 
said the groom . 
`` What ? '' 
answered the old man absent-mindedly . 
`` Go , Tit ! 
Thresh a bit ! '' 
`` Oh , you fool ! '' 
said the old man , spitting angrily . 
Some time passed in silence , and then the same joke was repeated . 
Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points . 
More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French . 
Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms . 
Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses . 
The remains of Langeron 's and Dokhturov 's mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd . 
After five o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade -LRB- delivered by the French alone -RRB- was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights , directed at our retreating forces . 
In the rearguard , Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops . 
It was growing dusk . 
On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling , while his grandson , with shirt sleeves rolled up , handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can , on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts -- on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon , under the horses ' hoofs and between the wagon wheels , men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together , crushing one another , dying , stepping over the dying and killing one another , only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way . 
Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around , or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng , killing some and splashing with blood those near them . 
Dolokhov -- now an officer -- wounded in the arm , and on foot , with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company , represented all that was left of that whole regiment . 
Impelled by the crowd , they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and , jammed in on all sides , had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out . 
A cannon ball killed someone behind them , another fell in front and splashed Dolokhov with blood . 
The crowd , pushing forward desperately , squeezed together , moved a few steps , and again stopped . 
`` Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved , remain here another two minutes and it is certain death , '' thought each one . 
Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam , throwing two soldiers off their feet , and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool . 
`` Turn this way ! '' 
he shouted , jumping over the ice which creaked under him ; `` turn this way ! '' 
he shouted to those with the gun . 
`` It bears ! 
... '' The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked , and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd , but very soon even under his weight alone . 
The men looked at him and pressed to the bank , hesitating to step onto the ice . 
The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dolokhov . 
Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked . 
It flopped into something moist , and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood . 
Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him . 
`` Get onto the ice , over the ice ! 
Go on ! 
Turn ! 
Do n't you hear ? 
Go on ! '' 
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general , the men themselves not knowing what , or why , they were shouting . 
One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice . 
Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond . 
The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers , and one leg slipped into the water . 
He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist . 
The nearest soldiers shrank back , the gun driver stopped his horse , but from behind still came the shouts : `` Onto the ice , why do you stop ? 
Go on ! 
Go on ! '' 
And cries of horror were heard in the crowd . 
The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on . 
The horses moved off the bank . 
The ice , that had held under those on foot , collapsed in a great mass , and some forty men who were on it dashed , some forward and some back , drowning one another . 
Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam , the pond , and the bank . 
On the Pratzen Heights , where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand , lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle , piteous , and childlike moan . 
Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still . 
He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted . 
Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning , lacerating pain in his head . 
`` Where is it , that lofty sky that I did not know till now , but saw today ? '' 
was his first thought . 
`` And I did not know this suffering either , '' he thought . 
`` Yes , I did not know anything , anything at all till now . 
But where am I ? '' 
He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses , and voices speaking French . 
He opened his eyes . 
Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher , and between them gleamed blue infinity . 
He did not turn his head and did not see those who , judging by the sound of hoofs and voices , had ridden up and stopped near him . 
It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp . 
Bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field . 
`` Fine men ! '' 
remarked Napoleon , looking at a dead Russian grenadier , who , with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape , lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide . 
`` The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted , Your Majesty , '' said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd . 
`` Have some brought from the reserve , '' said Napoleon , and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew , who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him . 
-LRB- The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy . -RRB- 
`` That 's a fine death ! '' 
said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski . 
Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it . 
He heard the speaker addressed as Sire . 
But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly . 
Not only did they not interest him , but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them . 
His head was burning , he felt himself bleeding to death , and he saw above him the remote , lofty , and everlasting sky . 
He knew it was Napoleon -- his hero -- but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small , insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it . 
At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him , or what was said of him ; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life , which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently . 
He collected all his strength , to stir and utter a sound . 
He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak , sickly groan which aroused his own pity . 
`` Ah ! 
He is alive , '' said Napoleon . 
`` Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station . '' 
Having said this , Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes , who , hat in hand , rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory . 
Prince Andrew remembered nothing more : he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher , the jolting while being moved , and the probing of his wound at the dressing station . 
He did not regain consciousness till late in the day , when with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital . 
During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak . 
The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French convoy officer , who said rapidly : `` We must halt here : the Emperor will pass here immediately ; it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners . '' 
`` There are so many prisoners today , nearly the whole Russian army , that he is probably tired of them , '' said another officer . 
`` All the same ! 
They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexander 's Guards , '' said the first one , indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards . 
Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg society . 
Beside him stood a lad of nineteen , also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards . 
Bonaparte , having come up at a gallop , stopped his horse . 
`` Which is the senior ? '' 
he asked , on seeing the prisoners . 
They named the colonel , Prince Repnin . 
`` You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander 's regiment of Horse Guards ? '' 
asked Napoleon . 
`` I commanded a squadron , '' replied Repnin . 
`` Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably , '' said Napoleon . 
`` The praise of a great commander is a soldier 's highest reward , '' said Repnin . 
`` I bestow it with pleasure , '' said Napoleon . 
`` And who is that young man beside you ? '' 
Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen . 
After looking at him Napoleon smiled . 
`` He 's very young to come to meddle with us . '' 
`` Youth is no hindrance to courage , '' muttered Sukhtelen in a failing voice . 
`` A splendid reply ! '' 
said Napoleon . 
`` Young man , you will go far ! '' 
Prince Andrew , who had also been brought forward before the Emperor 's eyes to complete the show of prisoners , could not fail to attract his attention . 
Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and , addressing him , again used the epithet `` young man '' that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew . 
`` Well , and you , young man , '' said he . 
`` How do you feel , mon brave ? '' 
Though five minutes before , Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him , now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon , he was silent ... . 
So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon , so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear , compared to the lofty , equitable , and kindly sky which he had seen and understood , that he could not answer him . 
Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood , suffering , and the nearness of death aroused in him . 
Looking into Napoleon 's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness , the unimportance of life which no one could understand , and the still greater unimportance of death , the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain . 
The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went : `` Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac ; let my doctor , Larrey , examine their wounds . 
Au revoir , Prince Repnin ! '' 
and he spurred his horse and galloped away . 
His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure . 
The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother 's neck , but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners , they now hastened to return the holy image . 
Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced , but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform . 
`` It would be good , '' thought Prince Andrew , glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence , `` it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary . 
How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life , and what to expect after it beyond the grave ! 
How happy and calm I should be if I could now say : ` Lord , have mercy on me ! ' 
... But to whom should I say that ? 
Either to a Power indefinable , incomprehensible , which I not only can not address but which I can not even express in words -- the Great All or Nothing - '' said he to himself , `` or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary ! 
There is nothing certain , nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand , and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important . '' 
The stretchers moved on . 
At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain ; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious . 
Visions of his father , wife , sister , and future son , and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle , the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon , and above all this the lofty sky , formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies . 
The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him . 
He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others , and doubts and torments had followed , and only the heavens promised peace . 
Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon 's doctor , Larrey , was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence . 
`` He is a nervous , bilious subject , '' said Larrey , `` and will not recover . '' 
And Prince Andrew , with others fatally wounded , was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district . 
Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave . 
Denisov was going home to Voronezh and Rostov persuaded him to travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there . 
Meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow , Denisov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and , despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road , did not once wake up on the way to Moscow , but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostov , who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow . 
`` How much longer ? 
How much longer ? 
Oh , these insufferable streets , shops , bakers ' signboards , street lamps , and sleighs ! '' 
thought Rostov , when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered Moscow . 
`` Denisov ! 
We 're here ! 
He 's asleep , '' he added , leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh . 
Denisov gave no answer . 
`` There 's the corner at the crossroads , where the cabman , Zakhar , has his stand , and there 's Zakhar himself and still the same horse ! 
And here 's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread ! 
Ca n't you hurry up ? 
Now then ! '' 
`` Which house is it ? '' 
asked the driver . 
`` Why , that one , right at the end , the big one . 
Do n't you see ? 
That 's our house , '' said Rostov . 
`` Of course , it 's our house ! 
Denisov , Denisov ! 
We 're almost there ! '' 
Denisov raised his head , coughed , and made no answer . 
`` Dmitri , '' said Rostov to his valet on the box , `` those lights are in our house , are n't they ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , and there 's a light in your father 's study . '' 
`` Then they 've not gone to bed yet ? 
What do you think ? 
Mind now , do n't forget to put out my new coat , '' added Rostov , fingering his new mustache . 
`` Now then , get on , '' he shouted to the driver . 
`` Do wake up , Vaska ! '' 
he went on , turning to Denisov , whose head was again nodding . 
`` Come , get on ! 
You shall have three rubles for vodka -- get on ! '' 
Rostov shouted , when the sleigh was only three houses from his door . 
It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all . 
At last the sleigh bore to the right , drew up at an entrance , and Rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off , the porch , and the post by the side of the pavement . 
He sprang out before the sleigh stopped , and ran into the hall . 
The house stood cold and silent , as if quite regardless of who had come to it . 
There was no one in the hall . 
`` Oh God ! 
Is everyone all right ? '' 
he thought , stopping for a moment with a sinking heart , and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase . 
The well-known old door handle , which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned , turned as loosely as ever . 
A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom . 
Old Michael was asleep on the chest . 
Prokofy , the footman , who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind , sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges . 
He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement . 
`` Gracious heavens ! 
The young count ! '' 
he cried , recognizing his young master . 
`` Can it be ? 
My treasure ! '' 
and Prokofy , trembling with excitement , rushed toward the drawing-room door , probably in order to announce him , but , changing his mind , came back and stooped to kiss the young man 's shoulder . 
`` All well ? '' 
asked Rostov , drawing away his arm . 
`` Yes , God be thanked ! 
Yes ! 
They 've just finished supper . 
Let me have a look at you , your excellency . '' 
`` Is everything quite all right ? '' 
`` The Lord be thanked , yes ! '' 
Rostov , who had completely forgotten Denisov , not wishing anyone to forestall him , threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom . 
All was the same : there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it ; but someone had already seen the young master , and , before he had reached the drawing room , something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him . 
Another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third ; more hugging , more kissing , more outcries , and tears of joy . 
He could not distinguish which was Papa , which Natasha , and which Petya . 
Everyone shouted , talked , and kissed him at the same time . 
Only his mother was not there , he noticed that . 
`` And I did not know ... Nicholas ... My darling ! 
... '' `` Here he is ... our own ... Kolya , * dear fellow ... How he has changed ! 
... Where are the candles ? 
... Tea ! 
... '' * Nicholas . 
`` And me , kiss me ! '' 
`` Dearest ... and me ! '' 
Sonya , Natasha , Petya , Anna Mikhaylovna , Vera , and the old count were all hugging him , and the serfs , men and maids , flocked into the room , exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing . 
Petya , clinging to his legs , kept shouting , `` And me too ! '' 
Natasha , after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses , holding him tight by the skirt of his coat , sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly . 
All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy , and all around were lips seeking a kiss . 
Sonya too , all rosy red , clung to his arm and , radiant with bliss , looked eagerly toward his eyes , waiting for the look for which she longed . 
Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty , especially at this moment of happy , rapturous excitement . 
She gazed at him , not taking her eyes off him , and smiling and holding her breath . 
He gave her a grateful look , but was still expectant and looking for someone . 
The old countess had not yet come . 
But now steps were heard at the door , steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother 's . 
Yet it was she , dressed in a new gown which he did not know , made since he had left . 
All the others let him go , and he ran to her . 
When they met , she fell on his breast , sobbing . 
She could not lift her face , but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar 's jacket . 
Denisov , who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone , stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight . 
`` Vasili Denisov , your son 's friend , '' he said , introducing himself to the count , who was looking inquiringly at him . 
`` You are most welcome ! 
I know , I know , '' said the count , kissing and embracing Denisov . 
`` Nicholas wrote us ... Natasha , Vera , look ! 
Here is Denisov ! '' 
The same happy , rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denisov . 
`` Darling Denisov ! '' 
screamed Natasha , beside herself with rapture , springing to him , putting her arms round him , and kissing him . 
This escapade made everybody feel confused . 
Denisov blushed too , but smiled and , taking Natasha 's hand , kissed it . 
Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him , and the Rostovs all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room . 
The old countess , not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment , sat beside him : the rest , crowding round him , watched every movement , word , or look of his , never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him . 
His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea , handkerchief , and pipe . 
Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him ; but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient , and he kept expecting something more , more and yet more . 
Next morning , after the fatigues of their journey , the travelers slept till ten o'clock . 
In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers , satchels , sabretaches , open portmanteaus , and dirty boots . 
Two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall . 
The servants were bringing in jugs and basins , hot water for shaving , and their well-brushed clothes . 
There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco . 
`` Hallo , Gwiska -- my pipe ! '' 
came Vasili Denisov 's husky voice . 
`` Wostov , get up ! '' 
Rostov , rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together , raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow . 
`` Why , is it late ? '' 
`` Late ! 
It 's nearly ten o'clock , '' answered Natasha 's voice . 
A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls ' voices came from the adjoining room . 
The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue , of ribbons , black hair , and merry faces . 
It was Natasha , Sonya , and Petya , who had come to see whether they were getting up . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Get up ! '' 
Natasha 's voice was again heard at the door . 
`` Directly ! '' 
Meanwhile , Petya , having found and seized the sabers in the outer room , with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother , and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed , opened the bedroom door . 
`` Is this your saber ? '' 
he shouted . 
The girls sprang aside . 
Denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket , looking with a scared face at his comrade for help . 
The door , having let Petya in , closed again . 
A sound of laughter came from behind it . 
`` Nicholas ! 
Come out in your dressing gown ! '' 
said Natasha 's voice . 
`` Is this your saber ? '' 
asked Petya . 
`` Or is it yours ? '' 
he said , addressing the black-mustached Denisov with servile deference . 
Rostov hurriedly put something on his feet , drew on his dressing gown , and went out . 
Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other . 
Sonya , when he came in , was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down . 
They were dressed alike , in new pale-blue frocks , and were both fresh , rosy , and bright . 
Sonya ran away , but Natasha , taking her brother 's arm , led him into the sitting room , where they began talking . 
They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves . 
Natasha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself , not because what they were saying was amusing , but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter . 
`` Oh , how nice , how splendid ! '' 
she said to everything . 
Rostov felt that , under the influence of the warm rays of love , that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face . 
`` No , but listen , '' she said , `` now you are quite a man , are n't you ? 
I 'm awfully glad you 're my brother . '' 
She touched his mustache . 
`` I want to know what you men are like . 
Are you the same as we ? 
No ? '' 
`` Why did Sonya run away ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Ah , yes ! 
That 's a whole long story ! 
How are you going to speak to her -- thou or you ? '' 
`` As may happen , '' said Rostov . 
`` No , call her you , please ! 
I 'll tell you all about it some other time . 
No , I 'll tell you now . 
You know Sonya 's my dearest friend . 
Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake . 
Look here ! '' 
She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long , slender , delicate arm , high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress . 
`` I burned this to prove my love for her . 
I just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there ! '' 
Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms , in what used to be his old schoolroom , and looking into Natasha 's wildly bright eyes , Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else , but gave him some of the best joys of his life ; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless , he understood and was not surprised at it . 
`` Well , and is that all ? '' 
he asked . 
`` We are such friends , such friends ! 
All that ruler business was just nonsense , but we are friends forever . 
She , if she loves anyone , does it for life , but I do n't understand that , I forget quickly . '' 
`` Well , what then ? '' 
`` Well , she loves me and you like that . '' 
Natasha suddenly flushed . 
`` Why , you remember before you went away ? 
... Well , she says you are to forget all that ... . 
She says : ' I shall love him always , but let him be free . ' 
Is n't that lovely and noble ! 
Yes , very noble ? 
Is n't it ? '' 
asked Natasha , so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked of before , with tears . 
Rostov became thoughtful . 
`` I never go back on my word , '' he said . 
`` Besides , Sonya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness . '' 
`` No , no ! '' 
cried Natasha , `` she and I have already talked it over . 
We knew you 'd say so . 
But it wo n't do , because you see , if you say that -- if you consider yourself bound by your promise -- it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously . 
It makes it as if you were marrying her because you must , and that would n't do at all . '' 
Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them . 
Sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day . 
Today , when he had caught a glimpse of her , she seemed still more lovely . 
She was a charming girl of sixteen , evidently passionately in love with him -LRB- he did not doubt that for an instant -RRB- . 
Why should he not love her now , and even marry her , Rostov thought , but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him ! 
`` Yes , they have taken a wise decision , '' he thought , `` I must remain free . '' 
`` Well then , that 's excellent , '' said he . 
`` We 'll talk it over later on . 
Oh , how glad I am to have you ! '' 
`` Well , and are you still true to Boris ? '' 
he continued . 
`` Oh , what nonsense ! '' 
cried Natasha , laughing . 
`` I do n't think about him or anyone else , and I do n't want anything of the kind . '' 
`` Dear me ! 
Then what are you up now ? '' 
`` Now ? '' 
repeated Natasha , and a happy smile lit up her face . 
`` Have you seen Duport ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Not seen Duport -- the famous dancer ? 
Well then , you wo n't understand . 
That 's what I 'm up to . '' 
Curving her arms , Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do , ran back a few steps , turned , cut a caper , brought her little feet sharply together , and made some steps on the very tips of her toes . 
`` See , I 'm standing ! 
See ! '' 
she said , but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer . 
`` So that 's what I 'm up to ! 
I 'll never marry anyone , but will be a dancer . 
Only do n't tell anyone . '' 
Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov , in his bedroom , felt envious and Natasha could not help joining in . 
`` No , but do n't you think it 's nice ? '' 
she kept repeating . 
`` Nice ! 
And so you no longer wish to marry Boris ? '' 
Natasha flared up . 
`` I do n't want to marry anyone . 
And I 'll tell him so when I see him ! '' 
`` Dear me ! '' 
said Rostov . 
`` But that 's all rubbish , '' Natasha chattered on . 
`` And is Denisov nice ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Yes , indeed ! '' 
`` Oh , well then , good-by : go and dress . 
Is he very terrible , Denisov ? '' 
`` Why terrible ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` No , Vaska is a splendid fellow . '' 
`` You call him Vaska ? 
That 's funny ! 
And is he very nice ? '' 
`` Very . '' 
`` Well then , be quick . 
We 'll all have breakfast together . '' 
And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe , like a ballet dancer , but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile . 
When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room , he reddened . 
He did not know how to behave with her . 
The evening before , in the first happy moment of meeting , they had kissed each other , but today they felt it could not be done ; he felt that everybody , including his mother and sisters , was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her . 
He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you - Sonya . 
But their eyes met and said thou , and exchanged tender kisses . 
Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared , by Natasha 's intermediacy , to remind him of his promise , and then thanked him for his love . 
His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her , for that would be impossible . 
`` How strange it is , '' said Vera , selecting a moment when all were silent , `` that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers . ''
