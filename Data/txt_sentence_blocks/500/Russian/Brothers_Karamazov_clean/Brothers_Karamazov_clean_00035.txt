He did not belong to anyone ! '' 
he explained , to the captain , to his wife , to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha . 
`` He used to live in the Fedotovs ' backyard . 
Though he made his home there , they did not feed him . 
He was a stray dog that had run away from the village ... I found him ... . 
You see , old man , he could n't have swallowed what you gave him . 
If he had , he must have died , he must have ! 
So he must have spat it out , since he is alive . 
You did not see him do it . 
But the pin pricked his tongue , that is why he squealed . 
He ran away squealing and you thought he 'd swallowed it . 
He might well squeal , because the skin of dogs ' mouths is so tender ... tenderer than in men , much tenderer ! '' 
Kolya cried impetuously , his face glowing and radiant with delight . 
Ilusha could not speak . 
White as a sheet , he gazed open-mouthed at Kolya , with his great eyes almost starting out of his head . 
And if Krassotkin , who had no suspicion of it , had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child 's health , nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him . 
But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realised it . 
As for the captain he behaved like a small child . 
`` Zhutchka ! 
It 's Zhutchka ! '' 
he cried in a blissful voice , `` Ilusha , this is Zhutchka , your Zhutchka ! 
Mamma , this is Zhutchka ! '' 
He was almost weeping . 
`` And I never guessed ! '' 
cried Smurov regretfully . 
`` Bravo , Krassotkin ! 
I said he 'd find the dog and here he 's found him . '' 
`` Here he 's found him ! '' 
another boy repeated gleefully . 
`` Krassotkin 's a brick ! 
cried a third voice . 
`` He 's a brick , he 's a brick ! '' 
cried the other boys , and they began clapping . 
`` Wait , wait , '' Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all . 
`` I 'll tell you how it happened , that 's the whole point . 
I found him , I took him home and hid him at once . 
I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to anyone till to-day . 
Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight , but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess . 
And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks . 
You should only see all the things he can do ! 
I trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog , in good condition , old man , so as to be able to say to you , ` See , old man , what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now ! ' 
Have n't you a bit of meat ? 
He 'll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing . 
A piece of meat , have n't you got any ? '' 
The captain ran across the passage to the landlady , where their cooking was done . 
Not to lose precious time , Kolya , in desperate haste , shouted to Perezvon , `` Dead ! '' 
And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air . 
The boys laughed , Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile , but the person most delighted with the dog 's performance was `` mamma . '' 
She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it , `` Perezvon , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Nothing will make him get up , nothing ! '' 
Kolya cried triumphantly , proud of his success . 
`` He wo n't move for all the shouting in the world , but if I call to him , he 'll jump up in a minute . 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
The dog leapt up and bounded about , whining with delight . 
The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef . 
`` Is it hot ? '' 
Kolya inquired hurriedly , with a business-like air , taking the meat . 
`` Dogs do n't like hot things . 
No , it 's all right . 
Look , everybody , look , Ilusha , look , old man ; why are n't you looking ? 
He does not look at him , now I 've brought him . '' 
The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose . 
The luckless dog had to stand without moving , with the meat on his nose , as long as his master chose to keep him , without a movement , perhaps for half an hour . 
But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment . 
`` Paid for ! '' 
cried Kolya , and the meat passed in a flash from the dog 's nose to his mouth . 
The audience , of course , expressed enthusiasm and surprise . 
`` Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha , with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice . 
`` Simply for that ! '' 
answered Kolya , with perfect simplicity . 
`` I wanted to show him in all his glory . '' 
`` Perezvon ! 
Perezvon , '' called Ilusha suddenly , snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog . 
`` What is it ? 
Let him jump up on the bed ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha . 
The boy threw both arms round his head and Perezvon instantly licked his cheek . 
Ilusha crept close to him , stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog 's shaggy coat . 
`` Dear , dear ! '' 
kept exclaiming the captain . 
Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed . 
`` Ilusha , I can show you another trick . 
I 've brought you a little cannon . 
You remember , I told you about it before and you said how much you 'd like to see it . 
Well , here , I 've brought it to you . '' 
And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon . 
He hurried , because he was happy himself . 
Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off , now he hurried on , regardless of all consideration . 
`` You are all happy now , '' he felt , `` so here 's something to make you happier ! '' 
He was perfectly enchanted himself . 
`` I 've been coveting this thing for a long while ; it 's for you , old man , it 's for you . 
It belonged to Morozov , it was no use to him , he had it from his brother . 
I swopped a book from father 's book-case for it , A Kinsman of Mahomet , or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago , before they had any censorship . 
And Morozov has a taste for such things . 
He was grateful to me , too ... '' Kolya held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it . 
Ilusha raised himself , and , with his right arm still round the dog , he gazed enchanted at the toy . 
The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he had gunpowder too , and that it could be fired off at once `` if it wo n't alarm the ladies . '' 
`` Mamma '' immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted . 
She was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap . 
She readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired , without any idea of what she had been asked . 
Kolya showed the powder and the shot . 
The captain , as a military man , undertook to load it , putting in a minute quantity of powder . 
He asked that the shot might be put off till another time . 
The cannon was put on the floor , aiming towards an empty part of the room , three grains of powder were thrust into the touchhole and a match was put to it . 
A magnificent explosion followed . 
Mamma was startled , but at once laughed with delight . 
The boys gazed in speechless triumph . 
But the captain , looking at Ilusha , was more enchanted than any of them . 
Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha , together with the powder and the shot . 
`` I got it for you , for you ! 
I 've been keeping it for you a long time , '' he repeated once more in his delight . 
`` Oh , give it to me ! 
No , give me the cannon ! '' 
mamma began begging like a little child . 
Her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it . 
Kolya was disconcerted . 
The captain fidgeted uneasily . 
`` Mamma , mamma , '' he ran to her , `` the cannon 's yours , of course , but let Ilusha have it , because it 's a present to him , but it 's just as good as yours . 
Ilusha will always let you play with it ; it shall belong to both of you , both of you . '' 
`` No , I do n't want it to belong to both of us ; I want it to be mine altogether , not Ilusha 's , '' persisted mamma , on the point of tears . 
`` Take it , mother , here , keep it ! '' 
Ilusha cried . 
`` Krassotkin , may I give it to my mother ? '' 
he turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face , as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to someone else . 
`` Of course you may , '' Krassotkin assented heartily , and , taking the cannon from Ilusha , he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow . 
She was so touched that she cried . 
`` Ilusha , darling , he 's the one who loves his mammal '' she said tenderly , and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again . 
`` Mamma , let me kiss your hand . '' 
The captain darted up to her at once and did so . 
`` And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy , '' said the grateful lady , pointing to Krassotkin . 
`` And I 'll bring you as much powder as you like , Ilusha . 
We make the powder ourselves now . 
Borovikov found out how it 's made - twenty-four parts of saltpetre , ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal . 
It 's all pounded together , mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve-that 's how it 's done . '' 
`` Smurov told me about your powder , only father says it 's not real gunpowder , '' responded Ilusha . 
`` Not real ? '' 
Kolya flushed . 
`` It burns . 
I do n't know , of course . '' 
`` No , I did n't mean that , '' put in the captain with a guilty face . 
`` I only said that real powder is not made like that , but that 's nothing , it can be made so . '' 
`` I do n't know , you know best . 
We lighted some in a pomatum pot , it burned splendidly , it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash . 
But that was only the paste , and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best , I do n't know ... And Bulkin 's father thrashed him on account of our powder , did you hear ? '' 
he turned to Ilusha . 
`` We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his bed . 
His father saw it . 
He said it might explode , and thrashed him on the spot . 
He was going to make a complaint against me to the masters . 
He is not allowed to go about with me now , no one is allowed to go about with me now . 
Smurov is not allowed to either ; I 've got a bad name with everyone . 
They say I 'm a ` desperate character , ' '' Kolya smiled scornfully . 
`` It all began from what happened on the railway . '' 
`` Ah , we 've heard of that exploit of yours , too , '' cried the captain . 
`` How could you lie still on the line ? 
Is it possible you were n't the least afraid , lying there under the train ? 
Were n't you frightened ? '' 
The captain was abject in his flattery of Kolya . 
`` N - not particularly , '' answered Kolya carelessly . 
`` What 's blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose , '' he said , turning again to Ilusha - but though he assumed an unconcerned air as he talked , he still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up . 
`` Ah ! 
I heard about the goose ! '' 
Ilusha laughed , beaming all over . 
`` They told me , but I did n't understand . 
Did they really take you to the court ? '' 
`` The most stupid , trivial affair , they made a mountain of a mole-hill as they always do , '' Kolya began carelessly . 
`` I was walking through the market-place here one day , just when they 'd driven in the geese . 
I stopped and looked at them . 
All at once a fellow , who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov 's now , looked at me and said , ` What are you looking at the geese for ? ' 
I looked at him ; he was a stupid , moon-faced fellow of twenty . 
I am always on the side of the peasantry , you know . 
I like talking to the peasants ... . 
We 've dropped behind the peasants that 's an axiom . 
I believe you are laughing , Karamazov ? '' 
`` No , Heaven forbid , I am listening , '' said Alyosha with a most good-natured air , and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured . '' 
`` My theory , Karamazov , is clear and simple , '' he hurried on again , looking pleased . 
`` I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their due , but I am not for spoiling them , that is a sine qua non ... But I was telling you about the goose . 
So I turned to the fool and answered , ' I am wondering what the goose thinks about . ' 
He looked at me quite stupidly , ` And what does the goose think about ? ' 
he asked . 
` Do you see that cart full of oats ? ' 
I said . 
` The oats are dropping out of the sack , and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up - do you see ? ' ' 
I see that quite well , ' he said . 
` Well , ' said I , ` if that cart were to move on a little , would it break the goose 's neck or not ? ' 
` It 'd be sure to break it , ' and he grinned all over his face , highly delighted . 
` Come on , then , ' said I , ` let 's try . ' 
` Let 's , ' he said . 
And it did not take us long to arrange : he stood at the bridle without being noticed , and I stood on one side to direct the goose . 
And the owner was n't looking , he was talking to someone , so I had nothing to do , the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself , under the cart , just under the wheel . 
I winked at the lad , he tugged at the bridle , and crack . 
The goose 's neck was broken in half . 
And , as luck would have it , all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once . 
` You did that on purpose ! ' 
` No , not on purpose . ' 
` Yes , you did , on purpose ! ' 
Well , they shouted , ` Take him to the justice of the peace ! ' 
They took me , too . 
` You were there , too , ' they said , ` you helped , you 're known all over the market ! ' 
And , for some reason , I really am known all over the market , '' Kolya added conceitedly . 
`` We all went off to the justice 's , they brought the goose , too . 
The fellow was crying in a great funk , simply blubbering like a woman . 
And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number of geese like that . 
Well , of course , there were witnesses . 
The justice of the peace settled it in a minute , that the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the goose , and the fellow to have the goose . 
And he was warned not to play such pranks again . 
And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman . 
` It was n't me , ' he said , ` it was he egged me on , ' and he pointed to me . 
I answered with the utmost composure that I had n't egged him on , that I simply stated the general proposition , had spoken hypothetically . 
The justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself once for having smiled . 
` I 'll complain to your masters of you , so that for the future you may n't waste your time on such general propositions , instead of sitting at your books and learning your lessons . ' 
He did n't complain to the masters , that was a joke , but the matter noised abroad and came to the ears of the masters . 
Their ears are long , you know ! 
The classical master , Kolbasnikov , was particularly shocked about it , but Dardanelov got me off again . 
But Kolbasnikov is savage with everyone now like a green ass . 
Did you know , Ilusha , he is just married , got a dowry of a thousand roubles , and his bride 's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree . 
The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it : Astounding news has reached the class , Kolbasnikov has been an ass . 
And so on , awfully funny , I 'll bring it to you later on . 
I say nothing against Dardanelov , he is a learned man , there 's no doubt about it . 
I respect men like that and it 's not because he stood up for me . '' 
`` But you took him down about the founders of Troy ! '' 
Smurov put in suddenly , proud of Krassotkin at such a moment . 
He was particularly pleased with the story of the goose . 
`` Did you really take him down ? '' 
the captain inquired , in a flattering way . 
`` On the question who founded Troy ? 
We heard of it , Ilusha told me about it at the time . '' 
`` He knows everything , father , he knows more than any of us ! '' 
put in Ilusha ; `` he only pretends to be like that , but really he is top in every subject ... '' Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness . 
`` Oh , that 's all nonsense about Troy , a trivial matter . 
I consider this an unimportant question , '' said Kolya with haughty humility . 
He had by now completely recovered his dignity , though he was still a little uneasy . 
He felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose , for instance , with too little reserve , while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word all the time . 
And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he despised him , and thought he was showing off before him . 
If he dared to think anything like that , Kolya would - `` I regard the question as quite a trivial one , '' he rapped out again , proudly . 
`` And I know who founded Troy , '' a boy , who had not spoken before , said suddenly , to the surprise of everyone . 
He was silent and seemed to be shy . 
He was a pretty boy of about eleven , called Kartashov . 
He was sitting near the door . 
Kolya looked at him with dignified amazement . 
The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret for the whole school , a secret which could only be discovered by reading Smaragdov , and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya . 
One day , when Kolya 's back was turned , Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov , which lay among Kolya 's books , and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation of Troy . 
This was a good time ago , but he felt uneasy and could not bring himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded Troy , afraid of what might happen and of Krassotkin 's somehow putting him to shame over it . 
But now he could n't resist saying it . 
For weeks he had been longing to . 
`` Well , who did found it ? '' 
Kolya , turning to him with haughty superciliousness . 
He saw from his face that he really did know and at once made up his mind how to take it . 
There was so to speak , a discordant note in the general harmony . 
`` Troy was founded by Teucer , Dardanus , Ilius and Tros , '' the boy rapped out at once , and in the same instant he blushed , blushed so , that it was painful to look at him . 
But the boys stared at him , stared at him for a whole minute , and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya , who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure . 
`` In what sense did they found it ? '' 
he deigned to comment at last . 
`` And what is meant by founding a city or a state ? 
What do they do ? 
Did they go and each lay a brick , do you suppose ? '' 
There was laughter . 
The offending boy turned from pink to crimson . 
He was silent and on the point of tears . 
Kolya held him so for a minute . 
`` Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a nationality , you must first understand what you mean by it , '' he admonished him in stern , incisive tones . 
`` But I attach no consequence to these old wives ' tales and I do n't think much of universal history in general , '' he added carelessly , addressing the company generally . 
`` Universal history ? '' 
the captain inquired , looking almost scared . 
`` Yes , universal history ! 
It 's the study of the successive follies of mankind and nothing more . 
The only subjects I respect are mathematics and natural science , '' said Kolya . 
He was showing off and he stole a glance at Alyosha ; his was the only opinion he was afraid of there . 
But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before . 
If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him , but Alyosha was silent and `` it might be the silence of contempt , '' and that finally irritated Kolya . 
`` The classical languages , too ... they are simply madness , nothing more . 
You seem to disagree with me again , Karamazov ? '' 
`` I do n't agree , '' said Alyosha , with a faint smile . 
`` The study of the classics , if you ask my opinion , is simply a police measure , that 's simply why it has been introduced into our schools . '' 
By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again . 
`` Latin and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect . 
It was dull before , so what could they do to make things duller ? 
It was senseless enough before , so what could they do to make it more senseless ? 
So they thought of Greek and Latin . 
That 's my opinion , I hope I shall never change it , '' Kolya finished abruptly . 
His cheeks were flushed . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Smurov suddenly , in a ringing tone of conviction . 
He had listened attentively . 
`` And yet he is first in Latin himself , '' cried one of the group of boys suddenly . 
`` Yes , father , he says that and yet he is first in Latin , '' echoed Ilusha . 
`` What of it ? '' 
Kolya thought fit to defend himself , though the praise was very sweet to him . 
`` I am fagging away at Latin because I have to , because I promised my mother to pass my examination , and I think that whatever you do , it 's worth doing it well . 
But in my soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud ... . 
You do n't agree , Karamazov ? '' 
`` Why ` fraud ' ? '' 
Alyosha smiled again . 
`` Well , all the classical authors have been translated into all languages , so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin , but solely as a police measure , to stupefy the intelligence . 
So what can one call it but a fraud ? '' 
`` Why , who taught you all this ? '' 
cried Alyosha , surprised at last . 
`` In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being taught . 
Besides , what I said just now about the classics being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class . '' 
`` The doctor has come ! '' 
cried Nina , who had been silent till then . 
A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate . 
The captain , who had been expecting the doctor all the morning , rushed headlong out to meet him . 
`` Mamma '' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air . 
Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his pillows straight . 
Nina , from her invalid chair , anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy . 
The boys hurriedly took leave . 
Some of them promised to come again in the evening . 
Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed . 
`` I wo n't go away , I wo n't go away , '' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha . 
`` I 'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor 's gone , I 'll come back with Perezvon . '' 
But by now the doctor had entered , an important-looking person with long , dark whiskers and a shiny , shaven chin , wearing a bearskin coat . 
As he crossed the threshold he stopped , taken aback ; he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place . 
`` How is this ? 
Where am I ? '' 
he muttered , not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap . 
The crowd , the poverty of the room , the washing hanging on a line in the corner , puzzled him . 
The captain , bent double , was bowing low before him . 
`` It 's here , sir , here , sir , '' he muttered cringingly ; `` it 's here , you 've come right , you were coming to us ... '' `` Sne-gi-ryov ? '' 
the doctor said loudly and pompously . 
`` Mr. Snegiryov - is that you ? '' 
`` That 's me , sir ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his coat , displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his neck . 
The captain caught the fur coat in the air , and the doctor took off his cap . 
`` Where is the patient ? '' 
he asked emphatically . 
Precocity `` WHAT do you think the doctor will say to him ? '' 
Kolya asked quickly . 
`` What a repulsive mug , though , has n't he ? 
I ca n't endure medicine ! '' 
`` Ilusha is dying . 
I think that 's certain , '' answered Alyosha , mournfully . 
`` They are rogues ! 
Medicine 's a fraud ! 
I am glad to have made your acquaintance , though , Karamazov . 
I wanted to know you for a long time . 
I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances . '' 
Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative , but he felt ill at ease . 
Alyosha noticed this , smiled , and pressed his hand . 
`` I 've long learned to respect you as a rare person , '' Kolya muttered again , faltering and uncertain . 
`` I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery . 
I know you are a mystic , but ... that has n't put me off . 
Contact with real life will cure you ... . 
It 's always so with characters like yours . '' 
`` What do you mean by mystic ? 
Cure me of what ? '' 
Alyosha was rather astonished . 
`` Oh , God and all the rest of it . '' 
`` What , do n't you believe in God ? '' 
`` Oh , I 've nothing against God . 
Of course , God is only a hypothesis , but ... I admit that He is needed ... for the order of the universe and all that ... and that if there were no God He would have to be invented , '' added Kolya , beginning to blush . 
He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was `` grown up . '' 
`` I have n't the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him , '' Kolya thought indignantly . 
And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed . 
`` I must confess I ca n't endure entering on such discussions , '' he said with a final air . 
`` It 's possible for one who does n't believe in God to love mankind , do n't you think so ? 
Voltaire did n't believe in God and loved mankind ? '' 
-LRB- `` I am at it again , '' he thought to himself . -RRB- 
`` Voltaire believed in God , though not very much , I think , and I do n't think he loved mankind very much either , '' said Alyosha quietly , gently , and quite naturally , as though he were talking to someone of his own age , or even older . 
Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha 's apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire . 
He seemed to be leaving the question for him , little Kolya , to settle . 
`` Have you read Voltaire ? '' 
Alyosha finished . 
`` No , not to say read ... . 
But I 've read Candide in the Russian translation ... in an absurd , grotesque , old translation . . 
-LRB- At it again ! 
again ! -RRB- '' 
`` And did you understand it ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , everything ... . 
That is ... Why do you suppose I should n't understand it ? 
There 's a lot of nastiness in it , of course ... . 
Of course I can understand that it 's a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea ... '' Kolya was getting mixed by now . 
`` I am a Socialist , Karamazov , I am an incurable Socialist , '' he announced suddenly , apropos of nothing . 
`` A Socialist ? '' 
laughed Alyosha . 
`` But when have you had time to become one ? 
Why , I thought you were only thirteen ? '' 
Kolya winced . 
`` In the first place I am not thirteen , but fourteen , fourteen in a fortnight , '' he flushed angrily , `` and in the second place I am at a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it ? 
The question is what are my convictions , not what is my age , is n't it ? '' 
`` When you are older , you 'll understand for yourself the influence of age on convictions . 
I fancied , too , that you were not expressing your own ideas , '' Alyosha answered serenely and modestly , but Kolya interrupted him hotly : `` Come , you want obedience and mysticism . 
You must admit that the Christian religion , for instance , has only been of use to the rich and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery . 
That 's so , is n't it ? '' 
`` Ah , I know where you read that , and I am sure someone told you so ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` I say , what makes you think I read it ? 
And certainly no one told so . 
I can think for myself ... . 
I am not opposed to Christ , if you like . 
He was a most humane person , and if He were alive to-day , He would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists , and would perhaps play a conspicuous part ... . 
There 's no doubt about that . '' 
`` Oh , where , where did you get that from ? 
What fool have you made friends with ? '' 
exclaimed Alyosha . 
`` Come , the truth will out ! 
It has so chanced that I have often talked to Mr. Rakitin , of course , but ... old Byelinsky said that , too , so they say . '' 
`` Byelinsky ? 
I do n't remember . 
He has n't written that anywhere . '' 
`` If he did n't write it , they say he said it . 
I heard that from a. . . 
but never mind . '' 
`` And have you read Byelinsky ? '' 
`` Well , no ... I have n't read all of him , but ... I read the passage about Tatyana , why she did n't go off with Onyegin . '' 
`` Did n't go off with Onyegin ? 
Surely you do n't ... understand that already ? '' 
`` Why , you seem to take me for little Smurov , '' said Kolya , with a grin of irritation . 
`` But please do n't suppose I am such a revolutionist . 
I often disagree with Mr. Rakitin . 
Though I mention Tatyana , I am not at all for the emancipation of women . 
I acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey . 
Les femmes tricottent , * Napoleon said . '' 
Kolya , for some reason , smiled , `` And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with that pseudo-great man . 
I think , too , that to leave one 's own country and fly to America is mean , worse than mean - silly . 
Why go to America when one may be of great service to humanity here ? 
Now especially . 
There 's a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us . 
That 's what I answered . '' 
* Let the women knit . 
`` What do you mean ? 
Answered whom ? 
Has someone suggested your going to America already ? '' 
`` I must own , they 've been at me to go , but I declined . 
That 's between ourselves , of course , Karamazov ; do you hear , not a word to anyone . 
I say this only to you . 
I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge . 
Long will you remember The house at the Chain bridge . 
Do you remember ? 
It 's splendid . 
Why are you laughing ? 
You do n't suppose I am fibbing , do you ? '' 
-LRB- `` What if he should find out that I 've only that one number of The Bell in father 's book case , and have n't read any more of it ? '' 
Kolya thought with a shudder . -RRB- 
`` Oh no , I am not laughing and do n't suppose for a moment that you are lying . 
No , indeed , I ca n't suppose so , for all this , alas ! 
is perfectly true . 
But tell me , have you read Pushkin - Onyegin , for instance ? 
... You spoke just now of Tatyana . '' 
`` No , I have n't read it yet , but I want to read it . 
I have no prejudices , Karamazov ; I want to hear both sides . 
What makes you ask ? '' 
`` Oh , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Karamazov , have you an awful contempt for me ? '' 
Kolya rapped out suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha , as though he were on drill . 
`` Be so kind as to tell me , without beating about the bush . '' 
`` I have a contempt for you ? '' 
Alyosha looked at him wondering . 
`` What for ? 
I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life . '' 
`` Do n't be anxious about my nature , '' Kolya interrupted , not without complacency . 
`` But it 's true that I am stupidly sensitive , crudely sensitive . 
You smiled just now , and I fancied you seemed to - '' `` Oh , my smile meant something quite different . 
I 'll tell you why I smiled . 
Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia , on our students and schoolboys of to-day . 
` Show a Russian schoolboy , ' he writes , ' a map of the stars , which he knows nothing about , and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it . ' 
No knowledge and unbounded conceit - that 's what the German meant to say about the Russian schoolboy . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perfectly right , '' Kolya laughed suddenly , `` exactly so ! 
Bravo the German ! 
But he did not see the good side , what do you think ? 
Conceit may be , that comes from youth , that will be corrected if need be , but , on the other hand , there is an independent spirit almost from childhood , boldness of thought and conviction , and not the spirit of these sausage makers , grovelling before authority ... . 
But the German was right all the same . 
Bravo the German ! 
But Germans want strangling all the same . 
Though they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled . '' 
`` Strangled , what for ? '' 
smiled Alyosha . 
`` Well , perhaps I am talking nonsense , I agree . 
I am awfully childish sometimes , and when I am pleased about anything I ca n't restrain myself and am ready to talk any stuff . 
But , I say , we are chattering away here about nothing , and that doctor has been a long time in there . 
But perhaps he 's examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina . 
I liked that Nina , you know . 
She whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away , ` Why did n't you come before ? ' 
And in such a voice , so reproachfully ! 
I think she is awfully nice and pathetic . '' 
`` Yes , yes ! 
Well , you 'll be coming often , you will see what she is like . 
It would do you a great deal of good to know people like that , to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people , '' Alyosha observed warmly . 
`` That would have more effect on you than anything . '' 
`` Oh , how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner ! '' 
Kolya exclaimed , with bitter feeling . 
`` Yes , it 's a great pity . 
You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you . 
And how he fretted for you to come ! '' 
`` Do n't tell me ! 
You make it worse ! 
But it serves me right . 
What kept me from coming was my conceit , my egoistic vanity , and the beastly wilfulness , which I never can get rid of , though I 've been struggling with it all my life . 
I see that now . 
I am a beast in lots of ways , Karamazov ! '' 
`` No , you have a charming nature , though it 's been distorted , and I quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous , morbidly sensitive boy , '' Alyosha answered warmly . 
`` And you say that to me ! '' 
cried Kolya ; `` and would you believe it , I thought - I 've thought several times since I 've been here - that you despised me ! 
If only you knew how I prize your opinion ! '' 
`` But are you really so sensitive ? 
At your age ! 
Would you believe it , just now , when you were telling your story , I thought , as I watched you , that you must be very sensitive ! '' 
`` You thought so ?
