What an eye you 've got , I say ! 
I bet that was when I was talking about the goose . 
That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off , and for a moment I quite hated you for it , and began talking like a fool . 
Then I fancied - just now , here - when I said that if there were no God He would have to be invented , that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge , especially as I got that phrase out of a book . 
But I swear I was n't showing off out of vanity , though I really do n't know why . 
Because I was so pleased ? 
Yes , I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it 's perfectly disgraceful for anyone to be gushing directly they are pleased , I know that . 
But I am convinced now that you do n't despise me ; it was all my imagination . 
Oh , Karamazov , I am profoundly unhappy . 
I sometimes fancy all sorts of things , that everyone is laughing at me , the whole world , and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things . '' 
`` And you worry everyone about you , '' smiled Alyosha . 
`` Yes , I worry everyone about me , especially my mother . 
Karamazov , tell me , am I very ridiculous now ? '' 
`` Do n't think about that , do n't think of it at all ! '' 
cried Alyosha . 
`` And what does ridiculous mean ? 
Is n't everyone constantly being or seeming ridiculous ? 
Besides , nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous , and that makes them unhappy . 
All I am surprised at is that you should be feeling that so early , though I 've observed it for some time past , , not only in you . 
Nowadays the very children have begun to suffer from it . 
It 's almost a sort of insanity . 
The devil has taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation ; it 's simply the devil , '' added Alyosha , without a trace of the smile that Kolya , staring at him , expected to see . 
`` You are like everyone else , '' said Alyosha , in conclusion , `` that is , like very many others . 
Only you must not be like everybody else , that 's all . '' 
`` Even if everyone is like that ? '' 
`` Yes , even if everyone is like that . 
You be the only one not like it . 
You really are not like everyone else , here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad and even ridiculous . 
And who will admit so much in these days ? 
No one . 
And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self-criticism . 
Do n't be like everyone else , even if you are the only one . '' 
`` Splendid ! 
I was not mistaken in you . 
You know how to console one . 
Oh , how I have longed to know you , Karamazov ! 
I 've long been eager for this meeting . 
Can you really have thought about me , too ? 
You said just now that you thought of me , too ? '' 
`` Yes , I 'd heard of you and had thought of you , too ... and if it 's partly vanity that makes you ask , it does n't matter . '' 
`` Do you know , Karamazov , our talk has been like a declaration of love , '' said Kolya , in a bashful and melting voice . 
`` That 's not ridiculous , is it ? '' 
`` Not at all ridiculous , and if it were , it would n't matter , because it 's been a good thing . '' 
Alyosha smiled brightly . 
`` But do you know , Karamazov , you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself , now ... . 
I see it by your eyes . '' 
Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness . 
`` Why ashamed ? '' 
`` Well , why are you blushing ? '' 
`` It was you made me blush , '' laughed Alyosha , and he really did blush . 
`` Oh , well , I am a little , goodness knows why , I do n't know ... '' he muttered , almost embarrassed . 
`` Oh , how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed ! 
Because you are just like me , '' cried Kolya , in positive ecstasy . 
His cheeks glowed , his eyes beamed . 
`` You know , Kolya , you will be very unhappy in your life , '' something made Alyosha say suddenly . 
`` I know , I know . 
How you know it all before hand ! '' 
Kolya agreed at once . 
`` But you will bless life on the whole , all the same . '' 
`` Just so , hurrah ! 
You are a prophet . 
Oh , we shall get on together , Karamazov ! 
Do you know , what delights me most , is that you treat me quite like an equal . 
But we are not equals , no , we are not , you are better ! 
But we shall get on . 
Do you know , all this last month , I 've been saying to myself , ` Either we shall be friends at once , for ever , or we shall part enemies to the grave ! ' '' 
`` And saying that , of course , you loved me , '' Alyosha laughed gaily . 
`` I did . 
I loved you awfully . 
I 've been loving and dreaming of you . 
And how do you know it all beforehand ? 
Ah , here 's the doctor . 
Goodness ! 
What will he tell us ? 
Look at his face ! '' 
Ilusha THE doctor came out of the room again , muffled in his fur coat and with his cap on his head . 
His face looked almost angry and disgusted , as though he were afraid of getting dirty . 
He cast a cursory glance round the passage , looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he did so . 
Alyosha waved from the door to the coachman , and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up . 
The captain darted out after the doctor , and , bowing apologetically , stopped him to get the last word . 
The poor fellow looked utterly crushed ; there was a scared look in his eyes . 
`` Your Excellency , your Excellency ... is it possible ? '' 
he began , but could not go on and clasped his hands in despair . 
Yet he still gazed imploringly at the doctor , as though a word from him might still change the poor boy 's fate . 
`` I ca n't help it , I am not God ! '' 
the doctor answered offhand , though with the customary impressiveness . 
`` Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon , soon ? '' 
`` You must be prepared for anything , '' said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones , and dropping his eyes , he was about to step out to the coach . 
`` Your Excellency , for Christ 's sake ! '' 
the terror-stricken captain stopped him again . 
`` Your Excellency ! 
But can nothing , absolutely nothing save him now ? '' 
`` It 's not in my hands now , '' said the doctor impatiently , `` but h 'm ! 
... '' he stopped suddenly . 
`` If you could , for instance ... send ... your patient ... at once , without delay '' -LRB- the words `` at once , without delay , '' the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start -RRB- `` to Syracuse , the change to the new be-ne-ficial `` To Syracuse ! '' 
cried the captain , unable to grasp what was said . 
`` Syracuse is in Sicily , '' Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation . 
The doctor looked at him . 
`` Sicily ! 
Your Excellency , '' faltered the captain , `` but you 've seen '' - he spread out his hands , indicating his surroundings - `` mamma and my family ? '' 
`` N-no , SiciIy is not the place for the family , the family should go to Caucasus in the early spring ... your daughter must go to the Caucasus , and your wife ... after a course of the waters in the Caucasus for her rheumatism ... must be sent straight to Paris to the mental specialist Lepelletier ; I could give you a note to him , and then ... there might be a change - '' `` Doctor , doctor ! 
But you see ! '' 
The captain flung wide his hands again despairingly , indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage . 
`` Well , that 's not my business , '' grinned the doctor . 
`` I have only told you the answer of medical science to your question as to possible `` Do n't be afraid , apothecary , my dog wo n't bite you , '' Kolya rapped out loudly , noticing the doctor 's rather uneasy glance at Perezvon , who was standing in the doorway . 
There was a wrathful note in Kolya 's voice . 
He used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose , and , as he explained afterwards , used it `` to insult him . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
The doctor flung up his head , staring with surprise at Kolya . 
`` Who 's this ? '' 
he addressed Alyosha , as though asking him to explain . 
`` It 's Perezvon 's master , do n't worry about me , '' Kolya said incisively again . 
`` Perezvon ? '' 
* repeated the doctor , perplexed . 
* i.e. a chime of bells . 
`` He hears the bell , but where it is he can not tell . 
Good-bye , we shall meet in Syracuse . '' 
`` Who 's this ? 
Who 's this ? '' 
The doctor flew into a terrible rage . 
`` He is a schoolboy , doctor , he is a mischievous boy ; take no notice of him , '' said Alyosha , frowning and speaking quickly . 
`` Kolya , hold your tongue ! '' 
he cried to Krassotkin . 
`` Take no notice of him , doctor , '' he repeated , rather impatiently . 
`` He wants a thrashing , a good thrashing ! '' 
The doctor stamped in a perfect fury . 
`` And you know , apothecary , my Perezvon might bite ! '' 
said Kolya , turning pale , with quivering voice and flashing eyes . 
`` Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
`` Kolya , if you say another word , I 'll have nothing more to do with you , '' Alyosha cried peremptorily . 
`` There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin - this is the man , '' Kolya pointed to Alyosha . 
`` I obey him , good-bye ! '' 
He stepped forward , opened the door , and quickly went into the inner room . 
Perezvon flew after him . 
The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement , looking at Alyosha ; then , with a curse , he went out quickly to the carriage , repeating aloud , `` This is ... this is ... I do n't know what it is ! '' 
The captain darted forward to help him into the carriage . 
Alyosha followed Kolya into the room . 
He was already by Ilusha 's bedside . 
The sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his father . 
A minute later the captain , too , came back . 
`` Father , father , come ... we ... '' Ilusha faltered in violent excitement , but apparently unable to go on , he flung his wasted arms , found his father and Kolya , uniting them in one embrace , and hugging them as tightly as he could . 
The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs , and Kolya 's lips and chin twitched . 
`` Father , father ! 
How sorry I am for you ! '' 
Ilusha moaned bitterly . 
`` Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we shall be happy ... the doctor ... '' the captain began . 
`` Ah , father ! 
I know what the new doctor said to you about me ... . 
I saw ! '' 
cried Ilusha , and again he hugged them both with all his strength , hiding his face on his father 's shoulder . 
`` Father , do n't cry , and when I die get a good boy , another one ... choose one of them all , a good one , call him Ilusha and love him instead of me ... '' `` Hush , old man , you 'll get well , '' Krassotkin cried suddenly , in a voice that sounded angry . 
`` But do n't ever forget me , father , '' Ilusha went on , `` come to my grave ... and father , bury me by our big stone , where we used to go for our walk , and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ... I shall expect you ... . 
Father , father ! '' 
His voice broke . 
They were all three silent , still embracing . 
Nina was crying , quietly in her chair , and at last seeing them all crying , `` mamma , '' too , burst into tears . 
`` Ilusha ! 
Ilusha ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha 's embrace . 
`` Good-bye , old man , mother expects me back to dinner , '' he said quickly . 
`` What a pity I did not tell her ! 
She will be dreadfully anxious ... But after dinner I 'll come back to you for the whole day , for the whole evening , and I 'll tell you all sorts of things , all sorts of things . 
And I 'll bring Perezvon , but now I will take him with me , because he will begin to howl when I am away and bother you . 
Good-bye ! 
And he ran out into the passage . 
He did n't want to cry , but in the passage he burst into tears . 
Alyosha found him crying . 
`` Kolya , you must be sure to keep your word and come , or he will be terribly disappointed , '' Alyosha said emphatically . 
`` I will ! 
Oh , how I curse myself for not having come before '' muttered Kolya , crying , and no longer ashamed of it . 
At that moment the captain flew out of the room , and at once closed the door behind him . 
His face looked frenzied , his lips were trembling . 
He stood before the two and flung up his arms . 
`` I do n't want a good boy ! 
I do n't want another boy ! '' 
he muttered in a wild whisper , clenching his teeth . 
`` If I forget thee , knees before the wooden bench . 
Pressing his fists against his head , he began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries , doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in the room . 
Kolya ran out into the street . 
`` Good-bye , Karamazov ? 
Will you come yourself ? '' 
he cried sharply and angrily to Alyosha . 
`` I will certainly come in the evening . '' 
`` What was that he said about Jerusalem ? 
... What did he mean by that ? '' 
`` It 's from the Bible . 
` If I forget thee , Jerusalem , ' that is , if I forget all that is most precious to me , if I let anything take its place , then may - '' `` I understand , that 's enough ! 
Mind you come ! 
Ici , Perezvon ! '' 
he cried with positive ferocity to the dog , and with rapid strides he went home . 
At Grushenka 's ALYOSHA went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov 's house to see Grushenka , who had sent Fenya to him early in the morning with an urgent message begging him to come . 
Questioning Fenya , Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day . 
During the two months that had passed since Mitya 's arrest , Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov 's house , both from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya . 
Three days after Mitya 's arrest , Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks . 
For one whole week she was unconscious . 
She was very much changed - thinner and a little sallow , though she had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out . 
But to Alyosha her face was even more attractive than before , and he liked to meet her eyes when he went in to her . 
A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face . 
There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her , and a steadfast , fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her . 
There was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming face a look of concentrated thought , almost austere at the first glance . 
There was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity . 
It seemed strange to Alyosha , too , that in spite of the calamity that had overtaken the poor girl , betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a terrible crime , almost at the instant of their betrothal , in spite of her illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya , Grushenka had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness . 
There was a soft light in the once proud eyes , though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her heart . 
The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever - Katerina Ivanovna , of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium . 
Alyosha knew that she was fearfully jealous of her . 
Yet Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his prison , though she might have done it whenever she liked . 
All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha , for he was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking advice . 
Sometimes he was unable to say anything . 
Full of anxiety he entered her lodging . 
She was at home . 
She had returned from seeing Mitya half an hour before , and from the rapid movement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him he saw that she had been expecting him with great impatience . 
A pack of cards dealt for a game of `` fools '' lay on the table . 
A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay , half reclining , on it . 
He wore a dressing-gown and a cotton nightcap , and was evidently ill and weak , though he was smiling blissfully . 
When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before , he had simply stayed on and was still staying with her . 
He arrived with her in rain and sleet , sat down on the sofa , drenched and scared , and gazed mutely at her with a timid , appealing smile . 
Grushenka , who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever , almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half hour after her arrival . 
Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently : he laughed a pitiful , helpless little laugh . 
She called Fenya and told her to give him something to eat . 
All that day he sat in the same place , almost without stirring . 
When it got dark and the shutters were closed , Fenya asked her mistress : `` Is the gentleman going to stay the night , mistress ? '' 
`` Yes ; make him a bed on the sofa , '' answered Grushenka . 
Questioning him more in detail , Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go , and that `` Mr. Kalganov , my benefactor , told me straight that he would n't receive me again and gave me five roubles . '' 
`` Well , God bless you , you 'd better stay , then , '' Grushenka decided in her grief , smiling compassionately at him . 
Her smile wrung the old man 's heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears . 
And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since . 
He did not leave the house even when she was ill . 
Fenya and her grandmother , the cook , did not turn him out , but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa . 
Grushenka had grown used to him , and coming back from seeing Mitya -LRB- whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well -RRB- she would sit down and begin talking to `` Maximushka '' about trifling matters , to keep her from thinking of her sorrow . 
The old man turned out to be a good story-teller on occasions , so that at last he became necessary to her . 
Grushenka saw scarcely anyone else beside Alyosha , who did not come every day and never stayed long . 
Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time , `` at his last gasp '' as they said in the town , and he did , in fact , die a week after Mitya 's trial . 
Three weeks before his death , feeling the end approaching , he made his sons , their wives and children , come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again . 
From that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came , `` The master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him . '' 
But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him . 
`` You 've come at last ! '' 
she cried , flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha , `` and Maximushka 's been scaring me that perhaps you would n't come . 
Ah , how I need you ! 
Sit down to the table . 
What will you have coffee ? '' 
`` Yes , please , '' said Alyosha , sitting down at the table . 
`` I am very hungry . '' 
`` That 's right . 
Fenya , Fenya , coffee , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` It 's been made a long time ready for you . 
And bring some little pies , and mind they are hot . 
Do you know , we 've had a storm over those pies to-day . 
I took them to the prison for him , and would you believe it , he threw them back to me : he would not eat them . 
He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it . 
So I said to him : ' I shall leave them with the warder ; if you do n't eat them before evening , it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you ! ' 
With that I went away . 
We quarrelled again , would you believe it ? 
Whenever I go we quarrel . '' 
Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation . 
Maximov , feeling nervous , at once smiled and looked on the floor . 
`` What did you quarrel about this time ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` I did n't expect it in the least . 
Only fancy , he is jealous of the Pole . 
` Why are you keeping him ? ' 
he said . 
` So you 've begun keeping him . ' 
He is jealous , jealous of me all the time , jealous eating and sleeping ! 
He even took into his head to be jealous of Kuzma last week . '' 
`` But he knew about the Pole before ? '' 
`` Yes , but there it is . 
He has known about him from the very beginning but to-day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him . 
I am ashamed to repeat what he said . 
Silly fellow ! 
Rakitin went in as I came out . 
Perhaps Rakitin is egging him on . 
What do you think ? '' 
she added carelessly . 
`` He loves you , that 's what it is ; he loves you so much . 
And now he is particularly worried . '' 
`` I should think he might be , with the trial to-morrow . 
And I went to him to say something about to-morrow , for I dread to think what 's going to happen then . 
You say that he is worried , but how worried I am ! 
And he talks about the Pole ! 
He 's too silly ! 
He is not jealous of Maximushka yet , anyway . '' 
`` My wife was dreadfully jealous over me , too , '' Maximov put in his word . 
`` Jealous of you ? '' 
Grushenka laughed in spite of herself . 
`` Of whom could she have been jealous ? '' 
`` Of the servant girls . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , Maximushka , I am in no laughing mood now ; I feel angry . 
Do n't ogle the pies . 
I sha n't give you any ; they are not good for you , and I wo n't give you any vodka either . 
I have to look after him , too , just as though I kept an almshouse , '' she laughed . 
`` I do n't deserve your kindness . 
I am a worthless creature , '' said Maximov , with tears in his voice . 
`` You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me . '' 
`` Ech , everyone is of use , Maximushka , and how can we tell who 's of most use ? 
If only that Pole did n't exist , Alyosha . 
He 's taken it into his head to fall ill , too , to-day . 
I 've been to see him also . 
And I shall send him some pies , too , on purpose . 
I had n't sent him any , but Mitya accused me of it , so now I shall send some ! 
Ah , here 's Fenya with a letter ! 
Yes , it 's from the Poles - begging again ! 
Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles . 
In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum , with a promise to repay it within three months , signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well . 
Grushenka had received many such letters , accompanied by such receipts , from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence . 
But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness . 
The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one , written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal . 
It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half , unable to make head or tail of it . 
She could not attend to letters then . 
The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period . 
Grushenka left that letter , too , unanswered . 
A whole series of letters had followed - one every day - all as pompous and rhetorical , but the loan asked for , gradually diminishing , dropped to a hundred roubles , than to twenty-five , to ten , and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both . 
Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them , and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging . 
She found the two Poles in great poverty , almost destitution , without food or fuel , without cigarettes , in debt to their landlady . 
The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared . 
But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self-assertion , with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches . 
Grushenka simply laughed , and gave her former admirer ten roubles . 
Then , laughing , she told Mitya of it and he was not in the least jealous . 
But ever since , the Poles had attached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had always sent them small sums . 
And now that day Mitya had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous . 
`` Like a fool , I went round to him just for a minute , on the way to see Mitya , for he is ill , too , my Pole , '' Grushenka began again with nervous haste . 
`` I was laughing , telling Mitya about it . 
` Fancy , ' I said , ` my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar . 
He thought I would be touched and marry him ! ' 
Mitya leapt up swearing ... . 
So , there , I 'll send them the pies ! 
Fenya , is it that little girl they 've sent ? 
Here , give her three roubles and pack up a dozen pies in a paper and tell her to take them . 
And you , Alyosha , be sure to tell Mitya that I did send them the pies . '' 
`` I would n't tell him for anything , '' said Alyosha , smiling . 
`` Ech ! 
You think he is unhappy about it . 
Why , he 's jealous on purpose . 
He does n't care , '' said Grushenka bitterly . 
`` On purpose ? '' 
queried Alyosha . 
`` I tell you you are silly , Alyosha . 
You know nothing about it , with all your cleverness . 
I am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me . 
I would be offended if he were not jealous . 
I am like that . 
I am not offended at jealousy . 
I have a fierce heart , too . 
I can be jealous myself . 
Only what offends me is that he does n't love me at all . 
I tell you he is jealous now on purpose . 
Am I blind ? 
Do n't I see ? 
He began talking to me just now of that woman , of Katerina , saying she was this and that , how she had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him , to try and save him ; how she had ordered the best counsel , the most learned one , too . 
So he loves her , if he 'll praise her to my face , more shame to him ! 
He 's treated me badly himself , so he attacked me , to make out I am in fault first and to throw it all on me . 
` You were with your Pole before me , so I ca n't be blamed for Katerina , ' that 's what it amounts to . 
He wants to throw the whole blame on me . 
He attacked me on purpose , on purpose , I tell you , but I 'll - '' Grushenka could not finish saying what she would do . 
She hid her eyes in her handkerchief and sobbed violently . 
`` He does n't love Katerina Ivanovna , '' said Alyosha firmly . 
`` Well , whether he loves her or not , I 'll soon find out for myself , '' said Grushenka , with a menacing note in her voice , taking the handkerchief from her eyes . 
Her face was distorted . 
Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene , it had become sullen and spiteful . 
`` Enough of this foolishness , '' she said suddenly ; `` it 's not for that I sent for you . 
Alyosha , darling , to-morrow - what will happen to-morrow ? 
That 's what worries me ! 
And it 's only me it worries ! 
I look at everyone and no one is thinking of it . 
No one cares about it . 
Are you thinking about it even ? 
To-morrow he 'll be tried , you know . 
Tell me , how will he be tried ? 
You know it 's the valet , the valet killed him ! 
Good heavens ! 
Can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him ? 
They have n't troubled the valet at all , have they ? '' 
`` He 's been severely cross-examined , '' observed Alyosha thoughtfully ; `` but everyone came to the conclusion it was not he . 
Now he is lying very ill . 
He has been ill ever since that attack . 
Really ill , '' added Alyosha . 
`` Oh , dear ! 
could n't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself ? 
He 's been brought from Petersburg for three thousand roubles , they say . '' 
`` We gave these three thousand together - Ivan , Katerina Ivanovna and I - but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself . 
The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more , but the case has become known all over Russia ; it 's talked of in all the papers and journals . 
Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing , because the case has become so notorious . 
I saw him yesterday . '' 
`` Well ? 
Did you talk to him ? '' 
Grushenka put in eagerly . 
`` He listened and said nothing . 
He told me that he had already formed his opinion . 
But he promised to give my words consideration . '' 
`` Consideration ! 
Ah , they are swindlers ! 
They 'll ruin him . 
And why did she send for the doctor ? '' 
`` As an expert . 
They want to prove that Mitya 's mad and committed the murder when he did n't know what he was doing , '' Alyosha smiled gently , `` but Mitya wo n't agree to that . '' 
`` Yes ; but that would be the truth if he had killed him ! '' 
cried Grushenka . 
`` He was mad then , perfectly mad , and that was my fault , wretch that I am ! 
But , of course , he did n't do it , he did n't do it ! 
And they are all against him , the whole town . 
Even Fenya 's evidence went to prove he had done it . 
And the people at the shop , and that official , and at the tavern , too , before , people had heard him say so ! 
They are all , all against him , all crying out against him . '' 
`` Yes , there 's a fearful accumulation of evidence , '' Alyosha observed grimly . 
`` And Grigory - Grigory Vassilyevitch - sticks to his story that the door was open , persists that he saw it - there 's no shaking him . 
I went and talked to him myself . 
He 's rude about it , too . '' 
`` Yes , that 's perhaps the strongest evidence against him , '' said Alyosha . 
`` And as for Mitya 's being mad , he certainly seems like it now , '' Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air . 
`` Do you know , Alyosha , I 've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time . 
I go to him every day and simply wonder at him . 
Tell me , now , what do you suppose he 's always talking about ? 
He talks and talks and I can make nothing of it . 
I fancied he was talking of something intellectual that I could n't understand in my foolishness . 
Only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe - that is , about some child . 
` Why is the babe poor ? ' 
he said . 
` It 's for that babe I am going to Siberia now . 
I am not a murderer , but I must go to Siberia ! ' 
What that meant , what babe , I could n't tell for the life of me . 
Only I cried when he said it , because he said it so nicely . 
He cried himself , and I cried , too . 
He suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me . 
What did it mean , Alyosha , tell me ? 
What is this babe ? '' 
`` It must be Rakitin , who 's been going to see him lately , '' smiled Alyosha , `` though ... that 's not Rakitin 's doing . 
I did n't see Mitya yesterday . 
I 'll see him to-day . '' 
`` No , it 's not Rakitin ; it 's his brother Ivan Fyodorovitch upsetting him . 
It 's his going to see him , that 's what it is , '' Grushenka began , and suddenly broke off . 
Alyosha gazed at her in amazement . 
`` Ivan 's going ? 
Has he been to see him ? 
Mitya told me himself that Ivan has n't been once . '' 
`` There ... there ! 
What a girl I am ! 
Blurting things out ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , confused and suddenly blushing . 
`` Stay , Alyosha , hush ! 
Since I 've said so much I 'll tell the whole truth - he 's been to see him twice , the first directly he arrived . 
He galloped here from Moscow at once , of course , before I was taken ill ; and the second time was a week ago . 
He told Mitya not to tell you about it , under any circumstances ; and not to tell anyone , in fact . 
He came secretly . '' 
Alyosha sat plunged in thought , considering something . 
The news evidently impressed him . 
`` Ivan does n't talk to me of Mitya 's case , '' he said slowly . 
`` He 's said very little to me these last two months . 
And whenever I go to see him , he seems vexed at my coming , so I 've not been to him for the last three weeks . 
H 'm ! 
... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week . '' 
`` There has been a change , '' Grushenka assented quickly . 
`` They have a secret , they have a secret ! 
Mitya told me himself there was a secret , and such a secret that Mitya ca n't rest . 
Before then , he was cheerful - and , indeed , he is cheerful now - but when he shakes his head like that , you know , and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand , I know there is something on his mind worrying him ... . 
I know ! 
He was cheerful before , though , indeed , he is cheerful to-day . '' 
`` But you said he was worried . '' 
`` Yes , he is worried and yet cheerful . 
He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again . 
And you know , Alyosha , I am constantly wondering at him - with this awful thing hanging over him , he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself . '' 
`` And did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan ? 
Did he say , ` Do n't tell him ' ? '' 
`` Yes , he told me , ` Do n't tell him . ' 
It 's you that Mitya 's most afraid of . 
Because it 's a secret : he said himself it was a secret . 
Alyosha , darling , go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me , '' Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness . 
`` Set my mind at rest that I may know the worst that 's in store for me . 
That 's why I sent for you . '' 
`` You think it 's something to do with you ? 
If it were , he would n't have told you there was a secret . '' 
`` I do n't know . 
Perhaps he wants to tell me , but does n't dare to . 
He warns me . 
There is a secret , he tells me , but he wo n't tell me what it is . '' 
`` What do you think yourself ? '' 
`` What do I think ? 
It 's the end for me , that 's what I think . 
They all three have been plotting my end , for Katerina 's in it . 
It 's all Katerina , it all comes from her . 
She is this and that , and that means that I am not . 
He tells me that beforehand - warns me . 
He is planning to throw me over , that 's the whole secret . 
They 've planned it together , the three of them - Mitya , Katerina , and Ivan Fyodorovitch . 
Alyosha , I 've been wanting to ask you a long time . 
A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina , because he often goes to see her . 
Did he tell me the truth or not ? 
Tell me , on your conscience , tell me the worst . '' 
`` I wo n't tell you a lie . 
Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna , I think . '' 
`` Oh , that 's what I thought ! 
He is lying to me , shameless deceiver , that 's what it is ! 
And he was jealous of me just now , so as to put the blame on me afterwards . 
He is stupid , he ca n't disguise what he is doing ; he is so open , you know ... . 
But I 'll give it to him , I 'll give it to him ! 
` You believe I did it , ' he said . 
He said that to me , to me . 
He reproached me with that ! 
God forgive him ! 
You wait , I 'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial ! 
I 'll just say a word then ... I 'll tell everything then ! ''
