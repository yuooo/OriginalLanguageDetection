Can you inform us , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch began , with extreme gentleness , `` where did you get so much money all of a sudden , when it appears from the facts , from the reckoning of time , that you had not been home ? '' 
The prosecutor 's brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly , but he did not interrupt Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` No , I did n't go home , '' answered Mitya , apparently perfectly composed , but looking at the floor . 
`` Allow me then to repeat my question , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on as though creeping up to the subject . 
`` Where were you able to procure such a sum all at once , when by your own confession , at five o'clock the same day you - '' `` I was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistols with Perhotin , and then went to Madame Hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she would n't give me , and so on , and all the rest of it , '' Mitya interrupted sharply . 
`` Yes , gentlemen , I was in want of it , and suddenly thousands turned up , eh ? 
Do you know , gentlemen , you 're both afraid now ` what if he wo n't tell us where he got it ? ' 
That 's just how it is . 
I 'm not going to tell you , gentlemen . 
You 've guessed right . 
You 'll never know , '' said Mitya , chipping out each word with extraordinary determination . 
The lawyers were silent for a moment . 
`` You must understand , Mr. Karamazov , that it is of vital importance for us to know , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , softly and suavely . 
`` I understand ; but still I wo n't tell you . '' 
The prosecutor , too , intervened , and again reminded the prisoner that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions , if he thought it to his interest , and so on . 
But in view of the damage he might do himself by his silence , especially in a case of such importance as - `` And so on , gentlemen , and so on . 
Enough ! 
I 've heard that rigmarole before , '' Mitya interrupted again . 
`` I can see for myself how important it is , and that this is the vital point , and still I wo n't say . '' 
`` What is it to us ? 
It 's not our business , but yours . . 
You are doing yourself harm , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously . 
`` You see , gentlemen , joking apart '' - Mitya lifted his eyes and looked firmly at them both - `` I had an inkling from the first that we should come to loggerheads at this point . 
But at first when I began to give my evidence , it was all still far away and misty ; it was all floating , and I was so simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing between us . 
Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the question , for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling-block . 
And now we 've come to it ! 
It 's impossible and there 's an end of it ! 
But I do n't blame you . 
You ca n't believe it all simply on my word . 
I understand that , of course . '' 
He relapsed into gloomy silence . 
`` Could n't you , without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point , could you not , at the same time , give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer , at a crisis so full of danger to you ? '' 
Mitya smiled mournfully , almost dreamily . 
`` I 'm much more good-natured than you think , gentlemen . 
I 'll tell you the reason why and give you that hint , though you do n't deserve it . 
I wo n't speak of that , gentlemen , because it would be a stain on my honour . 
The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father , if I had murdered and robbed him . 
That 's why I ca n't tell you . 
I ca n't for fear of disgrace . 
What , gentlemen , are you going to write that down ? '' 
`` Yes , we 'll write it down , '' lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` You ought not to write that down about ` disgrace . ' 
I only told you that in the goodness of my heart . 
I need n't have told you . 
I made you a present of it , so to speak , and you pounce upon it at once . 
Oh , well , write - write what you like , '' he concluded , with scornful disgust . 
`` I 'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my head before you . '' 
`` And ca n't you tell us the nature of that disgrace ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hazarded . 
The prosecutor frowned darkly . 
`` No , no , c'est fini , do n't trouble yourselves . 
It 's not worth while soiling one 's hands . 
I have soiled myself enough through you as it is . 
You 're not worth it - no one is . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I 'm not going on . '' 
This was said too peremptorily . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist further , but from Ippolit Kirillovitch 's eyes he saw that he had not given up hope . 
`` Can you not , at least , tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into Mr. Perhotin 's - how many roubles exactly ? '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that . '' 
`` You spoke to Mr. Perhotin , I believe , of having received three thousand from Madame Hohlakov . '' 
`` Perhaps I did . 
Enough , gentlemen . 
I wo n't say how much I had . '' 
`` Will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you have done since you arrived ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
you might ask the people here about that . 
But I 'll tell you if you like . '' 
He proceeded to do so , but we wo n't repeat his story . 
He told it dryly and curtly . 
Of the raptures of his love he said nothing , but told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself , owing to `` new factors in the case . '' 
He told the story without going into motives or details . 
And this time the lawyers did not worry him much . 
It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here . 
`` We shall verify all that . 
We will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses , which will , of course , take place in your presence , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion . 
`` And now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession , especially all the money you still have about you . '' 
`` My money , gentlemen ? 
Certainly . 
I understand that that is necessary . 
I 'm surprised , indeed , that you have n't inquired about it before . 
It 's true I could n't get away anywhere . 
I 'm sitting here where I can be seen . 
But here 's my money - count it - take it . 
That 's all , I think . '' 
He turned it all out of his pockets ; even the small change - two pieces of twenty copecks - he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket . 
They counted the money , which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles , and forty copecks . 
`` And is that all ? '' 
asked the investigating lawyer . 
`` You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at Plotnikovs ' . 
You gave Perhotin ten , your driver twenty , here you lost two hundred , then ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch reckoned it all up . 
Mitya helped him readily . 
They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total . 
`` With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first ? '' 
`` I suppose so , '' snapped Mitya . 
`` How is it they all assert there was much more ? '' 
`` Let them assert it . '' 
`` But you asserted it yourself . '' 
`` Yes , I did , too . '' 
`` We will compare all this with the evidence of other persons not yet examined . 
Do n't be anxious about your money . 
It will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of ... what is beginning ... if it appears , or , so to speak , is proved that you have undisputed right to it . 
Well , and now ... '' Nikolay Parfenovitch suddenly got up , and informed Mitya firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search `` of your clothes and everything else ... '' `` By all means , gentlemen . 
I 'll turn out all my pockets , if you like . '' 
And he did , in fact , begin turning out his pockets . 
`` It will be necessary to take off your clothes , too . '' 
`` What ! 
Undress ? 
Ugh ! 
Damn it ! 
Wo n't you search me as I am ? 
Ca n't you ? '' 
`` It 's utterly impossible , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
You must take off your clothes . '' 
`` As you like , '' Mitya submitted gloomily ; `` only , please , not here , but behind the curtains . 
Who will search them ? '' 
`` Behind the curtains , of course . '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent . 
His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity . 
The Prosecutor Catches Mitya SOMETHING utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed . 
He could never , even a minute before , have conceived that anyone could behave like that to him , Mitya Karamazov . 
What was worst of all , there was something humiliating in it , and on their side something `` supercilious and scornful . '' 
It was nothing to take off his coat , but he was asked to undress further , or rather not asked but `` commanded , '' he quite understood that . 
From pride and contempt he submitted without a word . 
Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain . 
`` To be ready if force is required , '' thought Mitya , `` and perhaps for some other reason , too . '' 
`` Well , must I take off my shirt , too ? '' 
he asked sharply , but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer . 
He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat , the trousers , the waistcoat and the cap ; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny . 
`` They make no bones about it , '' thought Mitya , `` they do n't keep up the most elementary politeness . '' 
`` I ask you for the second time - need I take off my shirt or not ? '' 
he said , still more sharply and irritably . 
`` Do n't trouble yourself . 
We will tell you what to do , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch said , and his voice was positively peremptory , or so it seemed to Mitya . 
Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers . 
There turned out to be on the coat , especially on the left side at the back , a huge patch of blood , dry , and still stiff . 
There were bloodstains on the trousers , too . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch , moreover , in the presence of the peasant witnesses , passed his fingers along the collar , the cuffs , and all the seams of the coat and trousers , obviously looking for something - money , of course . 
He did n't even hide from Mitya his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes . 
`` He treats me not as an officer but as a thief , '' Mitya muttered to himself . 
They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness . 
The secretary , for instance , who was also behind the curtain , fussing about and listening , called Nikolay Parfenovitch 's attention to the cap , which they were also fingering . 
`` You remember Gridyenko , the copying clerk , '' observed the secretary . 
`` Last summer he received the wages of the whole office , and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk . 
And where was it found ? 
Why , in just such pipings in his cap . 
The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping . '' 
Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko 's case perfectly , and so laid aside Mitya 's cap , and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later . 
`` Excuse me , '' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch , suddenly , noticing that the right cuff of Mitya 's shirt was turned in , and covered with blood , `` excuse me , what 's that , blood ? '' 
`` Yes , '' Mitya jerked out . 
`` That is , what blood ? 
... and why is the cuff turned in ? '' 
Mitya told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory , and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at Perhotin 's . 
`` You must take off your shirt , too . 
That 's very important as material evidence . '' 
Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage . 
`` What , am I to stay naked ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Do n't disturb yourself . 
We will arrange something . 
And meanwhile take off your socks . '' 
`` You 're not joking ? 
Is that really necessary ? '' 
Mitya 's eyes flashed . 
`` We are in no mood for joking , '' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly . 
`` Well , if I must - '' muttered Mitya , and sitting down on the bed , he took off his socks . 
He felt unbearably awkward . 
All were clothed , while he was naked , and strange to say , when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence , and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them , and that now they had a perfect right to despise him . 
`` When all are undressed , one is somehow not ashamed , but when one 's the only one undressed and everybody is looking , it 's degrading , '' he kept repeating to himself , again and again . 
`` It 's like a dream ; I 've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions . '' 
It was a misery to him to take off his socks . 
They were very dirty , and so were his underclothes , and now everyone could see it . 
And what was worse , he disliked his feet . 
All his life he had thought both his big toes hideous . 
He particularly loathed the coarse , flat , crooked nail on the right one , and now they would all see it . 
Feeling intolerably ashamed made him , at once and intentionally , rougher . 
He pulled off his shirt , himself . 
`` Would you like to look anywhere else if you 're not ashamed to ? '' 
`` No , there 's no need to , at present . '' 
`` Well , am I to stay naked like this ? '' 
he added savagely . 
`` Yes , that ca n't be helped for the time ... . 
Kindly sit down here for a while . 
You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed , and I. . . 
I 'll see to all this . '' 
All the things were shown to the witnesses . 
The report of the search was drawn up , and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out , and the clothes were carried out after him . 
Ippolit Kirillovitch went out , too . 
Mitya was left alone with the peasants , who stood in silence , never taking their eyes off him . 
Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt . 
He felt cold . 
His bare feet stuck out , and he could n't pull the quilt over so as to cover them . 
Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time , `` an insufferable time . '' 
`` He thinks of me as a puppy , '' thought Mitya , gnashing his teeth . 
`` That rotten prosecutor has gone , too , contemptuous no doubt , it disgusts him to see me naked ! '' 
Mitya imagined , however , that his clothes would be examined and returned to him . 
But what was his indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes , brought in behind him by a peasant . 
`` Here are clothes for you , '' he observed airily , seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission . 
`` Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency , as well as a clean shirt . 
Luckily he had them all in his trunk . 
You can keep your own socks and underclothes . '' 
Mitya flew into a passion . 
`` I wo n't have other people 's clothes ! '' 
he shouted menacingly , `` give me my own ! '' 
`` It 's impossible ! '' 
`` Give me my own . 
Damn Kalganov and his clothes , too ! '' 
It was a long time before they could persuade him . 
But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down . 
They impressed upon him that his clothes , being stained with blood , must be `` included with the other material evidence , '' and that they `` had not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case . '' 
Mitya at last understood this . 
He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself . 
He merely observed , as he put them on , that the clothes were much better than his old ones , and that he disliked `` gaining by the change . '' 
The coat was , besides , `` ridiculously tight . 
Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement ? '' 
They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating , that Kalganov was only a little taller , so that only the trousers might be a little too long . 
But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders . 
`` Damn it all ! 
I can hardly button it , '' Mitya grumbled . 
`` Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I did n't ask for his clothes , and it 's not my doing that they 've dressed me up like a clown . '' 
`` He understands that , and is sorry ... I mean , not sorry to lend you his clothes , but sorry about all this business , '' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Confound his sorrow ! 
Well , where now ? 
Am I to go on sitting here ? '' 
He was asked to go back to the `` other room . '' 
Mitya went in , scowling with anger , and trying to avoid looking at anyone . 
Dressed in another man 's clothes he felt himself disgraced , even in the eyes of the peasants , and of Trifon Borissovitch , whose face appeared , for some reason , in the doorway , and vanished immediately . 
`` He 's come to look at me dressed up , '' thought Mitya . 
He sat down on the same chair as before . 
He had an absurd nightmarish feeling , as though he were out of his mind . 
`` Well , what now ? 
Are you going to flog me ? 
That 's all that 's left for you , '' he said , clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor . 
He would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though he disdained to speak to him . 
`` He looked too closely at my socks , and turned them inside out on purpose to show everyone how dirty they were - the scoundrel ! '' 
`` Well , now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses , '' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch , as though in reply to Mitya 's question . 
`` Yes , '' said the prosecutor thoughtfully , as though reflecting on something . 
`` We 've done what we could in your interest , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on , `` but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you , we are , at the present moment - '' `` What is the stone in your ring ? '' 
Mitya interrupted suddenly , as though awakening from a reverie . 
He pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch 's right hand . 
`` Ring ? '' 
repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise . 
`` Yes , that one ... on your middle finger , with the little veins in it , what stone is that ? '' 
Mitya persisted , like a peevish child . 
`` That 's a smoky topaz , '' said Nikolay Parfenovitch , smiling . 
`` Would you like to look at it ? 
I 'll take it off ... '' `` No , do n't take it off , '' cried Mitya furiously , suddenly waking up , and angry with himself . 
`` Do n't take it off ... there 's no need ... . 
Damn it ! 
... Gentlemen , you 've sullied my heart ! 
Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you , if I had really killed my father , that I would shuffle , lie , and hide myself ? 
No , that 's not like Dmitri Karamazov , that he could n't do , and if I were guilty , I swear I should n't have waited for your coming , or for the sunrise as I meant at first , but should have killed myself before this , without waiting for the dawn ! 
I know that about myself now . 
I could n't have learnt so much in twenty years as I 've found out in this accursed night ! 
... And should I have been like this on this night , and at this moment , sitting with you , could I have talked like this , could I have moved like this , could I have looked at you and at the world like this , if I had really been the murderer of my father , when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night - not from fear - oh , not simply from fear of your punishment ! 
The disgrace of it ! 
And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you , who see nothing and believe in nothing , blind moles and scoffers , and to tell you another nasty thing I 've done , another disgrace , even if that would save me from your accusation ! 
No , better Siberia ! 
The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door , he killed him , he robbed him . 
Who was he ? 
I 'm racking my brains and ca n't think who . 
But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov , and that 's all I can tell you , and that 's enough , enough , leave me alone ... . 
Exile me , punish me , but do n't bother me any more . 
I 'll say no more . 
Call your witnesses ! '' 
Mitya uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future . 
The prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking , observed , as though it were the most ordinary thing , with the most frigid and composed air : `` Oh , about the open door of which you spoke just now , we may as well inform you , by the way , now , of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us , that has been given us by Grigory , the old man you wounded . 
On his recovery , he clearly and emphatically stated , in reply to our questions , that when , on coming out to the steps , and hearing a noise in the garden , he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open , before he noticed you running , as you have told us already , in the dark from the open window where you saw your father , he , Grigory , glanced to the left , and , while noticing the open window , observed at the same time , much nearer to him , the door , standing wide open - that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden . 
I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door , though , of course , he did not see you do so with his own eyes , since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden , running towards the fence . '' 
Mitya had leapt up from his chair half-way through this speech . 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
he yelled , in a sudden frenzy , `` it 's a barefaced lie . 
He could n't have seen the door open because it was shut . 
He 's lying ! '' 
`` I consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement . 
He does not waver . 
He adheres to it . 
We 've cross-examined him several times . '' 
`` Precisely . 
I have cross-examined him several times , '' Nikolay Parfenovitch confirmed warmly . 
`` It 's false , false ! 
It 's either an attempt to slander me , or the hallucination of a madman , '' Mitya still shouted . 
`` He 's simply raving , from loss of blood , from the wound . 
He must have fancied it when he came to ... . 
He 's raving . '' 
`` Yes , but he noticed the open door , not when he came to after his injuries , but before that , as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge . '' 
`` But it 's false , it 's false ! 
It ca n't be so ! 
He 's slandering me from spite ... . 
He could n't have seen it ... I did n't come from the door , '' gasped Mitya . 
The prosecutor turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and said to him impressively : `` Confront him with it . '' 
`` Do you recognise this object ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope , on which three seals still remained intact . 
The envelope was empty , and slit open at one end . 
Mitya stared at it with open eyes . 
`` It ... it must be that envelope of my father 's , the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there 's inscribed on it , allow me , ` For my little chicken ' ... yes - three thousand ! '' 
he shouted , `` do you see , three thousand , do you see ? '' 
`` Of course , we see . 
But we did n't find the money in it . 
It was empty , and lying on the floor by the bed , behind the screen . '' 
For some seconds Mitya stood as though thunderstruck . 
`` Gentlemen , it 's Smerdyakov ! '' 
he shouted suddenly , at the top of his voice . 
`` It 's he who 's murdered him ! 
He 's robbed him ! 
No one else knew where the old man hid the envelope . 
It 's Smerdyakov , that 's clear , now ! '' 
`` But you , too , knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow . '' 
`` I never knew it . 
I 've never seen it . 
This is the first time I 've looked at it . 
I 'd only heard of it from Smerdyakov ... . 
He was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden , I did n't know ... '' Mitya was completely breathless . 
`` But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father 's pillow . 
You especially stated that it was under the pillow , so you must have known it . '' 
`` We 've got it written down , '' confirmed Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Nonsense ! 
It 's absurd ! 
I 'd no idea it was under the pillow . 
And perhaps it was n't under the pillow at all ... . 
It was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow . 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
Have you asked him where it was ? 
What does Smerdyakov say ? 
That 's the chief point ... . 
And I went out of my way to tell lies against myself ... . 
I told you without thinking that it was under the pillow , and now you - Oh , you know how one says the wrong thing , without meaning it . 
No one knew but Smerdyakov , only Smerdyakov , and no one else ... . 
He did n't even tell me where it was ! 
But it 's his doing , his doing ; there 's no doubt about it , he murdered him , that 's as clear as daylight now , '' Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically , repeating himself incoherently , and growing more and more exasperated and excited . 
`` You must understand that , and arrest him at once ... . 
He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious , that 's clear now ... . 
He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal , and without the signal father would never have opened the door ... '' `` But you 're again forgetting the circumstance , '' the prosecutor observed , still speaking with the same restraint , though with a note of triumph , `` that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there , while you were in the garden ... '' `` The door , the door , '' muttered Mitya , and he stared speechless at the prosecutor . 
He sank back helpless in his chair . 
All were silent . 
`` Yes , the door ! 
... It 's a nightmare ! 
God is against me ! '' 
he exclaimed , staring before him in complete stupefaction . 
`` Come , you see , '' the prosecutor went on with dignity , `` and you can judge for yourself , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . 
On the one hand , we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out , a fact which overwhelms you and us . 
On the other side , your incomprehensible , persistent , and , so to speak , obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands , when only three hours earlier , on your own showing , you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles ! 
In view of all these facts , judge for yourself . 
What are we to believe , and what can we depend upon ? 
And do n't accuse us of being ` frigid , cynical , scoffing people , ' who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart ... . 
Try to enter into our position ... '' Mitya was indescribably agitated . 
He turned pale . 
`` Very well ! '' 
he exclaimed suddenly , `` I will tell you my secret . 
I 'll tell you where I got the money ! 
... I 'll reveal my shame , that I may not have to blame myself or you hereafter . '' 
`` And believe me , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch , in a voice of almost pathetic delight , `` that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may , later on , have an immense influence in your favour , and may , indeed , moreover - '' But the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table , and he checked himself in time . 
Mitya , it is true , had not heard him . 
Mitya 's Great Secret Received with Hisses `` GENTLEMEN , '' he began , still in the same agitation , `` I want to make a full confession : that money was my own . '' 
The lawyer 's faces lengthened . 
That was not at all what they expected . 
`` How do you mean ? '' 
faltered Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` when at five o'clock on the same day , from your own confession - '' `` Damn five o'clock on the same day and my own confession ! 
That 's nothing to do with it now ! 
That money was my own , my own , that is , stolen by me ... not mine , I mean , but stolen by me , and it was fifteen hundred roubles , and I had it on me all the time , all the time ... '' `` But where did you get it ? '' 
`` I took it off my neck , gentlemen , off this very neck ... it was here , round my neck , sewn up in a rag , and I 'd had it round my neck a long time , it 's a month since I put it round my neck ... to my shame and disgrace ! '' 
`` And from whom did you ... appropriate it ? '' 
`` You mean , ` steal it ' ? 
Speak out plainly now . 
Yes , I consider that I practically stole it , but , if you prefer , I ` appropriated it . ' 
I consider I stole it . 
And last night I stole it finally . '' 
`` Last night ? 
But you said that it 's a month since you ... obtained it ? 
... '' `` Yes . 
But not from my father . 
Not from my father , do n't be uneasy . 
I did n't steal it from my father , but from her . 
Let me tell you without interrupting . 
It 's hard to do , you know . 
You see , a month ago , I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna , formerly my betrothed . 
Do you know her ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` I know you know her . 
She 's a noble creature , noblest of the noble . 
But she has hated me ever so long , oh , ever so long ... and hated me with good reason , good reason ! '' 
`` Katerina Ivanovna ! '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder . 
The prosecutor , too , stared . 
`` Oh , do n't take her name in vain ! 
I 'm a scoundrel to bring her into it . 
Yes , I 've seen that she hated me ... a long while ... . 
From the very first , even that evening at my lodging ... but enough , enough . 
You 're unworthy even to know of that . 
No need of that at all ... . 
I need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago , gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB- as though she could n't have sent it off herself ! -RRB- 
and I. . . 
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I. . . 
well , in fact , when I 'd just come to love another , her , she 's sitting down below now , Grushenka . 
I carried her off here to Mokroe then , and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand , but the other half I kept on me . 
Well , I 've kept that other half , that fifteen hundred , like a locket round my neck , but yesterday I undid it , and spent it . 
What 's left of it , eight hundred roubles , is in your hands now , Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
That 's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday . '' 
`` Excuse me . 
How 's that ? 
Why , when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand , not fifteen hundred , everybody knows that . '' 
`` Who knows it ? 
Who counted the money ? 
Did I let anyone count it ? '' 
`` Why , you told everyone yourself that you 'd spent exactly three thousand . '' 
`` It 's true , I did . 
I told the whole town so , and the whole town said so . 
And here , at Mokroe , too , everyone reckoned it was three thousand . 
Yet I did n't spend three thousand , but fifteen hundred . 
And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag . 
That 's how it was , gentlemen . 
That 's where I got that money yesterday ... '' `` This is almost miraculous , '' murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch . 
`` Allow me to inquire , '' observed the prosecutor at last , `` have you informed anyone whatever of this circumstance before ; I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago ? '' 
`` I told no one . '' 
`` That 's strange . 
Do you mean absolutely no one ? '' 
`` Absolutely no one . 
No one and nobody . '' 
`` What was your reason for this reticence ? 
What was your motive for making such a secret of it ? 
To be more precise : You have told us at last your secret , in your words , so ` disgraceful , ' though in reality - that is , of course , comparatively speaking - this action , that is , the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to someone else , and , of course , only for a time is , in my view at least , only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful , when one takes into consideration your character ... . 
Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable , still , discreditable is not ` disgraceful . ' 
... Many people have already guessed , during this last month , about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna 's that you have spent , and I heard the legend myself , apart from your confession ... . 
Mihail Makarovitch , for instance , had heard it , too , so that indeed , it was scarcely a legend , but the gossip of the whole town . 
There are indications , too , if I am not mistaken , that you confessed this yourself to someone , I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna 's , and so , it 's extremely surprising to me that hitherto , that is , up to the present moment , you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by , apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret ... . 
It 's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret ... . 
You cried out , just now , that Siberia would be better than confessing it ... '' The prosecutor ceased speaking . 
He was provoked . 
He did not conceal his vexation , which was almost anger , and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen , disconnectedly and incoherently , without choosing words . 
`` It 's not the fifteen hundred that 's the disgrace , but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand , '' said Mitya firmly . 
`` Why ? '' 
smiled the prosecutor irritably . 
`` What is there disgraceful , to your thinking , in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably , if you prefer , ` disgracefully , ' appropriated ? 
Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it . 
And by the way , why did you do that - why did you set apart that half , for what purpose , for what object did you do it ? 
Can you explain that to us ? '' 
`` Oh , gentlemen , the purpose is the whole point ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I put it aside because I was vile , that is , because I was calculating , and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month . '' 
`` It 's incomprehensible . '' 
`` I wonder at you . 
But I 'll make it clearer . 
Perhaps it really is incomprehensible . 
You see , attend to what I say . 
I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honour ; I spend it on a spree , say I spend it all , and next morning I go to her and say , ` Katya , I 've done wrong , I 've squandered your three thousand ' ; well , is that right ? 
No , it 's not right - it 's dishonest and cowardly ; I 'm a beast , with no more self-control than a beast , that 's so , is n't it ? 
But still I 'm not a thief ? 
Not a downright thief , you 'll admit ! 
I squandered it , but I did n't steal it . 
Now a second , rather more favourable alternative : follow me carefully , or I may get confused again - my head 's going round - and so , for the second alternative : I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand , that is , only half . 
Next day I go and take that half to her : ` Katya , take this fifteen hundred from me , I 'm a low beast , and an untrustworthy scoundrel , for I 've wasted half the money , and I shall waste this , too , so keep me from temptation ! ' 
Well , what of that alternative ? 
I should be a beast and a scoundrel , and whatever you like ; but not a thief , not altogether a thief , or I should not have brought back what was left , but have kept that , too . 
She would see at once that since I brought back half , I should pay back what I 'd spent , that I should never give up trying to , that I should work to get it and pay it back . 
So in that case I should be a scoundrel , but not a thief , you may say what you like , not a thief ! '' 
`` I admit that there is a certain distinction , '' said the prosecutor , with a cold smile . 
`` But it 's strange that you see such a vital difference . '' 
`` Yes , I see a vital difference . 
Every man may be a scoundrel , and perhaps every man is a scoundrel , but not everyone can be a thief ; it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that . 
Oh , of course , I do n't know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel , that 's my conviction . 
Listen , I carry the money about me a whole month ; I may make up my mind to give it back to-morrow , and I 'm a scoundrel no longer ; but I can not make up my mind , you see , though I 'm making up my mind every day , and every day spurring myself on to do it , and yet for a whole month I ca n't bring myself to it , you see . 
Is that right to your thinking , is that right ? '' 
`` Certainly , that 's not right ; that I can quite understand , and that I do n't dispute , '' answered the prosecutor with reserve . 
`` And let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions , and , if you will be so kind , get back to the point . 
And the point is , that you have still not told us , although we 've asked you , why , in the first place , you halved the money , squandering one half and hiding the other ? 
For what purpose exactly did you hide it , what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred ? 
I insist upon that question , Dmitri Fyodorovitch . '' 
`` Yes , of course ! '' 
cried Mitya , striking himself on the forehead ; `` forgive me , I 'm worrying you , and am not explaining the chief point , or you 'd understand in a minute , for it 's just the motive of it that 's the disgrace ! 
You see , it was all to do with the old man , my dead father . 
He was always pestering Agrafena and I was jealous ; I thought then that she was hesitating between me and him . 
So I kept thinking everyday , suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden , suppose she were to leave off tormenting me , and were suddenly to say to me , ' I love you , not him ; take me to the other end of the world . ' 
And I 'd only forty copecks ; how could I take her away , what could I do ? 
Why , I 'd be lost . 
You see , I did n't know her then , I did n't understand her , I thought she wanted money , and that she would n't forgive my poverty . 
And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand , sewed it up , calculating on it , sewed it up before I was drunk , and after I had sewn it up , I went off to get drunk on the rest . 
Yes , that was base . 
Do you understand now ? '' 
Both the lawyers laughed aloud . 
`` I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all , '' chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch , `` for after all what does it amount to ? '' 
`` Why , that I stole it , that 's what it amounts to ! 
Oh , God , you horrify me by not understanding ! 
Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck , every day and every hour I said to myself , ` You 're a thief ! 
you 're a thief ! ' 
Yes , that 's why I 've been so savage all this month , that 's why I fought in the tavern , that 's why I attacked my father , it was because I felt I was a thief . 
I could n't make up my mind ; I did n't dare even to tell Alyosha , my brother , about that fifteen hundred : I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket . 
But , do you know , while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour : ` No , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , you may yet not be a thief . ' 
Why ? 
Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya . 
And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck , on my way from Fenya 's to Perhotin . 
I had n't been able till that moment to bring myself to it . 
And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief , a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life . 
Why ? 
Because , with that I destroyed , too , my dream of going to Katya and saying , ` I 'm a scoundrel , but not a thief ! 
Do you understand now ? 
Do you understand ? '' 
`` What was it made you decide to do it yesterday ? '' 
Nikolay Parfenovitch interrupted . 
`` Why ?
