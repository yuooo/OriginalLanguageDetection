cried Alyosha . 
`` Katerina Ivanovna will send you as much more as you need , and you know , I have money too , take what you want , as you would from a brother , from a friend , you can give it back later ... -LRB- You 'll get rich . 
you 'll get rich ! -RRB- 
And you know you could n't have a better idea than to move to another province ! 
It would be the saving of you , especially of your boy and you ought to go quickly , before the winter , before the cold . 
You must write to us when you are there , and we will always be brothers ... No , it 's not a dream ! '' 
Alyosha could have hugged him , he was so pleased . 
But glancing at him he stopped short . 
The man was standing with his neck outstretched and his lips protruding , with a pale and frenzied face . 
His lips were moving as though trying to articulate something ; no sound came , but still his lips moved . 
It was uncanny . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Alyosha , startled . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch ... I. . . 
you , '' muttered the captain , faltering , looking at him with a strange , wild , fixed stare , and an air of desperate resolution . 
At the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips . 
`` I. . . 
you , sir ... would n't you like me to show you a little trick I know ? '' 
he murmured , suddenly , in a firm rapid whisper , his voice no longer faltering . 
`` What trick ? '' 
`` A pretty trick , '' whispered the captain . 
His mouth was twisted on the left side , his left eye was screwed up . 
He still stared at Alyosha . 
`` What is the matter ? 
What trick ? '' 
Alyosha cried , now thoroughly alarmed . 
`` Why , look , '' squealed the captain suddenly , and showing him the two notes which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger during the conversation , he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them tight in his right hand . 
`` Do you see , do you see ? '' 
he shrieked , pale and infuriated . 
And suddenly flinging up his hand , he threw the crumpled notes on the sand . 
`` Do you see ? '' 
he shrieked again , pointing to them . 
`` Look there ! '' 
And with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel , gasping and exclaiming as he did so : `` So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! 
So much for your money ! '' 
Suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha , and his whole figure expressed unutterable pride . 
`` Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honour , '' he cried , raising his arm in the air . 
Then he turned quickly and began to run ; but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and kissed his hand to Alyosha . 
He ran another five paces and then turned round for the last time . 
This time his face was not contorted with laughter , but quivering all over with tears . 
In a tearful , faltering , sobbing voice he cried : `` What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame ? '' 
And then he ran on without turning . 
Alyosha looked after him , inexpressibly grieved . 
Oh , he saw that till the very last moment the man had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes . 
He did not turn back . 
Alyosha knew he would not . 
He would not follow him and call him back , he knew why . 
When he was out of sight , Alyosha picked up the two notes . 
They were very much crushed and crumpled , and had been pressed into the sand , but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha unfolded them and smoothed them out . 
After smoothing them out , he folded them up , put them in his pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on the success of her commission . 
Pro and Contra The Engagement MADAME HOHLAKOV was again the first to meet Alyosha . 
She was flustered ; something important had happened . 
Katerina Ivanovna 's hysterics had ended in a fainting fit , and then `` a terrible , awful weakness had followed , she lay with her eyes turned up and was delirious . 
Now she was in a fever . 
They had sent for Herzenstube ; they had sent for the aunts . 
The aunts were already here , but Herzenstube had not yet come . 
They were all sitting in her room , waiting . 
She was unconscious now , and what if it turned to brain fever ! '' 
Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed . 
`` This is serious , serious , '' she added at every word , as though nothing that had happened to her before had been serious . 
Alyosha listened with distress , and was beginning to describe his adventures , but she interrupted him at the first words . 
She had not time to listen . 
She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there . 
`` Lise , '' she whispered almost in his ear , `` Lise has greatly surprised me just now , dear Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
She touched me , too , and so my heart forgives her everything . 
Only fancy , as soon as you had gone , she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday , though she was not laughing at you , but only joking . 
But she was seriously sorry for it , almost ready to cry , so that I was quite surprised . 
She has never been really sorry for laughing at me , but has only made a joke of it . 
And you know she is laughing at me every minute . 
But this time she was in earnest She thinks a great deal of your opinion , Alexey Fyodorovitch , and do n't take offence or be wounded by her if you can help it . 
I am never hard upon her , for she 's such a clever little thing . 
Would you believe it ? 
She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood , ` the greatest friend of her childhood ' - just think of that - ` greatest friend ' - and what about me ? 
She has very strong feelings and memories , and , what 's more , she uses these phrases , most unexpected words , which come out all of a sudden when you least expect them . 
She spoke lately about a pine-tree , for instance : there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her early childhood . 
Very likely it 's standing there still ; so there 's no need to speak in the past tense . 
Pine-trees are not like people , Alexey Fyodorovitch , they do n't change quickly . 
` Mamma , ' she said , ' I remember this pine tree as in a dream , ' only she said something so original about it that I ca n't repeat it . 
Besides , I 've forgotten it . 
Well , good-bye ! 
I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind . 
Ah ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , I 've been out of my mind twice in my life . 
Go to Lise , cheer her up , as you always can so charmingly . 
Lise , '' she cried , going to her door , `` here I 've brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch , whom you insulted so . 
He is not at all angry , I assure you ; on the contrary , he is surprised that you could suppose so . '' 
`` Merci , maman . 
Come in , Alexey Fyodorovitch . '' 
Alyosha went in . 
Lise looked rather embarrassed , and at once flushed crimson . 
She was evidently ashamed of something , and , as people always do in such cases , she began immediately talking of other things , as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment . 
`` Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles , Alexey Fyodorovitch , and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know , although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to another ... I cried when I heard . 
Well , did you give him the money and how is that poor man getting on ? '' 
`` The fact is I did n't give it to him , and it 's a long story , '' answered Alyosha , as though he , too , could think of nothing but his regret at having failed , yet Lise saw perfectly well that he , too , looked away , and that he , too , was trying to talk of other things . 
Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story , but at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise 's attention as well . 
He spoke with deep feeling , under the influence of the strong impression he had just received , and he succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially . 
In old days in Moscow he had been fond of coming to Lise and describing to her what had just happened to him , what he had read , or what he remembered of his childhood . 
Sometimes they had made day-dreams and woven whole romances together - generally cheerful and amusing ones . 
Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in Moscow , two years before . 
Lise was extremely touched by his story . 
Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling . 
When he finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money , Lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out : `` So you did n't give him the money ! 
So you let him run away ! 
Oh , dear , you ought to have run after him ! '' 
`` No , Lise ; it 's better I did n't run after him , '' said Alyosha , getting up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room . 
`` How so ? 
How is it better ? 
Now they are without food and their case is hopeless . '' 
`` Not hopeless , for the two hundred roubles will still come to them . 
He 'll take the money to-morrow . 
To-morrow he will be sure to take it , '' said Alyosha , pacing up and down , pondering . 
`` You see , Lise , '' he went on , stopping suddenly before her , `` I made one blunder , but that , even that , is all for the best . '' 
`` What blunder , and why is it for the best ? '' 
`` I 'll tell you . 
He is a man of weak and timorous character ; he has suffered so much and is very good-natured . 
I keep wondering why he took offence so suddenly , for I assure you , up to the last minute , he did not know that he was going to trample on the notes . 
And I think now that there was a great deal to offend him ... and it could not have been otherwise in his position ... . 
To begin with , he was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence and not having concealed it from me . 
If he had been pleased , but not so much ; if he had not shown it ; if he had begun affecting scruples and difficulties , as other people do when they take money , he might still endure - to take it . 
But he was too genuinely delighted , and that was mortifying . 
Ah , Lise , he is a good and truthful man - that 's the worst of the whole business . 
All the while he talked , his voice was so weak , so broken , he talked so fast , so fast , he kept laughing such a laugh , or perhaps he was crying - yes , I am sure he was crying , he was so delighted - and he talked about his daughters - and about the situation he could get in another town ... . 
And when he had poured out his heart , he felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that . 
So he began to hate me at once . 
He is one of those awfully sensitive poor people . 
What had made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted me as a friend , you see . 
At first he almost flew at me and tried to intimidate me , but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing me ; he kept touching me with his hands . 
This must have been how he came to feel it all so humiliating , and then I made that blunder , a very important one . 
I suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to another town , we would give it to him , and , indeed , I myself would give him as much as he wanted out of my own money . 
That struck him all at once . 
Why , he thought , did I put myself forward to help him ? 
You know , Lise , it 's awfully hard for a man who has been injured , when other people look at him as though they were his benefactors ... . 
I 've heard that ; Father Zossima told me so . 
I do n't know how to put it , but I have often seen it myself . 
And I feel like that myself , too . 
And the worst of it was that though he did not know , to the very last minute , that he would trample on the notes , he had a kind of presentiment of it , I am sure of that . 
That 's just what made him so ecstatic , that he had that presentiment ... . 
And though it 's so dreadful , it 's all for the best . 
In fact , I believe nothing better could have happened . '' 
`` Why , why could nothing better have happened ? '' 
cried Lise , looking with great surprise at Alyosha . 
`` Because if he had taken the money , in an hour after getting home , he would be crying with mortification , that 's just what would have happened . 
And most likely he would have come to me early to-morrow , and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now . 
But now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant , though he knows he has ` ruined himself . ' 
So now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by to-morrow , for he has already vindicated his honour , tossed away the money , and trampled it under foot ... . 
He could n't know when he did it that I should bring it to him again to-morrow , and yet he is in terrible need of that money . 
Though he is proud of himself now , yet even to-day he 'll be thinking what a help he has lost . 
He will think of it more than ever at night , will dream of it , and by to-morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness . 
It 's just then that I 'll appear . 
` Here , you are a proud man , ' I shall say : ` you have shown it ; but now take the money and forgive us ! ' 
And then he will take it ! 
Alyosha was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words , `` And then he will take it ! '' 
Lise clapped her hands . 
`` Ah , that 's true ! 
I understand that perfectly now . 
Ah , Alyosha , how do you know all this ? 
So young and yet he knows what 's in the heart ... . 
I should never have worked it out . '' 
`` The great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing with us , in spite of his taking money from us , '' Alyosha went on in his excitement , `` and not only on an equal , but even on a higher footing . '' '' 
` On a higher footing ' is charming , Alexey Fyodorovitch ; but go on , go on ! '' 
`` You mean there is n't such an expression as ` on a higher footing ' ; but that does n't matter because - '' `` Oh , no , of course it does n't matter . 
Forgive me , Alyosha , dear ... . 
You know , I scarcely respected you till now - that is I respected you but on an equal footing ; but now I shall begin to respect you on a higher footing . 
Do n't be angry , dear , at my joking , '' she put in at once , with strong feeling . 
`` I am absurd and small , but you , you ! 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
Is n't there in all our analysis - I mean your analysis ... no , better call it ours - are n't we showing contempt for him , for that poor man - in analysing his soul like this , as it were , from above , eh ? 
In deciding so certainly that he will take the money ? '' 
`` No , Lise , it 's not contempt , '' Alyosha answered , as though he had prepared himself for the question . 
`` I was thinking of that on the way here . 
How can it be contempt when we are all like him , when we are all just the same as he is ? 
For you know we are just the same , no better . 
If we are better , we should have been just the same in his place ... . 
I do n't know about you , Lise , but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways , and his soul is not sordid ; on the contrary , full of fine feeling ... . 
No , Lise , I have no contempt for him . 
Do you know , Lise , my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for children , and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
dear , let us care for people as we would for the sick ! '' 
`` Let us , Lise ; I am ready . 
Though I am not altogether ready in myself . 
I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I do n't see things . 
It 's different with you . '' 
`` Ah , I do n't believe it ! 
Alexey Fyodorovitch , how happy I am ! '' 
`` I am so glad you say so , Lise . '' 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , you are wonderfully good , but you are sometimes sort of formal ... . 
And yet you are not a bit formal really . 
Go to the door , open it gently , and see whether mamma is listening , '' said Lise , in a nervous , hurried whisper . 
Alyosha went , opened the door , and reported that no one was listening . 
`` Come here , Alexey Fyodorovitch , '' Lise went on , flushing redder and redder . 
`` Give me your hand - that 's right . 
I have to make a great confession . 
I did n't write to you yesterday in joke , but in earnest , '' and she hid her eyes with her hand . 
It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession . 
Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times . 
`` Ah , Lise , what a good thing ! '' 
cried Alyosha joyfully . 
`` You know , I was perfectly sure you were in earnest . '' 
`` Sure ? 
Upon my word ! 
She put aside his hand , but did not leave go of it , blushing hotly , and laughing a little happy laugh . 
`` I kiss his hand and he says , ` What a good thing ! ' '' 
But her reproach was undeserved . 
Alyosha , too , was greatly overcome . 
`` I should like to please you always , Lise , but do n't know how to do it . '' 
he muttered , blushing too . 
`` Alyosha , dear , you are cold and rude . 
Do you see ? 
He has chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it . 
He is sure I was in earnest . 
What a thing to say ! 
Why , that 's impertinence - that 's what it is . '' 
`` Why , was it wrong of me to feel sure ? '' 
Alyosha asked , laughing suddenly . 
`` Ah , Alyosha , on the contrary , it was delightfully right , '' cried Lise , looking tenderly and happily at him . 
Alyosha stood still , holding her hand in his . 
Suddenly he stooped down and kissed her on her lips . 
`` Oh , what are you doing ? '' 
cried Lise . 
Alyosha was terribly abashed . 
`` Oh , forgive me if I should n't ... . 
Perhaps I 'm awfully stupid ... . 
You said I was cold , so I kissed you ... . 
But I see it was stupid . '' 
Lise laughed , and hid her face in her hands . 
`` And in that dress ! '' 
she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth . 
But she suddenly ceased laughing and became serious , almost stern . 
`` Alyosha , we must put off kissing . 
We are not ready for that yet , and we shall have a long time to wait , '' she ended suddenly . 
`` Tell me rather why you who are so clever , so intellectual , so observant , choose a little idiot , an invalid like me ? 
Ah , Alyosha , I am awfully happy , for I do n't deserve you a bit . '' 
`` You do , Lise . 
I shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few days . 
If I go into the world , I must marry . 
I know that . 
He told me to marry , too . 
Whom could I marry better than you - and who would have me except you ? 
I have been thinking it over . 
In the first place , you 've known me from a child and you 've a great many qualities I have n't . 
You are more light-hearted than I am ; above all , you are more innocent than I am . 
I have been brought into contact with many , many things already ... . 
Ah , you do n't know , but I , too , am a Karamazov . 
What does it matter if you do laugh and make jokes , and at me , too ? 
Go on laughing . 
I am so glad you do . 
You laugh like a little child , but you think like a martyr . '' 
`` Like a martyr ? 
How ? '' 
`` Yes , Lise , your question just now : whether we were n't showing contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul - that was the question of a sufferer ... . 
You see , I do n't know how to express it , but anyone who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering . 
Sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many things already . '' 
`` Alyosha , give me your hand . 
Why are you taking it away ? '' 
murmured Lise in a failing voice , weak with happiness . 
`` Listen , Alyosha . 
What will you wear when you come out of the monastery ? 
What sort of suit ? 
Do n't laugh , do n't be angry , it 's very , very important to me . '' 
`` I have n't thought about the suit , Lise ; But I 'll wear whatever you like . '' 
`` I should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat , a white pique waistcoat , and a soft grey felt hat ... . 
Tell me , did you believe that I did n't care for you when I said I did n't mean what I wrote ? '' 
`` No , I did n't believe it . '' 
`` Oh , you insupportable person , you are incorrigible . '' 
`` You see , I knew that you seemed to care for me , but I pretended to believe that you did n't care for me to make it easier for you . '' 
`` That makes it worse ! 
Worse and better than all ! 
Alyosha , I am awfully fond of you . 
Just before you came this morning , I tried my fortune . 
I decided I would ask you for my letter , and if you brought it out calmly and gave it to me -LRB- as might have been expected from you -RRB- it would mean that you did not love me at all , that you felt nothing , and were simply a stupid boy , good for nothing , and that I am ruined . 
But you left the letter at home and that cheered me . 
You left it behind on purpose , so as not to give it back , because you knew I would ask for it ? 
That was it , was n't it ? '' 
`` Ah , Lise , it was not so a bit . 
The letter is with me now , and it was this morning , in this pocket . 
Here it is . '' 
Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing , and showed it her at a distance . 
`` But I am not going to give it to you . 
Look at it from here . '' 
`` Why , then you told a lie ? 
You , a monk , told a lie ! '' 
`` I told a lie if you like , '' Alyosha laughed , too . 
`` I told a lie so as not to give you back the letter . 
It 's very precious to me , '' he added suddenly , with strong feeling , and again he flushed . 
`` It always will be , and I wo n't give it up to anyone ! '' 
Lise looked at him joyfully . 
`` Alyosha , '' she murmured again , `` look at the door . 
Is n't mamma listening ? '' 
`` Very well , Lise , I 'll look ; but would n't it be better not to look ? 
Why suspect your mother of such meanness ? '' 
`` What meanness ? 
As for her spying on her daughter , it 's her right , it 's not meanness ! '' 
cried Lise , firing up . 
`` You may be sure , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that when I am a mother , if I have a daughter like myself I shall certainly spy on her ! '' 
`` Really , Lise ? 
That 's not right . '' 
`` Oh , my goodness ! 
What has meanness to do with it ? 
If she were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation , it would be meanness , but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man ... Listen , Alyosha , do you know I shall spy upon you as soon as we are married , and let me tell you I shall open all your letters and read them , so you may as well be prepared . '' 
`` Yes , of course , if so - '' muttered Alyosha , `` only it 's not right . '' 
`` Ah , how contemptuous ! 
Alyosha , dear , we wo n't quarrel the very first day . 
I 'd better tell you the whole truth . 
Of course , it 's very wrong to spy on people , and , of course , I am not right and you are , only I shall spy on you all the same . '' 
`` Do , then ; you wo n't find out anything , '' laughed Alyosha . 
`` And Alyosha , will you give in to me ? 
We must decide that too . '' 
`` I shall be delighted to , Lise , and certain to , only not in the most important things . 
Even if you do n't agree with me , I shall do my duty in the most important things . '' 
`` That 's right ; but let me tell you I am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters , but in everything . 
And I am ready to vow to do so now - in everything , and for all my life ! '' 
cried Lise fervently , `` and I 'll do it gladly , gladly ! 
What 's more , I 'll swear never to spy on you , never once , never to read one of your letters . 
For you are right and I am not . 
And though I shall be awfully tempted to spy , I know that I wo n't do it since you consider it dishonourable . 
You are my conscience now ... . 
Listen , Alexey Fyodorovitch , why have you been so sad lately - both yesterday and to-day ? 
I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble , but I see you have some special grief besides , some secret one , perhaps ? '' 
`` Yes , Lise , I have a secret one , too , '' answered Alyosha mournfully . 
`` I see you love me , since you guessed that . '' 
`` What grief ? 
What about ? 
Can you tell me ? '' 
asked Lise with timid entreaty . 
`` I 'll tell you later , Lise - afterwards , '' said Alyosha , confused . 
`` Now you would n't understand it perhaps - and perhaps I could n't explain it . '' 
`` I know your brothers and your father are worrying you , too . '' 
`` Yes , my brothers too , '' murmured Alyosha , pondering . 
`` I do n't like your brother Ivan , Alyosha , '' said Lise suddenly . 
He noticed this remark with some surprise , but did not answer it . 
`` My brothers are destroying themselves , '' he went on , `` my father , too . 
And they are destroying others with them . 
It 's ` the primitive force of the Karamazovs , ' as father Paissy said the other day , a crude , unbridled , earthly force . 
Does the spirit of God move above that force ? 
Even that I do n't know . 
I only know that I , too , am a Karamazov ... . 
Me a monk , a monk ! 
Am I a monk , Lise ? 
You said just now that I was . '' 
`` Yes , I did . '' 
`` And perhaps I do n't even believe in God . '' 
`` You do n't believe ? 
What is the matter ? '' 
said Lise quietly and gently . 
But Alyosha did not answer . 
There was something too mysterious , too subjective in these last words of his , perhaps obscure to himself , but yet torturing him . 
`` And now on the top of it all , my friend , the best man in the world is going , is leaving the earth ! 
If you knew , Lise , how bound up in soul I am with him ! 
And then I shall be left alone ... . 
I shall come to you , Lise ... . 
For the future we will be together . '' 
`` Yes , together , together ! 
Henceforward we shall be always together , all our lives ! 
Listen , kiss me , I allow you . '' 
Alyosha kissed her . 
`` Come , now go . 
Christ be with you ! '' 
and she made the sign of the cross over him . 
`` Make haste back to him while he is alive . 
I see I 've kept you cruelly . 
I 'll pray to-day for him and you . 
Alyosha , we shall be happy ! 
Shall we be happy , shall we ? '' 
`` I believe we shall , Lise . '' 
Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good-bye to her . 
But no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him . 
From the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him . 
`` Alexey Fyodorovitch , this is awful . 
This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous . 
I trust you wo n't dream - It 's foolishness , nothing but foolishness ! '' 
she said , attacking him at once . 
`` Only do n't tell her that , '' said Alyosha , `` or she will be upset , and that 's bad for her now . '' 
`` Sensible advice from a sensible young man . 
Am I to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state , because you did n't want to irritate her by contradiction ? '' 
`` Oh no , not at all . 
I was quite serious in what I said , '' Alyosha declared stoutly . 
`` To be serious about it is impossible , unthinkable , and in the first place I shall never be at home to you again , and I shall take her away , you may be sure of that . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
asked Alyosha . 
`` It 's all so far off . 
We may have to wait another year and a half . '' 
`` Ah , Alexey Fyodorovitch , that 's true , of course , and you 'll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half . 
But I am so unhappy ! 
Though it 's such nonsense , it 's a great blow to me . 
I feel like Famusov in the last scene of Sorrow from Wit . 
You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya , and , only fancy , I 've run down to meet you on the stairs , and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase . 
I heard it all ; I almost dropped . 
So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late ! 
It means love to the daughter but death to the mother . 
I might as well be in my grave at once . 
And a more serious matter still , what is this letter she has written ? 
Show it me at once , at once ! '' 
`` No , there 's no need . 
Tell me , how is Katerina Ivanovna now ? 
I must know . '' 
`` She still lies in delirium ; she has not regained consciousness . 
Her aunts are here ; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs . 
Herzenstube came , and he was so alarmed that I did n't know what to do for him . 
I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him . 
He was driven home in my carriage . 
And on the top of it all , you and this letter ! 
It 's true nothing can happen for a year and a half . 
In the name of all that 's holy , in the name of your dying elder , show me that letter , Alexey Fyodorovitch . 
I 'm her mother . 
Hold it in your hand , if you like , and I will read it so . '' 
`` No , I wo n't show it to you . 
Even if she sanctioned it , I would n't . 
I am coming to-morrow , and if you like , we can talk over many things , but now good-bye ! '' 
And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street . 
Smerdyakov with a Guitar HE had no time to lose indeed . 
Even while he was saying good-bye to Lise , the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri , who was evidently keeping out of his way . 
It was getting late , nearly three o'clock . 
Alyosha 's whole soul turned to the monastery , to his dying saint , but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything . 
The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha 's mind with every hour . 
What that catastrophe was , and what he would say at that moment to his brother , he could perhaps not have said definitely . 
`` Even if my benefactor must die without me , anyway I wo n't have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not , but passed by and hastened home . 
If I do as I intend , I shall be following his great precept . '' 
His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares , to climb over the fence , as he had the day before , get into the garden and sit in the summer-house . 
If Dmitri were not there , thought Alyosha , he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house , but would remain hidden in the summer-house , even if he had to wait there till evening . 
If , as before , Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come , he would be very likely to come to the summer-house . 
Alyosha did not , however , give much thought to the details of his plan , but resolved to act upon it , even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day . 
Everything happened without hindrance , he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before , and stole into the summer-house unseen . 
He did not want to be noticed . 
The woman of the house and Foma too , if he were here , might be loyal to his brother and obey his instructions , and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden , or might warn Dmitri that he was being sought and inquired for . 
There was no one in the summer-house . 
Alyosha sat down and began to wait . 
He looked round the summer-house , which somehow struck him as a great deal more ancient than before . 
Though the day was just as fine as yesterday , it seemed a wretched little place this time . 
There was a circle on the table , left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before . 
Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind , as they always do in a time of tedious waiting . 
He wondered , for instance , why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before , why not in the other seat . 
At last he felt very depressed - depressed by suspense and uncertainty . 
But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour , when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close . 
People were sitting , or had only just sat down , somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away . 
Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before , he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the bushes on the left , by the fence . 
The people must be sitting on it now . 
Who were they ? 
A man 's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto , accompanying himself on the guitar : With invincible force I am bound to my dear . 
O Lord , have mercy On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
The voice ceased . 
It was a lackey 's tenor and a lackey 's song . 
Another voice , a woman 's , suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully , though with mincing affectation : `` Why have n't you been to see us for so long , Pavel Fyodorovitch ? 
Why do you always look down upon us ? '' 
`` Not at all answered a man 's voice politely , but with emphatic dignity . 
It was clear that the man had the best of the position , and that the woman was making advances . 
`` I believe the man must be Smerdyakov , '' thought Alyosha , `` from his voice . 
And the lady must be the daughter of the house here , who has come from Moscow , the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes to Marfa for soup . '' 
`` I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds , if they rhyme , '' the woman 's voice continued . 
`` Why do n't you go on ? '' 
The man sang again : What do I care for royal wealth If but my dear one be in health ? 
Lord have mercy On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
On her and on me ! 
`` It was even better last time , '' observed the woman 's voice . 
`` You sang ` If my darling be in health ' ; it sounded more tender . 
I suppose you 've forgotten to-day . '' 
`` Poetry is rubbish ! '' 
said Smerdyakov curtly . 
`` Oh , no ! 
I am very fond of poetry . '' 
`` So far as it 's poetry , it 's essential rubbish . 
Consider yourself , who ever talks in rhyme ? 
And if we were all to talk in rhyme , even though it were decreed by government , we should n't say much , should we ? 
Poetry is no good , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` How clever you are ! 
How is it you 've gone so deep into everything ? '' 
The woman 's voice was more and more insinuating . 
`` I could have done better than that . 
I could have known more than that , if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up . 
I would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father . 
And they used to throw it in my teeth in Moscow . 
It had reached them from here , thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch . 
Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth , but I would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the world at all . 
They used to say in the market , and your mamma too , with great lack of delicacy , set off telling me that her hair was like a mat on her head , and that she was short of five foot by a wee bit . 
Why talk of a wee bit while she might have said ' a little bit , ' like everyone else ? 
She wanted to make it touching , a regular peasant 's feeling . 
Can a Russian peasant be said to feel , in comparison with an educated man ? 
He ca n't be said to have feeling at all , in his ignorance . 
From my childhood up when I hear ' a wee bit , ' I am ready to burst with rage . 
I hate all Russia , Marya Kondratyevna . '' 
`` If you 'd been a cadet in the army , or a young hussar , you would n't have talked like that , but would have drawn your sabre to defend all Russia . '' 
`` I do n't want to be a hussar , Marya Kondratyevna , and , what 's more , I should like to abolish all soldiers . '' 
`` And when an enemy comes , who is going to defend us ? '' 
`` There 's no need of defence . 
In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia by Napoleon , first Emperor of the French , father of the present one , and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us . 
A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it . 
We should have had quite different institutions . '' 
`` Are they so much better in their own country than we are ? 
I would n't change a dandy I know of for three young englishmen , '' observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly , doubtless accompanying her words with a most languishing glance . 
`` That 's as one prefers . '' 
`` But you are just like a foreigner - just like a most gentlemanly foreigner . 
I tell you that , though it makes me bashful . '' 
`` If you care to know , the folks there and ours here are just alike in their vice . 
They are swindlers , only there the scoundrel wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it . 
The Russian people want thrashing , as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday , though he is mad , and all his children . '' 
`` You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch . ''
