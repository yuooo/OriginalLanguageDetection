`` Since you explain yourself with such frankness , it is our duty to be frank , likewise . 
Yes , you are ruined -- yes , you are hastening to your ruin - stop . 
And , in the first place , what money have we left ? '' 
`` Seven hundred thousand livres , '' said the intendant . 
`` Bread , '' murmured Madame Fouquet . 
`` Relays , '' said Pelisson , `` relays , and fly ! '' 
`` Whither ? '' 
`` To Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly ! '' 
`` If monseigneur flies , '' said Madame Belliere , `` it will be said that he was guilty - was afraid . '' 
`` More than that , it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with me . '' 
`` We will draw up memoirs to justify you , '' said La Fontaine . 
`` Fly ! '' 
`` I will remain , '' said Fouquet . 
`` And , besides , does not everything serve me ? '' 
`` You have Belle-Isle , '' cried the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` And I am naturally going there , when going to Nantes , '' replied the superintendent . 
`` Patience , then , patience ! '' 
`` Before arriving at Nantes , what a distance ! '' 
said Madame Fouquet . 
`` Yes , I know that well , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` But what is to be done there ? 
The king summons me to the States . 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me ; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness . '' 
`` Well , I have discovered the means of reconciling everything , '' cried Pelisson . 
`` You are going to set out for Nantes . '' 
Fouquet looked at him with an air of surprise . 
`` But with friends ; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans ; in your own barge as far as Nantes ; always ready to defend yourself , if you are attacked ; to escape , if you are threatened . 
In fact , you will carry your money against all chances ; and , whilst flying , you will only have obeyed the king ; then , reaching the sea , when you like , you will embark for Belle-Isle , and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please you , like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its eyrie . '' 
A general assent followed Pelisson 's words . 
`` Yes , do so , '' said Madame Fouquet to her husband . 
`` Do so , '' said Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do it ! 
do it ! '' 
cried all his friends . 
`` I will do so , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` This very evening ? '' 
`` In an hour ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune , '' said the Abbe Fouquet . 
`` What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` And , if necessary , we will go and discover a new world , '' added La Fontaine , intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm . 
A knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope . 
`` A courier from the king , '' said the master of the ceremonies . 
A profound silence immediately ensued , as if the message brought by this courier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment before . 
Every one waited to see what the master would do . 
His brow was streaming with perspiration , and he was really suffering from his fever at that instant . 
He passed into his cabinet , to receive the king 's message . 
There prevailed , as we have said , such a silence in the chambers , and throughout the attendance , that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet , saying , `` That is well , monsieur . '' 
This voice was , however , broken by fatigue , and trembled with emotion . 
An instant after , Fouquet called Gourville , who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation . 
At length , he himself re-appeared among his guests ; but it was no longer the same pale , spiritless countenance they had beheld when he left them ; from pale he had become livid ; and from spiritless , annihilated . 
A breathing , living specter , he advanced with his arms stretched out , his mouth parched , like a shade that comes to salute the friends of former days . 
On seeing him thus , every one cried out , and every one rushed towards Fouquet . 
The latter , looking at Pelisson , leaned upon his wife , and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise de Belliere . 
`` Well , '' said he , in a voice which had nothing human in it . 
`` What has happened , my God ! '' 
said some one to him . 
Fouquet opened his right hand , which was clenched , but glistening with perspiration , and displayed a paper , upon which Pelisson cast a terrified glance . 
He read the following lines , written by the king 's hand : '' ` DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET , - Give us , upon that which you have left of ours , the sum of seven hundred thousand livres , of which we stand in need to prepare for our departure . '' 
` And , as we know your health is not good , we pray God to restore you , and to have you in His holy keeping . '' 
` LOUIS . '' 
` The present letter is to serve as a receipt . ' '' 
A murmur of terror circulated through the apartment . 
`` Well , '' cried Pelisson , in his turn , `` you have received that letter ? '' 
`` Received it , yes ! '' 
`` What will you do , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , since I have received it . '' 
`` But - '' `` If I have received it , Pelisson , I have paid it , '' said the surintendant , with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present . 
`` You have paid it ! '' 
cried Madame Fouquet . 
`` Then we are ruined ! '' 
`` Come , no useless words , '' interrupted Pelisson . 
`` Next to money , life . 
Monseigneur , to horse ! 
to horse ! '' 
`` What , leave us ! '' 
at once cried both the women , wild with grief . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , in saving yourself , you save us all . 
To horse ! '' 
`` But he can not hold himself on . 
Look at him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
if he takes time to reflect - '' said the intrepid Pelisson . 
`` He is right , '' murmured Fouquet . 
`` Monseigneur ! 
Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Gourville , rushing up the stairs , four steps at once . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
`` Well ! 
what ? '' 
`` I escorted , as you desired , the king 's courier with the money . '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well ! 
when I arrived at the Palais Royal , I saw - '' `` Take breath , my poor friend , take breath ; you are suffocating . '' 
`` What did you see ? '' 
cried the impatient friends . 
`` I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback , '' said Gourville . 
`` There , then ! '' 
cried every voice at once ; `` there , then ! 
is there an instant to be lost ? '' 
Madame Fouquet rushed downstairs , calling for her horses ; Madame de Belliere flew after her , catching her in her arms , and saying : `` Madame , in the name of his safety , do not betray anything , do not manifest alarm . '' 
Pelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages . 
And , in the meantime , Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends were able to throw into it of gold and silver - the last offering , the pious alms made to misery by poverty . 
The surintendant , dragged along by some , carried by others , was shut up in his carriage . 
Gourville took the reins , and mounted the box . 
Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet , who had fainted . 
Madame de Belliere had more strength , and was well paid for it ; she received Fouquet 's last kiss . 
Pelisson easily explained this precipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned the minister to Nantes . 
: In M. Colbert 's Carriage . 
As Gourville had seen , the king 's musketeers were mounting and following their captain . 
The latter , who did not like to be confined in his proceedings , left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant , and set off on post horses , recommending his men to use all diligence . 
However rapidly they might travel , they could not arrive before him . 
He had time , in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs , to see something which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture . 
He saw M. Colbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage , which was stationed before the door . 
In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the hoods of two women , and being rather curious , he wished to know the names of the ladies hid beneath these hoods . 
To get a glimpse at them , for they kept themselves closely covered up , he urged his horse so near the carriage , that he drove him against the step with such force as to shake everything containing and contained . 
The terrified women uttered , the one a faint cry , by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman , the other an imprecation , in which he recognized the vigor and aplomb that half a century bestows . 
The hoods were thrown back : one of the women was Madame Vanel , the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse . 
D'Artagnan 's eyes were quicker than those of the ladies ; he had seen and known them , whilst they did not recognize him ; and as they laughed at their fright , pressing each other 's hands , - `` Humph ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , `` the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to friendship than formerly . 
She paying her court to the mistress of M. Colbert ! 
Poor M. Fouquet ! 
that presages you nothing good ! '' 
He rode on . 
M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes . 
Madame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband 's house , and , left alone with M. Colbert , chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her ride . 
She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation , that dear duchesse , and as she always talked for the ill of others , though ever with a view to her own good , her conversation amused her interlocutor , and did not fail to leave a favorable impression . 
She taught Colbert , who , poor man ! 
was ignorant of the fact , how great a minister he was , and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher . 
She promised to rally around him , when he should become surintendant , all the old nobility of the kingdom , and questioned him as to the preponderance it would be proper to allow La Valliere . 
She praised him , she blamed him , she bewildered him . 
She showed him the secret of so many secrets that , for a moment , Colbert thought he was doing business with the devil . 
She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of to - day , as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday ; and as he asked her very simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant : `` Why do you yourself hate him ? '' 
said she . 
`` Madame , in politics , '' replied he , `` the differences of system oft bring about dissentions between men . 
M. Fouquet always appeared to me to practice a system opposed to the true interests of the king . '' 
She interrupted him . 
- `` I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet . 
The journey the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of him . 
M. Fouquet , for me , is a man gone by - and for you also . '' 
Colbert made no reply . 
`` On his return from Nantes , '' continued the duchesse , `` the king , who is only anxious for a pretext , will find that the States have not behaved well - that they have made too few sacrifices . 
The States will say that the imposts are too heavy , and that the surintendant has ruined them . 
The king will lay all the blame on M. Fouquet , and then - '' `` And then ? '' 
said Colbert . 
`` Oh ! 
he will be disgraced . 
Is not that your opinion ? '' 
Colbert darted a glance at the duchesse , which plainly said : `` If M. Fouquet be only disgraced , you will not be the cause of it . '' 
`` Your place , M. Colbert , '' the duchesse hastened to say , `` must be a high place . 
Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself , after the fall of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` I do not understand , '' said he . 
`` You will understand . 
To what does your ambition aspire ? '' 
`` I have none . '' 
`` It was useless , then , to overthrow the superintendent , Monsieur Colbert . 
It was idle . '' 
`` I had the honor to tell you , madame - '' `` Oh ! 
yes , I know , all about the interest of the king - but , if you please , we will speak of your own . '' 
`` Mine ! 
that is to say , the affairs of his majesty . '' 
`` In short , are you , or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet ? 
Answer without evasion . '' 
`` Madame , I ruin nobody . '' 
`` I am endeavoring to comprehend , then , why you purchased from me the letters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet . 
Neither can I conceive why you have laid those letters before the king . '' 
Colbert , half stupefied , looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint . 
`` Madame , '' said he , `` I can less easily conceive how you , who received the money , can reproach me on that head - '' `` That is , '' said the old duchesse , `` because we must will that which we wish for , unless we are not able to obtain what we wish . '' 
`` Will ! '' 
said Colbert , quite confounded by such coarse logic . 
`` You are not able , hein ! 
Speak . '' 
`` I am not able , I allow , to destroy certain influences near the king . '' 
`` That fight in favor of M. Fouquet ? 
What are they ? 
Stop , let me help you . '' 
`` Do , madame . '' 
`` La Valliere ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
very little influence ; no knowledge of business , and small means . 
M. Fouquet has paid his court to her . '' 
`` To defend him would be to accuse herself , would it not ? '' 
`` I think it would . '' 
`` There is still another influence , what do you say to that ? '' 
`` Is it considerable ? '' 
`` The queen-mother , perhaps ? '' 
`` Her majesty , the queen-mother , has a weakness for M. Fouquet very prejudicial to her son . '' 
`` Never believe that , '' said the old duchesse , smiling . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Colbert , with incredulity , `` I have often experienced it . '' 
`` Formerly ? '' 
`` Very recently , madame , at Vaux . 
It was she who prevented the king from having M. Fouquet arrested . '' 
`` People do not forever entertain the same opinions , my dear monsieur . 
That which the queen may have wished recently , she would not wish , perhaps , to-day . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
said Colbert , astonished . 
`` Oh ! 
the reason is of very little consequence . '' 
`` On the contrary , I think it is of great consequence ; for , if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty , the queen-mother , my scruples would be all removed . '' 
`` Well ! 
have you never heard talk of a certain secret ? '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` Call it what you like . 
In short , the queen-mother has conceived a bitter hatred for all those who have participated , in one fashion or another , in the discovery of this secret , and M. Fouquet I believe is one of these . '' 
`` Then , '' said Colbert , `` we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` I have just left her majesty , and she assures me so . '' 
`` So be it , then , madame . '' 
`` But there is something further ; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet , M. d'Herblay , a bishop , I believe ? '' 
`` Bishop of Vannes . '' 
`` Well ! 
this M. d'Herblay , who also knew the secret , the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` So hotly pursued , that if he were dead , she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head , to satisfy her he would never speak again . '' 
`` And is that the desire of the queen-mother ? '' 
`` An order is given for it . '' 
`` This Monsieur d'Herblay shall be sought for , madame . '' 
`` Oh ! 
it is well known where he is . '' 
Colbert looked at the duchesse . 
`` Say where , madame . '' 
`` He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet ? '' 
`` At the residence of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` He shall be taken . '' 
It was now the duchesse 's turn to smile . 
`` Do not fancy the capture so easy , '' said she ; `` do not promise it so lightly . '' 
`` Why not , madame ? '' 
`` Because M. d'Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when and where you please . '' 
`` He is a rebel , then ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
Monsieur Colbert , we have passed all our lives in making rebels , and yet you see plainly , that so far from being taken , we take others . '' 
Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression , accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur . 
`` The times are gone , '' said he , `` in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France . 
If M. d'Herblay conspires , he will perish on the scaffold . 
That will give , or will not give , pleasure to his enemies , - a matter , by the way , of little importance to us . '' 
And this us , a strange word in the mouth of Colbert , made the duchesse thoughtful for a moment . 
She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation , and he meant to keep it . 
`` You ask me , madame , '' he said , `` to have this M. d'Herblay arrested ? '' 
`` I ? 
- I ask you nothing of the kind ! '' 
`` I thought you did , madame . 
But as I have been mistaken , we will leave him alone ; the king has said nothing about him . '' 
The duchesse bit her nails . 
`` Besides , '' continued Colbert , `` what a poor capture would this bishop be ! 
A bishop game for a king ! 
Oh ! 
no , no ; I will not even take the slightest notice of him . '' 
The hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself . 
`` Game for a woman ! '' 
said she . 
`` Is not the queen a woman ? 
If she wishes M. d'Herblay arrested , she has her reasons . 
Besides , is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
never mind that , '' said Colbert . 
`` This man shall be spared , if he is not the enemy of the king . 
Is that displeasing to you ? '' 
`` I say nothing . '' 
`` Yes - you wish to see him in prison , in the Bastile , for instance . '' 
`` I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` I will speak to the king about it ; he will clear up the point . '' 
`` And whilst waiting for that enlightenment , Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes will have escaped . 
I would do so . '' 
`` Escaped ! 
he ! 
and whither should he escape ? 
Europe is ours , in will , if not in fact . '' 
`` He will always find an asylum , monsieur . 
It is evident you know nothing of the man you have to do with . 
You do not know D'Herblay ; you do not know Aramis . 
He was one of those four musketeers who , under the late king , made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble , and who , during the regency , gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin . '' 
`` But , madame , what can he do , unless he has a kingdom to back him ? '' 
`` He has one , monsieur . '' 
`` A kingdom , he ! 
what , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I repeat to you , monsieur , that if he wants a kingdom , he either has it or will have it . '' 
`` Well , as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape , madame , I promise you he shall not escape . '' 
`` Belle-Isle is fortified , M. Colbert , and fortified by him . '' 
`` If Belle-Isle were also defended by him , Belle-Isle is not impregnable ; and if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle , well , madame , the place shall be besieged , and he will be taken . '' 
`` You may be very certain , monsieur , that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily , and you will be magnificently rewarded ; but what shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man ? '' 
`` That when once taken , he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape . '' 
`` Very well , Monsieur Colbert , and we may say , that , dating from this instant , we have formed a solid alliance , that is , you and I , and that I am absolutely at your service . '' 
`` It is I , madame , who place myself at yours . 
This Chevalier d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy , is he not ? '' 
`` Much more . '' 
`` A secret ambassador ? '' 
`` Higher still . '' 
`` Stop - King Phillip III . 
of Spain is a bigot . 
He is , perhaps , the confessor of Phillip III . '' 
`` You must go higher even than that . '' 
`` Mordieu ! '' 
cried Colbert , who forgot himself so far as to swear in the presence of this great lady , of this old friend of the queen-mother . 
`` He must then be the general of the Jesuits . '' 
`` I believe you have guessed it at last , '' replied the duchesse . 
`` Ah ! 
then , madame , this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him ; and we must make haste , too . '' 
`` Such was my opinion , monsieur , but I did not dare to give it you . '' 
`` And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne , and not us . '' 
`` But , mark this well , M. Colbert . 
M. d'Herblay is never discouraged ; if he has missed one blow , he will be sure to make another ; he will begin again . 
If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for himself , sooner or later , he will make another , of whom , to a certainty , you will not be prime minister . '' 
Colbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression . 
`` I feel assured that a prison will settle this affair for us , madame , in a manner satisfactory for both . '' 
The duchesse smiled again . 
`` Oh ! 
if you knew , '' said she , `` how many times Aramis has got out of prison ! '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
replied Colbert , `` we will take care that he shall not get out this time . '' 
`` But you were not attending to what I said to you just now . 
Do you remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so dreaded ? 
And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and experience . '' 
Colbert bit his lips . 
`` We will renounce the idea of the prison , '' said he , in a lower tone : `` we will find a little retreat from which the invincible can not possibly escape . '' 
`` That was well spoken , our ally ! '' 
replied the duchesse . 
`` But it is getting late ; had we not better return ? '' 
`` The more willingly , madame , from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king . '' 
`` To Paris ! '' 
cried the duchesse to the coachman . 
And the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine , after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet , the last defender of Belle-Isle , the former friend of Marie Michon , the new foe of the old duchesse . 
: The Two Lighters . 
D'Artagnan had set off ; Fouquet likewise was gone , and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends . 
The first moments of this journey , or better say , this flight , were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive . 
It was not natural , in fact , if Louis XIV . 
was determined to seize this prey , that he should allow it to escape ; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase , and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted . 
But insensibly all fears were dispersed ; the surintendant , by hard traveling , placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors , that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him . 
As to his position , his friends had made it excellent for him . 
Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes , and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey ? 
He arrived , fatigued , but reassured , at Orleans , where he found , thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him , a handsome lighter of eight oars . 
These lighters , in the shape of gondolas , somewhat wide and heavy , containing a small chamber , covered by the deck , and a chamber in the poop , formed by a tent , then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes , by the Loire , and this passage , a long one in our days , appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road , with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages . 
Fouquet went on board this lighter , which set out immediately . 
The rowers , knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances , pulled with all their strength , and that magic word , the finances , promised them a liberal gratification , of which they wished to prove themselves worthy . 
The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire . 
Magnificent weather , a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape , displayed the river in all its limpid serenity . 
The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird , and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage . 
Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes ; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States ; he would make himself a necessity , a thing very easy for a man of his merit , and would delay the catastrophe , if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely . 
`` Besides , '' said Gourville to him , `` at Nantes , you will make out , or we will make out , the intentions of your enemies ; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou , a bark in which to gain the sea , and when once upon the open sea , Belle-Isle is your inviolable port . 
You see , besides , that no one is watching you , no one is following . '' 
He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance , behind an elbow formed by the river , the masts of a huge lighter coming down . 
The rowers of Fouquet 's boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked Fouquet . 
`` The matter is , monseigneur , '' replied the patron of the bark , `` that it is a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane . '' 
Gourville started , and mounted to the deck , in order to obtain a better view . 
Fouquet did not go up with him , but said to Gourville , with restrained mistrust : `` See what it is , dear friend . '' 
The lighter had just passed the elbow . 
It came on so fast , that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day . 
`` How they go , '' repeated the skipper , `` how they go ! 
They must be well paid ! 
I did not think , '' he added , `` that oars of wood could behave better than ours , but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary . '' 
`` Well they may , '' said one of the rowers , `` they are twelve , and we but eight . '' 
`` Twelve rowers ! '' 
replied Gourville , `` twelve ! 
impossible . '' 
The number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded , even for the king . 
This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant , more for the sake of haste than of respect . 
`` What does it mean ? '' 
said Gourville , endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent , which was already apparent , travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering . 
`` They must be in a hurry , for it is not the king , '' said the patron . 
Fouquet shuddered . 
`` By what sign do you know that it is not the king ? '' 
said Gourville . 
`` In the first place , because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis , which the royal lighter always carries . '' 
`` And then , '' said Fouquet , `` because it is impossible it should be the king , Gourville , as the king was still in Paris yesterday . '' 
Gourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said : `` You were there yourself yesterday . '' 
`` And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste ? '' 
added he , for the sake of gaining time . 
`` By this , monsieur , '' said the patron ; `` these people must have set out a long while after us , and they have already nearly overtaken us . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said Gourville , `` who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even ? '' 
`` We have seen no lighter of that shape , except at Orleans . 
It comes from Orleans , monsieur , and makes great haste . '' 
Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance . 
The captain remarked their uneasiness , and , to mislead him , Gourville immediately said : `` Some friend , who has laid a wager he would catch us ; let us win the wager , and not allow him to come up with us . '' 
The patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible , but Fouquet said with much hauteur , - `` If it is any one who wishes to overtake us , let him come . '' 
`` We can try , monseigneur , '' said the man , timidly . 
`` Come , you fellows , put out your strength ; row , row ! '' 
`` No , '' said Fouquet , `` on the contrary ; stop short . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! 
what folly ! '' 
interrupted Gourville , stooping towards his ear . 
`` Pull up ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
The eight oars stopped , and resisting the water , created a retrograde motion . 
It stopped . 
The twelve rowers in the other did not , at first , perceive this maneuver , for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket - shot . 
Fouquet was short-sighted , Gourville was annoyed by the sun , now full in his eyes ; the skipper alone , with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements , perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter . 
`` I can see them ! '' 
cried he ; `` there are two . '' 
`` I can see nothing , '' said Gourville . 
`` You will not be long before you distinguish them ; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us . '' 
But what the patron announced was not realized ; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet , and instead of coming to join its pretended friends , it stopped short in the middle of the river . 
`` I can not comprehend this , '' said the captain . 
`` Nor I , '' cried Gourville . 
`` You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter , '' resumed Fouquet , `` try to describe them to us , before we are too far off . '' 
`` I thought I saw two , '' replied the boatman . 
`` I can only see one now , under the tent . '' 
`` What sort of man is he ? '' 
`` He is a dark man , broad-shouldered , bull-necked . '' 
A little cloud at that moment passed across the azure , darkening the sun . 
Gourville , who was still looking , with one hand over his eyes , became able to see what he sought , and all at once , jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him : `` Colbert ! '' 
said he , in a voice broken by emotion . 
`` Colbert ! '' 
repeated Fouquet . 
`` Too strange ! 
but no , it is impossible ! '' 
`` I tell you I recognized him , and he , at the same time , so plainly recognized me , that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop . 
Perhaps the king has sent him on our track . '' 
`` In that case he would join us , instead of lying by . 
What is he doing there ? '' 
`` He is watching us , without a doubt . '' 
`` I do not like uncertainty , '' said Fouquet ; `` let us go straight up to him . '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur , do not do that , the lighter is full of armed men . '' 
`` He wishes to arrest me , then , Gourville ? 
Why does he not come on ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin . '' 
`` But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor ! '' 
`` Nothing yet proves that they are watching you , monseigneur ; be patient ! '' 
`` What is to be done , then ? '' 
`` Do not stop ; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king 's order with zeal . 
Redouble the speed . 
He who lives will see ! '' 
`` That is better . 
Come ! '' 
cried Fouquet ; `` since they remain stock-still yonder , let us go on . '' 
The captain gave the signal , and Fouquet 's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested . 
Scarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms , than the other , that with the twelve rowers , resumed its rapid course . 
This position lasted all day , without any increase or diminution of distance between the two vessels . 
Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor . 
He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore , as if to effect a landing . 
Colbert 's lighter imitated this maneuver , and steered towards the shore in a slanting direction . 
By the merest chance , at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land , a stableman , from the chateau of Langeais , was following the flowery banks leading three horses in halters . 
Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready for flight , for four or five men , armed with muskets , jumped from the lighter on to the shore , and marched along the banks , as if to gain ground on the horseman . 
Fouquet , satisfied of having forced the enemy to a demonstration , considered his intention evident , and put his boat in motion again . 
Colbert 's people returned likewise to theirs , and the course of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance . 
Upon seeing this , Fouquet felt himself threatened closely , and in a prophetic voice - `` Well , Gourville , '' said he , whisperingly , `` what did I say at our last repast , at my house ? 
Am I going , or not , to my ruin ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` These two boats , which follow each other with so much emulation , as if we were disputing , M. Colbert and I , a prize for swiftness on the Loire , do they not aptly represent our fortunes ; and do you not believe , Gourville , that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes ? '' 
`` At least , '' objected Gourville , `` there is still uncertainty ; you are about to appear at the States ; you are about to show what sort of man you are ; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you , if not to conquer with . 
The Bretons do not know you ; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won ! 
Oh ! 
let M. Colbert look to it well , for his lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset . 
Both go quickly , his faster than yours , it is true ; we shall see which will be wrecked first . '' 
Fouquet , taking Gourville 's hand - `` My friend , '' said he , `` everything considered , remember the proverb , ` First come , first served ! ' 
Well ! 
M. Colbert takes care not to pass me . 
He is a prudent man is M. Colbert . '' 
He was right ; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes , watching each other . 
When the surintendant landed , Gourville hoped he should be able to seek refuge at once , and have the relays prepared . 
But , at the landing , the second lighter joined the first , and Colbert , approaching Fouquet , saluted him on the quay with marks of the profoundest respect - marks so significant , so public , that their result was the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse . 
Fouquet was completely self-possessed ; he felt that in his last moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself . 
He wished to fall from such a height that his fall should crush some of his enemies . 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert . 
The surintendant , therefore , coming up to him , replied , with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him - `` What ! 
is that you , M. Colbert ? '' 
`` To offer you my respects , monseigneur , '' said the latter . 
`` Were you in that lighter ? '' 
- pointing to the one with twelve rowers . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Of twelve rowers ? '' 
said Fouquet ; `` what luxury , M. Colbert . 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
- and Colbert blushed . 
`` This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it dear , Monsieur l'Intendant ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` But you have , happily , arrived ! 
-- You see , however , '' added he , a moment after , `` that I , who had but eight rowers , arrived before you . '' 
And he turned his back towards him , leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first . 
At least he did not give him the satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened . 
Colbert , so annoyingly attacked , did not give way . 
`` I have not been quick , monseigneur , '' he replied , `` because I followed your example whenever you stopped . '' 
`` And why did you do that , Monsieur Colbert ? '' 
cried Fouquet , irritated by the base audacity ; `` as you had a superior crew to mine , why did you not either join me or pass me ? '' 
`` Out of respect , '' said the intendant , bowing to the ground . 
Fouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him , we know not why or how , and he repaired to la Maison de Nantes , escorted by a vast crowd of people , who for several days had been agog with expectation of a convocation of the States . 
Scarcely was he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes , and a boat at Paimboef . 
He performed these various operations with so much mystery , activity , and generosity , that never was Fouquet , then laboring under an attack of fever , more nearly saved , except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of human projects , - chance . 
A report was spread during the night , that the king was coming in great haste on post horses , and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest . 
The people , while waiting for the king , were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers , newly arrived , with Monsieur d'Artagnan , their captain , and quartered in the castle , of which they occupied all the posts , in quality of guard of honor . 
M. d'Artagnan , who was very polite , presented himself , about ten o'clock , at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments ; and although the minister suffered from fever , although he was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat , he would receive M. d'Artagnan , who was delighted with that honor , as will be seen by the conversation they had together . 
: Friendly Advice . 
Fouquet had gone to bed , like a man who clings to life , and wishes to economize , as much as possible , that slender tissue of existence , of which the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the tenuity . 
D'Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber , and was saluted by the superintendent with a very affable `` Good day . '' 
`` Bon jour ! 
monseigneur , '' replied the musketeer ; `` how did you get through the journey ? '' 
`` Tolerably well , thank you . '' 
`` And the fever ? '' 
`` But poorly . 
I drink , as you perceive . 
I am scarcely arrived , and I have already levied a contribution of tisane upon Nantes . '' 
`` You should sleep first , monseigneur . '' 
`` Eh ! 
corbleu ! 
my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , I should be very glad to sleep . '' 
`` Who hinders you ? '' 
`` Why , you in the first place . '' 
`` I ? 
Oh , monseigneur ! '' 
`` No doubt you do . 
Is it at Nantes as at Paris ? 
Do you not come in the king 's name ? '' 
`` For Heaven 's sake , monseigneur , '' replied the captain , `` leave the king alone ! 
The day on which I shall come on the part of the king , for the purpose you mean , take my word for it , I will not leave you long in doubt . 
You will see me place my hand on my sword , according to the ordonnance , and you will hear my say at once , in ceremonial voice , ` Monseigneur , in the name of the king , I arrest you ! ' '' 
`` You promise me that frankness ? '' 
said the superintendent . 
`` Upon my honor ! 
But we have not come to that , believe me . '' 
`` What makes you think that , M. d'Artagnan ? 
For my part , I think quite the contrary . '' 
`` I have heard speak of nothing of the kind , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Indeed , no . 
You are an agreeable man , in spite of your fever . 
The king should not , can not help loving you , at the bottom of his heart . '' 
Fouquet 's expression implied doubt . 
`` But M. Colbert ? '' 
said he ; `` does M. Colbert love me as much as you say ? '' 
`` I am not speaking of M. Colbert , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` He is an exceptional man . 
He does not love you ; so much is very possible ; but , mordioux ! 
the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very little trouble . '' 
`` Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend ? '' 
replied Fouquet ; `` and that , upon my life ! 
I have never met with a man of your intelligence , and heart ? '' 
`` You are pleased to say so , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Why did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment ? '' 
`` Blind that we are ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Your voice is getting hoarse , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` drink , monseigneur , drink ! '' 
And he offered him a cup of tisane , with the most friendly cordiality ; Fouquet took it , and thanked him by a gentle smile . 
`` Such things only happen to me , '' said the musketeer . 
`` I have passed ten years under your very beard , while you were rolling about tons of gold . 
You were clearing an annual pension of four millions ; you never observed me ; and you find out there is such a person in the world , just at the moment you - '' `` Just at the moment I am about to fall , '' interrupted Fouquet . 
`` That is true , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` But you thought so ; and that is the same thing . 
Well ! 
if I fall , take my word as truth , I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself , as I strike my brow , ` Fool ! 
fool ! 
- stupid mortal ! 
You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand , and you did not employ him , you did not enrich him ! ' '' 
`` You overwhelm me , '' said the captain . 
`` I esteem you greatly . '' 
`` There exists another man , then , who does not think as M. Colbert thinks , '' said the surintendant . 
`` How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination ! 
He is worse than fever ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have good cause , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Judge for yourself . '' 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters , and the hypocritical persecution of Colbert . 
`` Is not this a clear sign of my ruin ? '' 
D'Artagnan became very serious . 
`` That is true , '' he said . 
`` Yes ; it has an unsavory odor , as M. de Treville used to say . '' 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look . 
`` Am I not clearly designated in that , captain ? 
Is not the king bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris , where I have so many creatures , and to possess himself of Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` Where M. d'Herblay is , '' added D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet raised his head . 
`` As for me , monseigneur , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I can assure you the king has said nothing to me against you . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` The king commanded me to set out for Nantes , it is true ; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres . '' 
`` My friend . '' 
`` To M. de Gesvres , yes , monseigneur , '' continued the musketeer , whose eye s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips . 
`` The king , moreover , commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers , which is apparently superfluous , as the country is quite quiet . '' 
`` A brigade ! '' 
said Fouquet , raising himself upon his elbow . 
`` Ninety-six horsemen , yes , monseigneur . 
The same number as were employed in arresting MM . 
de Chalais , de Cinq-Mars , and Montmorency . '' 
Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? '' 
`` I ? 
- to what end ? 
Are you threatened ? 
Only there really is an order with respect to carriages and boats - '' `` An order ? '' 
`` Yes ; but it can not concern you - a simple measure of police . '' 
`` What is it , captain ? 
- what is it ? '' 
`` To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes , without a pass , signed by the king . '' 
`` Great God ! 
but - '' D'Artagnan began to laugh . 
`` All that is not to be put into execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes . 
So that you see plainly , monseigneur , the order in nowise concerns you . '' 
Fouquet became thoughtful , and D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation . 
`` It is evident , by my thus confiding to you the orders which have been given to me , that I am friendly towards you , and that I am trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you . '' 
`` Without doubt ! 
- without doubt ! '' 
said Fouquet , still absent . 
`` Let us recapitulate , '' said the captain , his glance beaming with earnestness . 
`` A special guard about the castle , in which your lodging is to be , is it not ? '' 
`` Do you know the castle ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur , a regular prison ! 
The absence of M. de Gesvres , who has the honor of being one of your friends . 
The closing of the gates of the city , and of the river without a pass ; but , only when the king shall have arrived . 
Please to observe , Monsieur Fouquet , that if , instead of speaking to man like you , who are one of the first in the kingdom , I were speaking to a troubled , uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever . 
What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be free ! 
No police , no guards , no orders ; the water free , the roads free , Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged to lend his horses , if required . 
All this ought to reassure you , Monsieur Fouquet , for the king would not have left me thus independent , if he had any sinister designs . 
In truth , Monsieur Fouquet , ask me whatever you like , I am at your service ; and , in return , if you will consent to do it , do me a service , that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos , in case you embark for Belle-Isle , as you have a right to do without changing your dress , immediately , in your robe de chambre - just as you are . '' 
Saying these words , and with a profound bow , the musketeer , whose looks had lost none of their intelligent kindness , left the apartment . 
He had not reached the steps of the vestibule , when Fouquet , quite beside himself , hung to the bell-rope , and shouted , `` My horses ! 
- my lighter ! '' 
But nobody answered . 
The surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand . 
`` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
cried he , while slipping his watch into his pocket . 
And the bell sounded again , whilst Fouquet repeated , `` Gourville ! 
- Gourville ! '' 
Gourville at length appeared , breathless and pale . 
`` Let us be gone ! 
Let us be gone ! '' 
cried Fouquet , as soon as he saw him . 
`` It is too late ! '' 
said the surintendant 's poor friend . 
`` Too late ! 
- why ? '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of the castle . 
`` What does that mean , Gourville ? '' 
`` It means the king is come , monseigneur . '' 
`` The king ! '' 
`` The king , who has ridden double stages , who has killed horses , and who is eight hours in advance of all our calculations . '' 
`` We are lost ! '' 
murmured Fouquet . 
`` Brave D'Artagnan , all is over , thou has spoken to me too late ! '' 
The king , in fact , was entering the city , which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts , and from a vessel which replied from the lower parts of the river . 
Fouquet 's brow darkened ; he called his valets de chambre and dressed in ceremonial costume . 
From his window , behind the curtains , he could see the eagerness of the people , and the movement of a large troop , which had followed the prince . 
The king was conducted to the castle with great pomp , and Fouquet saw him dismount under the portcullis , and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan , who held his stirrup . 
D'Artagnan , when the king had passed under the arch , directed his steps towards the house Fouquet was in ; but so slowly , and stopping so frequently to speak to his musketeers , drawn up like a hedge , that it might be said he was counting the seconds , or the steps , before accomplishing his object . 
Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the court . 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan , on perceiving him , `` are you still there , monseigneur ? '' 
And that word still completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had paid him . 
The surintendant sighed deeply . 
`` Good heavens ! 
yes , monsieur , '' replied he . 
`` The arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed . '' 
`` Oh , then you know that the king has arrived ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , I have seen him ; and this time you come from him - '' `` To inquire after you , monseigneur ; and , if your health is not too bad , to beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle . '' 
`` Directly , Monsieur d'Artagnan , directly ! '' 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
said the captain , `` now the king is come , there is no more walking for anybody - no more free will ; the password governs all now , you as much as me , me as much as you . '' 
Fouquet heaved a last sigh , climbed with difficulty into his carriage , so great was his weakness , and went to the castle , escorted by D'Artagnan , whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful . 
: How the King , Louis XIV. , Played His Little Part . 
As Fouquet was alighting from his carriage , to enter the castle of Nantes , a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect , and gave him a letter . 
D'Artagnan endeavored to prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet , and pushed him away , but the message had been given to the surintendant . 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it , and instantly a vague terror , which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate , was painted on the countenance of the first minister . 
Fouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm , and passed on towards the king 's apartments . 
D'Artagnan , through the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs , saw , as he went up behind Fouquet , the man who had delivered the note , looking round him on the place and making signs to several persons , who disappeared in the adjacent streets , after having themselves repeated the signals . 
Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken , - a terrace which abutted on the little corridor , at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located . 
Here D'Artagnan passed on before the surintendant , whom , till that time , he had respectfully accompanied , and entered the royal cabinet . 
`` Well ? '' 
asked Louis XIV. , who , on perceiving him , threw on to the table covered with papers a large green cloth . 
`` The order is executed , sire . '' 
`` And Fouquet ? '' 
`` Monsieur le surintendant follows me , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` In ten minutes let him be introduced , '' said the king , dismissing D'Artagnan again with a gesture . 
The latter retired ; but had scarcely reached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for him , when he was recalled by the king 's bell . 
`` Did he not appear astonished ? '' 
asked the king . 
`` Who , sire ? '' 
`` Fouquet , '' replied the king , without saying monsieur , a peculiarity which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions . 
`` No , sire , '' replied he . 
`` That 's well ! '' 
And a second time Louis dismissed D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide . 
He reperused his note , conceived thus : `` Something is being contrived against you . 
Perhaps they will not dare to carry it out at the castle ; it will be on your return home . 
The house is already surrounded by musketeers . 
Do not enter . 
A white horse is in waiting for you behind the esplanade ! '' 
Fouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville . 
Not being willing that , if any evil happened to himself , this paper should compromise a faithful friend , the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand morsels , spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace . 
D'Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps in space . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` the king awaits you . '' 
Fouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor , where MM . 
de Brienne and Rose were at work , whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan , seated on a chair , likewise in the corridor , appeared to be waiting for orders , with feverish impatience , his sword between his legs . 
It appeared strange to Fouquet that MM . 
Brienne , Rose , and de Saint-Aignan , in general so attentive and obsequious , should scarcely take the least notice , as he , the surintendant , passed . 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers , he whom the king no longer called anything but Fouquet ? 
He raised his head , determined to look every one and everything bravely in the face , and entered the king 's apartment , where a little bell , which we already know , had already announced him to his majesty . 
The king , without rising , nodded to him , and with interest : `` Well ! 
how are you , Monsieur Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` I am in a high fever , '' replied the surintendant ; `` but I am at the king 's service . '' 
`` That is well ; the States assemble to-morrow ; have you a speech ready ? '' 
Fouquet looked at the king with astonishment . 
`` I have not , sire , '' replied he ; `` but I will improvise one . 
I am too well acquainted with affairs to feel any embarrassment . 
I have only one question to ask ; will your majesty permit me ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
Ask it . '' 
`` Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris ? '' 
`` You were ill ; I was not willing to fatigue you . '' 
`` Never did a labor - never did an explanation fatigue me , sire ; and since the moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king - '' `` Oh , Monsieur Fouquet ! 
an explanation ? 
An explanation , pray , of what ? '' 
`` Of your majesty 's intentions with respect to myself . '' 
The king blushed . 
`` I have been calumniated , '' continued Fouquet , warmly , `` and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make inquiries . '' 
`` You say all this to me very uselessly , Monsieur Fouquet ; I know what I know . '' 
`` Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you ; and I , on my part , have said nothing to you , whilst others have spoken many , many times - '' `` What do you wish to say ? '' 
said the king , impatient to put an end to this embarrassing conversation . 
`` I will go straight to the facts , sire ; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty 's opinion . '' 
`` Nobody has injured you , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` That reply proves to me , sire , that I am right . '' 
`` Monsieur Fouquet , I do not like people to be accused . '' 
`` Not when one is accused ? '' 
`` We have already spoken too much about this affair . '' 
`` Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself ? '' 
`` I repeat that I do not accuse you . '' 
Fouquet , with a half-bow , made a step backward . 
`` It is certain , '' thought he , `` that he has made up his mind . 
He alone who can not go back can show such obstinacy . 
Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed ; not to shun it would be stupid . '' 
He resumed aloud , `` Did your majesty send for me on business ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet , but for some advice I wish to give you . '' 
`` I respectfully await it , sire . '' 
`` Rest yourself , Monsieur Fouquet , do not throw away your strength ; the session of the States will be short , and when my secretaries shall have closed it , I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a fortnight . '' 
`` Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of the States ? '' 
`` No , Monsieur Fouquet . '' 
`` Not to me , the surintendant of the finances ? '' 
`` Rest yourself , I beg you ; that is all I have to say to you . '' 
Fouquet bit his lips and hung his head . 
He was evidently busy with some uneasy thought . 
This uneasiness struck the king . 
`` Are you angry at having to rest yourself , M. Fouquet ? '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , sire , I am not accustomed to take rest . '' 
`` But you are ill ; you must take care of yourself . '' 
`` Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow . '' 
His majesty made no reply ; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him . 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation . 
He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince , which fear would but precipitate . 
`` If I appear frightened , I am lost , '' thought he . 
The king , on his part , was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet . 
`` Has he a suspicion of anything ? '' 
murmured he . 
`` If his first word is severe , '' again thought Fouquet ; `` if he becomes angry , or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext , how shall I extricate myself ? 
Let us smooth the declivity a little . 
Gourville was right . '' 
`` Sire , '' said he , suddenly , `` since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the point of dispensing with my labor , may I not be allowed to be absent from the council of to-morrow ? 
I could pass the day in bed , and will entreat the king to grant me his physician , that we may endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever . '' 
`` So be it , Monsieur Fouquet , it shall be as you desire ; you shall have a holiday to-morrow , you shall have the physician , and shall be restored to health . '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
said Fouquet , bowing . 
Then , opening his game : `` Shall I not have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle - Isle ? '' 
And he looked Louis full in the face , to judge of the effect of such a proposal . 
The king blushed again . 
`` Do you know , '' replied he , endeavoring to smile , `` that you have just said , ` My residence of Belle-Isle ' ? '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Well ! 
do you not remember , '' continued the king in the same cheerful tone , `` that you gave me Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` That is true again , sire . 
Only , as you have not taken it , you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it . '' 
`` I mean to do so . '' 
`` That was , besides , your majesty 's intention as well as mine ; and I can not express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see all the king 's regiments from Paris to help take possession . '' 
The king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that alone . 
`` Oh , I am convinced of that , '' said Fouquet , warmly ; `` your majesty knows very well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand , to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` Peste ! '' 
cried the king ; `` I do not wish those fine fortifications , which cost so much to build , to fall at all . 
No , let them stand against the Dutch and English . 
You would not guess what I want to see at Belle - Isle , Monsieur Fouquet ; it is the pretty peasants and women of the lands on the sea-shore , who dance so well , and are so seducing with their scarlet petticoats ! 
I have heard great boast of your pretty tenants , monsieur le surintendant ; well , let me have a sight of them . '' 
`` Whenever your majesty pleases . '' 
`` Have you any means of transport ? 
It shall be to-morrow , if you like . '' 
The surintendant felt this stroke , which was not adroit , and replied , `` No , sire ; I was ignorant of your majesty 's wish ; above all , I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle , and I am prepared with nothing . '' 
`` You have a boat of your own , nevertheless ? '' 
`` I have five ; but they are all in port , or at Paimboeuf ; and to join them , or bring them hither , would require at least twenty-four hours . 
Have I any occasion to send a courier ? 
Must I do so ? '' 
`` Wait a little , put an end to the fever , - wait till to-morrow . '' 
`` That is true . 
Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred other ideas ? '' 
replied Fouquet , now perfectly convinced and very pale . 
The king started , and stretched his hand out towards his little bell , but Fouquet prevented his ringing . 
`` Sire , '' said he , `` I have an ague - I am trembling with cold . 
If I remain a moment longer , I shall most likely faint . 
I request your majesty 's permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes . '' 
`` Indeed , you are in a shiver ; it is painful to behold ! 
Come , Monsieur Fouquet , begone ! 
I will send to inquire after you . '' 
`` Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness . 
In an hour I shall be better . '' 
`` I will call some one to reconduct you , '' said the king . 
`` As you please , sire ; I would gladly take the arm of any one . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , ringing his little bell . 
`` Oh , sire , '' interrupted Fouquet , laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold , `` would you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings ? 
An equivocal honor that , sire ! 
A simple footman , I beg . '' 
`` And why , M. Fouquet ? 
M. d'Artagnan conducts me often , and extremely well ! '' 
`` Yes , but when he conducts you , sire , it is to obey you ; whilst me - '' `` Go on ! '' 
`` If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers , it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
replied the king , who became paler than Fouquet himself , - `` arrested ! 
oh ! '' 
`` And why should they not say so ? '' 
continued Fouquet , still laughing ; `` and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it . '' 
This sally disconcerted the monarch . 
Fouquet was skillful enough , or fortunate enough , to make Louis XIV . 
recoil before the appearance of the deed he meditated . 
M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed , without at all comprehending what was going on . 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment , affecting all the slowness of a man who walks with difficulty . 
When once out of the castle , `` I am saved ! '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , disloyal king , you shall see Belle-Isle , but it shall be when I am no longer there . '' 
He disappeared , leaving D'Artagnan with the king . 
`` Captain , '' said the king , `` you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` He is going to his lodgings again . 
You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . '' 
`` The case is provided for , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out . '' 
`` A carriage with an iron trellis ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan ; `` but a carriage with an iron trellis is not made in half an hour , and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet 's lodgings . '' 
`` The carriage in question is already made . '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is quite a different thing , '' said the captain ; `` if the carriage is ready made , very well , then , we have only to set it in motion . '' 
`` It is ready - and the horses harnessed . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
`` And the coachman , with the outriders , is waiting in the lower court of the castle . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed . 
`` There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet . '' 
`` To the castle of Angers , at first . '' 
`` Very well , sire . '' 
`` Afterwards we will see . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , one last word : you have remarked that , for making this capture of M. Fouquet , I have not employed my guards , on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious . '' 
`` Your majesty does not employ your guards , '' said the captain , a little humiliated , `` because you mistrust M. de Gesvres , that is all . '' 
`` That is to say , monsieur , that I have more confidence in you . '' 
`` I know that very well , sire ! 
and it is of no use to make so much of it . '' 
`` It is only for the sake of arriving at this , monsieur , that if , from this moment , it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been , monsieur - '' `` Oh ! 
very often , sire ; but for others , not for me . '' 
`` And why not with you ? '' 
`` Because I , sire , have , for an instant , wished to save M. Fouquet . '' 
The king started . 
`` Because , '' continued the captain , `` I had then a right to do so , having guessed your majesty 's plan , without you having spoken to me of it , and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet . 
Now , was I not at liberty to show my interest in this man ? '' 
`` In truth , monsieur , you do not reassure me with regard to your services . '' 
`` If I had saved him then , I should have been perfectly innocent ; I will say more , I should have done well , for M. Fouquet is not a bad man . 
But he was not willing ; his destiny prevailed ; he let the hour of liberty slip by . 
So much the worse ! 
Now I have orders , I will obey those orders , and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested . 
He is at the castle of Angers , this very M. Fouquet . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you have not got him yet , captain . '' 
`` That concerns me ; every one to his trade , sire ; only , once more , reflect ! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet , sire ? '' 
`` Yes , a thousand times , yes ! '' 
`` In writing , sire , then . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
D'Artagnan read it , bowed to the king , and left the room . 
From the height of the terrace he perceived Gourville , who went by with a joyous air towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
: The White Horse and the Black . 
`` That is rather surprising , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` Gourville running about the streets so gayly , when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger ; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace , and given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant . 
Gourville is rubbing his hands ; that is because he has done something clever . 
Whence comes M. Gourville ? 
Gourville is coming from the Rue aux Herbes . 
Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead ? '' 
And D'Artagnan followed , along the tops of the houses of Nantes , dominated by the castle , the line traced by the streets , as he would have done upon a topographical plan ; only , instead of the dead , flat paper , the living chart rose in relief with the cries , the movements , and the shadows of men and things . 
Beyond the inclosure of the city , the great verdant plains stretched out , bordering the Loire , and appeared to run towards the pink horizon , which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of the marshes . 
Immediately outside the gates of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic hand . 
D'Artagnan , who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by crossing the terrace , was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to the mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of Nantes . 
One step more , and he was about to descend the stairs , take his trellised carriage , and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet . 
But chance decreed , at the moment of plunging into the staircase , that he was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said the musketeer to himself ; `` a horse galloping , - a runaway horse , no doubt . 
What a rate he is going at ! '' 
The moving point became detached from the road , and entered into the fields . 
`` A white horse , '' continued the captain , who had just observed the color thrown luminously against the dark ground , `` and he is mounted ; it must be some boy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him . '' 
These reflections , rapid as lightning , simultaneous with visual perception , D'Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first steps of the staircase . 
Some morsels of paper were spread over the stairs , and shone out white against the dirty stones . 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the captain to himself , `` here are some of the fragments of the note torn by M. Fouquet . 
Poor man ! 
he has given his secret to the wind ; the wind will have no more to do with it , and brings it back to the king . 
Decidedly , Fouquet , you play with misfortune ! 
the game is not a fair one , - fortune is against you . 
The star of Louis XIV . 
obscures yours ; the adder is stronger and more cunning than the squirrel . '' 
D'Artagnan picked up one of these morsels of paper as he descended . 
`` Gourville 's pretty little hand ! '' 
cried he , whilst examining one of the fragments of the note ; `` I was not mistaken . '' 
And he read the word `` horse . '' 
`` Stop ! '' 
said he ; and he examined another , upon which there was not a letter traced . 
Upon a third he read the word `` white ; '' `` white horse , '' repeated he , like a child that is spelling . 
`` Ah , mordioux ! '' 
cried the suspicious spirit , `` a white horse ! '' 
And , like that grain of powder which , burning , dilates into ten thousand times its volume , D'Artagnan , enlightened by ideas and suspicions , rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace . 
The white horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire , at the extremity of which , melting into the vapors of the water , a little sail appeared , wave-balanced like a water-butterfly . 
`` Oh ! '' 
cried the musketeer , `` only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across plowed lands ; there is but one Fouquet , a financier , to ride thus in open day upon a white horse ; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make his escape towards the sea , while there are such thick forests on land , and there is but one D'Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet , who has half an hour 's start , and who will have gained his boat within an hour . '' 
This being said , the musketeer gave orders that the carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a thicket situated just outside the city . 
He selected his best horse , jumped upon his back , galloped along the Rue aux Herbes , taking , not the road Fouquet had taken , but the bank itself of the Loire , certain that he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance , and , at the intersection of the two lines , come up with the fugitive , who could have no suspicion of being pursued in that direction . 
In the rapidity of the pursuit , and with the impatience of the avenger , animating himself as in war , D'Artagnan , so mild , so kind towards Fouquet , was surprised to find himself become ferocious - almost sanguinary . 
For a long time he galloped without catching sight of the white horse . 
His rage assumed fury , he doubted himself , - he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some subterranean road , or that he had changed the white horse for one of those famous black ones , as swift as the wind , which D'Artagnan , at Saint - Mande , had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and their fleetness . 
At such moments , when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring from them , when the saddle had become burning hot , when the galled and spurred horse reared with pain , and threw behind him a shower of dust and stones , D'Artagnan , raising himself in his stirrups , and seeing nothing on the waters , nothing beneath the trees , looked up into the air like a madman . 
He was losing his senses . 
In the paroxysms of eagerness he dreamt of aerial ways , - the discovery of following century ; he called to his mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him from the prisons of Crete . 
A hoarse sigh broke from his lips , as he repeated , devoured by the fear of ridicule , `` I ! 
I ! 
duped by a Gourville ! 
I ! 
They will say that I am growing old , - they will say I have received a million to allow Fouquet to escape ! '' 
And he again dug his spurs into the sides of his horse : he had ridden astonishingly fast . 
Suddenly , at the extremity of some open pasture-ground , behind the hedges , he saw a white form which showed itself , disappeared , and at last remained distinctly visible against the rising ground . 
D'Artagnan 's heart leaped with joy . 
He wiped the streaming sweat from his brow , relaxed the tension of his knees , - by which the horse breathed more freely , - and , gathering up his reins , moderated the speed of the vigorous animal , his active accomplice on this man-hunt . 
He had then time to study the direction of the road , and his position with regard to Fouquet . 
The superintendent had completely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground . 
He felt the necessity of gaining a firmer footing , and turned towards the road by the shortest secant line . 
D'Artagnan , on his part , had nothing to do but to ride straight on , concealed by the sloping shore ; so that he would cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him . 
Then the real race would begin , - then the struggle would be in earnest . 
D'Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time . 
He observed that the superintendent had relaxed into a trot , which was to say , he , too , was favoring his horse . 
But both of them were too much pressed for time to allow them to continue long at that pace . 
The white horse sprang off like an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground . 
D'Artagnan dropped his head , and his black horse broke into a gallop . 
Both followed the same route ; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded . 
Fouquet had not yet perceived D'Artagnan . 
But on issuing from the slope , a single echo struck the air ; it was that of the steps of D'Artagnan 's horse , which rolled along like thunder . 
Fouquet turned round , and saw behind him , within a hundred paces , his enemy bent over the neck of his horse . 
There could be no doubt - the shining baldrick , the red cassock - it was a musketeer . 
Fouquet slackened his hand likewise , and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself . 
`` Oh , but , '' thought D'Artagnan , becoming very anxious , `` that is not a common horse M. Fouquet is upon - let us see ! '' 
And he attentively examined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the courser . 
Round full quarters - a thin long tail - large hocks - thin legs , as dry as bars of steel - hoofs hard as marble . 
He spurred his own , but the distance between the two remained the same . 
D'Artagnan listened attentively ; not a breath of the horse reached him , and yet he seemed to cut the air . 
The black horse , on the contrary , began to puff like any blacksmith 's bellows . 
`` I must overtake him , if I kill my horse , '' thought the musketeer ; and he began to saw the mouth of the poor animal , whilst he buried the rowels of his merciless spurs into his sides . 
The maddened horse gained twenty toises , and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet . 
`` Courage ! '' 
said the musketeer to himself , `` courage ! 
the white horse will perhaps grow weaker , and if the horse does not fall , the master must pull up at last . '' 
But horse and rider remained upright together , gaining ground by difficult degrees . 
D'Artagnan uttered a wild cry , which made Fouquet turn round , and added speed to the white horse . 
`` A famous horse ! 
a mad rider ! '' 
growled the captain . 
`` Hola ! 
mordioux ! 
Monsieur Fouquet ! 
stop ! 
in the king 's name ! '' 
Fouquet made no reply . 
`` Do you hear me ? '' 
shouted D'Artagnan , whose horse had just stumbled . 
`` Pardieu ! '' 
replied Fouquet , laconically ; and rode on faster . 
D'Artagnan was nearly mad ; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his eyes . 
`` In the king 's name ! '' 
cried he again , `` stop , or I will bring you down with a pistol-shot ! '' 
`` Do ! '' 
replied Fouquet , without relaxing his speed . 
D'Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it , hoping that the double click of the spring would stop his enemy . 
`` You have pistols likewise , '' said he , `` turn and defend yourself . '' 
Fouquet did turn round at the noise , and looking D'Artagnan full in the face , opened , with his right hand , the part of his dress which concealed his body , but he did not even touch his holsters .
