`` I tell you he will do it . '' 
`` He may ; but I will go and help him . '' 
`` To be sure you will ; I reckoned upon you , and still further believe that when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Athos , shaking his head . 
`` Patience ! 
patience ! '' 
`` Monseigneur , permit us to take our leave . '' 
`` Begone , then , and may my good luck attend you . '' 
`` Adieu ! 
monseigneur ; and may your own good luck attend you likewise . '' 
`` Here is an expedition admirably commenced ! '' 
said Athos to his son . 
`` No provisions - no store flotilla ! 
What can be done , thus ? '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
murmured Raoul ; `` if all are going to do as I am , provisions will not be wanted . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied Athos , sternly , `` do not be unjust and senseless in your egotism , or your grief , whichever you please to call it . 
If you set out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein , you stand in need of nobody , and it was scarcely worth while to recommend you to M. de Beaufort . 
But when you have been introduced to the prime commandant - when you have accepted the responsibility of a post in his army , the question is no longer about you , but about all those poor soldiers , who , as well as you , have hearts and bodies , who will weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their condition . 
Remember , Raoul , that officers are ministers as useful to the world as priests , and that they ought to have more charity . '' 
`` Monsieur , I know it and have practiced it ; I would have continued to do so still , but - '' `` You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military glory ; go and die if you like , but do not die without honor and without advantage to France . 
Cheer up , Raoul ! 
do not let my words grieve you ; I love you , and wish to see you perfect . '' 
`` I love your reproaches , monsieur , '' said the young man , mildly ; `` they alone may cure me , because they prove to me that some one loves me still . '' 
`` And now , Raoul , let us be off ; the weather is so fine , the heavens so clear , those heavens which we always find above our heads , which you will see more clear still at Gigelli , and which will speak to you of me there , as they speak to me here of God . '' 
The two gentlemen , after having agreed on this point , talked over the wild freaks of the duke , convinced that France would be served in a very incomplete manner , as regarded both spirit and practice , in the ensuing expedition ; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word vanity , they set forward , in obedience rather to their will than destiny . 
The sacrifice was half accomplished . 
: The Silver Dish . 
The journey passed off pretty well . 
Athos and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day ; sometimes more , sometimes less , according to the intensity of Raoul 's grief . 
It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon , and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes . 
They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route , for Athos derived from his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon . 
Raoul was much affected at not meeting with D'Artagnan . 
His affectionate heart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of steel . 
Athos knew from experience that D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair , whether on his own account or on the service of the king . 
He even feared to offend his friend , or thwart him by too pressing inquiries . 
And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of classing the flotilla , and got together the chalands and lighters to send them to Toulon , one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark . 
Athos , believing that this man was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish , and so gain more money when all his companions were gone , insisted upon having the details . 
The fisherman informed him that six days previously , a man had come in the night to hire his boat , for the purpose of visiting the island of St. Honnorat . 
The price was agreed upon , but the gentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case , which he insisted upon embarking , in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the operation . 
The fisherman wished to retract . 
He had even threatened , but his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the gentleman 's cane , which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long . 
Swearing and grumbling , he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes , who administer justice among themselves and protect each other ; but the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper , at sight of which the syndic , bowing to the very ground , enjoined obedience from the fisherman , and abused him for having been refractory . 
They then departed with the freight . 
`` But all this does not tell us , '' said Athos , `` how you injured your boat . '' 
`` This is the way . 
I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman desired me ; but he changed his mind , and pretended that I could not pass to the south of the abbey . '' 
`` And why not ? '' 
`` Because , monsieur , there is in front of the square tower of the Benedictines , towards the southern point , the bank of the Moines . '' 
`` A rock ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` Level with the water , but below water ; a dangerous passage , yet one I have cleared a thousand times ; the gentleman required me to land him at Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , monsieur ! '' 
cried the fisherman , with his Provencal accent , `` a man is a sailor , or he is not ; he knows his course , or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber . 
I was obstinate , and wished to try the channel . 
The gentleman took me by the collar , and told me quietly he would strangle me . 
My mate armed himself with a hatchet , and so did I . 
We had the affront of the night before to pay him out for . 
But the gentleman drew his sword , and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner , that we neither of us could get near him . 
I was about to hurl my hatchet at his head , and I had a right to do so , had n't I , monsieur ? 
for a sailor aboard is master , as a citizen is in his chamber ; I was going , then , in self-defense , to cut the gentleman in two , when , all at once - believe me or not , monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself , I do n't know how , and there came out of it a sort of a phantom , his head covered with a black helmet and a black mask , something terrible to look upon , which came towards me threatening with its fist . '' 
`` And that was - '' said Athos . 
`` That was the devil , monsieur ; for the gentleman , with great glee , cried out , on seeing him : ` Ah ! 
thank you , monseigneur ! ' '' 
`` A most strange story ! '' 
murmured the comte , looking at Raoul . 
`` And what did you do ? '' 
asked the latter of the fisherman . 
`` You must know , monsieur , that two poor men , such as we are , could be no match for two gentlemen ; but when one of them turned out to be the devil , we had no earthly chance ! 
My companion and I did not stop to consult one another ; we made but one jump into the sea , for we were within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore . '' 
`` Well , and then ? '' 
`` Why , and then , monseigneur , as there was a little wind from the southwest , the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite 's . '' 
`` Oh ! 
- but the travelers ? '' 
`` Bah ! 
you need not be uneasy about them ! 
It was pretty plain that one was the devil , and protected the other ; for when we recovered the boat , after she got afloat again , instead of finding these two creatures injured by the shock , we found nothing , not even the carriage or the case . '' 
`` Very strange ! 
very strange ! '' 
repeated the comte . 
`` But after that , what did you do , my friend ? '' 
`` I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite 's , who brought my finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would have me flogged . '' 
`` What ! 
did the governor himself say so ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur ; and yet my boat was injured , seriously injured , for the prow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite 's , and the carpenter asks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it . '' 
`` Very well , '' replied Raoul ; `` you will be exempted from the service . 
Go . '' 
`` We will go to Sainte-Marguerite 's , shall we ? '' 
said the comte to Bragelonne , as the man walked away . 
`` Yes , monsieur , for there is something to be cleared up ; that man does not seem to me to have told the truth . '' 
`` Nor to me either , Raoul . 
The story of the masked man and the carriage having disappeared , may be told to conceal some violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea , to punish him for his persistence in embarking . '' 
`` I formed the same suspicion ; the carriage was more likely to contain property than a man . '' 
`` We shall see to that , Raoul . 
The gentleman very much resembles D'Artagnan ; I recognize his methods of proceeding . 
Alas ! 
we are no longer the young invincibles of former days . 
Who knows whether the hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing that which the best blades of Europe , balls , and bullets have not been able to do in forty years ? '' 
That same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite 's , on board a chasse - maree come from Toulon under orders . 
The impression they experienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one . 
The island seemed loaded with flowers and fruits . 
In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor . 
Orange , pomegranate , and fig trees bent beneath the weight of their golden or purple fruits . 
All round this garden , in the uncultivated parts , red partridges ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers , and at every step of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the burrow . 
In fact , this fortunate isle was uninhabited . 
Flat , offering nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation , and under the protection of the governor , who went shares with them , smugglers made use of it as a provisional entrepot , at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden . 
With this compromise , the governor was in a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his fortress , in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green . 
The governor was a sort of happy farmer , harvesting wines , figs , oil , and oranges , preserving his citrons and cedrates in the sun of his casemates . 
The fortress , encircled by a deep ditch , its only guardian , arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by terraces covered with moss . 
Athos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding any one to introduce them to the governor . 
They ended by making their own way into the garden . 
It was at the hottest time of the day . 
Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone . 
The heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises , to envelop all existences ; the rabbit under the broom , the fly under the leaf , slept as the wave did beneath the heavens . 
Athos saw nothing living but a soldier , upon the terrace beneath the second and third court , who was carrying a basket of provisions on his head . 
This man returned almost immediately without his basket , and disappeared in the shade of his sentry-box . 
Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one , and , after having done so , returned to dine himself . 
All at once they heard some one call out , and raising their heads , perceived in the frame of the bars of the window something of a white color , like a hand that was waved backwards and forwards - something shining , like a polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun . 
And before they were able to ascertain what it was , a luminous train , accompanied by a hissing sound in the air , called their attention from the donjon to the ground . 
A second dull noise was heard from the ditch , and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand . 
The hand that had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen , and then disappeared . 
Athos and Raoul , approaching each other , commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate , and they discovered , in characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife , this inscription : `` I am the brother of the king of France - a prisoner to-day - a madman to-morrow . 
French gentlemen and Christians , pray to God for the soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers . '' 
The plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to make out the meaning of these dismal words . 
At the same moment they heard a cry from the top of the donjon . 
Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his head , and forced down that of his father likewise . 
A musket - barrel glittered from the crest of the wall . 
A white smoke floated like a plume from the mouth of the musket , and a ball was flattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen . 
`` Cordieu ! '' 
cried Athos . 
`` What , are people assassinated here ? 
Come down , cowards as you are ! '' 
`` Yes , come down ! '' 
cried Raoul , furiously shaking his fist at the castle . 
One of the assailants - he who was about to fire - replied to these cries by an exclamation of surprise ; and , as his companion , who wished to continue the attack , had re-seized his loaded musket , he who had cried out threw up the weapon , and the ball flew into the air . 
Athos and Raoul , seeing them disappear from the platform , expected they would come down to them , and waited with a firm demeanor . 
Five minutes had not elapsed , when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms , and they showed themselves on the other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand . 
At the head of these men was an officer , whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket . 
The man ordered the soldiers to `` make ready . '' 
`` We are going to be shot ! '' 
cried Raoul ; `` but , sword in hand , at least , let us leap the ditch ! 
We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels , when their muskets are empty . '' 
And , suiting the action to the word , Raoul was springing forward , followed by Athos , when a well-known voice resounded behind them , `` Athos ! 
Raoul ! '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the two gentlemen . 
`` Recover arms ! 
Mordioux ! '' 
cried the captain to the soldiers . 
`` I was sure I could not be mistaken ! '' 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` What ! 
were we to be shot without warning ? '' 
`` It was I who was going to shoot you , and if the governor missed you , I should not have missed you , my dear friends . 
How fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim , instead of firing at the instant I raise my weapon ! 
I thought I recognized you . 
Ah ! 
my dear friends , how fortunate ! '' 
And D'Artagnan wiped his brow , for he had run fast , and emotion with him was not feigned . 
`` How ! '' 
said Athos . 
`` And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress ? '' 
`` In person . '' 
`` And why did he fire at us ? 
What have we done to him ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
You received what the prisoner threw to you ? '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` That plate - the prisoner has written something on it , has he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
I was afraid he had . '' 
And D'Artagnan , with all the marks of mortal disquietude , seized the plate , to read the inscription . 
When he had read it , a fearful pallor spread across his countenance . 
`` Oh ! 
good heavens ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` Silence ! 
- Here is the governor . '' 
`` And what will he do to us ? 
Is it our fault ? '' 
`` It is true , then ? '' 
said Athos , in a subdued voice . 
`` It is true ? '' 
`` Silence ! 
I tell you - silence ! 
If he only believes you can read ; if he only suspects you have understood ; I love you , my dear friends , I would willingly be killed for you , but - '' `` But - '' said Athos and Raoul . 
`` But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from death . 
Silence , then ! 
Silence again ! '' 
The governor came up , having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge . 
`` Well ! '' 
said he to D'Artagnan , `` what stops us ? '' 
`` You are Spaniards - you do not understand a word of French , '' said the captain , eagerly , to his friends in a low voice . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied he , addressing the governor , `` I was right ; these gentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres , last year ; they do n't know a word of French . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said the governor , sharply . 
`` And yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan took it out of his hands , effacing the characters with the point of his sword . 
`` How ! '' 
cried the governor , `` what are you doing ? 
I can not read them now ! '' 
`` It is a state secret , '' replied D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and as you know that , according to the king 's orders , it is under the penalty of death any one should penetrate it , I will , if you like , allow you to read it , and have you shot immediately afterwards . '' 
During this apostrophe - half serious , half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the coolest , most unconcerned silence . 
`` But , is it possible , '' said the governor , `` that these gentlemen do not comprehend at least some words ? '' 
`` Suppose they do ! 
If they do understand a few spoken words , it does not follow that they should understand what is written . 
They can not even read Spanish . 
A noble Spaniard , remember , ought never to know how to read . '' 
The governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations , but he was still tenacious . 
`` Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress , '' said he . 
`` That I will willingly do . 
I was about to propose it to you . '' 
The fact is , the captain had quite another idea , and would have wished his friends a hundred leagues off . 
But he was obliged to make the best of it . 
He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish , giving them a polite invitation , which they accepted . 
They all turned towards the entrance of the fort , and , the incident being at an end , the eight soldiers returned to their delightful leisure , for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure . 
: Captive and Jailers . 
When they had entered the fort , and whilst the governor was making some preparations for the reception of his guests , `` Come , '' said Athos , `` let us have a word of explanation whilst we are alone . '' 
`` It is simply this , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` I have conducted hither a prisoner , who the king commands shall not be seen . 
You came here , he has thrown something to you through the lattice of his window ; I was at dinner with the governor , I saw the object thrown , and I saw Raoul pick it up . 
It does not take long to understand this . 
I understood it , and I thought you in intelligence with my prisoner . 
And then - '' `` And then - you commanded us to be shot . '' 
`` Ma foi ! 
I admit it ; but , if I was the first to seize a musket , fortunately , I was the last to take aim at you . '' 
`` If you had killed me , D'Artagnan , I should have had the good fortune to die for the royal house of France , and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you , its noblest and most loyal defender . '' 
`` What the devil , Athos , do you mean by the royal house ? '' 
stammered D'Artagnan . 
`` You do n't mean that you , a well-informed and sensible man , can place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot ? '' 
`` I do believe in it . '' 
`` With so much the more reason , my dear chevalier , from your having orders to kill all those who do believe in it , '' said Raoul . 
`` That is because , '' replied the captain of the musketeers - `` because every calumny , however absurd it may be , has the almost certain chance of becoming popular . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , '' replied Athos , promptly ; `` but because the king is not willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people , and cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII . '' 
`` Do not talk in such a childish manner , Athos , or I shall begin to think you have lost your senses . 
Besides , explain to me how it is possible Louis XIII . 
should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite . '' 
`` A son whom you have brought hither masked , in a fishing-boat , '' said Athos . 
`` Why not ? '' 
D'Artagnan was brought to a pause . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said he ; `` whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ? '' 
`` Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite 's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur . 
Oh ! 
I am acquainted with all that , '' resumed the comte . 
D'Artagnan bit his mustache . 
`` If it were true , '' said he , `` that I had brought hither in a boat and with a carriage a masked prisoner , nothing proves that this prisoner must be a prince - a prince of the house of France . '' 
`` Ask Aramis such riddles , '' replied Athos , coolly . 
`` Aramis , '' cried the musketeer , quite at a stand . 
`` Have you seen Aramis ? '' 
`` After his discomfiture at Vaux , yes ; I have seen Aramis , a fugitive , pursued , bewildered , ruined ; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan 's head sunk on his breast in some confusion . 
`` This is the way , '' said he , `` in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom ! 
A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered fragments ! 
Athos , cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face with me in this affair ! 
for now - '' `` Well , '' said Athos , with his customary mild severity , `` is your secret lost because I know it ? 
Consult your memory , my friend . 
Have I not borne secrets heavier than this ? '' 
`` You have never borne one so dangerous , '' replied D'Artagnan , in a tone of sadness . 
`` I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die , and die unhappily . '' 
`` The will of God be done ! '' 
said Athos , `` but here is your governor . '' 
D'Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . 
The governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards D'Artagnan with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . 
With respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer , and never taking his eye from them . 
Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks , or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage . 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable , if the governor did not believe it to be quite true . 
They rose from the table to repose awhile . 
`` What is this man 's name ? 
I do n't like the looks of him , '' said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish . 
`` De Saint-Mars , '' replied the captain . 
`` He is , then , I suppose , the prince 's jailer ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
how can I tell ? 
I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , not you ! '' 
`` My friend , I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a desert . 
He would like to carry it away , but he can not ; he would like to leave it , but he dares not . 
The king will not dare to recall me , for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do ; he regrets not having me near him , from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person as myself . 
But it will happen as it may please God . '' 
`` But , '' observed Raoul , `` your not being certain proves that your situation here is provisional , and you will return to Paris ? '' 
`` Ask these gentlemen , '' interrupted the governor , `` what was their purpose in coming to Saint-Marguerite ? '' 
`` They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte - Honnorat which is considered curious ; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the island . '' 
`` That is quite at their service , as well as yours , '' replied Saint-Mars . 
D'Artagnan politely thanked him . 
`` When will they depart ? '' 
added the governor . 
`` To-morrow , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds , and left D'Artagnan alone with the pretended Spaniards . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed the musketeer , `` here is a life and a society that suits me very little . 
I command this man , and he bores me , mordioux ! 
Come , let us have a shot or two at the rabbits ; the walk will be beautiful , and not fatiguing . 
The whole island is but a league and a half in length , with the breadth of a league ; a real park . 
Let us try to amuse ourselves . '' 
`` As you please , D'Artagnan ; not for the sake of amusing ourselves , but to gain an opportunity for talking freely . '' 
D'Artagnan made a sign to a soldier , who brought the gentlemen some guns , and then returned to the fort . 
`` And now , '' said the musketeer , `` answer me the question put to you by that black-looking Saint-Mars : what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles ? '' 
`` To bid you farewell . '' 
`` Bid me farewell ! 
What do you mean by that ? 
Is Raoul going anywhere ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort . '' 
`` With M. de Beaufort it is , my dear friend . 
You always guess correctly . '' 
`` From habit . '' 
Whilst the two friends were commencing their conversation , Raoul , with his head hanging down and his heart oppressed , seated himself on a mossy rock , his gun across his knees , looking at the sea - looking at the heavens , and listening to the voice of his soul ; he allowed the sportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him . 
D'Artagnan remarked his absence . 
`` He has not recovered the blow ? '' 
said he to Athos . 
`` He is struck to death . '' 
`` Oh ! 
your fears exaggerate , I hope . 
Raoul is of a tempered nature . 
Around all hearts as noble as his , there is a second envelope that forms a cuirass . 
The first bleeds , the second resists . '' 
`` No , '' replied Athos , `` Raoul will die of it . '' 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , in a melancholy tone . 
And he did not add a word to this exclamation . 
Then , a minute after , `` Why do you let him go ? '' 
`` Because he insists on going . '' 
`` And why do you not go with him ? '' 
`` Because I could not bear to see him die . '' 
D'Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face . 
`` You know one thing , '' continued the comte , leaning upon the arm of the captain ; `` you know that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things . 
Well ! 
I have an incessant gnawing , insurmountable fear that an hour will come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
murmured D'Artagnan ; `` oh ! '' 
`` He will die , I know , I have a perfect conviction of that ; but I would not see him die . '' 
`` How is this , Athos ? 
you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man , you say you have ever seen , of your own D'Artagnan , of that man without an equal , as you formerly called him , and you come and tell him , with your arms folded , that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son , you who have seen all that can be seen in this world ! 
Why have you this fear , Athos ? 
Man upon this earth must expect everything , and ought to face everything . '' 
`` Listen to me , my friend . 
After having worn myself out upon this earth of which you speak , I have preserved but two religions : that of life , friendship , my duty as a father - that of eternity , love , and respect for God . 
Now , I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that my friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence -- oh ! 
no , I can not even tell you , D'Artagnan ! '' 
`` Speak , speak , tell me ! '' 
`` I am strong against everything , except against the death of those I love . 
For that only there is no remedy . 
He who dies , gains ; he who sees others die , loses . 
No , this is it - to know that I should no more meet on earth him whom I now behold with joy ; to know that there would nowhere be a D'Artagnan any more , nowhere again be a Raoul , oh ! 
I am old , look you , I have no longer courage ; I pray God to spare me in my weakness ; but if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion , I should curse him . 
A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God , D'Artagnan ; it is enough to once have cursed a king ! '' 
`` Humph ! '' 
sighed D'Artagnan , a little confused by this violent tempest of grief . 
`` Let me speak to him , Athos . 
Who knows ? '' 
`` Try , if you please , but I am convinced you will not succeed . '' 
`` I will not attempt to console him . 
I will serve him . '' 
`` You will ? '' 
`` Doubtless , I will . 
Do you think this would be the first time a woman had repented of an infidelity ? 
I will go to him , I tell you . '' 
Athos shook his head , and continued his walk alone , D'Artagnan , cutting across the brambles , rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him . 
`` Well , Raoul ! 
You have something to say to me ? '' 
`` I have a kindness to ask of you , '' replied Bragelonne . 
`` Ask it , then . '' 
`` You will some day return to France ? '' 
`` I hope so . '' 
`` Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Valliere ? '' 
`` No , you must not . '' 
`` But I have many things to say to her . '' 
`` Go and say them to her , then . '' 
`` Never ! '' 
`` Pray , what virtue do you attribute to a letter , which your speech might not possess ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . '' 
`` She loves the king , '' said D'Artagnan , bluntly ; `` and she is an honest girl . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` And you , you whom she abandons , she , perhaps , loves better than she does the king , but after another fashion . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , do you believe she loves the king ? '' 
`` To idolatry . 
Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling . 
You might continue to live near her , and would be her best friend . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
exclaimed Raoul , with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a hideous hope . 
`` Will you do so ? '' 
`` It would be base . '' 
`` That is a very absurd word , which would lead me to think slightly of your understanding . 
Please to understand , Raoul , that it is never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force . 
If your heart says to you , ` Go there , or die , ' why go , Raoul . 
Was she base or brave , she whom you loved , in preferring the king to you , the king whom her heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you ? 
No , she was the bravest of women . 
Do , then , as she has done . 
Oblige yourself . 
Do you know one thing of which I am sure , Raoul ? '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Why , that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man - '' `` Well ? '' 
`` Well ! 
you would cease to love her . '' 
`` Then I am decided , my dear D'Artagnan . '' 
`` To set off to see her again ? '' 
`` No ; to set off that I may never see her again . 
I wish to love her forever . '' 
`` Ha ! 
I must confess , '' replied the musketeer , `` that is a conclusion which I was far from expecting . '' 
`` This is what I wish , my friend . 
You will see her again , and you will give her a letter which , if you think proper , will explain to her , as to yourself , what is passing in my heart . 
Read it ; I drew it up last night . 
Something told me I should see you to-day . '' 
He held the letter out , and D'Artagnan read : `` MADEMOISELLE , - You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me . 
You have only been guilty of one fault towards me , that of having left me to believe you loved me . 
This error will cost me my life . 
I pardon you , but I can not pardon myself . 
It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers . 
It will not be so with you , who did not love me , save with anxiety . 
I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love , you would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death , or lessening the esteem I had for you . 
It is much more delightful to me to die , knowing that you are free and satisfied . 
How much , then , will you love me , when you will no longer fear either my presence or reproaches ? 
You will love me , because , however charming a new love may appear to you , God has not made me in anything inferior to him you have chosen , and because my devotedness , my sacrifice , and my painful end will assure me , in your eyes , a certain superiority over him . 
I have allowed to escape , in the candid credulity of my heart , the treasure I possessed . 
Many people tell me that you loved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much . 
That idea takes from my mind all bitterness , and leads me only to blame myself . 
You will accept this last farewell , and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is extinguished , and where all love endures forever . 
Adieu , mademoiselle . 
If your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood , I would shed that drop . 
I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery ! 
`` RAOUL , VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE . '' 
`` The letter reads very well , '' said the captain . 
`` I have only one fault to find with it . '' 
`` Tell me what that is ! '' 
said Raoul . 
`` Why , it is that it tells everything , except the thing which exhales , like a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart ; except the senseless love which still consumes you . '' 
Raoul grew paler , but remained silent . 
`` Why did you not write simply these words : '' ` MADEMOISELLE , - Instead of cursing you , I love you and I die . ' '' 
`` That is true , '' exclaimed Raoul , with a sinister kind of joy . 
And tearing the letter he had just taken back , he wrote the following words upon a leaf of his tablets : `` To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you , I commit the baseness of writing to you ; and to punish myself for that baseness , I die . '' 
And he signed it . 
`` You will give her these tablets , captain , will you not ? '' 
`` When ? '' 
asked the latter . 
`` On the day , '' said Bragelonne , pointing to the last sentence , `` on the day when you can place a date under these words . '' 
And he sprang away quickly to join Athos , who was returning with slow steps . 
As they re-entered the fort , the sea rose with that rapid , gusty vehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean ; the ill-humor of the element became a tempest . 
Something shapeless , and tossed about violently by the waves , appeared just off the coast . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Athos , - `` a wrecked boat ? '' 
`` No , it is not a boat , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Pardon me , '' said Raoul , `` there is a bark gaining the port rapidly . '' 
`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . '' 
`` Your advice is good , Athos , and I will this night have it carried out , or rather , I will carry it out myself ; but let us go in , for the rain falls heavily , and the lightning is terrific . '' 
As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key , they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by the prisoner . 
Upon a sign from D'Artagnan , they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` You will see . 
Look . 
The prisoner is returning from chapel . '' 
And they saw , by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky , they saw pass gravely , at six paces behind the governor , a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of polished steel , soldered to a helmet of the same nature , which altogether enveloped the whole of his head . 
The fire of the heavens cast red reflections on the polished surface , and these reflections , flying off capriciously , seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate , instead of imprecations . 
In the middle of the gallery , the prisoner stopped for a moment , to contemplate the infinite horizon , to respire the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest , to drink in thirstily the hot rain , and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan . 
`` Come on , monsieur , '' said Saint-Mars , sharply , to the prisoner , for he already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls . 
`` Monsieur , come on ! '' 
`` Say monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , from his corner , with a voice so solemn and terrible , that the governor trembled from head to foot . 
Athos insisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty . 
The prisoner turned round . 
`` Who spoke ? '' 
asked Saint-Mars . 
`` It was I , '' replied D'Artagnan , showing himself promptly . 
`` You know that is the order . '' 
`` Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur , '' said the prisoner in his turn , in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul ; `` call me ACCURSED ! '' 
He passed on , and the iron door croaked after him . 
`` There goes a truly unfortunate man ! '' 
murmured the musketeer in a hollow whisper , pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince . 
: Promises . 
Scarcely had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends , when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him . 
The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea , and which appeared so eager to gain the port , came to Sainte-Marguerite with an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers . 
On opening it , D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king : `` I should think , '' said Louis XIV. , `` you will have completed the execution of my orders , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; return , then , immediately to Paris , and join me at the Louvre . '' 
`` There is the end of my exile ! '' 
cried the musketeer with joy ; `` God be praised , I am no longer a jailer ! '' 
And he showed the letter to Athos . 
`` So , then , you must leave us ? '' 
replied the latter , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Yes , but to meet again , dear friend , seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone with M. de Beaufort , and will prefer his father going back in company with M. d'Artagnan , to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere ; will you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' stammered the latter , with an expression of tender regret . 
`` No , no , my friend , '' interrupted Athos , `` I will never quit Raoul till the day his vessel disappears on the horizon . 
As long as he remains in France he shall not be separated from me . '' 
`` As you please , dear friend ; but we will , at least , leave Sainte - Marguerite together ; take advantage of the bark that will convey me back to Antibes . '' 
`` With all my heart ; we can not too soon be at a distance from this fort , and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now . '' 
The three friends quitted the little isle , after paying their respects to the governor , and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took their farewell of the white walls of the fort . 
D'Artagnan parted from his friend that same night , after having seen fire set to the carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars , according to the advice the captain had given him . 
Before getting on horseback , and after leaving the arms of Athos : `` My friends , '' said he , `` you bear too much resemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post . 
Something warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank . 
Will you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a hundred good muskets ? 
The king will not refuse me , and I will take you with me . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' replied Raoul , pressing his hand with emotion , `` thanks for that offer , which would give us more than we wish , either monsieur le comte or I. I , who am young , stand in need of labor of mind and fatigue of body ; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose . 
You are his best friend . 
I recommend him to your care . 
In watching over him , you are holding both our souls in your hands . '' 
`` I must go ; my horse is all in a fret , '' said D'Artagnan , with whom the most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in conversation . 
`` Come , comte , how many days longer has Raoul to stay here ? '' 
`` Three days at most . '' 
`` And how long will it take you to reach home ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a considerable time , '' replied Athos . 
`` I shall not like the idea of being separated too quickly from Raoul . 
Time will travel too fast of itself to require me to aid it by distance . 
I shall only make half - stages . '' 
`` And why so , my friend ? 
Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly ; and hostelry life does not become a man like you . '' 
`` My friend , I came hither on post-horses ; but I wish to purchase two animals of a superior kind . 
Now , to take them home fresh , it would not be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day . '' 
`` Where is Grimaud ? '' 
`` He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul 's appointments ; and I have left him to sleep . '' 
`` That is , never to come back again , '' D'Artagnan suffered to escape him . 
`` Till we meet again , then , dear Athos - and if you are diligent , I shall embrace you the sooner . '' 
So saying , he put his foot in the stirrup , which Raoul held . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said the young man , embracing him . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , as he got into his saddle . 
His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends . 
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos , near the gates of Antibes , whither D'Artagnan , after his supper , had ordered his horses to be brought . 
The road began to branch off there , white and undulating in the vapors of the night . 
The horse eagerly respired the salt , sharp perfume of the marshes . 
D'Artagnan put him to a trot ; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house . 
All at once they heard the rapid approach of a horse 's steps , and first believed it to be one of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a road . 
But it was really the return of the horseman . 
They uttered a cry of joyous surprise ; and the captain , springing to the ground like a young man , seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul . 
He held them long embraced thus , without speaking a word , or suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him . 
Then , as rapidly as he had come back , he set off again , with a sharp application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the comte , in a low voice , `` alas ! 
alas ! '' 
`` An evil omen ! '' 
on his side , said D'Artagnan to himself , making up for lost time . 
`` I could not smile upon them . 
An evil omen ! '' 
The next day Grimaud was on foot again . 
The service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished . 
The flotilla , sent to Toulon by the exertions of Raoul , had set out , dragging after it in little nutshells , almost invisible , the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in requisition for the service of the fleet . 
The time , so short , which remained for father and son to live together , appeared to go by with double rapidity , like some swift stream that flows towards eternity . 
Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon , which began to be filled with the noise of carriages , with the noise of arms , the noise of neighing horses . 
The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches ; the drummers signalized their strength ; the streets were overflowing with soldiers , servants , and tradespeople . 
The Duc de Beaufort was everywhere , superintending the embarkation with the zeal and interest of a good captain . 
He encouraged the humblest of his companions ; he scolded his lieutenants , even those of the highest rank . 
Artillery , provisions , baggage , he insisted upon seeing all himself . 
He examined the equipment of every soldier ; assured himself of the health and soundness of every horse . 
It was plain that , light , boastful , egotistical , in his hotel , the gentleman became the soldier again - the high noble , a captain - in face of the responsibility he had accepted . 
And yet , it must be admitted that , whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations for departure , it was easy to perceive careless precipitation , and the absence of all the precaution that make the French solider the first soldier in the world , because , in that world , he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral resources . 
All things having satisfied , or appearing to have satisfied , the admiral , he paid his compliments to Raoul , and gave the last orders for sailing , which was ordered the next morning at daybreak . 
He invited the comte had his son to dine with him ; but they , under a pretext of service , kept themselves apart . 
Gaining their hostelry , situated under the trees of the great Place , they took their repast in haste , and Athos led Raoul to the rocks which dominate the city , vast gray mountains , whence the view is infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears , so remote is it , on a level with the rocks themselves . 
The night was fine , as it always is in these happy climes . 
The moon , rising behind the rocks , unrolled a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea . 
In the roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to facilitate the embarkation . 
The sea , loaded with phosphoric light , opened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and munitions ; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames ; from every oar dropped liquid diamonds . 
The sailors , rejoicing in the largesses of the admiral , were heard murmuring their slow and artless songs . 
Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot falling into the holds . 
Such harmonies , such a spectacle , oppress the heart like fear , and dilate it like hope . 
All this life speaks of death . 
Athos had seated himself with his son , upon the moss , among the brambles of the promontory . 
Around their heads passed and repassed large bats , carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind chase . 
The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff , bathed in that void which is peopled by vertigo , and provokes to self-annihilation . 
When the moon had risen to its fullest height , caressing with light the neighboring peaks , when the watery mirror was illumined in its full extent , and the little red fires had made their openings in the black masses of every ship , Athos , collecting all his ideas and all his courage , said : `` God has made all these things that we see , Raoul ; He has made us also , - poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe . 
We shine like those fires and those stars ; we sigh like those waves ; we suffer like those great ships , which are worn out in plowing the waves , in obeying the wind that urges them towards an end , as the breath of God blows us towards a port . 
Everything likes to live , Raoul ; and everything seems beautiful to living things . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said Raoul , `` we have before us a beautiful spectacle ! '' 
`` How good D'Artagnan is ! '' 
interrupted Athos , suddenly , `` and what a rare good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as he is ! 
That is what you have missed , Raoul . '' 
`` A friend ! '' 
cried Raoul , `` I have wanted a friend ! '' 
`` M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion , '' resumed the comte , coldly , `` but I believe , in the times in which you live , men are more engaged in their own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours . 
You have sought a secluded life ; that is a great happiness , but you have lost your strength thereby . 
We four , more weaned from those delicate abstractions that constitute your joy , furnished much more resistance when misfortune presented itself . '' 
`` I have not interrupted you , monsieur , to tell you that I had a friend , and that that friend is M. de Guiche . 
Certes , he is good and generous , and moreover he loves me . 
But I have lived under the guardianship of another friendship , monsieur , as precious and as strong as that of which you speak , since it is yours . '' 
`` I have not been a friend for you , Raoul , '' said Athos . 
`` Eh ! 
monsieur , and in what respect not ? '' 
`` Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face , because , sad and severe , alas ! 
I have always cut off for you , without , God knows , wishing to do so , the joyous buds that spring incessantly from the fair tree of youth ; so that at this moment I repent of not having made of you a more expansive , dissipated , animated man . '' 
`` I know why you say that , monsieur . 
No , it is not you who have made me what I am ; it was love , which took me at the time when children only have inclinations ; it is the constancy natural to my character , which with other creatures is but habit . 
I believed that I should always be as I was ; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear , quite straight , bordered with fruits and flowers . 
I had ever watching over me your vigilance and strength . 
I believed myself to be vigilant and strong . 
Nothing prepared me ; I fell once , and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my life . 
It is quite true that I wrecked myself . 
Oh , no , monsieur ! 
you are nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope ! 
No , I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it for me ; I bless you , and I love you ardently . '' 
`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . '' 
`` I will do all you may command , '' said Raoul , much agitated . 
`` It is not necessary , Raoul , that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into too hazardous enterprises . 
You have gone through your ordeal ; you are known to be a true man under fire . 
Remember that war with Arabs is a war of snares , ambuscades , and assassinations . '' 
`` So it is said , monsieur . '' 
`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults . 
Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you , Raoul ? 
God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters . '' 
`` I am naturally prudent , monsieur , and I have very good fortune , '' said Raoul , with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father ; `` for , '' the young man hastened to add , `` in twenty combats through which I have been , I have only received one scratch . '' 
`` There is in addition , '' said Athos , `` the climate to be dreaded : that is an ugly end , to die of fever ! 
King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague , rather than the fever . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
with sobriety , with reasonable exercise - '' `` I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France . 
You , as his aide - de-camp , will be charged with expediting them , and will be sure not to forget me . '' 
`` No , monsieur , '' said Raoul , almost choked with emotion . 
`` Besides , Raoul , as you are a good Christian , and I am one also , we ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels . 
Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you , on any occasion , you will think of me at once . '' 
`` First and at once ! 
Oh ! 
yes , monsieur . '' 
`` And will call upon me ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` You dream of me sometimes , do you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Every night , monsieur . 
During my early youth I saw you in my dreams , calm and mild , with one hand stretched out over my head , and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - formerly . '' 
`` We love each other too dearly , '' said the comte , `` that from this moment , in which we separate , a portion of both our souls should not travel with one and the other of us , and should not dwell wherever we may dwell . 
Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill . 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting , they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards , as if in indecision or ashamed to be seen . 
It was Grimaud , who in his anxiety had tracked his master , and was there awaiting him . 
`` Oh ! 
my good Grimaud , '' cried Raoul , `` what do you want ? 
You are come to tell us it is time to be gone , have you not ? '' 
`` Alone ? '' 
said Grimaud , addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of reproach , which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled . 
`` Oh ! 
you are right ! '' 
cried the comte . 
`` No , Raoul shall not go alone ; no , he shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand to support him , some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved ! '' 
`` I ? '' 
said Grimaud . 
`` You , yes , you ! '' 
cried Raoul , touched to the inmost heart . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said Athos , `` you are very old , my good Grimaud . '' 
`` So much the better , '' replied the latter , with an inexpressible depth of feeling and intelligence . 
`` But the embarkation is begun , '' said Raoul , `` and you are not prepared . '' 
`` Yes , '' said Grimaud , showing the keys of his trunks , mixed with those of his young master . 
`` But , '' again objected Raoul , `` you can not leave monsieur le comte thus alone ; monsieur le comte , whom you have never quitted ? '' 
Grimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul , as if to measure the strength of both . 
The comte uttered not a word . 
`` Monsieur le comte prefers my going , '' said Grimaud . 
`` I do , '' said Athos , by an inclination of the head . 
At that moment the drums suddenly rolled , and the clarions filled the air with their inspiring notes . 
The regiments destined for the expedition began to debouch from the city . 
They advanced to the number of five , each composed of forty companies . 
Royals marched first , distinguished by their white uniform , faced with blue . 
The ordonnance colors , quartered cross-wise , violet and dead leaf , with a sprinkling of golden fleurs-de - lis , left the white-colored flag , with its fleur-de-lised cross , to dominate the whole . 
Musketeers at the wings , with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders ; pikemen in the center , with their lances , fourteen feet in length , marched gayly towards the transports , which carried them in detail to the ships . 
The regiments of Picardy , Navarre , Normandy , and Royal Vaisseau , followed after . 
M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops . 
He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would take a full hour before he could reach the sea . 
Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach , in order to take his place when the prince embarked . 
Grimaud , boiling with the ardor of a young man , superintended the embarkation of Raoul 's baggage in the admiral 's vessel . 
Athos , with his arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose , absorbed in melancholy meditation , was deaf to every noise around him . 
An officer came quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have him by his side . 
`` Have the kindness to tell the prince , '' said Raoul , `` that I request he will allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father . '' 
`` No , no , '' said Athos , `` an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his general . 
Please to tell the prince , monsieur , that the vicomte will join him immediately . '' 
The officer set off at a gallop . 
`` Whether we part here or part there , '' added the comte , `` it is no less a separation . '' 
He carefully brushed the dust from his son 's coat , and passed his hand over his hair as they walked along . 
`` But , Raoul , '' said he , `` you want money . 
M. de Beaufort 's train will be splendid , and I am certain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms , which are very dear things in Africa . 
Now , as you are not actually in the service of the king or M. de Beaufort , and are simply a volunteer , you must not reckon upon either pay or largesse . 
But I should not like you to want for anything at Gigelli . 
Here are two hundred pistoles ; if you would please me , Raoul , spend them . '' 
Raoul pressed the hand of his father , and , at the turning of a street , they saw M. de Beaufort , mounted on a magnificent white genet , which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city . 
The duke called Raoul , and held out his hand to the comte . 
He spoke to him for some time , with such a kindly expression that the heart of the poor father even felt a little comforted . 
It was , however , evident to both father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a punishment . 
There was a terrible moment - that at which , on quitting the sands of the shore , the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their families and friends ; a supreme moment , in which , notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens , the warmth of the sun , of the perfumes of the air , and the rich life that was circulating in their veins , everything appeared black , everything bitter , everything created doubts of Providence , nay , at the most , of God . 
It was customary for the admiral and his suite to embark last ; the cannon waited to announce , with its formidable voice , that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel . 
Athos , forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet , and of his own dignity as a strong man , opened his arms to his son , and pressed him convulsively to his heart . 
`` Accompany us on board , '' said the duke , very much affected ; `` you will gain a good half-hour . '' 
`` No , '' said Athos , `` my farewell has been spoken , I do not wish to voice a second . '' 
`` Then , vicomte , embark - embark quickly ! '' 
added the prince , wishing to spare the tears of these two men , whose hearts were bursting . 
And paternally , tenderly , very much as Porthos might have done , he took Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat , the oars of which , at a signal , immediately were dipped in the waves . 
He himself , forgetful of ceremony , jumped into his boat , and pushed it off with a vigorous foot . 
`` Adieu ! '' 
cried Raoul . 
Athos replied only by a sign , but he felt something burning on his hand : it was the respectful kiss of Grimaud - the last farewell of the faithful dog . 
This kiss given , Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon the stem of a two-oared yawl , which had just been taken in tow by a chaland served by twelve galley-oars . 
Athos seated himself on the mole , stunned , deaf , abandoned . 
Every instant took from him one of the features , one of the shades of the pale face of his son . 
With his arms hanging down , his eyes fixed , his mouth open , he remained confounded with Raoul - in one same look , in one same thought , in one same stupor . 
The sea , by degrees , carried away boats and faces to that distance at which men become nothing but points , - loves , nothing but remembrances . 
Athos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral 's ship , he saw him lean upon the rail of the deck , and place himself in such a manner as to be always an object in the eye of his father . 
In vain the cannon thundered , in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult , responded to by immense acclamations from the shore ; in vain did the noise deafen the ear of the father , the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations . 
Raoul appeared to him to the last moment ; and the imperceptible atom , passing from black to pale , from pale to white , from white to nothing , disappeared for Athos - disappeared very long after , to all the eyes of the spectators , had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling sails . 
Towards midday , when the sun devoured space , and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of the sea , Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise , and vanish as soon as seen . 
This was the smoke of a cannon , which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the coast of France . 
The point was buried in its turn beneath the sky , and Athos returned with slow and painful step to his deserted hostelry . 
: Among Women . 
D'Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends so much as he would have wished . 
The stoical soldier , the impassive man-at - arms , overcome by fear and sad presentiments , had yielded , for a few moments , to human weakness . 
When , therefore , he had silenced his heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves , turning towards his lackey , a silent servant , always listening , in order to obey the more promptly : `` Rabaud , '' said he , `` mind , we must travel thirty leagues a day . '' 
`` At your pleasure , captain , '' replied Rabaud . 
And from that moment , D'Artagnan , accommodating his action to the pace of the horse , like a true centaur , gave up his thoughts to nothing - that is to say , to everything . 
He asked himself why the king had sent for him back ; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of Raoul . 
As to the first subject , the reply was negative ; he knew right well that the king 's calling him was from necessity . 
He still further knew that Louis XIV . 
must experience an imperious desire for a private conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level with the highest powers of the kingdom . 
But as to saying exactly what the king 's wish was , D'Artagnan found himself completely at a loss . 
The musketeer had no doubts , either , upon the reason which had urged the unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth . 
Philippe , buried forever beneath a mask of steel , exiled to a country where the men seemed little more than slaves of the elements ; Philippe , deprived even of the society of D'Artagnan , who had loaded him with honors and delicate attentions , had nothing more to see than odious specters in this world , and , despair beginning to devour him , he poured himself forth in complaints , in the belief that his revelations would raise up some avenger for him . 
The manner in which the musketeer had been near killing his two best friends , the destiny which had so strangely brought Athos to participate in the great state secret , the farewell of Raoul , the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy death ; all this threw D'Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable predictions and forebodings , which the rapidity of his pace did not dissipate , as it used formerly to do . 
D'Artagnan passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis . 
He saw them both , fugitives , tracked , ruined - laborious architects of fortunes they had lost ; and as the king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and malice , D'Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed . 
Sometimes , ascending hills , when the winded horse breathed hard from his red nostrils , and heaved his flanks , the captain , left to more freedom of thought , reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis , a genius of acumen and intrigue , a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice . 
Soldier , priest , diplomatist ; gallant , avaricious , cunning ; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except as stepping - stones to rise to giddier ends . 
Generous in spirit , if not lofty in heart , he never did ill but for the sake of shining even yet more brilliantly . 
Towards the end of his career , at the moment of reaching the goal , like the patrician Fuscus , he had made a false step upon a plank , and had fallen into the sea . 
But Porthos , good , harmless Porthos ! 
To see Porthos hungry , to see Mousqueton without gold lace , imprisoned , perhaps ; to see Pierrefonds , Bracieux , razed to the very stones , dishonored even to the timber , - these were so many poignant griefs for D'Artagnan , and every time that one of these griefs struck him , he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun . 
Never was the man of spirit subjected to ennui , if his body was exposed to fatigue ; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light , if he had something to engage his mind . 
D'Artagnan , riding fast , thinking as constantly , alighted from his horse in Pairs , fresh and tender in his muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium . 
The king did not expect him so soon , and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon . 
D'Artagnan , instead of riding after the king , as he would formerly have done , took off his boots , had a bath , and waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired . 
He occupied the interval of five hours in taking , as people say , the air of the house , and in arming himself against all ill chances . 
He learned that the king , during the last fortnight , had been gloomy ; that the queen-mother was ill and much depressed ; that Monsieur , the king 's brother , was exhibiting a devotional turn ; that Madame had the vapors ; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his estates . 
He learned that M. Colbert was radiant ; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day , who still did not cure him , and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not usually cure , unless they are political physicians . 
The king , D'Artagnan was told , behaved in the kindest manner to M. Fouquet , and did not allow him to be ever out of his sight ; but the surintendant , touched to the heart , like one of those fine trees a worm has punctured , was declining daily , in spite of the royal smile , that sun of court trees . 
D'Artagnan learned that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had become indispensable to the king ; that the king , during his sporting excursions , if he did not take her with him , wrote to her frequently , no longer verses , but , which was much worse , prose , and that whole pages at a time . 
Thus , as the political Pleiad of the day said , the first king in the world was seen descending from his horse with an ardor beyond compare , and on the crown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases , which M. de Saint-Aignan , aide-de-camp in perpetuity , carried to La Valliere at the risk of foundering his horses . 
During this time , deer and pheasants were left to the free enjoyment of their nature , hunted so lazily that , it was said , the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France . 
D'Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor Raoul , of that desponding letter destined for a woman who passed her life in hoping , and as D'Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally , he resolved to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute 's talk with Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
This was a very easy affair ; while the king was hunting , Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of the galleries of the Palais Royal , exactly where the captain of the musketeers had some guards to inspect . 
D'Artagnan did not doubt that , if he could but open the conversation on Raoul , Louise might give him grounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile ; and hope , or at least consolation for Raoul , in the state of heart in which he had left him , was the sun , was life to two men , who were very dear to our captain . 
He directed his course , therefore , to the spot where he knew he should find Mademoiselle de la Valliere . 
D'Artagnan found La Valliere the center of the circle . 
In her apparent solitude , the king 's favorite received , like a queen , more , perhaps , than the queen , a homage of which Madame had been so proud , when all the king 's looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the courtiers . 
D'Artagnan , although no squire of dames , received , nevertheless , civilities and attentions from the ladies ; he was polite , as a brave man always is , and his terrible reputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as admiration among the women . 
On seeing him enter , therefore , they immediately accosted him ; and , as is not unfrequently the case with fair ladies , opened the attack by questions . 
`` Where had he been ? 
What had become of him so long ? 
Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style , to the delight and astonishment of the curious from the king 's balcony ? '' 
He replied that he had just come from the land of oranges . 
This set all the ladies laughing . 
Those were times in which everybody traveled , but in which , notwithstanding , a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem often solved by death . 
`` From the land of oranges ? '' 
cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente . 
`` From Spain ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
said the musketeer . 
`` From Malta ? '' 
echoed Montalais . 
`` Ma foi ! 
You are coming very near , ladies . '' 
`` Is it an island ? '' 
asked La Valliere . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` I will not give you the trouble of seeking any further ; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is , at this moment , embarking for Algiers . '' 
`` Have you seen the army ? '' 
asked several warlike fair ones . 
`` As plainly as I see you , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` And the fleet ? '' 
`` Yes , I saw everything . '' 
`` Have we any of us any friends there ? '' 
said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , coldly , but in a manner to attract attention to a question that was not without its calculated aim . 
`` Why , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` yes ; there were M. de la Guillotiere , M. de Manchy , M. de Bragelonne - '' La Valliere became pale . 
`` M. de Bragelonne ! '' 
cried the perfidious Athenais . 
`` Eh , what ! 
- is he gone to the wars ? 
- he ! '' 
Montalais trod on her toe , but all in vain . 
`` Do you know what my opinion is ? '' 
continued she , addressing D'Artagnan . 
`` No , mademoiselle ; but I should like very much to know it . '' 
`` My opinion is , then , that all the men who go to this war are desperate , desponding men , whom love has treated ill ; and who go to try if they can not find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been . '' 
Some of the ladies laughed ; La Valliere was evidently confused ; Montalais coughed loud enough to waken the dead . 
`` Mademoiselle , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , `` you are in error when you speak of black women at Gigelli ; the women there have not jet faces ; it is true they are not white - they are yellow . '' 
`` Yellow ! '' 
exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties . 
`` Eh ! 
do not disparage it . 
I have never seen a finer color to match with black eyes and a coral mouth . '' 
`` So much the better for M. de Bragelonne , '' said Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente , with persistent malice . 
`` He will make amends for his loss . 
Poor fellow ! '' 
A profound silence followed these words ; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves - treat each other more cruelly than tigers . 
But making La Valliere pale did not satisfy Athenais ; she determined to make her blush likewise . 
Resuming the conversation without pause , `` Do you know , Louise , '' said she , `` that there is a great sin on your conscience ? '' 
`` What sin , mademoiselle ? '' 
stammered the unfortunate girl , looking round her for support , without finding it . 
`` Eh ! 
- why , '' continued Athenais , `` the poor young man was affianced to you ; he loved you ; you cast him off . '' 
`` Well , that is a right which every honest woman has , '' said Montalais , in an affected tone . 
`` When we know we can not constitute the happiness of a man , it is much better to cast him off . '' 
`` Cast him off ! 
or refuse him ! 
- that 's all very well , '' said Athenais , `` but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Valliere has to reproach herself with . 
The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars ; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with . '' 
Louise pressed her hand over her icy brow . 
`` And if he dies , '' continued her pitiless tormentor , `` you will have killed him . 
That is the sin . '' 
Louise , half-dead , caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers , whose face betrayed unusual emotion . 
`` You wished to speak with me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said she , in a voice broken by anger and pain . 
`` What had you to say to me ? '' 
D'Artagnan made several steps along the gallery , holding Louise on his arm ; then , when they were far enough removed from the others - `` What I had to say to you , mademoiselle , '' replied he , `` Mademoiselle de Tonnay - Charente has just expressed ; roughly and unkindly , it is true but still in its entirety . '' 
She uttered a faint cry ; pierced to the heart by this new wound , she went her way , like one of those poor birds which , struck unto death , seek the shade of the thicket in which to die . 
She disappeared at one door , at the moment the king was entering by another . 
The first glance of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress . 
Not perceiving La Valliere , a frown came over his brow ; but as soon as he saw D'Artagnan , who bowed to him - `` Ah ! 
monsieur ! '' 
cried he , `` you have been diligent ! 
I am much pleased with you . '' 
This was the superlative expression of royal satisfaction . 
Many men would have been ready to lay down their lives for such a speech from the king . 
The maids of honor and the courtiers , who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his entrance , drew back , on observing he wished to speak privately with his captain of the musketeers . 
The king led the way out of the gallery , after having again , with his eyes , sought everywhere for La Valliere , whose absence he could not account for . 
The moment they were out of the reach of curious ears , `` Well ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` the prisoner ? '' 
`` Is in his prison , sire . '' 
`` What did he say on the road ? '' 
`` Nothing , sire . '' 
`` What did he do ? '' 
`` There was a moment at which the fisherman - who took me in his boat to Sainte-Marguerite - revolted , and did his best to kill me . 
The - the prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly . '' 
The king became pale . 
`` Enough ! '' 
said he ; and D'Artagnan bowed . 
Louis walked about his cabinet with hasty steps . 
`` Were you at Antibes , '' said he , `` when Monsieur de Beaufort came there ? '' 
`` No , sire ; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
which was followed by a fresh silence . 
`` Whom did you see there ? '' 
`` A great many persons , '' said D'Artagnan , coolly . 
The king perceived he was unwilling to speak . 
`` I have sent for you , monsieur le capitaine , to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at Nantes . '' 
`` At Nantes ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` In Bretagne . '' 
`` Yes , sire , it is in Bretagne . 
Will you majesty make so long a journey as to Nantes ? '' 
`` The States are assembled there , '' replied the king . 
`` I have two demands to make of them : I wish to be there . '' 
`` When shall I set out ? '' 
said the captain . 
`` This evening - to-morrow - to-morrow evening ; for you must stand in need of rest . '' 
`` I have rested , sire . '' 
`` That is well . 
Then between this and to-morrow evening , when you please . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave ; but , perceiving the king very much embarrassed , `` Will you majesty , '' said he , stepping two paces forward , `` take the court with you ? '' 
`` Certainly I shall . '' 
`` Then you majesty will , doubtless , want the musketeers ? '' 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain . 
`` Take a brigade of them , '' replied Louis . 
`` Is that all ? 
Has your majesty no other orders to give me ? '' 
`` No - ah - yes . '' 
`` I am all attention , sire . '' 
`` At the castle of Nantes , which I hear is very ill arranged , you will adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the principal dignitaries I shall take with me . '' 
`` Of the principal ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` For instance , at the door of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And that of M. Letellier ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Of M. de Brienne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And of monsieur le surintendant ? '' 
`` Without doubt . '' 
`` Very well , sire . 
By to-morrow I shall have set out . '' 
`` Oh , yes ; but one more word , Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
At Nantes you will meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres , captain of the guards . 
Be sure that your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive . 
Precedence always belongs to the first comer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` And if M. de Gesvres should question you ? '' 
`` Question me , sire ! 
Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question me ? '' 
And the musketeer , turning cavalierly on his heel , disappeared . 
`` To Nantes ! '' 
said he to himself , as he descended from the stairs . 
`` Why did he not dare to say , from thence to Belle-Isle ? '' 
As he reached the great gates , one of M. Brienne 's clerks came running after him , exclaiming , `` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! 
I beg your pardon - '' `` What is the matter , Monsieur Ariste ? '' 
`` The king has desired me to give you this order . '' 
`` Upon your cash-box ? '' 
asked the musketeer . 
`` No , monsieur ; on that of M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan was surprised , but he took the order , which was in the king 's own writing , and was for two hundred pistoles . 
`` What ! '' 
thought he , after having politely thanked M. Brienne 's clerk , `` M. Fouquet is to pay for the journey , then ! 
Mordioux ! 
that is a bit of pure Louis XI . 
Why was not this order on the chest of M. Colbert ? 
He would have paid it with such joy . '' 
And D'Artagnan , faithful to his principle of never letting an order at sight get cold , went straight to the house of M. Fouquet , to receive his two hundred pistoles . 
: The Last Supper . 
The superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching departure , for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends . 
From the bottom to the top of the house , the hurry of the servants bearing dishes , and the diligence of the registres , denoted an approaching change in offices and kitchen . 
D'Artagnan , with his order in his hand , presented himself at the offices , when he was told it was too late to pay cash , the chest was closed . 
He only replied : `` On the king 's service . '' 
The clerk , a little put out by the serious air of the captain , replied , that `` that was a very respectable reason , but that the customs of the house were respectable likewise ; and that , in consequence , he begged the bearer to call again next day . '' 
D'Artagnan asked if he could not see M. Fouquet . 
The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with such details , and rudely closed the outer door in the captain 's face . 
But the latter had foreseen this stroke , and placed his boot between the door and the door-case , so that the lock did not catch , and the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor . 
This made him change his tone , and say , with terrified politeness , `` If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le surintendant , he must go to the ante-chambers ; these are the offices , where monseigneur never comes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
very well ! 
Where are they ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan . 
`` On the other side of the court , '' said the clerk , delighted to be free . 
D'Artagnan crossed the court , and fell in with a crowd of servants . 
`` Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour , '' he was answered by a fellow carrying a vermeil dish , in which were three pheasants and twelve quails . 
`` Tell him , '' said the captain , laying hold of the servant by the end of his dish , `` that I am M. d'Artagnan , captain of his majesty 's musketeers . '' 
The fellow uttered a cry of surprise , and disappeared ; D'Artagnan following him slowly . 
He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in the ante-chamber : the latter , a little pale , came hastily out of the dining - room to learn what was the matter . 
D'Artagnan smiled . 
`` There is nothing unpleasant , Monsieur Pelisson ; only a little order to receive the money for . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Fouquet 's friend , breathing more freely ; and he took the captain by the hand , and , dragging him behind him , led him into the dining-room , where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant , placed in the center , and buried in the cushions of a fauteuil . 
There were assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet . 
Joyous friends , for the most part faithful , they had not fled their protector at the approach of the storm , and , in spite of the threatening heavens , in spite of the trembling earth , they remained there , smiling , cheerful , as devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity . 
On the left of the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere ; on his right was Madame Fouquet ; as if braving the laws of the world , and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to silence , the two protecting angels of this man united to offer , at the moment of the crisis , the support of their twined arms . 
Madame de Belliere was pale , trembling , and full of respectful attentions for madame la surintendante , who , with one hand on her husband 's , was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson had gone out to bring D'Artagnan . 
The captain entered at first full of courtesy , and afterwards of admiration , when , with his infallible glance , he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face . 
Fouquet raised himself up in his chair . 
`` Pardon me , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he , `` if I did not myself receive you when coming in the king 's name . '' 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness , which filled the hearts of all his friends with terror . 
`` Monseigneur , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` I only come to you in the king 's name to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles . '' 
The clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet , which still remained overcast . 
`` Ah ! 
then , '' said he , `` perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes ? '' 
`` I do not know whither I am setting out , monseigneur . '' 
`` But , '' said Madame Fouquet , recovered from her fright , `` you are not going so soon , monsieur le capitaine , as not to do us the honor to take a seat with us ? '' 
`` Madame , I should esteem that a great honor done me , but I am so pressed for time , that , you see , I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to procure payment of my note . '' 
`` The reply to which shall be gold , '' said Fouquet , making a sign to his intendant , who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him . 
`` Oh ! '' 
said the latter , `` I was not uneasy about the payment ; the house is good . '' 
A painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet . 
`` Are you in pain ? '' 
asked Madame de Belliere . 
`` Do you feel your attack coming on ? '' 
asked Madame Fouquet . 
`` Neither , thank you both , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Your attack ? '' 
said D'Artagnan , in his turn ; `` are you unwell , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I have a tertian fever , which seized me after the fete at Vaux . '' 
`` Caught cold in the grottos , at night , perhaps ? '' 
`` No , no ; nothing but agitation , that was all . '' 
`` The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king , '' said La Fontaine , quietly , without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege . 
`` We can not devote too much heart to the reception of our king , '' said Fouquet , mildly , to his poet . 
`` Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor , '' interrupted D'Artagnan , with perfect frankness and much amenity . 
`` The fact is , monseigneur , that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux . '' 
Madame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted himself well towards the king , the king had hardly done the like to the minister . 
But D'Artagnan knew the terrible secret . 
He alone with Fouquet knew it ; those two men had not , the one the courage to complain , the other the right to accuse . 
The captain , to whom the two hundred pistoles were brought , was about to take his leave , when Fouquet , rising , took a glass of wine , and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` to the health of the king , whatever may happen . '' 
`` And to your health , monseigneur , whatever may happen , '' said D'Artagnan . 
He bowed , with these words of evil omen , to all the company , who rose as soon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs . 
`` I , for a moment , thought it was I and not my money he wanted , '' said Fouquet , endeavoring to laugh . 
`` You ! '' 
cried his friends ; `` and what for , in the name of Heaven ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
do not deceive yourselves , my dear brothers in Epicurus , '' said the superintendent ; `` I do not wish to make a comparison between the most humble sinner on the earth , and the God we adore , but remember , he gave one day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper , and which was nothing but a farewell dinner , like that which we are making at this moment . '' 
A painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table . 
`` Shut the doors , '' said Fouquet , and the servants disappeared . 
`` My friends , '' continued Fouquet , lowering his voice , `` what was I formerly ? 
What am I now ? 
Consult among yourselves and reply . 
A man like me sinks when he does not continue to rise . 
What shall we say , then , when he really sinks ? 
I have no more money , no more credit ; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies , and powerless friends . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
cried Pelisson .
