On the day after that , he did not leave his bed . 
His portress , who prepared his scanty repasts , a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon , glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed : `` But you ate nothing yesterday , poor , dear man ! '' 
`` Certainly I did , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` The plate is quite full . '' 
`` Look at the water jug . 
It is empty . '' 
`` That proves that you have drunk ; it does not prove that you have eaten . '' 
`` Well , '' said Jean Valjean , `` what if I felt hungry only for water ? '' 
`` That is called thirst , and , when one does not eat at the same time , it is called fever . '' 
`` I will eat to-morrow . '' 
`` Or at Trinity day . 
Why not to-day ? 
Is it the thing to say : ` I will eat to-morrow ' ? 
The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it ! 
My ladyfinger potatoes were so good ! '' 
Jean Valjean took the old woman 's hand : `` I promise you that I will eat them , '' he said , in his benevolent voice . 
`` I am not pleased with you , '' replied the portress . 
Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman . 
There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes , and houses to which no one ever comes . 
He was in one of those streets and one of those houses . 
While he still went out , he had purchased of a coppersmith , for a few sous , a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed . 
That gibbet is always good to look at . 
A week passed , and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room . 
He still remained in bed . 
The portress said to her husband : -- `` The good man upstairs yonder does not get up , he no longer eats , he will not last long . 
That man has his sorrows , that he has . 
You wo n't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage . '' 
The porter replied , with the tone of marital sovereignty : `` If he 's rich , let him have a doctor . 
If he is not rich , let him go without . 
If he has no doctor he will die . '' 
`` And if he has one ? '' 
`` He will die , '' said the porter . 
The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement , with an old knife , and , as she tore out the blades , she grumbled : `` It 's a shame . 
Such a neat old man ! 
He 's as white as a chicken . '' 
She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street ; she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs . 
`` It 's on the second floor , '' said she . 
`` You have only to enter . 
As the good man no longer stirs from his bed , the door is always unlocked . '' 
The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him . 
When he came down again the portress interrogated him : `` Well , doctor ? '' 
`` Your sick man is very ill indeed . '' 
`` What is the matter with him ? '' 
`` Everything and nothing . 
He is a man who , to all appearances , has lost some person who is dear to him . 
People die of that . '' 
`` What did he say to you ? '' 
`` He told me that he was in good health . '' 
`` Shall you come again , doctor ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the doctor . 
`` But some one else besides must come . '' 
A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT 'S CART One evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow ; he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse ; his breath was short and halted at times ; he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before . 
Then , no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation , he made an effort , drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself . 
He put on his old workingman 's clothes . 
As he no longer went out , he had returned to them and preferred them . 
He was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself ; merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead . 
Since he had been alone , he had placed his bed in the antechamber , in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible . 
He opened the valise and drew from it Cosette 's outfit . 
He spread it out on his bed . 
The Bishop 's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece . 
He took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks . 
Then , although it was still broad daylight , -- it was summer , -- he lighted them . 
In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse . 
Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him , and he was obliged to sit down . 
It was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it ; it was the remnant of all movement possible to him , it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed . 
The chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirror , so fatal for him , so providential for Marius , in which he had read Cosette 's reversed writing on the blotting book . 
He caught sight of himself in this mirror , and did not recognize himself . 
He was eighty years old ; before Marius ' marriage , he would have hardly been taken for fifty ; that year had counted for thirty . 
What he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age , it was the mysterious mark of death . 
The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there . 
His cheeks were pendulous ; the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it ; the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs . 
He gazed into space with an air of reproach ; one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one . 
He was in that condition , the last phase of dejection , in which sorrow no longer flows ; it is coagulated , so to speak ; there is something on the soul like a clot of despair . 
Night had come . 
He laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair to the fireside , and placed upon the table a pen , some ink and some paper . 
That done , he had a fainting fit . 
When he recovered consciousness , he was thirsty . 
As he could not lift the jug , he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth , and swallowed a draught . 
As neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time , the point of the pen had curled up , the ink had dried away , he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink , which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times , and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen . 
He wiped his brow from time to time . 
Then he turned towards the bed , and , still seated , for he could not stand , he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects . 
These contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes . 
All at once he shivered , he felt that a child was taking possession of him ; he rested his elbows on the table , which was illuminated by the Bishop 's candles and took up the pen . 
His hand trembled . 
He wrote slowly the few following lines : `` Cosette , I bless thee . 
I am going to explain to thee . 
Thy husband was right in giving me to understand that I ought to go away ; but there is a little error in what he believed , though he was in the right . 
He is excellent . 
Love him well even after I am dead . 
Monsieur Pontmercy , love my darling child well . 
Cosette , this paper will be found ; this is what I wish to say to thee , thou wilt see the figures , if I have the strength to recall them , listen well , this money is really thine . 
Here is the whole matter : White jet comes from Norway , black jet comes from England , black glass jewellery comes from Germany . 
Jet is the lightest , the most precious , the most costly . 
Imitations can be made in France as well as in Germany . 
What is needed is a little anvil two inches square , and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax . 
The wax was formerly made with resin and lampblack , and cost four livres the pound . 
I invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine . 
It does not cost more than thirty sous , and is much better . 
Buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast , by means of this wax , to a little framework of black iron . 
The glass must be violet for iron jewellery , and black for gold jewellery . 
Spain buys a great deal of it . 
It is the country of jet ... '' Here he paused , the pen fell from his fingers , he was seized by one of those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being ; the poor man clasped his head in both hands , and meditated . 
`` Oh ! '' 
he exclaimed within himself -LSB- lamentable cries , heard by God alone -RSB- , `` all is over . 
I shall never see her more . 
She is a smile which passed over me . 
I am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again . 
Oh ! 
one minute , one instant , to hear her voice , to touch her dress , to gaze upon her , upon her , the angel ! 
and then to die ! 
It is nothing to die , what is frightful is to die without seeing her . 
She would smile on me , she would say a word to me , would that do any harm to any one ? 
No , all is over , and forever . 
Here I am all alone . 
My God ! 
My God ! 
I shall never see her again ! '' 
At that moment there came a knock at the door . 
A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING That same day , or to speak more accurately , that same evening , as Marius left the table , and was on the point of withdrawing to his study , having a case to look over , Basque handed him a letter saying : `` The person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber . '' 
Cosette had taken the grandfather 's arm and was strolling in the garden . 
A letter , like a man , may have an unprepossessing exterior . 
Coarse paper , coarsely folded -- the very sight of certain missives is displeasing . 
The letter which Basque had brought was of this sort . 
Marius took it . 
It smelled of tobacco . 
Nothing evokes a memory like an odor . 
Marius recognized that tobacco . 
He looked at the superscription : `` To Monsieur , Monsieur le Baron Pommerci . 
At his hotel . '' 
The recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well . 
It may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes . 
Marius was , as it were , illuminated by one of these flashes . 
The sense of smell , that mysterious aid to memory , had just revived a whole world within him . 
This was certainly the paper , the fashion of folding , the dull tint of ink ; it was certainly the well-known handwriting , especially was it the same tobacco . 
The Jondrette garret rose before his mind . 
Thus , strange freak of chance ! 
one of the two scents which he had so diligently sought , the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost , had come and presented itself to him of its own accord . 
He eagerly broke the seal , and read : `` Monsieur le Baron : -- If the Supreme Being had given me the talents , I might have been baron Thenard , member of the Institute -LSB- academy of ciences -RSB- , but I am not . 
I only bear the same as him , happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses . 
The benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle . 
I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual . 
This individual concerns you . 
I hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you . 
I will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there , madame la baronne being of lofty birth . 
The sanctuary of virtue can not cohabit longer with crime without abdicating . 
I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron . 
`` With respect . '' 
The letter was signed `` Thenard . '' 
This signature was not false . 
It was merely a trifle abridged . 
Moreover , the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation . 
The certificate of origin was complete . 
Marius ' emotion was profound . 
After a start of surprise , he underwent a feeling of happiness . 
If he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search , the man who had saved him , Marius , there would be nothing left for him to desire . 
He opened the drawer of his secretary , took out several bank-notes , put them in his pocket , closed the secretary again , and rang the bell . 
Basque half opened the door . 
`` Show the man in , '' said Marius . 
Basque announced : `` Monsieur Thenard . '' 
A man entered . 
A fresh surprise for Marius . 
The man who entered was an utter stranger to him . 
This man , who was old , moreover , had a thick nose , his chin swathed in a cravat , green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes , and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in `` high life . '' 
His hair was gray . 
He was dressed in black from head to foot , in garments that were very threadbare but clean ; a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch . 
He held in his hand an old hat ! 
He walked in a bent attitude , and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow . 
The first thing that struck the observer was , that this personage 's coat , which was too ample although carefully buttoned , had not been made for him . 
Here a short digression becomes necessary . 
There was in Paris at that epoch , in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue Beautreillis , near the Arsenal , an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men . 
Not for too long , which might have proved embarrassing for the villain . 
The change was on sight , for a day or two , at the rate of thirty sous a day , by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible . 
This costumer was called `` the Changer '' ; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew him by no other . 
He had a tolerably complete wardrobe . 
The rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable . 
He had specialties and categories ; on each nail of his shop hung a social status , threadbare and worn ; here the suit of a magistrate , there the outfit of a Cure , beyond the outfit of a banker , in one corner the costume of a retired military man , elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters , and further on the dress of a statesman . 
This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris . 
His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged , and into which roguery retreated . 
A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room , deposited his thirty sous and selected , according to the part which he wished to play , the costume which suited him , and on descending the stairs once more , the knave was a somebody . 
On the following day , the clothes were faithfully returned , and the Changer , who trusted the thieves with everything , was never robbed . 
There was one inconvenience about these clothes , they `` did not fit '' ; not having been made for those who wore them , they were too tight for one , too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one . 
Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer 's costumes . 
It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean . 
The changer had foreseen only ordinary men . 
He had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand , who is neither stout nor thin , neither tall nor short . 
Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer 's clients extricated themselves as best they might . 
So much the worse for the exceptions ! 
The suit of the statesman , for instance , black from head to foot , and consequently proper , would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala . 
The costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the Changer 's catalogue ; we copy : `` A coat of black cloth , trowsers of black wool , a silk waistcoat , boots and linen . '' 
On the margin there stood : ex-ambassador , and a note which we also copy : `` In a separate box , a neatly frizzed peruke , green glasses , seals , and two small quills an inch long , wrapped in cotton . '' 
All this belonged to the statesman , the ex-ambassador . 
This whole costume was , if we may so express ourselves , debilitated ; the seams were white , a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows ; moreover , one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast ; but this was only detail ; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart , its function was to conceal the absent button . 
If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris , he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basque had just shown in , the statesman 's suit borrowed from the pick-me-down-that shop of the Changer . 
Marius ' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the newcomer 's disadvantage . 
He surveyed him from head to foot , while that personage made exaggerated bows , and demanded in a curt tone : `` What do you want ? '' 
The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea : `` It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor of seeing Monsieur le Baron in society . 
I think I actually did meet monsieur personally , several years ago , at the house of Madame la Princesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte Dambray , peer of France . '' 
It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know . 
Marius paid attention to the manner of this man 's speech . 
He spied on his accent and gesture , but his disappointment increased ; the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry , shrill tone which he had expected . 
He was utterly routed . 
`` I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray , '' said he . 
`` I have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life . '' 
The reply was ungracious . 
The personage , determined to be gracious at any cost , insisted . 
`` Then it must have been at Chateaubriand 's that I have seen Monsieur ! 
I know Chateaubriand very well . 
He is very affable . 
He sometimes says to me : ` Thenard , my friend ... wo n't you drink a glass of wine with me ? ' '' 
Marius ' brow grew more and more severe : `` I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand . 
Let us cut it short . 
What do you want ? '' 
The man bowed lower at that harsh voice . 
`` Monsieur le Baron , deign to listen to me . 
There is in America , in a district near Panama , a village called la Joya . 
That village is composed of a single house , a large , square house of three stories , built of bricks dried in the sun , each side of the square five hundred feet in length , each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below , in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice , in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept ; no windows , loopholes , no doors , ladders , ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace , and from the first to the second , and from the second to the third , ladders to descend into the inner court , no doors to the chambers , trap-doors , no staircases to the chambers , ladders ; in the evening the traps are closed , the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes ; no means of entering , a house by day , a citadel by night , eight hundred inhabitants , -- that is the village . 
Why so many precautions ? 
because the country is dangerous ; it is full of cannibals . 
Then why do people go there ? 
because the country is marvellous ; gold is found there . '' 
`` What are you driving at ? '' 
interrupted Marius , who had passed from disappointment to impatience . 
`` At this , Monsieur le Baron . 
I am an old and weary diplomat . 
Ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices . 
I want to try savages . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron , egotism is the law of the world . 
The proletarian peasant woman , who toils by the day , turns round when the diligence passes by , the peasant proprietress , who toils in her field , does not turn round . 
The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man , the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man . 
Each one for himself . 
Self-interest -- that 's the object of men . 
Gold , that 's the loadstone . '' 
`` What then ? 
Finish . '' 
`` I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya . 
There are three of us . 
I have my spouse and my young lady ; a very beautiful girl . 
The journey is long and costly . 
I need a little money . '' 
`` What concern is that of mine ? '' 
demanded Marius . 
The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat , a gesture characteristic of the vulture , and replied with an augmented smile . 
`` Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter ? '' 
There was some truth in this . 
The fact is , that the contents of the epistle had slipped Marius ' mind . 
He had seen the writing rather than read the letter . 
He could hardly recall it . 
But a moment ago a fresh start had been given him . 
He had noted that detail : `` my spouse and my young lady . '' 
He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger . 
An examining judge could not have done the look better . 
He almost lay in wait for him . 
He confined himself to replying : `` State the case precisely . '' 
The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs , drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column , but scrutinizing Marius in his turn , with the green gaze of his spectacles . 
`` So be it , Monsieur le Baron . 
I will be precise . 
I have a secret to sell to you . '' 
`` A secret ? '' 
`` A secret . '' 
`` Which concerns me ? '' 
`` Somewhat . '' 
`` What is the secret ? '' 
Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him . 
`` I commence gratis , '' said the stranger . 
`` You will see that I am interesting . '' 
`` Speak . '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron , you have in your house a thief and an assassin . '' 
Marius shuddered . 
`` In my house ? 
no , '' said he . 
The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on : `` An assassin and a thief . 
Remark , Monsieur le Baron , that I do not here speak of ancient deeds , deeds of the past which have lapsed , which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God . 
I speak of recent deeds , of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour . 
I continue . 
This man has insinuated himself into your confidence , and almost into your family under a false name . 
I am about to tell you his real name . 
And to tell it to you for nothing . '' 
`` I am listening . '' 
`` His name is Jean Valjean . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` I am going to tell you , equally for nothing , who he is . '' 
`` Say on . '' 
`` He is an ex-convict . '' 
`` I know it . '' 
`` You know it since I have had the honor of telling you . '' 
`` No . 
I knew it before . '' 
Marius ' cold tone , that double reply of `` I know it , '' his laconicism , which was not favorable to dialogue , stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger . 
He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius , which was instantly extinguished . 
Rapid as it was , this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it ; it did not escape Marius . 
Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls ; the eye , that vent-hole of the thought , glows with it ; spectacles hide nothing ; try putting a pane of glass over hell ! 
The stranger resumed with a smile : `` I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron . 
In any case , you ought to perceive that I am well informed . 
Now what I have to tell you is known to myself alone . 
This concerns the fortune of Madame la Baronne . 
It is an extraordinary secret . 
It is for sale -- I make you the first offer of it . 
Cheap . 
Twenty thousand francs . '' 
`` I know that secret as well as the others , '' said Marius . 
The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle . 
`` Monsieur le Baron , say ten thousand francs and I will speak . '' 
`` I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me . 
I know what you wish to say to me . '' 
A fresh flash gleamed in the man 's eye . 
He exclaimed : `` But I must dine to-day , nevertheless . 
It is an extraordinary secret , I tell you . 
Monsieur le Baron , I will speak . 
I speak . 
Give me twenty francs . '' 
Marius gazed intently at him : `` I know your extraordinary secret , just as I knew Jean Valjean 's name , just as I know your name . '' 
`` My name ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That is not difficult , Monsieur le Baron . 
I had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you . 
Thenard . '' '' 
-- Dier . '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` Thenardier . '' 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
In danger the porcupine bristles up , the beetle feigns death , the old guard forms in a square ; this man burst into laughter . 
Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip . 
Marius continued : `` You are also Jondrette the workman , Fabantou the comedian , Genflot the poet , Don Alvares the Spaniard , and Mistress Balizard . '' 
`` Mistress what ? '' 
`` And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil . '' 
`` A pot-house ! 
Never . '' 
`` And I tell you that your name is Thenardier . '' 
`` I deny it . '' 
`` And that you are a rascal . 
Here . '' 
And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face . 
`` Thanks ! 
Pardon me ! 
five hundred francs ! 
Monsieur le Baron ! '' 
And the man , overcome , bowed , seized the note and examined it . 
`` Five hundred francs ! '' 
he began again , taken aback . 
And he stammered in a low voice : `` An honest rustler . '' 
-LSB- 69 -RSB- -LSB- 69 -RSB- Un fafiot serieux . 
Fafiot is the slang term for a bank-bill , derived from its rustling noise . 
Then brusquely : `` Well , so be it ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Let us put ourselves at our ease . '' 
And with the agility of a monkey , flinging back his hair , tearing off his spectacles , and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made , and which the reader has also met with on another page of this book , he took off his face as the man takes off his hat . 
His eye lighted up ; his uneven brow , with hollows in some places and bumps in others , hideously wrinkled at the top , was laid bare , his nose had become as sharp as a beak ; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared . 
`` Monsieur le Baron is infallible , '' he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared , `` I am Thenardier . '' 
And he straightened up his crooked back . 
Thenardier , for it was really he , was strangely surprised ; he would have been troubled , had he been capable of such a thing . 
He had come to bring astonishment , and it was he who had received it . 
This humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him , and , taking it all in all , he accepted it ; but he was none the less bewildered . 
He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time , and , in spite of his disguise , this Baron Pontmercy recognized him , and recognized him thoroughly . 
And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to Thenardier , but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean . 
Who was this almost beardless young man , who was so glacial and so generous , who knew people 's names , who knew all their names , and who opened his purse to them , who bullied rascals like a judge , and who paid them like a dupe ? 
Thenardier , the reader will remember , although he had been Marius ' neighbor , had never seen him , which is not unusual in Paris ; he had formerly , in a vague way , heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named Marius who lived in the house . 
He had written to him , without knowing him , the letter with which the reader is acquainted . 
No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possible in his mind . 
As for the name Pontmercy , it will be recalled that , on the battlefield of Waterloo , he had only heard the last two syllables , for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks . 
However , through his daughter Azelma , who had started on the scent of the married pair on the 16th of February , and through his own personal researches , he had succeeded in learning many things , and , from the depths of his own gloom , he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew . 
He had discovered , by dint of industry , or , at least , by dint of induction , he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer . 
From the man he had easily reached the name . 
He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette . 
But he meant to be discreet in that quarter . 
Who was Cosette ? 
He did not know exactly himself . 
He did , indeed , catch an inkling of illegitimacy , the history of Fantine had always seemed to him equivocal ; but what was the use of talking about that ? 
in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence ? 
He had , or thought he had , better wares than that for sale . 
And , according to all appearances , if he were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation -- and without proof : `` Your wife is a bastard , '' the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer . 
From Thenardier 's point of view , the conversation with Marius had not yet begun . 
He ought to have drawn back , to have modified his strategy , to have abandoned his position , to have changed his front ; but nothing essential had been compromised as yet , and he had five hundred francs in his pocket . 
Moreover , he had something decisive to say , and , even against this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy , he felt himself strong . 
For men of Thenardier 's nature , every dialogue is a combat . 
In the one in which he was about to engage , what was his situation ? 
He did not know to whom he was speaking , but he did know of what he was speaking , he made this rapid review of his inner forces , and after having said : `` I am Thenardier , '' he waited . 
Marius had become thoughtful . 
So he had hold of Thenardier at last . 
That man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him . 
He could honor Colonel Pontmercy 's recommendation . 
He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain , and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him , Marius , had been protested up to that day . 
It also seemed to him , in the complex state of his mind towards Thenardier , that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal . 
In any case , he was content . 
He was about to deliver the Colonel 's shade from this unworthy creditor at last , and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father 's memory from the debtors ' prison . 
By the side of this duty there was another -- to elucidate , if possible , the source of Cosette 's fortune . 
The opportunity appeared to present itself . 
Perhaps Thenardier knew something . 
It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man . 
He commenced with this . 
Thenardier had caused the `` honest rustler '' to disappear in his fob , and was gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender . 
Marius broke the silence . 
`` Thenardier , I have told you your name . 
Now , would you like to have me tell you your secret -- the one that you came here to reveal to me ? 
I have information of my own , also . 
You shall see that I know more about it than you do . 
Jean Valjean , as you have said , is an assassin and a thief . 
A thief , because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer , whose ruin he brought about . 
An assassin , because he assassinated police-agent Javert . '' 
`` I do n't understand , sir , '' ejaculated Thenardier . 
`` I will make myself intelligible . 
In a certain arrondissement of the Pas de Calais , there was , in 1822 , a man who had fallen out with justice , and who , under the name of M. Madeleine , had regained his status and rehabilitated himself . 
This man had become a just man in the full force of the term . 
In a trade , the manufacture of black glass goods , he made the fortune of an entire city . 
As far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also , but as a secondary matter , and in some sort , by accident . 
He was the foster-father of the poor . 
He founded hospitals , opened schools , visited the sick , dowered young girls , supported widows , and adopted orphans ; he was like the guardian angel of the country . 
He refused the cross , he was appointed Mayor . 
A liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days ; he denounced him , and had him arrested , and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte , -- I have the fact from the cashier himself , -- by means of a false signature , to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine . 
This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean . 
As for the other fact , you have nothing to tell me about it either . 
Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert ; he shot him with a pistol . 
I , the person who is speaking to you , was present . '' 
Thenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory , and who has just regained , in one instant , all the ground which he has lost . 
But the smile returned instantly . 
The inferior 's triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling . 
Thenardier contented himself with saying to Marius : `` Monsieur le Baron , we are on the wrong track . '' 
And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl . 
`` What ! '' 
broke forth Marius , `` do you dispute that ? 
These are facts . '' 
`` They are chimeras . 
The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so . 
Truth and justice before all things . 
I do not like to see folks accused unjustly . 
Monsieur le Baron , Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill Javert . '' 
`` This is too much ! 
How is this ? '' 
`` For two reasons . '' 
`` What are they ? 
Speak . '' 
`` This is the first : he did not rob M. Madeleine , because it is Jean Valjean himself who was M. Madeleine . '' 
`` What tale are you telling me ? '' 
`` And this is the second : he did not assassinate Javert , because the person who killed Javert was Javert . '' 
`` What do you mean to say ? '' 
`` That Javert committed suicide . '' 
`` Prove it ! 
prove it ! '' 
cried Marius beside himself . 
Thenardier resumed , scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient Alexandrine measure : `` Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change . '' 
`` But prove it ! '' 
Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper , which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes . 
`` I have my papers , '' he said calmly . 
And he added : `` Monsieur le Baron , in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean thoroughly . 
I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the same man , and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert . 
If I speak , it is because I have proofs . 
Not manuscript proofs -- writing is suspicious , handwriting is complaisant , -- but printed proofs . '' 
As he spoke , Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers , yellow , faded , and strongly saturated with tobacco . 
One of these two newspapers , broken at every fold and falling into rags , seemed much older than the other . 
`` Two facts , two proofs , '' remarked Thenardier . 
And he offered the two newspapers , unfolded , to Marius , The reader is acquainted with these two papers . 
One , the most ancient , a number of the Drapeau Blanc of the 25th of July , 1823 , the text of which can be seen in the first volume , established the identity of M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean . 
The other , a Moniteur of the 15th of June , 1832 , announced the suicide of Javert , adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to the prefect that , having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who , holding him under his pistol , had fired into the air , instead of blowing out his brains . 
Marius read . 
He had evidence , a certain date , irrefragable proof , these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up Thenardier 's statements ; the note printed in the Moniteur had been an administrative communication from the Prefecture of Police . 
Marius could not doubt . 
The information of the cashier-clerk had been false , and he himself had been deceived . 
Jean Valjean , who had suddenly grown grand , emerged from his cloud . 
Marius could not repress a cry of joy . 
`` Well , then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man ! 
the whole of that fortune really belonged to him ! 
he is Madeleine , the providence of a whole countryside ! 
he is Jean Valjean , Javert 's savior ! 
he is a hero ! 
he is a saint ! '' 
`` He 's not a saint , and he 's not a hero ! '' 
said Thenardier . 
`` He 's an assassin and a robber . '' 
And he added , in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority : `` Let us be calm . '' 
Robber , assassin -- those words which Marius thought had disappeared and which returned , fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath . 
`` Again ! '' 
said he . 
`` Always , '' ejaculated Thenardier . 
`` Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine , but he is a thief . 
He did not kill Javert , but he is a murderer . '' 
`` Will you speak , '' retorted Marius , `` of that miserable theft , committed forty years ago , and expiated , as your own newspapers prove , by a whole life of repentance , of self-abnegation and of virtue ? '' 
`` I say assassination and theft , Monsieur le Baron , and I repeat that I am speaking of actual facts . 
What I have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown . 
It belongs to unpublished matter . 
And perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne by Jean Valjean . 
I say skilfully , because , by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share , and , at the same stroke , to conceal one 's crime , and to enjoy one 's theft , to bury one 's name and to create for oneself a family . '' 
`` I might interrupt you at this point , '' said Marius , `` but go on . '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron , I will tell you all , leaving the recompense to your generosity . 
This secret is worth massive gold . 
You will say to me : ` Why do not you apply to Jean Valjean ? ' 
For a very simple reason ; I know that he has stripped himself , and stripped himself in your favor , and I consider the combination ingenious ; but he has no longer a son , he would show me his empty hands , and , since I am in need of some money for my trip to la Joya , I prefer you , you who have it all , to him who has nothing . 
I am a little fatigued , permit me to take a chair . '' 
Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same . 
Thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair , picked up his two newspapers , thrust them back into their envelope , and murmured as he pecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail : `` It cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one . '' 
That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair , an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying , then he entered upon his subject gravely , emphasizing his words : `` Monsieur le Baron , on the 6th of June , 1832 , about a year ago , on the day of the insurrection , a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris , at the point where the sewer enters the Seine , between the Pont des Invalides and the Pont de Jena . '' 
Marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thenardier . 
Thenardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words : `` This man , forced to conceal himself , and for reasons , moreover , which are foreign to politics , had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it . 
It was , I repeat , on the 6th of June ; it might have been eight o'clock in the evening . 
The man hears a noise in the sewer . 
Greatly surprised , he hides himself and lies in wait . 
It was the sound of footsteps , some one was walking in the dark , and coming in his direction . 
Strange to say , there was another man in the sewer besides himself . 
The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off . 
A little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer , and to see that the man was carrying something on his back . 
He was walking in a bent attitude . 
The man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex-convict , and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse . 
Assassination caught in the very act , if ever there was such a thing . 
As for the theft , that is understood ; one does not kill a man gratis . 
This convict was on his way to fling the body into the river . 
One fact is to be noticed , that before reaching the exit grating , this convict , who had come a long distance in the sewer , must , necessarily , have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body , but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day , while at work on the quagmire , and that did not suit the assassin 's plans . 
He had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden , and his exertions must have been terrible , for it is impossible to risk one 's life more completely ; I do n't understand how he could have come out of that alive . '' 
Marius ' chair approached still nearer . 
Thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath . 
He went on : `` Monsieur le Baron , a sewer is not the Champ de Mars . 
One lacks everything there , even room . 
When two men are there , they must meet . 
That is what happened . 
The man domiciled there and the passer-by were forced to bid each other good-day , greatly to the regret of both . 
The passer-by said to the inhabitant : -- `` You see what I have on my back , I must get out , you have the key , give it to me . '' 
That convict was a man of terrible strength . 
There was no way of refusing . 
Nevertheless , the man who had the key parleyed , simply to gain time . 
He examined the dead man , but he could see nothing , except that the latter was young , well dressed , with the air of being rich , and all disfigured with blood . 
While talking , the man contrived to tear and pull off behind , without the assassin perceiving it , a bit of the assassinated man 's coat . 
A document for conviction , you understand ; a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal . 
He put this document for conviction in his pocket . 
After which he opened the grating , made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back , closed the grating again , and ran off , not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all , not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river . 
Now you comprehend . 
The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean ; the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment ; and the piece of the coat ... '' Thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket , and holding , on a level with his eyes , nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers , a strip of torn black cloth , all covered with dark spots . 
Marius had sprung to his feet , pale , hardly able to draw his breath , with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth , and , without uttering a word , without taking his eyes from that fragment , he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney . 
He found the key , opened the cupboard , plunged his arm into it without looking , and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which Thenardier still held outspread . 
But Thenardier continued : `` Monsieur le Baron , I have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by Jean Valjean , and the bearer of an enormous sum of money . '' 
`` The young man was myself , and here is the coat ! '' 
cried Marius , and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood . 
Then , snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier , he crouched down over the coat , and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt . 
The rent fitted exactly , and the strip completed the coat . 
Thenardier was petrified . 
This is what he thought : `` I 'm struck all of a heap . '' 
Marius rose to his feet trembling , despairing , radiant . 
He fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thenardier , presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank-notes for five hundred and a thousand francs . 
`` You are an infamous wretch ! 
you are a liar , a calumniator , a villain . 
You came to accuse that man , you have only justified him ; you wanted to ruin him , you have only succeeded in glorifying him . 
And it is you who are the thief ! 
And it is you who are the assassin ! 
I saw you , Thenardier Jondrette , in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital . 
I know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose . 
Here are a thousand francs , bully that you are ! '' 
And he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier . 
`` Ah ! 
Jondrette Thenardier , vile rascal ! 
Let this serve you as a lesson , you dealer in second-hand secrets , merchant of mysteries , rummager of the shadows , wretch ! 
Take these five hundred francs and get out of here ! 
Waterloo protects you . '' 
`` Waterloo ! '' 
growled Thenardier , pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand . 
`` Yes , assassin ! 
You there saved the life of a Colonel ... '' `` Of a General , '' said Thenardier , elevating his head . 
`` Of a Colonel ! '' 
repeated Marius in a rage . 
`` I would n't give a ha ` penny for a general . 
And you come here to commit infamies ! 
I tell you that you have committed all crimes . 
Go ! 
disappear ! 
Only be happy , that is all that I desire . 
Ah ! 
monster ! 
here are three thousand francs more . 
Take them . 
You will depart to-morrow , for America , with your daughter ; for your wife is dead , you abominable liar . 
I shall watch over your departure , you ruffian , and at that moment I will count out to you twenty thousand francs . 
Go get yourself hung elsewhere ! '' 
`` Monsieur le Baron ! '' 
replied Thenardier , bowing to the very earth , `` eternal gratitude . '' 
And Thenardier left the room , understanding nothing , stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold , and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank-bills . 
Struck by lightning he was , but he was also content ; and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that . 
Let us finish with this man at once . 
Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating , he set out , thanks to Marius ' care , for America under a false name , with his daughter Azelma , furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousand francs . 
The moral wretchedness of Thenardier , the bourgeois who had missed his vocation , was irremediable . 
He was in America what he had been in Europe . 
Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it . 
With Marius ' money , Thenardier set up as a slave-dealer . 
As soon as Thenardier had left the house , Marius rushed to the garden , where Cosette was still walking . 
`` Cosette ! 
Cosette ! '' 
he cried . 
`` Come ! 
come quick ! 
Let us go . 
Basque , a carriage ! 
Cosette , come . 
Ah ! 
My God ! 
It was he who saved my life ! 
Let us not lose a minute ! 
Put on your shawl . '' 
Cosette thought him mad and obeyed . 
He could not breathe , he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing . 
He paced back and forth with huge strides , he embraced Cosette : `` Ah ! 
Cosette ! 
I am an unhappy wretch ! '' 
said he . 
Marius was bewildered . 
He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure . 
An unheard-of virtue , supreme and sweet , humble in its immensity , appeared to him . 
The convict was transfigured into Christ . 
Marius was dazzled by this prodigy . 
He did not know precisely what he beheld , but it was grand . 
In an instant , a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door . 
Marius helped Cosette in and darted in himself . 
`` Driver , '' said he , `` Rue de l'Homme Arme , Number 7 . '' 
The carriage drove off . 
`` Ah ! 
what happiness ! '' 
ejaculated Cosette . 
`` Rue de l'Homme Arme , I did not dare to speak to you of that . 
We are going to see M. Jean . '' 
`` Thy father ! 
Cosette , thy father more than ever . 
Cosette , I guess it . 
You told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you by Gavroche . 
It must have fallen into his hands . 
Cosette , he went to the barricade to save me . 
As it is a necessity with him to be an angel , he saved others also ; he saved Javert . 
He rescued me from that gulf to give me to you . 
He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer . 
Ah ! 
I am a monster of ingratitude . 
Cosette , after having been your providence , he became mine . 
Just imagine , there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over , to drown one in mire . 
Cosette ! 
he made me traverse it . 
I was unconscious ; I saw nothing , I heard nothing , I could know nothing of my own adventure . 
We are going to bring him back , to take him with us , whether he is willing or not , he shall never leave us again . 
If only he is at home ! 
Provided only that we can find him , I will pass the rest of my life in venerating him . 
Yes , that is how it should be , do you see , Cosette ? 
Gavroche must have delivered my letter to him . 
All is explained . 
You understand . '' 
Cosette did not understand a word . 
`` You are right , '' she said to him . 
Meanwhile the carriage rolled on . 
A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY Jean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door . 
`` Come in , '' he said feebly . 
The door opened . 
Cosette and Marius made their appearance . 
Cosette rushed into the room . 
Marius remained on the threshold , leaning against the jamb of the door . 
`` Cosette ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
And he sat erect in his chair , his arms outstretched and trembling , haggard , livid , gloomy , an immense joy in his eyes . 
Cosette , stifling with emotion , fell upon Jean Valjean 's breast . 
`` Father ! '' 
said she . 
Jean Valjean , overcome , stammered : `` Cosette ! 
she ! 
you ! 
Madame ! 
it is thou ! 
Ah ! 
my God ! '' 
And , pressed close in Cosette 's arms , he exclaimed : `` It is thou ! 
thou art here ! 
Thou dost pardon me then ! '' 
Marius , lowering his eyelids , in order to keep his tears from flowing , took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs : `` My father ! '' 
`` And you also , you pardon me ! '' 
Jean Valjean said to him . 
Marius could find no words , and Jean Valjean added : `` Thanks . '' 
Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed . 
`` It embarrasses me , '' said she . 
And , seating herself on the old man 's knees , she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement , and kissed his brow . 
Jean Valjean , bewildered , let her have her own way . 
Cosette , who only understood in a very confused manner , redoubled her caresses , as though she desired to pay Marius ' debt . 
Jean Valjean stammered : `` How stupid people are ! 
I thought that I should never see her again . 
Imagine , Monsieur Pontmercy , at the very moment when you entered , I was saying to myself : ` All is over . 
Here is her little gown , I am a miserable man , I shall never see Cosette again , ' and I was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs . 
Was not I an idiot ? 
Just see how idiotic one can be ! 
One reckons without the good God . 
The good God says : '' ` You fancy that you are about to be abandoned , stupid ! 
No . 
No , things will not go so . 
Come , there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel . ' 
And the angel comes , and one sees one 's Cosette again ! 
and one sees one 's little Cosette once more ! 
Ah ! 
I was very unhappy . '' 
For a moment he could not speak , then he went on : `` I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then . 
A heart needs a bone to gnaw . 
But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way . 
I gave myself reasons : ` They do not want you , keep in your own course , one has not the right to cling eternally . ' 
Ah ! 
God be praised , I see her once more ! 
Dost thou know , Cosette , thy husband is very handsome ? 
Ah ! 
what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on , luckily . 
I am fond of that pattern . 
It was thy husband who chose it , was it not ? 
And then , thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls . 
Let me call her thou , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
It will not be for long . '' 
And Cosette began again : `` How wicked of you to have left us like that ! 
Where did you go ? 
Why have you stayed away so long ? 
Formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days . 
I sent Nicolette , the answer always was : ` He is absent . ' 
How long have you been back ? 
Why did you not let us know ? 
Do you know that you are very much changed ? 
Ah ! 
what a naughty father ! 
he has been ill , and we have not known it ! 
Stay , Marius , feel how cold his hand is ! '' 
`` So you are here ! 
Monsieur Pontmercy , you pardon me ! '' 
repeated Jean Valjean . 
At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more , all that was swelling Marius ' heart found vent . 
He burst forth : `` Cosette , do you hear ? 
he has come to that ! 
he asks my forgiveness ! 
And do you know what he has done for me , Cosette ? 
He has saved my life . 
He has done more -- he has given you to me . 
And after having saved me , and after having given you to me , Cosette , what has he done with himself ? 
He has sacrificed himself . 
Behold the man . 
And he says to me the ingrate , to me the forgetful , to me the pitiless , to me the guilty one : Thanks ! 
Cosette , my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little . 
That barricade , that sewer , that furnace , that cesspool , -- all that he traversed for me , for thee , Cosette ! 
He carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me , and accepted for himself . 
Every courage , every virtue , every heroism , every sanctity he possesses ! 
Cosette , that man is an angel ! '' 
`` Hush ! 
hush ! '' 
said Jean Valjean in a low voice . 
`` Why tell all that ? '' 
`` But you ! '' 
cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration , `` why did you not tell it to me ? 
It is your own fault , too . 
You save people 's lives , and you conceal it from them ! 
You do more , under the pretext of unmasking yourself , you calumniate yourself . 
It is frightful . '' 
`` I told the truth , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` No , '' retorted Marius , `` the truth is the whole truth ; and that you did not tell . 
You were Monsieur Madeleine , why not have said so ? 
You saved Javert , why not have said so ? 
I owed my life to you , why not have said so ? '' 
`` Because I thought as you do . 
I thought that you were in the right . 
It was necessary that I should go away . 
If you had known about that affair , of the sewer , you would have made me remain near you . 
I was therefore forced to hold my peace . 
If I had spoken , it would have caused embarrassment in every way . '' 
`` It would have embarrassed what ? 
embarrassed whom ? '' 
retorted Marius . 
`` Do you think that you are going to stay here ? 
We shall carry you off . 
Ah ! 
good heavens ! 
when I reflect that it was by an accident that I have learned all this . 
You form a part of ourselves . 
You are her father , and mine . 
You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house . 
Do not imagine that you will be here to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I shall not be here , but I shall not be with you . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
replied Marius . 
`` Ah ! 
come now , we are not going to permit any more journeys . 
You shall never leave us again . 
You belong to us . 
We shall not loose our hold of you . '' 
`` This time it is for good , '' added Cosette . 
`` We have a carriage at the door . 
I shall run away with you . 
If necessary , I shall employ force . '' 
And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms . 
`` Your chamber still stands ready in our house , '' she went on . 
`` If you only knew how pretty the garden is now ! 
The azaleas are doing very well there . 
The walks are sanded with river sand ; there are tiny violet shells . 
You shall eat my strawberries . 
I water them myself . 
And no more ` madame , ' no more ` Monsieur Jean , ' we are living under a Republic , everybody says thou , do n't they , Marius ? 
The programme is changed . 
If you only knew , father , I have had a sorrow , there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall , and a horrible cat ate her . 
My poor , pretty , little robin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me ! 
I cried over it . 
I should have liked to kill the cat . 
But now nobody cries any more . 
Everybody laughs , everybody is happy . 
You are going to come with us . 
How delighted grandfather will be ! 
You shall have your plot in the garden , you shall cultivate it , and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine . 
And , then , I shall do everything that you wish , and then , you will obey me prettily . '' 
Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her . 
He heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words ; one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes . 
He murmured : `` The proof that God is good is that she is here . '' 
`` Father ! '' 
said Cosette . 
Jean Valjean continued : `` It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together . 
Their trees are full of birds . 
I would walk with Cosette . 
It is sweet to be among living people who bid each other ` good-day , ' who call to each other in the garden . 
People see each other from early morning . 
We should each cultivate our own little corner . 
She would make me eat her strawberries . 
I would make her gather my roses . 
That would be charming . 
Only ... '' He paused and said gently : `` It is a pity . '' 
The tear did not fall , it retreated , and Jean Valjean replaced it with a smile . 
Cosette took both the old man 's hands in hers . 
`` My God ! '' 
said she , `` your hands are still colder than before . 
Are you ill ? 
Do you suffer ? '' 
`` I ? 
No , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
`` I am very well . 
Only ... '' He paused . 
`` Only what ? '' 
`` I am going to die presently . '' 
Cosette and Marius shuddered . 
`` To die ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
`` Yes , but that is nothing , '' said Jean Valjean . 
He took breath , smiled and resumed : `` Cosette , thou wert talking to me , go on , so thy little robin red-breast is dead ? 
Speak , so that I may hear thy voice . '' 
Marius gazed at the old man in amazement . 
Cosette uttered a heartrending cry . 
`` Father ! 
my father ! 
you will live . 
You are going to live . 
I insist upon your living , do you hear ? '' 
Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , forbid me to die . 
Who knows ? 
Perhaps I shall obey . 
I was on the verge of dying when you came . 
That stopped me , it seemed to me that I was born again . '' 
`` You are full of strength and life , '' cried Marius . 
`` Do you imagine that a person can die like this ? 
You have had sorrow , you shall have no more . 
It is I who ask your forgiveness , and on my knees ! 
You are going to live , and to live with us , and to live a long time . 
We take possession of you once more . 
There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness . '' 
`` You see , '' resumed Cosette , all bathed in tears , `` that Marius says that you shall not die . '' 
Jean Valjean continued to smile . 
`` Even if you were to take possession of me , Monsieur Pontmercy , would that make me other than I am ? 
No , God has thought like you and myself , and he does not change his mind ; it is useful for me to go . 
Death is a good arrangement . 
God knows better than we what we need . 
May you be happy , may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette , may youth wed the morning , may there be around you , my children , lilacs and nightingales ; may your life be a beautiful , sunny lawn , may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls , and now let me , who am good for nothing , die ; it is certain that all this is right . 
Come , be reasonable , nothing is possible now , I am fully conscious that all is over . 
And then , last night , I drank that whole jug of water . 
How good thy husband is , Cosette ! 
Thou art much better off with him than with me . '' 
A noise became audible at the door . 
It was the doctor entering . 
`` Good-day , and farewell , doctor , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Here are my poor children . '' 
Marius stepped up to the doctor . 
He addressed to him only this single word : `` Monsieur ? 
... '' But his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question . 
The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance . 
`` Because things are not agreeable , '' said Jean Valjean , `` that is no reason for being unjust towards God . '' 
A silence ensued . 
All breasts were oppressed . 
Jean Valjean turned to Cosette . 
He began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity . 
In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended , ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at Cosette . 
The reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage . 
The doctor felt of his pulse . 
`` Ah ! 
it was you that he wanted ! '' 
he murmured , looking at Cosette and Marius . 
And bending down to Marius ' ear , he added in a very low voice : `` Too late . '' 
Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely , almost without ceasing to gaze at Cosette . 
These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth : `` It is nothing to die ; it is dreadful not to live . '' 
All at once he rose to his feet . 
These accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony . 
He walked with a firm step to the wall , thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him , detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there , and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health , and said in a loud voice , as he laid the crucifix on the table : `` Behold the great martyr . '' 
Then his chest sank in , his head wavered , as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him . 
His hands , which rested on his knees , began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers . 
Cosette supported his shoulders , and sobbed , and tried to speak to him , but could not . 
Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears , they distinguished words like the following : `` Father , do not leave us . 
Is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again ? '' 
It might be said that agony writhes . 
It goes , comes , advances towards the sepulchre , and returns towards life . 
There is groping in the action of dying . 
Jean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon , shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more . 
He took a fold of Cosette 's sleeve and kissed it . 
`` He is coming back ! 
doctor , he is coming back , '' cried Marius . 
`` You are good , both of you , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` I am going to tell you what has caused me pain . 
What has pained me , Monsieur Pontmercy , is that you have not been willing to touch that money . 
That money really belongs to your wife . 
I will explain to you , my children , and for that reason , also , I am glad to see you . 
Black jet comes from England , white jet comes from Norway . 
All this is in this paper , which you will read . 
For bracelets , I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron , slides of iron laid together . 
It is prettier , better and less costly . 
You will understand how much money can be made in that way . 
So Cosette 's fortune is really hers . 
I give you these details , in order that your mind may be set at rest . '' 
The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door . 
The doctor dismissed her . 
But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared : `` Would you like a priest ? '' 
`` I have had one , '' replied Jean Valjean . 
And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one . 
It is probable , in fact , that the Bishop was present at this death agony . 
Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins . 
Jean Valjean resumed : `` Have no fear , Monsieur Pontmercy , I adjure you . 
The six hundred thousand francs really belong to Cosette . 
My life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them ! 
We managed to do very well with those glass goods . 
We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery . 
However , we could not equal the black glass of England . 
A gross , which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains , only costs three francs . '' 
When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death , we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back . 
Cosette gave her hand to Marius , and both , mute with anguish , not knowing what to say to the dying man , stood trembling and despairing before him . 
Jean Valjean sank moment by moment . 
He was failing ; he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon . 
His breath had become intermittent ; a little rattling interrupted it . 
He found some difficulty in moving his forearm , his feet had lost all movement , and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased , all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow . 
The light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes . 
His face paled and smiled . 
Life was no longer there , it was something else . 
His breath sank , his glance grew grander . 
He was a corpse on which the wings could be felt . 
He made a sign to Cosette to draw near , then to Marius ; the last minute of the last hour had , evidently , arrived . 
He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance , and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him . 
`` Draw near , draw near , both of you . 
I love you dearly . 
Oh ! 
how good it is to die like this ! 
And thou lovest me also , my Cosette . 
I knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man . 
How kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins ! 
Thou wilt weep for me a little , wilt thou not ? 
Not too much . 
I do not wish thee to have any real griefs . 
You must enjoy yourselves a great deal , my children . 
I forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest . 
A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty . 
It really was a good business . 
So there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
It is honest money . 
You may be rich with a tranquil mind . 
Thou must have a carriage , a box at the theatres now and then , and handsome ball dresses , my Cosette , and then , thou must give good dinners to thy friends , and be very happy . 
I was writing to Cosette a while ago . 
She will find my letter . 
I bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece . 
They are of silver , but to me they are gold , they are diamonds ; they change candles which are placed in them into wax-tapers . 
I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high . 
I have done what I could . 
My children , you will not forget that I am a poor man , you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find , under a stone to mark the spot . 
This is my wish . 
No name on the stone . 
If Cosette cares to come for a little while now and then , it will give me pleasure . 
And you too , Monsieur Pontmercy . 
I must admit that I have not always loved you . 
I ask your pardon for that . 
Now she and you form but one for me . 
I feel very grateful to you . 
I am sure that you make Cosette happy . 
If you only knew , Monsieur Pontmercy , her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight ; when I saw her in the least pale , I was sad . 
In the chest of drawers , there is a bank-bill for five hundred francs . 
I have not touched it . 
It is for the poor . 
Cosette , dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed ? 
dost thou recognize it ? 
That was ten years ago , however . 
How time flies ! 
We have been very happy . 
All is over . 
Do not weep , my children , I am not going very far , I shall see you from there , you will only have to look at night , and you will see me smile . 
Cosette , dost thou remember Montfermeil ? 
Thou wert in the forest , thou wert greatly terrified ; dost thou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket ? 
That was the first time that I touched thy poor , little hand . 
It was so cold ! 
Ah ! 
your hands were red then , mademoiselle , they are very white now . 
And the big doll ! 
dost thou remember ? 
Thou didst call her Catherine . 
Thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent ! 
How thou didst make me laugh sometimes , my sweet angel ! 
When it had been raining , thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters , and watch them pass away . 
One day I gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow , blue and green feathers . 
Thou hast forgotten it . 
Thou wert roguish so young ! 
Thou didst play . 
Thou didst put cherries in thy ears . 
Those are things of the past . 
The forests through which one has passed with one 's child , the trees under which one has strolled , the convents where one has concealed oneself , the games , the hearty laughs of childhood , are shadows . 
I imagined that all that belonged to me .
