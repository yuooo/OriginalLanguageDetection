Come , tell us your story , '' Grushenka cried to Maximov . 
`` Why are you all silent ? '' 
`` There 's nothing to tell , it 's all so foolish , '' answered Maximov at once , with evident satisfaction , mincing a little . 
`` Besides , all that 's by way of allegory in Gogol , for he 's made all the names have a meaning . 
Nozdryov was really called Nosov , and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name , he was called Shkvornev . 
Fenardi really was called Fenardi , only he was n't an Italian but a Russian , and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights , and she had a little short skirt with spangles , and she kept turning round and round , only not for four hours but for four minutes only , and she bewitched everyone ... '' `` But what were you beaten for ? '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` For Piron ! '' 
answered Maximov . 
`` What Piron ? '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` The famous French writer , Piron . 
We were all drinking then , a big party of us , in a tavern at that very fair . 
They 'd invited me , and first of all I began quoting epigrams . 
` Is that you , Boileau ? 
What a funny get-up ! ' 
and Boileau answers that he 's going to a masquerade , that is to the baths , he he ! 
And they took it to themselves , so I made haste to repeat another , very sarcastic , well known to all educated people : Yes , Sappho and Phaon are we ! 
But one grief is weighing on me . 
You do n't know your way to the sea ! 
`` They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it . 
And as ill-luck would have it , to set things right , I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron , how he was not accepted into the French Academy , and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph : Ci-git Piron qui ne fut rien , Pas meme academicien , * * Here lies Piron , who was nothing , not even an Academician . 
They seized me and thrashed me . '' 
`` But what for ? 
What for ? '' 
`` For my education . 
People can thrash a man for anything , '' Maximov concluded , briefly and sententiously . 
`` Eh , that 's enough ! 
That 's all stupid , I do n't want to listen . 
I thought it would be amusing , '' Grushenka cut them short , suddenly . 
Mitya started , and at once left off laughing . 
The tall Pole rose upon his feet , and with the haughty air of a man , bored and out of his element , began pacing from corner to corner of the room , his hands behind his back . 
`` Ah , he ca n't sit still , '' said Grushenka , looking at him contemptuously . 
Mitya began to feel anxious . 
He noticed besides , that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression . 
`` Panie ! '' 
cried Mitya , `` Let 's drink ! 
and the other pan , too ! 
Let us drink . '' 
In a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him , and filled them with champagne . 
`` To Poland , Panovie , I drink to your Poland ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I shall be delighted , panie , '' said the Pole on the sofa , with dignity and affable condescension , and he took his glass . 
`` And the other pan , what 's his name ? 
Drink , most illustrious , take your glass ! '' 
Mitya urged . 
`` Pan Vrublevsky , '' put in the Pole on the sofa . 
Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table , swaying as he walked . 
`` To Poland , Panovie ! '' 
cried Mitya , raisin , his glass . 
`` Hurrah ! '' 
All three drank . 
Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses . 
`` Now to Russia , Panovie , and let us be brothers ! '' 
`` Pour out some for us , '' said Grushenka ; `` I 'll drink to Russia , too ! '' 
`` So will I , '' said Kalganov . 
`` And I would , too ... to Russia , the old grandmother ! '' 
tittered Maximov . 
`` All ! 
All ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` Trifon Borissovitch , some more bottles ! '' 
The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him were put on the table . 
Mitya filled the glasses . 
`` To Russia ! 
Hurrah ! '' 
he shouted again . 
All drank the toast except the Poles , and Grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once . 
The Poles did not touch theirs . 
`` How 's this , Panovie ? '' 
cried Mitya , `` wo n't you drink it ? '' 
Pan Vrublevsky took the glass , raised it and said with a resonant voice : `` To Russia as she was before 1772 . '' 
`` Come , that 's better ! '' 
cried the other Pole , and they both emptied their glasses at once . 
`` You 're fools , you Panovie , '' broke suddenly from Mitya . 
`` Panie ! '' 
shouted both the Poles , menacingly , setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks . 
Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious . 
`` Can one help loving one 's own country ? '' 
he shouted . 
`` Be silent ! 
Do n't quarrel ! 
I wo n't have any quarrelling ! '' 
cried Grushenka imperiously , and she stamped her foot on the floor . 
Her face glowed , her eyes were shining . 
The effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent . 
Mitya was terribly alarmed . 
`` Panovie , forgive me ! 
It was my fault , I 'm sorry . 
Vrublevsky , panie Vrublevsky , I 'm sorry . '' 
`` Hold your tongue , you , anyway ! 
Sit down , you stupid ! '' . 
Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance . 
Everyone sat down , all were silent , looking at one another . 
`` Gentlemen , I was the cause of it all , '' Mitya began again , unable to make anything of Grushenka 's words . 
`` Come , why are we sitting here ? 
What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again ? '' 
`` Ach , it 's certainly anything but amusing ! '' 
Kalgonov mumbled lazily . 
`` Let 's play faro again , as we did just now , '' Maximov tittered suddenly . 
`` Faro ? 
Splendid ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` If only the panovie - '' `` It 's lite , panovie , '' the Pole on the sofa responded , as it were unwillingly . 
`` That 's true , '' assented Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Lite ? 
What do you mean by ` lite ' ? '' 
asked Grushenka . 
`` Late , pani ! ' 
A late hour ' I mean , '' the Pole on the sofa explained . 
`` It 's always late with them . 
They can never do anything ! '' 
Grushenka almost shrieked in her anger . 
`` They 're dull themselves , so they want others to be dull . 
Before came , Mitya , they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me . '' 
`` My goddess ! '' 
cried the Pole on the sofa , `` I see you 're not well-disposed to me , that 's why I 'm gloomy . 
I 'm ready , panie , '' added he , addressing Mitya . 
`` Begin , panie , '' Mitya assented , pulling his notes out of his pocket , and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table . 
`` I want to lose a lot to you . 
Take your cards . 
Make the bank . '' 
`` We 'll have cards from the landlord , panie , '' said the little Pole , gravely and emphatically . 
`` That 's much the best way , '' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` From the landlord ? 
Very good , I understand , let 's get them from him . 
Cards ! '' 
Mitya shouted to the landlord . 
The landlord brought in a new , unopened pack , and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready , and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon ; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived . 
Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders , but only three girls had arrived , and Marya was not there yet . 
And he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out . 
He only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls , the sweets , the toffee and the fondants . 
`` And vodka for Andrey , vodka for Andrey ! '' 
he cried in haste . 
`` I was rude to Andrey ! '' 
Suddenly Maximov , who had followed him out , touched him on the shoulder . 
`` Give me five roubles , '' he whispered to Mitya . 
`` I 'll stake something at faro , too , he he ! '' 
`` Capital ! 
Splendid ! 
Take ten , here ! '' 
Again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles . 
`` And if you lose that , come again , come again . '' 
`` Very good , '' Maximov whispered joyfully , and he ran back again . 
Mitya , too , returned , apologising for having kept them waiting . 
The Poles had already sat down , and opened the pack . 
They looked much more amiable , almost cordial . 
The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw . 
He wore an air of solemnity . 
`` To your places , gentlemen , '' cried Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` No , I 'm not going to play any more , '' observed Kalganov , `` I 've lost fifty roubles to them just now . '' 
`` The pan had no luck , perhaps he 'll be lucky this time , '' the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction . 
`` How much in the bank ? 
To correspond ? '' 
asked Mitya . 
`` That 's according , panie , maybe a hundred , maybe two hundred , as much as you will stake . '' 
`` A million ! '' 
laughed Mitya . 
`` The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky , perhaps ? '' 
`` What Podvysotsky ? '' 
`` In Warsaw there was a bank and anyone comes and stakes against it . 
Podvysotsky comes , sees a thousand gold pieces , stakes against the bank . 
The banker says , ` Panie Podvysotsky , are you laying down the gold , or must we trust to your honour ? ' 
` To my honour , panie , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` So much the better . ' 
The banker throws the dice . 
Podvysotsky wins . 
` Take it , panie , ' says the banker , and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million . 
` Take it , panie , this is your gain . ' 
There was a million in the bank . ' 
I did n't know that , ' says Podvysotsky . 
` Panie Podvysotsky , ' said the banker , ` you pledged your honour and we pledged ours . ' 
Podvysotsky took the million . '' 
`` That 's not true , '' said Kalganov . 
`` Panie Kalganov , in gentlemanly society one does n't say such things . '' 
`` As if a Polish gambler would give away a million ! '' 
cried Mitya , but checked himself at once . 
`` Forgive me , panie , it 's my fault again ; he would , he would give away a million , for honour , for Polish honour . 
You see how I talk Polish , ha ha ! 
Here , I stake ten roubles , the knave leads . '' 
`` And I put a rouble on the queen , the queen of hearts , the pretty little panienotchka * he ! 
he ! '' 
laughed Maximov , pulling out his queen , and , as though trying to conceal it from everyone , he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table . 
Mitya won . 
The rouble won , too . 
* Little miss . 
`` A corner ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` I 'll bet another rouble , a ` single ' stake , '' Maximov muttered gleefully , hugely delighted at having won a rouble . 
`` Lost ! '' 
shouted Mitya . 
`` A ` double ' on the seven ! '' 
The seven too was trumped . 
`` Stop ! '' 
cried Kalganov suddenly . 
`` Double ! 
Double ! '' 
Mitya doubled his stakes , and each time he doubled the stake , the card he doubled was trumped by the Poles . 
The rouble stakes kept winning . 
`` On the double ! '' 
shouted Mitya furiously . 
`` You 've lost two hundred , panie . 
Will you stake another hundred ? '' 
the Pole on the sofa inquired . 
`` What ? 
Lost two hundred already ? 
Then another two hundred ! 
All doubles ! '' 
And pulling his money out of his pocket , Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen , but Kalgonov covered it with his hand . 
`` That 's enough ! '' 
he shouted in his ringing voice . 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
Mitya stared at him . 
`` That 's enough ! 
I do n't want you to play anymore . 
Do n't ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because I do n't . 
Hang it , come away . 
That 's why . 
I wo n't let you go on playing . '' 
Mitya gazed at him in astonishment . 
`` Give it up , Mitya . 
He may be right . 
You 've lost a lot as it is , '' said Grushenka , with a curious note in her voice . 
Both the Poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air . 
`` Are you joking , panie ? '' 
said the short man , looking severely at Kalganov . 
`` How dare you ! '' 
Pan Vrublevsky , too , growled at Kalganov . 
`` Do n't dare to shout like that , '' cried Grushenka . 
`` Ah , you turkey-cocks ! '' 
Mitya looked at each of them in turn . 
But something in Grushenka 's face suddenly struck him , and at the same instant something new flashed into his mind - a strange new thought ! 
`` Pani Agrippina , '' the little Pole was beginning , crimson with anger , when Mitya suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder . 
`` Most illustrious , two words with you . 
`` cried Grushenka . 
`` What do you want ? '' 
`` In the next room , I 've two words to say to you , something pleasant , very pleasant . 
You 'll be glad to hear it . '' 
The little pan was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya . 
He agreed at once , however , on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them . 
`` The bodyguard ? 
Let him come , and I want him , too . 
I must have him ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
`` March , panovie ! '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
asked Grushenka , anxiously . 
`` We 'll be back in one moment , '' answered Mitya . 
There was a sort of boldness , a sudden confidence shining in his eyes . 
His face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before . 
He led the Poles , not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid , but into the bedroom on the right , where the trunks and packages were kept , and there were two large beds , with pyramids of cotton pillows on each . 
There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner . 
The small man and Mitya sat down to this table , facing each other , while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them , his hands behind his back . 
The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive . 
`` What can I do for you , panie ? '' 
lisped the little Pole . 
`` Well , look here , panie , I wo n't keep you long . 
There 's money for you , '' he pulled out his notes . 
`` Would you like three thousand ? 
Take it and go your way . '' 
The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya , with a searching look . 
`` Three thousand , panie ? '' 
He exchanged glances with Vrublevsky . 
`` Three , panovie , three ! 
Listen , panie , I see you 're a sensible man . 
Take three thousand and go to the devil , and Vrublevsky with you d'you hear ? 
But , at once , this very minute , and for ever . 
You understand that , panie , for ever . 
Here 's the door , you go out of it . 
What have you got there , a great-coat , a fur coat ? 
I 'll bring it out to you . 
They 'll get the horses out directly , and then-good-bye , panie ! '' 
Mitya awaited an answer with assurance . 
He had no doubts . 
An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole 's face . 
`` And the money , panie ? '' 
`` The money , panie ? 
Five hundred roubles I 'll give you this moment for the journey , and as a first instalment , and two thousand five hundred to-morrow , in the town - I swear on my honour , I 'll get it , I 'll get it at any cost ! '' 
cried Mitya . 
The Poles exchanged glances again . 
The short man 's face looked more forbidding . 
`` Seven hundred , seven hundred , not five hundred , at once , this minute , cash down ! '' 
Mitya added , feeling something wrong . 
`` What 's the matter , panie ? 
Do n't you trust me ? 
I ca n't give you the whole three thousand straight off . 
If I give it , you may come back to her to-morrow ... . 
Besides , I have n't the three thousand with me . 
I 've got it at home in the town , '' faltered Mitya , his spirit sinking at every word he uttered . 
`` Upon my word , the money 's there , hidden . '' 
In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man 's face . 
`` What next ? '' 
he asked ironically . 
`` For shame ! '' 
and he spat on the floor . 
Pan Vrublevsky spat too . 
`` You do that , panie , '' said Mitya , recognising with despair that all was over , `` because you hope to make more out of Grushenka ? 
You 're a couple of capons , that 's what you are ! '' 
`` This is a mortal insult ! '' 
The little Pole turned as red as a crab , and he went out of the room , briskly , as though unwilling to hear another word . 
Vrublevsky swung out after him , and Mitya followed , confused and crestfallen . 
He was afraid of Grushenka , afraid that the Pan would at once raise an outcry . 
And so indeed he did . 
The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka . 
`` Pani Agrippina , I have received a mortal insult ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience , as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot . 
`` Speak Russian ! 
Speak Russian ! '' 
she cried , `` not another word of Polish ! 
You used to talk Russian . 
You ca n't have forgotten it in five years . '' 
She was red with passion . 
`` Pani Agrippina - '' `` My name 's Agrafena , Grushenka , speak Russian or I wo n't listen ! '' 
The Pole gasped with offended dignity , and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian : `` Pani Agrafena , I came here to forget the past and forgive it , to forget all that has happened till to-day - '' `` Forgive ? 
Came here to forgive me ? '' 
Grushenka cut him short , jumping up from her seat . 
`` Just so , Pani , I 'm not pusillanimous , I 'm magnanimous . 
But I was astounded when I saw your lovers . 
Pan Mitya offered me three thousand , in the other room to depart . 
I spat in the pan 's face . '' 
`` What ? 
He offered you money for me ? '' 
cried Grushenka , hysterically . 
`` Is it true , Mitya ? 
How dare you ? 
Am I for sale ? '' 
`` Panie , panie ! '' 
yelled Mitya , `` she 's pure and shining , and I have never been her lover ! 
That 's a lie ... '' `` How dare you defend me to him ? '' 
shrieked Grushenka . 
`` It was n't virtue kept me pure , and it was n't that I was afraid of Kuzma , but that I might hold up my head when I met him , and tell him he 's a scoundrel . 
And he did actually refuse the money ? '' 
`` He took it ! 
He took it ! '' 
cried Mitya ; `` only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once , and I could only give him seven hundred straight off . '' 
`` I see : he heard I had money , and came here to marry me ! '' 
`` Pani Agrippina ! '' 
cried the little Pole . 
`` I 'm - a knight , I 'm - a nobleman , and not a lajdak . 
I came here to make you my wife and I find you a different woman , perverse and shameless . '' 
`` Oh , go back where you came from ! 
I 'll tell them to turn you out and you 'll be turned out , '' cried Grushenka , furious . 
`` I 've been a fool , a fool , to have been miserable these five years ! 
And it was n't for his sake , it was my anger made me miserable . 
And this is n't he at all ! 
Was he like this ? 
It might be his father ! 
Where did you get your wig from ? 
He was a falcon , but this is a gander . 
He used to laugh and sing to me ... . 
And I 've been crying for five years , damned fool , abject , shameless I was ! 
She sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands . 
At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left - a rollicking dance song . 
`` A regular Sodom ! '' 
Vrublevsky roared suddenly . 
`` Landlord , send the shameless hussies away ! '' 
The landlord , who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door , hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarrelling , at once entered the room . 
`` What are you shouting for ? 
D'you want to split your throat ? '' 
he said , addressing Vrublevsky , with surprising rudeness . 
`` Animal ! '' 
bellowed Pan Vrublevsky . 
`` Animal ? 
And what sort of cards were you playing with just now ? 
I gave you a pack and you hid it . 
You played with marked cards ! 
I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards , d'you know that , for it 's just the same as false banknotes ... And going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion , and pulled out an unopened pack of cards . 
`` Here 's my pack unopened ! '' 
He held it up and showed it to all in the room . 
`` From where I stood I saw him slip my pack away , and put his in place of it - you 're a cheat and not a gentleman ! '' 
`` And I twice saw the pan change a card ! '' 
cried Kalganov . 
`` How shameful ! 
How shameful ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka , clasping her hands , and blushing for genuine shame . 
`` Good Lord , he 's come to that ! '' 
`` I thought so , too ! '' 
said Mitya . 
But before he had uttered the words , Vrublevsky , with a confused and infuriated face , shook his fist at Grushenka , shouting : `` You low harlot ! '' 
Mitya flew at him at once , clutched him in both hands , lifted him in the air , and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right , from which they had just come . 
`` I 've laid him on the floor , there , '' he announced , returning at once , gasping with excitement . 
`` He 's struggling , the scoundrel ! 
But he wo n't come back , no fear of that ! 
... '' He closed one half of the folding doors , and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole : `` Most illustrious , will you please to retire as well ? '' 
`` My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' said Trifon Borissovitch , `` make them give you back the money you lost . 
It 's as good as stolen from you . '' 
`` I do n't want my fifty roubles back , '' Kalgonov declared suddenly . 
`` I do n't want my two hundred , either , '' cried Mitya , `` I would n't take it for anything ! 
Let him keep it as a consolation . '' 
`` Bravo , Mitya ! 
You 're a trump , Mitya ! '' 
cried Grushenka , and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation . 
The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity , was making for the door , but he stopped short and said suddenly , addressing Grushenka : `` Pani , if you want to come with me , come . 
If not , good-bye . '' 
And swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door . 
This was a man of character : he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed , he still expected that she would marry him . 
Mitya slammed the door after him . 
`` Lock it , '' said Kalganov . 
But the key clicked on the other side , they had locked it from within . 
`` That 's capital ! '' 
exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly . 
`` Serve them right ! '' 
Delirium WHAT followed was almost an orgy , a feast to which all were welcome . 
Grushenka was the first to call for wine . 
`` I want to drink . 
I want to be quite drunk , as we were before . 
Do you remember , Mitya , do you remember how we made friends here last time ! '' 
Mitya himself was almost delirious , feeling that his happiness was at hand . 
But Grushenka was continually sending him away from her . 
`` Go and enjoy yourself . 
Tell them to dance , to make merry , ` let the stove and cottage dance ' ; as we had it last time , '' she kept exclaiming . 
She was tremendously excited . 
And Mitya hastened to obey her . 
The chorus were in the next room . 
The room in which they had been sitting till that moment was too small , and was divided in two by cotton curtains , behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows . 
In the four rooms for visitors there were beds . 
Grushenka settled herself just at the door . 
Mitya set an easy chair for her . 
She had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing `` the time before , '' when they had made merry there . 
All the girls who had come had been there then ; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come , too , and at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions . 
Mitya bustled about . 
All sorts of people began coming into the room to look on , peasants and their women , who had been roused from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvellous entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before . 
Mitya remembered their faces , greeting and embracing everyone he knew . 
He uncorked bottles and poured out wine for everyone who presented himself . 
Only the girls were very eager for the champagne . 
The men preferred rum , brandy , and , above all , hot punch . 
Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls , and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself . 
An absurd chaotic confusion followed , but Mitya was in his natural element , and the more foolish it became , the more his spirits rose . 
If the peasants had asked him for money at that moment , he would have pulled out his notes and given them away right and left . 
This was probably why the landlord , Trifon Borissovitch , kept hovering about Mitya to protect him . 
He seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night ; but he drank little , only one glass of punch , and kept a sharp look-out on Mitya 's interests after his own fashion . 
He intervened in the nick of time , civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away `` cigars and Rhine wine , '' and , above all , money to the peasants as he had done before . 
He was very indignant , too , at the peasant girls drinking liqueur , and eating sweets . 
`` They 're a lousy lot , Dmitri Fyodorovitch , '' he said . 
`` I 'd give them a kick , every one of them , and they 'd take it as an honour - that 's all they 're worth ! '' 
Mitya remembered Andrey again , and ordered punch to be sent out to him . 
`` I was rude to him just now , '' he repeated with a sinking , softened voice . 
Kalgonov did to drink , and at first did not care for the girls singing ; but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne he became extraordinarily lively , strolling about the room , laughing and praising the music and the songs , admiring everyone and everything . 
Maximov , blissfully drunk , never left his side . 
Grushenka , too , was beginning to get drunk . 
Pointing to Kalganov , she said to Mitya : `` What a dear , charming boy he is ! '' 
And Mitya , delighted , ran to kiss Kalgonov and Maximov . 
Oh , great were his hopes ! 
She had said nothing yet , and seemed , indeed , purposely to refrain from speaking . 
But she looked at him from time to time with caressing and passionate eyes . 
At last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her . 
She was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the door . 
`` How was it you came just now , eh ? 
Have you walked in ! 
... I was frightened . 
So you wanted to give me up to him , did you ? 
Did you really want to ? '' 
`` I did n't want to spoil your happiness ! '' 
Mitya faltered blissfully . 
But she did not need his answer . 
`` Well , go and enjoy yourself ... '' she sent him away once more . 
`` Do n't cry , I 'll call you back again . '' 
He would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at the dancing , though her eyes followed him wherever he went . 
But in another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run back to her . 
`` Come , sit beside me , tell me , how did you hear about me , and my coming here yesterday ? 
From whom did you first hear it ? '' 
And Mitya began telling her all about it , disconnectedly , incoherently , feverishly . 
He spoke strangely , often frowning , and stopping abruptly . 
`` What are you frowning at ? '' 
she asked . 
`` Nothing ... . 
I left a man ill there . 
I 'd give ten years of my life for him to get well , to know he was all right ! '' 
`` Well , never mind him , if he 's ill . 
So you meant to shoot yourself to-morrow ! 
What a silly boy ! 
What for ? 
I like such reckless fellows as you , '' she lisped , with a rather halting tongue . 
`` So you would go any length for me , eh ? 
Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow , you stupid ? 
No , wait a little . 
To-morrow I may have something to say to you ... . 
I wo n't say it to-day , but to-morrow . 
You 'd like it to be to-day ? 
No , I do n't want to to-day . 
Come , go along now , go and amuse yourself . '' 
Once , however , she called him , as it were , puzzled and uneasy . 
`` Why are you sad ? 
I see you 're sad ... . 
Yes , I see it , '' she added , looking intently into his eyes . 
`` Though you keep kissing the peasants and shouting , I see something . 
No , be merry . 
I 'm merry ; you be merry , too ... . 
I love somebody here . 
Guess who it is . 
Ah , look , my boy has fallen asleep , poor dear , he 's drunk . '' 
She meant Kalganov . 
He was , in fact , drunk , and had dropped asleep for a moment , sitting on the sofa . 
But he was not merely drowsy from drink ; he felt suddenly dejected , or , as he said , `` bored . '' 
He was intensely depressed by the girls ' songs , which , as the drinking went on , gradually became coarse and more reckless . 
And the dances were as bad . 
Two girls dressed up as bears , and a lively girl , called Stepanida , with a stick in her hand , acted the part of keeper , and began to `` show them . '' 
`` Look alive , Marya , or you 'll get the stick ! 
The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion , amid roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women . 
`` Well , let them ! 
Let them ! '' 
said Grushenka sententiously , with an ecstatic expression on her face . 
`` When they do get a day to enjoy themselves ; why should n't folks be happy ? '' 
Kalgonov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt . 
`` It 's swinish , all this peasant foolery , '' he murmured , moving away ; `` it 's the game they play when it 's light all night in summer . '' 
He particularly disliked one `` new '' song to a jaunty dance-tune . 
It described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls , to see whether they would love him : The master came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But the girls could not love the master : He would beat me cruelly And such love wo n't do for me . 
Then a gypsy comes along and he , too , tries : The gypsy came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But they could n't love the gypsy either : He would be a thief , I fear , And would cause me many a tear . 
And many more men come to try their luck , among them a soldier : The soldier came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
But the soldier is rejected with contempt , in two indecent lines , sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience . 
The song ends with a merchant : The merchant came to try the girls : Would they love him , would they not ? 
And it appears that he wins their love because : The merchant will make gold for me And his queen I 'll gladly be . 
Kalgonov was positively indignant . 
`` That 's just a song of yesterday , '' he said aloud . 
`` Who writes such things for them ? 
They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to try his luck with the girls ; they 'd have carried all before them . '' 
And , almost as though it were a personal affront , he declared , on the spot , that he was bored , sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep . 
His pretty little face looked rather pale , as it fell back on the sofa cushion . 
`` Look how pretty he is , '' said Grushenka , taking Mitya up to him . 
`` I was combing his hair just now ; his hair 's like flax , and so thick ... '' And , bending over him tenderly , she kissed his forehead . 
Kalgonov instantly opened his eyes , looked at her , stood up , and with the most anxious air inquired where was Maximov ? 
`` So that 's who it is you want . '' 
Grushenka laughed . 
`` Stay with me a minute . 
Mitya , run and find his Maximov . '' 
Maximov , it appeared , could not tear himself away from the girls , only running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur . 
He had drunk two cups of chocolate . 
His face was red , and his nose was crimson ; his eyes were moist , and mawkishly sweet.He ran up and announced that he was going to dance the `` sabotiere . '' 
`` They taught me all those well-bred , aristocratic dances when I was little ... '' `` Go , go with him , Mitya , and I 'll watch from here how he dances , '' said Grushenka . 
`` No , no , I 'm coming to look on , too , '' exclaimed Kalganov , brushing aside in the most naive way Grushenka 's offer to sit with him . 
They all went to look on . 
Maximov danced his dance . 
But it roused no great admiration in anyone but Mitya . 
It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping , kicking the feet , and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot . 
Kalgonov did not like it at all , but Mitya kissed the dancer . 
`` Thanks . 
You 're tired perhaps ? 
What are you looking for here ? 
Would you like some sweets ? 
A cigar , perhaps ? '' 
`` A cigarette . '' 
`` Do n't you want a drink ? '' 
`` I 'll just have a liqueur ... . 
Have you any chocolates ? '' 
`` Yes , there 's a heap of them on the table there . 
Choose one , my dear soul ! '' 
`` I like one with vanilla ... for old people . 
He he ! 
`` No , brother , we 've none of that special sort . '' 
`` I say , '' the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya 's ear . 
`` That girl there , little Marya , he he ! 
How would it be if you were to help me make friends with her ? '' 
`` So that 's what you 're after ! 
No , brother , that wo n't do ! '' 
`` I 'd do no harm to anyone , '' Maximov muttered disconsolately . 
`` Oh , all right , all right . 
They only come here to dance and sing , you know , brother . 
But damn it all , wait a bit ! 
... Eat and drink and be merry , meanwhile . 
Do n't you want money ? '' 
`` Later on , perhaps , '' smiled Maximov . 
`` All right , all right ... '' Mitya 's head was burning . 
He went outside to the wooden balcony which ran round the whole building on the inner side , overlooking the courtyard . 
The fresh air revived him . 
He stood alone in a dark corner , and suddenly clutched his head in both hands . 
His scattered thoughts came together ; his sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind . 
A fearful and terrible light ! 
`` If I 'm to shoot myself , why not now ? '' 
passed through his mind . 
`` Why not go for the pistols , bring them here , and here , in this dark dirty corner , make an end ? '' 
Almost a minute he undecided . 
A few hours earlier , when he had been dashing here , he was pursued by disgrace , by the theft he had committed , and that blood , that blood ! 
... But yet it was easier for him then . 
Then everything was over : he had lost her , given her up . 
She was gone , for him - oh , then his death sentence had been easier for him ; at least it had seemed necessary , inevitable , for what had he to stay on earth for ? 
But now ? 
Was it the same as then ? 
Now one phantom , one terror at least was at an end : that first , rightful lover , that fateful figure had vanished , leaving no trace . 
The terrible phantom had turned into something so small , so comic ; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in . 
It would never return . 
She was ashamed , and from her eyes he could see now whom she loved . 
Now he had everything to make life happy ... but he could not go on living , he could not ; oh , damnation ! 
`` O God ! 
restore to life the man I knocked down at the fence ! 
Let this fearful cup pass from me ! 
Lord , thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me ! 
But what , what if the old man 's alive ? 
Oh , then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away . 
I would restore the stolen money . 
I 'd give it back ; I 'd get it somehow ... . 
No trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever ! 
But no , no ; oh , impossible cowardly dreams ! 
Oh , damnation ! '' 
Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness . 
He jumped up and ran back to the room - to her , to her , his queen for ever ! 
Was not one moment of her love worth all the rest of life , even in the agonies of disgrace ? 
This wild question clutched at his heart . 
`` To her , to her alone , to see her , to hear her , to think of nothing , to forget everything , if only for that night , for an hour , for a moment ! '' 
Just as he turned from the balcony into the passage , he came upon the landlord , Trifon Borissovitch . 
He thought he looked gloomy and worried , and fancied he had come to find him . 
`` What is it , Trifon Borissovitch ? 
Are you looking for me ? '' 
`` No , sir , '' The landlord seemed disconcerted . 
`` Why should I be looking for you ? 
Where have you been ? '' 
`` Why do you look so glum ? 
You 're not angry , are you ? 
Wait a bit , you shall soon get to bed ... . 
What 's the time ? '' 
`` It 'll be three o'clock . 
Past three , it must be . '' 
`` We 'll leave off soon . 
We 'll leave off . '' 
`` Do n't mention it ; it does n't matter . 
Keep it up as long as you like ... '' `` What 's the matter with him ? '' 
Mitya wondered for an instant , and he ran back to the room where the girls were dancing . 
But she was not there . 
She was not in the blue room either ; there was no one but Kalgonov asleep on the sofa . 
Mitya peeped behind the curtain - she was there . 
She was sitting in the corner , on a trunk . 
Bent forward , with her head and arms on the bed close by , she was crying bitterly , doing her utmost to stifle her sobs that she might not be heard . 
Seeing Mitya , she beckoned him to her , and when he ran to her , she grasped his hand tightly . 
`` Mitya , Mitya , I loved him , you know . 
How I have loved him these five years , all that time ! 
Did I love him or only my own anger ? 
No , him , him ! 
It 's a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him . 
Mitya , I was only seventeen then ; he was so kind to me , so merry ; he used to sing to me ... . 
Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me ... . 
And now , O Lord , it 's not the same man . 
Even his face is not the same ; he 's different altogether . 
I should n't have known him . 
I drove here with Timofey , and all the way I was thinking how I should meet him , what I should say to him , how we should look at one another . 
My soul was faint , and all of a sudden it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me . 
He talked to me like a schoolmaster , all so grave and learned ; he met me so solemnly that I was struck dumb . 
I could n't get a word in . 
At first I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big Pole . 
I sat staring at him and wondering why I could n't say a word to him now . 
It must have been his wife that ruined him ; you know he threw me up to get married . 
She must have changed him like that . 
Mitya , how shameful it is ! 
Oh , Mitya , I 'm ashamed , I 'm ashamed for all my life . 
Curse it , curse it , curse those five years ! '' 
And again she burst into tears , but clung tight to Mitya 's hand and did not let it go . 
`` Mitya , darling , stay , do n't go away . 
I want to say one word to you , '' she whispered , and suddenly raised her face to him . 
`` Listen , tell me who it is I love ? 
I love one man here . 
Who is that man ? 
That 's what you must tell me . '' 
A smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping , and her eyes shone in the half darkness . 
`` A falcon flew in , and my heart sank . 
`` Fool ! 
that 's the man you love ! ' 
That was what my heart whispered to me at once . 
You came in and all grew bright . 
What 's he afraid of ? 
I wondered . 
For you were frightened ; you could n't speak . 
It 's not them he 's afraid of - could you be frightened of anyone ? 
It 's me he 's afraid of , I thought , only me . 
So Fenya told you , you little stupid , how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I 'd loved Mityenka for one hour , and that I was going now to love ... another . 
Mitya , Mitya , how could I be such a fool as to think I could love anyone after you ? 
Do you forgive me , Mitya ? 
Do you forgive me or not ? 
Do you love me ? 
Do you love me ? '' 
She jumped up and held him with both hands on his shoulders . 
Mitya , dumb with rapture , gazed into her eyes , at her face , at her smile , and suddenly clasped her tightly his arms and kissed her passionately . 
`` You will forgive me for having tormented you ? 
It was through spite I tormented you all . 
It was for spite I drove the old man out of his mind ... . 
Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the wine-glass ? 
I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank ` to my vile heart . ' 
Mitya , my falcon , why do n't you kiss me ? 
He kissed me once , and now he draws back and looks and listens . 
Why listen to me ? 
Kiss me , kiss me hard , that 's right . 
if you love , well , then , love ! 
I 'll be your slave now , your slave for the rest of my life . 
It 's sweet to be a slave . 
Kiss me ! 
Beat me , ill-treat me , do what you will with me ... . 
And I do deserve to suffer . 
Stay , wait , afterwards , I wo n't have that ... '' she suddenly thrust him away . 
`` Go along , Mitya , I 'll come and have some wine , I want to be drunk , I 'm going to get drunk and dance ; I must , I must ! '' 
She tore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain . 
Mitya followed like a drunken man . 
`` Yes , come what may - whatever may happen now , for one minute I 'd give the whole world , '' he thought . 
Grushenka did , in fact , toss off a whole glass of champagne at one gulp , and became at once very tipsy . 
She sat down in the same chair as before , with a blissful smile on her face . 
Her cheeks were glowing , her lips were burning , her flashing eyes were moist ; there was passionate appeal in her eyes . 
Even Kalgonov felt a stir at the heart and went up to her . 
`` Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now ? '' 
she said thickly . 
`` I 'm drunk now , that 's what it is ... . 
And are n't you drunk ? 
And why is n't Mitya drinking ? 
Why do n't you drink , Mitya ? 
I 'm drunk , and you do n't drink ... '' `` I am drunk ! 
I 'm drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I 'll be drunk with wine , too . '' 
He drank off another glass , and - he thought it strange himself - that glass made him completely drunk . 
He was suddenly drunk , although till that moment he had been quite sober , he remembered that . 
From that moment everything whirled about him , as though he were delirious . 
He walked , laughed , talked to everybody , without knowing what he was doing . 
Only one persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually , `` like a red-hot coal in his heart , '' he said afterwards . 
He went up to her , sat beside her , gazed at her , listened to her ... . 
She became very talkative , kept calling everyone to her , and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus . 
When the girl came up , she either kissed her , or made the sign of the cross over her . 
In another minute she might have cried . 
She was greatly amused by the `` little old man , '' as she called Maximov . 
He ran up every minute to kiss her hands , each little finger , '' and finally he danced another dance to an old song , which he sang himself . 
He danced with special vigour to the refrain : The little pig says - umph ! 
umph ! 
umph ! 
The little calf says - moo , moo , moo , The little duck says - quack , quack , quack , The little goose says - ga , ga , ga. . 
The hen goes strutting through the porch ; Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo , she 'll say , Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo , she 'll say ! 
`` Give him something , Mitya , '' said Grushenka . 
`` Give him a present , he 's poor , you know . 
Ah , the poor , the insulted ! 
... Do you know , Mitya , I shall go into a nunnery . 
No , I really shall one day . 
Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember all my life ... . 
Yes ... . 
But to-day let us dance . 
To-morrow to the nunnery , but to-day we 'll dance . 
I want to play to-day , good people , and what of it ? 
God will forgive us . 
If I were God , I 'd forgive everyone : ` My dear sinners , from this day forth I forgive you . ' 
I 'm going to beg forgiveness : ` Forgive me , good people , a silly wench . ' 
I 'm a beast , that 's what I am . 
But I want to pray . 
I gave a little onion . 
Wicked as I 've been , I want to pray . 
Mitya , let them dance , do n't stop them . 
Everyone in the world is good . 
Everyone - even the worst of them . 
The world 's a nice place . 
Though we 're bad the world 's all right . 
We 're good and bad , good and bad ... . 
Come , tell me , I 've something to ask you : come here everyone , and I 'll ask you : Why am I so good ? 
You know I am good . 
I 'm very good ... . 
Come , why am I so good ? '' 
So Grushenka babbled on , getting more and more drunk . 
At last she announced that she was going to dance , too . 
She got up from her chair , staggering . 
`` Mitya , do n't give me any more wine - if I ask you , do n't give it to me . 
Wine does n't give peace . 
Everything 's going round , the stove , and everything . 
I want to dance . 
Let everyone see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I dance ... '' She really meant it . 
She pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her pocket , and took it by one corner in her right hand , to wave it in the dance . 
Mitya ran to and fro , the girls were quiet , and got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal . 
Maximov , hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance , squealed with delight , and ran skipping about in front of her , humming : With legs so slim and sides so trim And its little tail curled tight . 
But Grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away . 
`` Sh-h ! 
Mitya , why do n't they come ? 
Let everyone come ... to look on . 
Call them in , too , that were locked in ... . 
Why did you lock them in ? 
Tell them I 'm going to dance . 
Let them look on , too ... '' Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door , and began knocking to the Poles with his fist . 
`` Hi , you ... Podvysotskis ! 
Come , she 's going to dance . 
She calls you . '' 
`` Lajdak ! '' 
one of the Poles shouted in reply . 
`` You 're a lajdak yourself ! 
You 're a little scoundrel , that 's what you are . '' 
`` Leave off laughing at Poland , '' said Kalganov sententiously . 
He too was drunk . 
`` Be quiet , boy ! 
If I call him a scoundrel , it does n't mean that I called all Poland so . 
One lajdak does n't make a Poland . 
Be quiet , my pretty boy , eat a sweetmeat . '' 
`` Ach , what fellows ! 
As though they were not men . 
Why wo n't they make friends ? '' 
said Grushenka , and went forward to dance . 
The chorus broke into `` Ah , my porch , my new porch ! '' 
Grushenka flung back her head , half opened her lips , smiled , waved her handkerchief , and suddenly , with a violent lurch , stood still in the middle of the room , looking bewildered . 
`` I 'm weak ... '' she said in an exhausted voice . 
`` Forgive me ... . 
I 'm weak , I ca n't ... . 
I 'm sorry . '' 
She bowed to the chorus , and then began bowing in all directions . 
`` I 'm sorry ... . 
Forgive me ... '' `` The lady 's been drinking . 
The pretty lady has been drinking , '' voices were heard saying . 
`` The lady 's drunk too much , '' Maximov explained to the girls , giggling . 
`` Mitya , lead me away ... take me , '' said Grushenka helplessly . 
Mitya pounced on her , snatched her up in his arms , and carried the precious burden through the curtains . 
`` Well , now I 'll go , '' thought Kalganov , and walking out of the blue room , he closed the two halves of the door after him . 
But the orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder . 
Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips . 
`` Do n't touch me ... '' she faltered , in an imploring voice . 
`` Do n't touch me , till I 'm yours ... . 
I 've told you I 'm yours , but do n't touch me ... spare me ... . 
With them here , with them close , you must n't . 
He 's here . 
It 's nasty here ... '' `` I 'll obey you ! 
I wo n't think of it ... I worship you ! '' 
muttered Mitya . 
`` Yes , it 's nasty here , it 's abominable . '' 
And still holding her in his arms , he sank on his knees by the bedside . 
`` I know , though you 're a brute , you 're generous , '' Grushenka articulated with difficulty . 
`` It must be honourable ... it shall be honourable for the future ... and let us be honest , let us be good , not brutes , but good ... take me away , take me far away , do you hear ? 
I do n't want it to be here , but far , far away ... '' `` Oh , yes , yes , it must be ! '' 
said Mitya , pressing her in his arms . 
`` I 'll take you and we 'll fly away ... . 
Oh , I 'd give my whole life for one year only to know about that blood ! '' 
`` What blood ? '' 
asked Grushenka , bewildered . 
`` Nothing , '' muttered Mitya , through his teeth . 
`` Grusha , you wanted to be honest , but I 'm a thief . 
But I 've stolen money from Katya ... . 
Disgrace , a disgrace ! '' 
`` From Katya , from that young lady ? 
No , you did n't steal it . 
Give it back to her , take it from me ... . 
Why make a fuss ? 
Now everything of mine is yours . 
What does money matter ? 
We shall waste it anyway ... . 
Folks like us are bound to waste money . 
But we 'd better go and work the land . 
I want to dig the earth with my own hands . 
We must work , do you hear ? 
Alyosha said so . 
I wo n't be your mistress , I 'll be faithful to you , I 'll be your slave , I 'll work for you . 
We 'll go to the young lady and bow down to her together , so that she may forgive us , and then we 'll go away . 
And if she wo n't forgive us , we 'll go , anyway . 
Take her money and love me ... . 
Do n't love her ... . 
Do n't love her any more . 
If you love her , I shall strangle her ... . 
I 'll put out both her eyes with a needle ... '' `` I love you . 
love only you . 
I 'll love you in Siberia ... '' `` Why Siberia ? 
Never mind , Siberia , if you like . 
I do n't care ... we 'll work ... there 's snow in Siberia ... . 
I love driving in the snow ... and must have bells ... . 
Do you hear , there 's a bell ringing ? 
Where is that bell ringing ? 
There are people coming ... . 
Now it 's stopped . '' 
She closed her eyes , exhausted , and suddenly fell asleep for an instant . 
There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance , but the ringing had ceased . 
Mitya let his head sink on her breast . 
He did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing , nor did he notice that the songs had ceased , and that instead of singing and drunken clamour there was absolute stillness in the house . 
Grushenka opened her eyes . 
`` What 's the matter ? 
Was I asleep ? 
Yes ... a bell ... I 've been asleep and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells , and I dozed . 
I was with someone I loved , with you . 
And far , far away . 
I was holding you and kissing you , nestling close to you . 
I was cold , and the snow glistened ... . 
You know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines . 
It was as though I was not on earth . 
I woke up , and my dear one is close to me . 
How sweet that is ! 
... '' `` Close to you , '' murmured Mitya , kissing her dress , her bosom , her hands . 
And suddenly he had a strange fancy : it seemed to him that she was looking straight before her , not at him , not into his face , but over his head , with an intent , almost uncanny fixity . 
An expression of wonder , almost of alarm , came suddenly into her face . 
`` Mitya , who is that looking at us ? '' 
she whispered . 
Mitya turned , and saw that someone had , in fact , parted the curtains and seemed to be watching them . 
And not one person alone , it seemed . 
He jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder . 
`` Here , come to us , come here , '' said a voice , speaking not loudly , but firmly and peremptorily . 
Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still . 
The room was filled with people , but not those who had been there before . 
An instantaneous shiver ran down his back , and he shuddered . 
He recognised all those people instantly . 
That tall , stout old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade - was the police captain , Mihail Makarovitch . 
And that `` consumptive-looking '' trim dandy , `` who always has such polished boots '' - that was the deputy prosecutor . 
`` He has a chronometer worth four hundred roubles ; he showed it to me . '' 
And that small young man in spectacles ... . 
Mitya forgot his surname though he knew him , had seen him : he was the `` investigating lawyer , '' from the `` school of jurisprudence , '' who had only lately come to the town . 
And this man - the inspector of police , Mavriky Mavrikyevitch , a man he knew well . 
And those fellows with the brass plates on , why are they here ? 
And those other two ... peasants ... . 
And there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch ... `` Gentlemen ! 
What 's this for , gentlemen ? '' 
began Mitya , but suddenly , as though beside himself , not knowing what he was doing , he cried aloud , at the top of his voice : `` I un-der-stand ! '' 
The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly , and stepping up to Mitya , began with dignity , though hurriedly : `` We have to make ... in brief , I beg you to come this way , this way to the sofa ... . 
It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation . '' 
`` The old man ! '' 
cried Mitya frantically . 
`` The old man and his blood ! 
... I understand . '' 
And he sank , almost fell , on a chair close by , as though he had been mown down by a scythe . 
`` You understand ? 
He understands it ! 
Monster and parricide ! 
Your father 's blood cries out against you ! '' 
the old captain of police roared suddenly , stepping up to Mitya . 
He was beside himself , crimson in the face and quivering all over . 
`` This is impossible ! '' 
cried the small young man . 
`` Mihail Makarovitch , Mihail Makarovitch , this wo n't do ! 
... I beg you 'll allow me to speak . 
I should never have expected such behaviour from you ... '' `` This is delirium , gentlemen , raving delirium , '' cried the captain of police ; `` look at him : drunk , at this time of night , in the company of a disreputable woman , with the blood of his father on his hands ... . 
It 's delirium ! 
... '' `` I beg you most earnestly , dear Mihail Makarovitch , to restrain your feelings , '' the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police captain , `` or I shall be forced to resort to - '' But the little lawyer did not allow him to finish . 
He turned to Mitya , and delivered himself in a loud , firm , dignified voice : `` Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov , it is my duty to inform you that you are charged with the murder of your father , Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov , perpetrated this night ... '' He said something more , and the prosecutor , too , put in something , but though Mitya heard them he did not understand them . 
He stared at them all with wild eyes . 
The Preliminary Investigation The Beginning of Perhotin 's Official Career PYOTR ILYITCH PERHOTIN , whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates of the widow Morozov 's house , ended , of course , by making himself heard . 
Fenya , who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before , and too much `` upset '' to go to bed , was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the furious knocking at the gate . 
Though she had herself seen him drive away , she fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking again , no one else could knock so savagely . 
She ran to the house-porter , who had already waked up and gone out to the gate , and began imploring him not to open it . 
But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch , and learned that he wanted to see Fenya on very `` important business , '' the man made up his mind at last to open . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya 's kitchen , but the girl begged him to allow the houseporter to be present , `` because of her misgivings . '' 
He began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital fact , that is , that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for Grushenka , he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar , and that when he returned , the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with blood . 
`` And the blood was simply flowing , dripping from him , dripping ! '' 
Fenya kept exclaiming . 
This horrible detail was simply the product of her disordered imagination . 
But although not `` dripping , '' Pyotr Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood , and had helped to wash them . 
Moreover , the question he had to decide was , not how soon the blood had dried , but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle , or rather , whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's , and how he could satisfactorily ascertain . 
Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point , and though he found out nothing conclusive , yet he carried away a conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his father 's house , and that , therefore , something must have happened there . 
`` And when he came back , '' Fenya added with excitement . 
`` I told him the whole story , and then I began asking him , ` Why have you got blood on your hands , Dmitri Fyodorovitch ? ' 
and he answered that that was human blood , and that he had just killed someone . 
He confessed it all to me , and suddenly ran off like a madman . 
I sat down and began thinking , where 's he run off to now like a madman ? 
He 'll go to Mokroe , I thought , and kill my mistress there . 
I ran out to beg him not to kill her . 
I was running to his lodgings , but I looked at Plotnikov 's shop , and saw him just setting off , and there was no blood on his hands then . '' 
-LRB- Fenya had noticed this and remembered it . -RRB- 
Fenya 's old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far as she was capable . 
After asking some further questions , Pyotr Ilyitch left the house , even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it . 
The most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to go straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's , to find out whether anything had happened there , and if so , what ; and only to go to the police captain , as Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing , when he had satisfied himself of the fact . 
But the night was dark , Fyodor Pavlovitch 's gates were strong , and he would have to knock again . 
His acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of the slightest , and what if , after he had been knocking , they opened to him , and nothing had happened ? 
Fyodor Pavlovitch in his jeering way would go telling the story all over the town , how a stranger , called Perhotin , had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if anyone had killed him . 
It would make a scandal . 
And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world . 
Yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong , that though he stamped his foot angrily and swore at himself , he set off again , not to Fyodor Pavlovitch 's but to Madame Hohlakov 's . 
He decided that if she denied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles , he would go straight to the police captain , but if she admitted having given him the money , he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning . 
It is , of course , perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of causing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night to a fashionable lady , a complete stranger , and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her an amazing question , than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch . 
But that is just how it is , sometimes , especially in cases like the present one , with the decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people . 
Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means phlegmatic at that moment . 
He remembered all his life how a haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him , growing more and more painful and driving him on , against his will . 
Yet he kept cursing himself , of course , all the way for going to this lady , but `` I will get to the bottom of it , I will ! '' 
he repeated for the tenth time , grinding his teeth , and he carried out his intention . 
It was exactly eleven o'clock when he entered Madame Hohlakov 's house . 
He was admitted into the yard pretty quickly , but , in response to his inquiry whether the lady was still up , the porter could give no answer , except that she was usually in bed by that time . 
`` Ask at the top of the stairs . 
If the lady wants to receive you , she 'll receive you . 
If she wo n't , she wo n't . '' 
Pyotr Ilyitch went up , but did not find things so easy here . 
The footman was unwilling to take in his name , but finally called a maid . 
Pyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that an official , living in the town , called Perhotin , had called on particular business , and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would not have ventured to come . 
`` Tell her in those words , in those words exactly , '' he asked the girl . 
She went away . 
He remained waiting in the entry . 
Madame Hohlakov herself was already in her bedroom , though not yet asleep . 
She had felt upset ever since Mitya 's visit , and had a presentiment that she would not get through the night without the sick headache which always , with her , followed such excitement . 
She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid . 
She irritably declined to see him , however , though the unexpected visit at such an hour , of an `` official living in the town , '' who was a total stranger , roused her feminine curiosity intensely . 
But this time Pyotr Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule . 
He begged the maid most earnestly to take another message in these very words : `` That he had come on business of the greatest importance , and that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later , if she refused to see him now . '' 
`` I plunged headlong , '' he described it afterwards . 
The maid , gazing at him in amazement , went to take his message again . 
Madame Hohlakov was impressed . 
She thought a little , asked what he looked like , and learned that he was very well dressed , young , and so polite . '' 
We may note , parenthetically , that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking young man , and well aware of the fact . 
Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him . 
She was in her dressing-gown and slippers , but she flung a black shawl over her shoulders . 
`` The official '' was asked to walk into the drawing-room , the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly before . 
The lady came to meet her visitor , with a sternly inquiring countenance , and , without asking him to sit down , began at once with the question : `` What do you want ? '' 
`` I have ventured to disturb you , madam , on a matter concerning our common acquaintance , Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov , '' Perhotin began . 
But he had hardly uttered the name , when the lady 's face showed signs of acute irritation . 
She almost shrieked , and interrupted him in a fury : `` How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man ? '' 
she cried hysterically . 
`` How dare you , sir , how could you venture to disturb a lady who is a stranger to you , in her own house at such an hour ! 
... And to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here , to this very drawing-room , only three hours ago , to murder me , and went stamping out of the room , as no one would go out of a decent house . 
Let me tell you , sir , that I shall lodge a complaint against you , that I will not let it pass . 
Kindly leave me at once ... I am a mother ... . 
I. . . 
I - '' `` Murder ! 
then he tried to murder you , too ? '' 
`` Why , has he killed somebody else ? '' 
Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively . 
`` If you would kindly listen , madam , for half a moment , I 'll explain it all in a couple of words , '' answered Perhotin , firmly . 
`` At five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me , and I know for a fact he had no money . 
Yet at nine o'clock , he came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his hand , about two or three thousand roubles . 
His hands and face were all covered with blood , and he looked like a madman . 
When I asked him where he had got so much money , he answered that he had just received it from you , that you had given him a sum of three thousand to go to the gold mines ... '' Madame Hohlakov 's face assumed an expression of intense and painful excitement . 
`` Good God ! 
He must have killed his old father ! '' 
she cried , clasping her hands . 
`` I have never given him money , never !
