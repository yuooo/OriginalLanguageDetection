Princess Mary 's embarrassment on her people 's account was quite unnecessary . 
They were not in the least abashed . 
The old woman , lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers , had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it , and sat quietly in her armchair , though hoping to be offered another cup of tea . 
Ivanushka , sipping out of her saucer , looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men . 
`` Where have you been ? 
To Kiev ? '' 
Prince Andrew asked the old woman . 
`` I have , good sir , '' she answered garrulously . 
`` Just at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint . 
And now I 'm from Kolyazin , master , where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed . '' 
`` And was Ivanushka with you ? '' 
`` I go by myself , benefactor , '' said Ivanushka , trying to speak in a bass voice . 
`` I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo ... '' Pelageya interrupted her companion ; she evidently wished to tell what she had seen . 
`` In Kolyazin , master , a wonderful blessing has been revealed . '' 
`` What is it ? 
Some new relics ? '' 
asked Prince Andrew . 
`` Andrew , do leave off , '' said Princess Mary . 
`` Do n't tell him , Pelageya . '' 
`` No ... why not , my dear , why should n't I ? 
I like him . 
He is kind , he is one of God 's chosen , he 's a benefactor , he once gave me ten rubles , I remember . 
When I was in Kiev , Crazy Cyril says to me -LRB- he 's one of God 's own and goes barefoot summer and winter -RRB- , he says , ` Why are you not going to the right place ? 
Go to Kolyazin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed . ' 
On hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went . '' 
All were silent , only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones , drawing in her breath . 
`` So I come , master , and the people say to me : ' A great blessing has been revealed , holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother , the Holy Virgin Mother of God ' ... '' `` All right , all right , you can tell us afterwards , '' said Princess Mary , flushing . 
`` Let me ask her , '' said Pierre . 
`` Did you see it yourselves ? '' 
he inquired . 
`` Oh , yes , master , I was found worthy . 
Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven , and from the blessed Mother 's cheek it drops and drops ... '' `` But , dear me , that must be a fraud ! '' 
said Pierre , naively , who had listened attentively to the pilgrim . 
`` Oh , master , what are you saying ? '' 
exclaimed the horrified Pelageya , turning to Princess Mary for support . 
`` They impose on the people , '' he repeated . 
`` Lord Jesus Christ ! '' 
exclaimed the pilgrim woman , crossing herself . 
`` Oh , do n't speak so , master ! 
There was a general who did not believe , and said , ` The monks cheat , ' and as soon as he 'd said it he went blind . 
And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said , ` Believe in me and I will make you whole . ' 
So he begged : ` Take me to her , take me to her . ' 
It 's the real truth I 'm telling you , I saw it myself . 
So he was brought , quite blind , straight to her , and he goes up to her and falls down and says , ` Make me whole , ' says he , ` and I 'll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me . ' 
I saw it myself , master , the star is fixed into the icon . 
Well , and what do you think ? 
He received his sight ! 
It 's a sin to speak so . 
God will punish you , '' she said admonishingly , turning to Pierre . 
`` How did the star get into the icon ? '' 
Pierre asked . 
`` And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general ? '' 
said Prince Andrew , with a smile . 
Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands . 
`` Oh , master , master , what a sin ! 
And you who have a son ! '' 
she began , her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red . 
`` Master , what have you said ? 
God forgive you ! '' 
And she crossed herself . 
`` Lord forgive him ! 
My dear , what does it mean ? 
... '' she asked , turning to Princess Mary . 
She got up and , almost crying , began to arrange her wallet . 
She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said , and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house . 
`` Now , why need you do it ? '' 
said Princess Mary . 
`` Why did you come to me ? 
... '' `` Come , Pelageya , I was joking , '' said Pierre . 
`` Princesse , ma parole , je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser . 
* I did not mean anything , I was only joking , '' he said , smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense . 
`` It was all my fault , and Andrew was only joking . '' 
* `` Princess , on my word , I did not wish to offend her . '' 
Pelageya stopped doubtfully , but in Pierre 's face there was such a look of sincere penitence , and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre , that she was gradually reassured . 
The pilgrim woman was appeased and , being encouraged to talk , gave a long account of Father Amphilochus , who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense , and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs , and how she , taking some dried bread with her , had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints . 
`` I 'd pray awhile to one , ponder awhile , then go on to another . 
I 'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics , and there was such peace all around , such blessedness , that one do n't want to come out , even into the light of heaven again . '' 
Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously . 
Prince Andrew went out of the room , and then , leaving `` God 's folk '' to finish their tea , Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room . 
`` You are very kind , '' she said to him . 
`` Oh , I really did not mean to hurt her feelings . 
I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them . '' 
Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately . 
`` I have known you a long time , you see , and am as fond of you as of a brother , '' she said . 
`` How do you find Andrew ? '' 
she added hurriedly , not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words . 
`` I am very anxious about him . 
His health was better in the winter , but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure . 
And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually . 
He has not a character like us women who , when we suffer , can weep away our sorrows . 
He keeps it all within him . 
Today he is cheerful and in good spirits , but that is the effect of your visit -- he is not often like that . 
If you could persuade him to go abroad . 
He needs activity , and this quiet regular life is very bad for him . 
Others do n't notice it , but I see it . '' 
Toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door , hearing the bells of the old prince 's carriage approaching . 
Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch . 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
asked the old prince , noticing Pierre as he got out of , the carriage . 
`` Ah ! 
Very glad ! 
Kiss me , '' he said , having learned who the young stranger was . 
The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre . 
Before supper , Prince Andrew , coming back to his father 's study , found him disputing hotly with his visitor . 
Pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars . 
The old prince disputed it chaffingly , but without getting angry . 
`` Drain the blood from men 's veins and put in water instead , then there will be no more war ! 
Old women 's nonsense -- old women 's nonsense ! '' 
he repeated , but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder , and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew , evidently not wishing to join in the conversation , was looking over the papers his father had brought from town . 
The old prince went up to him and began to talk business . 
`` The marshal , a Count Rostov , has n't sent half his contingent . 
He came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner -- I gave him a pretty dinner ! 
... And there , look at this ... . 
Well , my boy , '' the old prince went on , addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder . 
`` A fine fellow -- your friend -- I like him ! 
He stirs me up . 
Another says clever things and one does n't care to listen , but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up . 
Well , go ! 
Get along ! 
Perhaps I 'll come and sit with you at supper . 
We 'll have another dispute . 
Make friends with my little fool , Princess Mary , '' he shouted after Pierre , through the door . 
Only now , on his visit to Bald Hills , did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew . 
That charm was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and with the household . 
With the stern old prince and the gentle , timid Princess Mary , though he had scarcely known them , Pierre at once felt like an old friend . 
They were all fond of him already . 
Not only Princess Mary , who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims , gave him her most radiant looks , but even the one-year-old `` Prince Nicholas '' -LRB- as his grandfather called him -RRB- smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms , and Michael Ivanovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince . 
The old prince came in to supper ; this was evidently on Pierre 's account . 
And during the two days of the young man 's visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again . 
When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together , they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left , but as seldom happens , no one said anything but what was good of him . 
When returning from his leave , Rostov felt , for the first time , how close was the bond that united him to Denisov and and the whole regiment . 
On approaching it , Rostov felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow . 
When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment , when he recognized red-haired Dementyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses , when Lavrushka gleefully shouted to his master , `` The count has come ! '' 
and Denisov , who had been asleep on his bed , ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him , and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival , Rostov experienced the same feeling his mother , his father , and his sister had embraced him , and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak . 
The regiment was also a home , and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents ' house . 
When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron , had been on duty and had gone out foraging , when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow , unchanging frame , he experienced the same sense of peace , of moral support , and the same sense being at home here in his own place , as he had felt under the parental roof . 
But here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large , where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions ; here was no Sonya with whom he ought , or ought not , to have an explanation ; here was no possibility of going there or not going there ; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways ; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another ; there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father , and nothing to recall that terrible loss to Dolokhov . 
Here , in the regiment , all was clear and simple . 
The whole world was divided into two unequal parts : one , our Pavlograd regiment ; the other , all the rest . 
And the rest was no concern of his . 
In the regiment , everything was definite : who was lieutenant , who captain , who was a good fellow , who a bad one , and most of all , who was a comrade . 
The canteenkeeper gave one credit , one 's pay came every four months , there was nothing to think out or decide , you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and , when given an order , to do what was clearly , distinctly , and definitely ordered -- and all would be well . 
Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life , Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest . 
Life in the regiment , during this campaign , was all the pleasanter for him , because , after his loss to Dolokhov -LRB- for which , in spite of all his family 's efforts to console him , he could not forgive himself -RRB- , he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving , not as he had done before , but really well , and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer -- in a word , a splendid man altogether , a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world , but so possible in the regiment . 
After his losses , he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years . 
He received ten thousand rubles a year , but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents . 
Our army , after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau , was concentrated near Bartenstein . 
It was awaiting the Emperor 's arrival and the beginning of a new campaign . 
The Pavlograd regiment , belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign , had been recruiting up to strength in Russia , and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign . 
It had been neither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and , when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign , was attached to Platov 's division . 
Platov 's division was acting independently of the main army . 
Several times parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy , had taken prisoners , and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot 's carriages . 
In April the Pavlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village . 
A thaw had set in , it was muddy and cold , the ice on the river broke , and the roads became impassable . 
For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued . 
As no transports could arrive , the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages , searching for potatoes , but found few even of these . 
Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled -- if any remained , they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them ; even the soldiers , usually pitiless enough , instead of taking anything from them , often gave them the last of their rations . 
The Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action , but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness . 
In the hospitals , death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever , or the swelling that came from bad food , preferred to remain on duty , and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals . 
When spring came on , the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus , which , for some reason , they called `` Mashka 's sweet root . '' 
It was very bitter , but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it , though they were ordered not to do so , as it was a noxious plant . 
That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers , a swelling of the arms , legs , and face , which the doctors attributed to eating this root . 
But in spite of all this , the soldiers of Denisov 's squadron fed chiefly on `` Mashka 's sweet root , '' because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen . 
The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin , though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair . 
Despite this destitution , the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual . 
Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms , the hussars formed line for roll call , kept things in order , groomed their horses , polished their arms , brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder , and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry , joking about their nasty food and their hunger . 
As usual , in their spare time , they lit bonfires , steamed themselves before them naked ; smoked , picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes , told and listened to stories of Potemkin 's and Suvorov 's campaigns , or to legends of Alesha the Sly , or the priest 's laborer Mikolka . 
The officers , as usual , lived in twos and threes in the roofless , half-ruined houses . 
The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and , in general , food for the men . 
The younger ones occupied themselves as before , some playing cards -LRB- there was plenty of money , though there was no food -RRB- , some with more innocent games , such as quoits and skittles . 
The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of , partly because nothing certain was known about it , partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly . 
Rostov lived , as before , with Denisov , and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever . 
Denisov never spoke of Rostov 's family , but by the tender friendship his commander showed him , Rostov felt that the elder hussar 's luckless love for Natasha played a part in strengthening their friendship . 
Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostov to danger as seldom as possible , and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy . 
On one of his foraging expeditions , in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions , Rostov found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms . 
They were half clad , hungry , too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance . 
Rostov brought them to his quarters , placed them in his own lodging , and kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering . 
One of his comrades , talking of women , began chaffing Rostov , saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved . 
Rostov took the joke as an insult , flared up , and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent a duel . 
When the officer had gone away , Denisov , who did not himself know what Rostov 's relations with the Polish girl might be , began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper , and Rostov replied : `` Say what you like ... . 
She is like a sister to me , and I ca n't tell you how it offended me ... because ... well , for that reason ... '' Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at Rostov , as was his way at moments of deep feeling . 
`` Ah , what a mad bweed you Wostovs are ! '' 
he muttered , and Rostov noticed tears in his eyes . 
In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor 's arrival , but Rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein , as the Pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place . 
They were bivouacking . 
Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut , dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf . 
The hut was made in the following manner , which had then come into vogue . 
A trench was dug three and a half feet wide , four feet eight inches deep , and eight feet long . 
At one end of the trench , steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule . 
The trench itself was the room , in which the lucky ones , such as the squadron commander , had a board , lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance , to serve as a table . 
On each side of the trench , the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet , and this did duty for bedsteads and couches . 
The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table . 
Denisov , who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him , had also a board in the roof at the farther end , with a piece of -LRB- broken but mended -RRB- glass in it for a window . 
When it was very cold , embers from the soldiers ' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the `` reception room '' -- as Denisov called that part of the hut - and it was then so warm that the officers , of whom there were always some with Denisov and Rostov , sat in their shirt sleeves . 
In April , Rostov was on orderly duty . 
One morning , between seven and eight , returning after a sleepless night , he sent for embers , changed his rain-soaked underclothes , said his prayers , drank tea , got warm , then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner , and , his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt , lay down on his back , putting his arms under his head . 
He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition , and was awaiting Denisov , who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk . 
Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut , evidently much excited . 
Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to , and saw the quartermaster , Topcheenko . 
`` I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff ! '' 
Denisov was shouting . 
`` And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields . '' 
`` I have given the order again and again , your honor , but they do n't obey , '' answered the quartermaster . 
Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently : `` Let him fuss and bustle now , my job 's done and I 'm lying down -- capitally ! '' 
He could hear that Lavrushka -- that sly , bold orderly of Denisov 's -- was talking , as well as the quartermaster . 
Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons , biscuits , and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions . 
Then Denisov 's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away . 
`` Saddle ! 
Second platoon ! '' 
`` Where are they off to now ? '' 
thought Rostov . 
Five minutes later , Denisov came into the hut , climbed with muddy boots on the bed , lit his pipe , furiously scattered his things about , took his leaded whip , buckled on his saber , and went out again . 
In answer to Rostov 's inquiry where he was going , he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business . 
`` Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards ! '' 
said Denisov going out , and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud . 
He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone . 
Having got warm in his corner , he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening . 
Denisov had not yet returned . 
The weather had cleared up , and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka , laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud . 
Rostov joined them . 
In the middle of the game , the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them . 
The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them . 
`` There now , Denisov has been worrying , '' said Rostov , `` and here are the provisions . '' 
`` So they are ! '' 
said the officers . 
`` Wo n't the soldiers be glad ! '' 
A little behind the hussars came Denisov , accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking . 
Rostov went to meet them . 
`` I warn you , Captain , '' one of the officers , a short thin man , evidently very angry , was saying . 
`` Have n't I told you I wo n't give them up ? '' 
replied Denisov . 
`` You will answer for it , Captain . 
It is mutiny -- seizing the transport of one 's own army . 
Our men have had nothing to eat for two days . '' 
`` And mine have had nothing for two weeks , '' said Denisov . 
`` It is robbery ! 
You 'll answer for it , sir ! '' 
said the infantry officer , raising his voice . 
`` Now , what are you pestewing me for ? '' 
cried Denisov , suddenly losing his temper . 
`` I shall answer for it and not you , and you 'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt . 
Be off ! 
Go ! '' 
he shouted at the officers . 
`` Very well , then ! '' 
shouted the little officer , undaunted and not riding away . 
`` If you are determined to rob , I 'll ... '' `` Go to the devil ! 
quick ma ` ch , while you 're safe and sound ! '' 
and Denisov turned his horse on the officer . 
`` Very well , very well ! '' 
muttered the officer , threateningly , and turning his horse he trotted away , jolting in his saddle . 
`` A dog astwide a fence ! 
A weal dog astwide a fence ! '' 
shouted Denisov after him -LRB- the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman -RRB- and riding up to Rostov , he burst out laughing . 
`` I 've taken twansports from the infantwy by force ! '' 
he said . 
`` After all , ca n't let our men starve . '' 
The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment , but learning from Lavrushka that the transport was unescorted , Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force . 
The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely , and they even shared them with the other squadrons . 
The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov , and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said : `` This is how I look at this affair : I know nothing about it and wo n't begin proceedings , but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received . 
If not , as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment , there will be a row and the affair may end badly . '' 
From the regimental commander 's , Denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice . 
In the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in . 
Denisov could not speak and gasped for breath . 
When Rostov asked what was the matter , he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse , feeble voice . 
Alarmed at Denisov 's condition , Rostov suggested that he should undress , drink some water , and send for the doctor . 
`` Twy me for wobbewy ... oh ! 
Some more water ... Let them twy me , but I 'll always thwash scoundwels ... and I 'll tell the Empewo ' ... Ice ... '' he muttered . 
The regimental doctor , when he came , said it was absolutely necessary to bleed Denisov . 
A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him . 
`` I get there , '' began Denisov . '' 
` Now then , where 's your chief 's quarters ? ' 
They were pointed out . 
` Please to wait . ' 
` I 've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait . 
Announce me . ' 
Vewy well , so out comes their head chief -- also took it into his head to lecture me : ` It 's wobbewy ! ' 
-- ` Wobbewy , ' I say , ` is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers , but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets ! ' 
` Will you please be silent ? ' 
` Vewy good ! ' 
Then he says : ` Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner , but your affair will be passed on to headquarters . ' 
I go to the commissioner . 
I enter , and at the table ... who do you think ? 
No , but wait a bit ! 
... Who is it that 's starving us ? '' 
shouted Denisov , hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about . 
`` Telyanin ! 
` What ? 
So it 's you who 's starving us to death ! 
Is it ? 
Take this and this ! ' 
and I hit him so pat , stwaight on his snout ... ` Ah , what a. . . 
what ... ! ' 
and I sta ` ted fwashing him ... Well , I 've had a bit of fun I can tell you ! '' 
cried Denisov , gleeful and yet angry , his showing under his black mustache . 
`` I 'd have killed him if they had n't taken him away ! '' 
`` But what are you shouting for ? 
Calm yourself , '' said Rostov . 
`` You 've set your arm bleeding afresh . 
Wait , we must tie it up again . '' 
Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed . 
Next day he woke calm and cheerful . 
But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov 's and Denisov 's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday 's occurrence . 
The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn : that a court-martial had been appointed , and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded , degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for . 
The case , as represented by the offended parties , was that , after seizing the transports , Major Denisov , being drunk , went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief , threatened to strike him , and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing , and dislocated the arm of one of them . 
In answer to Rostov 's renewed questions , Denisov said , laughing , that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it , but that it was all nonsense and rubbish , and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial , and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget . 
Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter , but Rostov knew him too well not to detect that -LRB- while hiding it from others -RRB- at heart he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair , which was evidently taking a bad turn . 
Every day , letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived , and on the first of May , Denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office . 
On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars . 
Denisov , as was his wont , rode out in front of the outposts , parading his courage . 
A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg . 
Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound , but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital . 
In June the battle of Friedland was fought , in which the Pavlograds did not take part , and after that an armistice was proclaimed . 
Rostov , who felt his friend 's absence very much , having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs , took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denisov in hospital . 
The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated by Russian and French troops . 
Because it was summer , when it is so beautiful out in the fields , the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences , its foul streets , tattered inhabitants , and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about . 
The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces . 
Several bandaged soldiers , with pale swollen faces , were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard . 
Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air . 
On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar . 
The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant . 
`` I ca n't tear myself to pieces , '' the doctor was saying . 
`` Come to Makar Alexeevich in the evening . 
I shall be there . '' 
The assistant asked some further questions . 
`` Oh , do the best you can ! 
Is n't it all the same ? '' 
The doctor noticed Rostov coming upstairs . 
`` What do you want , sir ? '' 
said the doctor . 
`` What do you want ? 
The bullets having spared you , do you want to try typhus ? 
This is a pesthouse , sir . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
asked Rostov . 
`` Typhus , sir . 
It 's death to go in . 
Only we two , Makeev and I '' -LRB- he pointed to the assistant -RRB- , `` keep on here . 
Some five of us doctors have died in this place ... . 
When a new one comes he is done for in a week , '' said the doctor with evident satisfaction . 
`` Prussian doctors have been invited here , but our allies do n't like it at all . '' 
Rostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars , who was wounded . 
`` I do n't know . 
I ca n't tell you , sir . 
Only think ! 
I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients ! 
It 's well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost ! '' 
he laughed . 
`` Four hundred , sir , and they 're always sending me fresh ones . 
There are four hundred ? 
Eh ? '' 
he asked , turning to the assistant . 
The assistant looked fagged out . 
He was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go . 
`` Major Denisov , '' Rostov said again . 
`` He was wounded at Molliten . '' 
`` Dead , I fancy . 
Eh , Makeev ? '' 
queried the doctor , in a tone of indifference . 
The assistant , however , did not confirm the doctor 's words . 
`` Is he tall and with reddish hair ? '' 
asked the doctor . 
Rostov described Denisov 's appearance . 
`` There was one like that , '' said the doctor , as if pleased . 
`` That one is dead , I fancy . 
However , I 'll look up our list . 
We had a list . 
Have you got it , Makeev ? '' 
`` Makar Alexeevich has the list , '' answered the assistant . 
`` But if you 'll step into the officers ' wards you 'll see for yourself , '' he added , turning to Rostov . 
`` Ah , you 'd better not go , sir , '' said the doctor , `` or you may have to stay here yourself . '' 
But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way . 
`` Only do n't blame me ! '' 
the doctor shouted up after him . 
Rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor . 
The smell was so strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on . 
A door opened to the right , and an emaciated sallow man on crutches , barefoot and in underclothing , limped out and , leaning against the doorpost , looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing . 
Glancing in at the door , Rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats . 
`` May I go in and look ? '' 
`` What is there to see ? '' 
said the assistant . 
But , just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in , Rostov entered the soldiers ' ward . 
The foul air , to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor , was still stronger here . 
It was a little different , more pungent , and one felt that this was where it originated . 
In the long room , brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows , the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls , and leaving a passage in the middle . 
Most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers . 
Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces , and all looked intently at Rostov with the same expression of hope , of relief , reproach , and envy of another 's health . 
Rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there . 
He stood still , looking silently around . 
He had not at all expected such a sight . 
Just before him , almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor , lay a sick man , probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair . 
The man lay on his back , his huge arms and legs outstretched . 
His face was purple , his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen , and on his bare legs and arms which were still red , the veins stood out like cords . 
He was knocking the back of his head against the floor , hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating . 
Rostov listened and made out the word . 
It was `` drink , drink , a drink ! '' 
Rostov glanced round , looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water . 
`` Who looks after the sick here ? '' 
he asked the assistant . 
Just then a commissariat soldier , a hospital orderly , came in from the next room , marching stiffly , and drew up in front of Rostov . 
`` Good day , your honor ! '' 
he shouted , rolling his eyes at Rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities . 
`` Get him to his place and give him some water , '' said Rostov , pointing to the Cossack . 
`` Yes , your honor , '' the soldier replied complacently , and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter , but did not move . 
`` No , it 's impossible to do anything here , '' thought Rostov , lowering his eyes , and he was going out , but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right , and he turned . 
Close to the corner , on an overcoat , sat an old , unshaven , gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton , with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostov . 
The man 's neighbor on one side whispered something to him , pointing at Rostov , who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him . 
He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him , the other had been amputated above the knee . 
His neighbor on the other side , who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back , was a young soldier with a snub nose . 
His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back . 
Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back . 
`` Why , this one seems ... '' he began , turning to the assistant . 
`` And how we 've been begging , your honor , '' said the old soldier , his jaw quivering . 
`` He 's been dead since morning . 
After all we 're men , not dogs . '' 
`` I 'll send someone at once . 
He shall be taken away -- taken away at once , '' said the assistant hurriedly . 
`` Let us go , your honor . '' 
`` Yes , yes , let us go , '' said Rostov hastily , and lowering his eyes and shrinking , he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him , and went out of the room . 
Going along the corridor , the assistant led Rostov to the officers ' wards , consisting of three rooms , the doors of which stood open . 
There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them . 
Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns . 
The first person Rostov met in the officers ' ward was a thin little man with one arm , who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown , with a pipe between his teeth . 
Rostov looked at him , trying to remember where he had seen him before . 
`` See where we 've met again ! '' 
said the little man . 
`` Tushin , Tushin , do n't you remember , who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern ? 
And I 've had a bit cut off , you see ... '' he went on with a smile , pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown . 
`` Looking for Vasili Dmitrich Denisov ? 
My neighbor , '' he added , when he heard who Rostov wanted . 
`` Here , here , '' and Tushin led him into the next room , from whence came sounds of several laughing voices . 
`` How can they laugh , or even live at all here ? '' 
thought Rostov , still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers ' ward , and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides , and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back . 
Denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket , though it was nearly noon . 
`` Ah , Wostov ? 
How are you , how are you ? '' 
he called out , still in the same voice as in the regiment , but Rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new , sinister , hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of Denisov 's face and the intonations of his voice . 
His wound , though a slight one , had not yet healed even now , six weeks after he had been hit . 
His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients , but it was not this that struck Rostov . 
What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him , and smiled at him unnaturally . 
He did not ask about the regiment , nor about the general state of affairs , and when Rostov spoke of these matters did not listen . 
Rostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment , or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital . 
He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers . 
On Rostov 's inquiry as to how the matter stood , he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it . 
He became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew Rostov 's attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies . 
His hospital companions , who had gathered round Rostov -- a fresh arrival from the world outside - gradually began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading his answer . 
Rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it . 
Only the man who had the next bed , a stout Uhlan , continued to sit on his bed , gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe , and little one-armed Tushin still listened , shaking his head disapprovingly . 
In the middle of the reading , the Uhlan interrupted Denisov . 
`` But what I say is , '' he said , turning to Rostov , `` it would be best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon . 
They say great rewards will now be distributed , and surely a pardon would be granted ... '' `` Me petition the Empewo ' ! '' 
exclaimed Denisov , in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire , but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence . 
`` What for ? 
If I were a wobber I would ask mercy , but I 'm being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book . 
Let them twy me , I 'm not afwaid of anyone . 
I 've served the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen ! 
And am I to be degwaded ? 
... Listen , I 'm w ` iting to them stwaight . 
This is what I say : ` If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy ... ' '' `` It 's certainly well written , '' said Tushin , `` but that 's not the point , Vasili Dmitrich , '' and he also turned to Rostov . 
`` One has to submit , and Vasili Dmitrich does n't want to . 
You know the auditor told you it was a bad business . '' 
`` Well , let it be bad , '' said Denisov . 
`` The auditor wrote out a petition for you , '' continued Tushin , `` and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it . 
No doubt he '' -LRB- indicating Rostov -RRB- `` has connections on the staff . 
You wo n't find a better opportunity . '' 
`` Have n't I said I 'm not going to gwovel ? '' 
Denisov interrupted him , went on reading his paper . 
Rostov had not the courage to persuade Denisov , though he instinctively felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other officers was the safest , and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denisov . 
He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper . 
When the reading of Denisov 's virulent reply , which took more than an hour , was over , Rostov said nothing , and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov 's hospital comrades , who had round him , telling them what he knew and listening to their stories . 
Denisov was moodily silent all the evening . 
Late in the evening , when Rostov was about to leave , he asked Denisov whether he had no commission for him . 
`` Yes , wait a bit , '' said Denisov , glancing round at the officers , and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window , where he had an inkpot , and sat down to write . 
`` It seems it 's no use knocking one 's head against a wall ! '' 
he said , coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope . 
In it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor , in which Denisov , without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials , simply asked for pardon . 
`` Hand it in . 
It seems ... '' He did not finish , but gave a painfully unnatural smile . 
Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of Denisov 's affairs , Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor . 
On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in Tilsit . 
Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance , to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit . 
`` I should like to see the great man , '' he said , alluding to Napoleon , whom hitherto he , like everyone else , had always called Buonaparte . 
`` You are speaking of Buonaparte ? '' 
asked the general , smiling . 
Boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested . 
`` I am speaking , Prince , of the Emperor Napoleon , '' he replied . 
The general patted him on the shoulder , with a smile . 
`` You will go far , '' he said , and took him to Tilsit with him . 
Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two Emperors met . 
He saw the raft , decorated with monograms , saw Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river , saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon 's arrival , saw both Emperors get into boats , and saw how Napoleon - reaching the raft first -- stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him , and how they both retired into the pavilion . 
Since he had begun to move in the highest circles Boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down . 
At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore , and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages . 
At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch , and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out . 
The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes . 
He noted this down that same evening , among other facts he felt to be of historic importance . 
As the Emperor 's suite was a very small one , it was a matter of great importance , for a man who valued his success in the service , to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors , and having succeeded in this , Boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured . 
He had not only become known , but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him . 
Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself , so that the latter knew his face , and all those at court , far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer , would now have been surprised had he been absent . 
Boris lodged with another adjutant , the Polish Count Zhilinski . 
Zhilinski , a Pole brought up in Paris , was rich , and passionately fond of the French , and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit , French officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and Boris . 
On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June , Count Zhilinski arranged a supper for his French friends . 
The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon 's , there were also several French officers of the Guard , and a page of Napoleon 's , a young lad of an old aristocratic French family . 
That same day , Rostov , profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress , came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski . 
Rostov , in common with the whole army from which he came , was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French -- who from being foes had suddenly become friends -- that had taken place at headquarters and in Boris . 
In the army , Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger , contempt , and fear . 
Only recently , talking with one of Platov 's Cossack officers , Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign , but as a criminal . 
Quite lately , happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road , Rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte . 
Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in Boris ' lodging , dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank . 
As soon as he noticed a French officer , who thrust his head out of the door , that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him . 
He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there . 
Boris , hearing a strange voice in the anteroom , came out to meet him . 
An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostov . 
`` Ah , it 's you ? 
Very glad , very glad to see you , '' he said , however , coming toward him with a smile . 
But Rostov had noticed his first impulse . 
`` I 've come at a bad time I think . 
I should not have come , but I have business , '' he said coldly . 
`` No , I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment . 
Dans un moment je suis a vous , '' * he said , answering someone who called him . 
* `` In a minute I shall be at your disposal . '' 
`` I see I 'm intruding , '' Rostov repeated . 
The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris ' face : having evidently reflected and decided how to act , he very quietly took both Rostov 's hands and led him into the next room . 
His eyes , looking serenely and steadily at Rostov , seemed to be veiled by something , as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality . 
So it seemed to Rostov . 
`` Oh , come now ! 
As if you could come at a wrong time ! '' 
said Boris , and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests , explaining that he was not a civilian , but an hussar officer , and an old friend of his . 
`` Count Zhilinski -- le Comte N. N. -- le Capitaine S. S. , '' said he , naming his guests . 
Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen , bowed reluctantly , and remained silent . 
Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov . 
Boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and , with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met Rostov , tried to enliven the conversation . 
One of the Frenchmen , with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen , addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostov , saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor . 
`` No , I came on business , '' replied Rostov , briefly . 
Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on Boris ' face , and as always happens to those in a bad humor , it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybody 's way . 
He really was in their way , for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general . 
The looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say : `` And what is he sitting here for ? '' 
He rose and went up to Boris . 
`` Anyhow , I 'm in your way , '' he said in a low tone . 
`` Come and talk over my business and I 'll go away . '' 
`` Oh , no , not at all , '' said Boris . 
`` But if you are tired , come and lie down in my room and have a rest . '' 
`` Yes , really ... '' They went into the little room where Boris slept . 
Rostov , without sitting down , began at once , irritably -LRB- as if Boris were to blame in some way -RRB- telling him about Denisov 's affair , asking him whether , through his general , he could and would intercede with the Emperor on Denisov 's behalf and get Denisov 's petition handed in . 
When he and Boris were alone , Rostov felt for the first time that he could not look Boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness . 
Boris , with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right , listened to Rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate , now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rostov 's eyes with the same veiled look . 
Each time this happened Rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes . 
`` I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in such affairs . 
I think it would be best not to bring it before the Emperor , but to apply to the commander of the corps ... . 
But in general , I think ... '' `` So you do n't want to do anything ? 
Well then , say so ! '' 
Rostov almost shouted , not looking Boris in the face . 
Boris smiled . 
`` On the contrary , I will do what I can . 
Only I thought ... '' At that moment Zhilinski 's voice was heard calling Boris . 
`` Well then , go , go , go ... '' said Rostov , and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room , he walked up and down for a long time , hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room . 
Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on Denisov 's behalf . 
He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so , and Boris , even had he wished to , could not have done so on the following day . 
On that day , June 27 , the preliminaries of peace were signed . 
The Emperors exchanged decorations : Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree , and a dinner had been arranged for the evening , given by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion . 
The Emperors were to be present at that banquet . 
Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that , when the latter looked in after supper , he pretended to be asleep , and early next morning went away , avoiding Boris . 
In his civilian clothes and a round hat , he wandered about the town , staring at the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were staying . 
In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner ; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets , with hugh monograms A and N . 
In the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed . 
`` Boris does n't want to help me and I do n't want to ask him . 
That 's settled , '' thought Nicholas . 
`` All is over between us , but I wo n't leave here without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor . 
The Emperor ! 
... He is here ! '' 
thought Rostov , who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged . 
Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling , evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out . 
`` I may see him at any moment , '' thought Rostov . 
`` If only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all ... could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes ? 
Surely not ! 
He would understand on whose side justice lies . 
He understands everything , knows everything . 
Who can be more just , more magnanimous than he ? 
And even if they did arrest me for being here , what would it matter ? '' 
thought he , looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied . 
`` After all , people do go in ... . 
It 's all nonsense ! 
I 'll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskoy who drives me to it ! '' 
And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect , Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house . 
`` No , I wo n't miss my opportunity now , as I did after Austerlitz , '' he thought , expecting every moment to meet the monarch , and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought . 
`` I will fall at his feet and beseech him . 
He will lift me up , will listen , and will even thank me . ' 
I am happy when I can do good , but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness , ' '' Rostov fancied the sovereign saying . 
And passing people who looked after him with curiosity , he entered the porch of the Emperor 's house . 
A broad staircase led straight up from the entry , and to the right he saw a closed door . 
Below , under the staircase , was a door leading to the lower floor . 
`` Whom do you want ? '' 
someone inquired . 
`` To hand in a letter , a petition , to His Majesty , '' said Nicholas , with a tremor in his voice . 
`` A petition ? 
This way , to the officer on duty '' -LRB- he was shown the door leading downstairs -RRB- , `` only it wo n't be accepted . '' 
On hearing this indifferent voice , Rostov grew frightened at what he was doing ; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away , but the official who had questioned him opened the door , and Rostov entered . 
A short stout man of about thirty , in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on , standing in that room , and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that , for some reason , attracted Rostov 's attention . 
This man was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room . 
`` A good figure and in her first bloom , '' he was saying , but on seeing Rostov , he stopped short and frowned . 
`` What is it ? 
A petition ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the person in the other room . 
`` Another petitioner , '' answered the man with the braces . 
`` Tell him to come later . 
He 'll be coming out directly , we must go . '' 
`` Later ... later ! 
Tomorrow . 
It 's too late ... '' Rostov turned and was about to go , but the man in the braces stopped him . 
`` Whom have you come from ? 
Who are you ? '' 
`` I come from Major Denisov , '' answered Rostov . 
`` Are you an officer ? '' 
`` Lieutenant Count Rostov . '' 
`` What audacity ! 
Hand it in through your commander . 
And go along with you ... go , '' and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him . 
Rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform , whom he had to pass . 
Cursing his temerity , his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence , fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it , Rostov , with downcast eyes , was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him . 
`` What are you doing here , sir , in civilian dress ? '' 
asked a deep voice . 
It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor 's special favor during this campaign , and who had formerly commanded the division in which Rostov was serving . 
Rostov , in dismay , began justifying himself , but seeing the kindly , jocular face of the general , he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair , asking him to intercede for Denisov , whom the general knew . 
Having heard Rostov to the end , the general shook his head gravely . 
`` I 'm sorry , sorry for that fine fellow . 
Give me the letter . '' 
Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining Denisov 's case , when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs , and the general , leaving him , went to the porch . 
The gentlemen of the Emperor 's suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses . 
Hayne , the same groom who had been at Austerlitz , led up the Emperor 's horse , and the faint creak of a footstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs . 
Forgetting the danger of being recognized , Rostov went close to the porch , together with some inquisitive civilians , and again , after two years , saw those features he adored : that same face and same look and step , and the same union of majesty and mildness ... . 
And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostov 's soul in all its old force . 
In the uniform of the Preobrazhensk regiment -- white chamois-leather breeches and high boots -- and wearing a star Rostov did not know -LRB- it was that of the Legion d'honneur -RRB- , the monarch came out into the porch , putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm . 
He stopped and looked about him , brightening everything around by his glance . 
He spoke a few words to some of the generals , and , recognizing the former commander of Rostov 's division , smiled and beckoned to him . 
All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking for some time to the Emperor . 
The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse . 
Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers -LRB- among whom was Rostov -RRB- moved nearer to the Emperor . 
Stopping beside his horse , with his hand on the saddle , the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice , evidently wishing to be heard by all : `` I can not do it , General . 
I can not , because the law is stronger than I , '' and he raised his foot to the stirrup . 
The general bowed his head respectfully , and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop . 
Beside himself with enthusiasm , Rostov ran after him with the crowd . 
The Emperor rode to the square where , facing one another , a battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left . 
As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions , which presented arms , another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank , and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon . 
It could be no one else . 
He came at a gallop , wearing a small hat , a blue uniform open over a white vest , and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder . 
He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth . 
On approaching Alexander he raised his hat , and as he did so , Rostov , with his cavalryman 's eye , could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle . 
The battalions shouted `` Hurrah ! '' 
and `` Vive l'Empereur ! '' 
Napoleon said something to Alexander , and both Emperors dismounted and took each other 's hands . 
Napoleon 's face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile . 
Alexander was saying something affable to him . 
In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes ' horses , which were pushing back the crowd , Rostov kept his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte . 
It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar , as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to him . 
Alexander and Napoleon , with the long train of their suites , approached the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there . 
The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the Emperors that Rostov , standing in the front row , was afraid he might be recognized . 
`` Sire , I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest of your soldiers , '' said a sharp , precise voice , articulating every letter . 
This was said by the undersized Napoleon , looking up straight into Alexander 's eyes . 
Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and , bending his head , smiled pleasantly . 
`` To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war , '' added Napoleon , accentuating each syllable , as with a composure and assurance exasperating to Rostov , he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up before him , who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor . 
`` Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel ? '' 
said Alexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski , the commander of the battalion . 
Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand , tore it in doing so , and threw it away . 
An aide-de-camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up . 
`` To whom shall it be given ? '' 
the Emperor Alexander asked Koslovski , in Russian in a low voice . 
`` To whomever Your Majesty commands . '' 
The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and , glancing back , remarked : `` But we must give him an answer . '' 
Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov in his scrutiny . 
`` Can it be me ? '' 
thought Rostov . 
`` Lazarev ! '' 
the colonel called , with a frown , and Lazarev , the first soldier in the rank , stepped briskly forward . 
`` Where are you off to ? 
Stop here ! '' 
voices whispered to Lazarev who did not know where to go . 
Lazarev stopped , casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm . 
His face twitched , as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks . 
Napoleon slightly turned his head , and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something . 
The members of his suite , guessing at once what he wanted , moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another , and a page -- the same one Rostov had seen the previous evening at Boris ' -- ran forward and , bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment , laid in it an Order on a red ribbon . 
Napoleon , without looking , pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them . 
Then he approached Lazarev -LRB- who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch -RRB- , looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally , and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lazarev 's buttons . 
It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier 's breast for the soldier to be forever happy , rewarded , and distinguished from everyone else in the world . 
Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev 's breast and , dropping his hand , turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there . 
And it really did . 
Officious hands , Russian and French , immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform . 
Lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and , still standing motionless presenting arms , looked again straight into Alexander 's eyes , as if asking whether he should stand there , or go away , or do something else . 
But receiving no orders , he remained for some time in that rigid position . 
The Emperors remounted and rode away . 
The Preobrazhensk battalion , breaking rank , mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them . 
Lazarev sat in the place of honor . 
Russian and French officers embraced him , congratulated him , and pressed his hands . 
Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him . 
A rumble of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square . 
Two officers with flushed faces , looking cheerful and happy , passed by Rostov . 
`` What d'you think of the treat ? 
All on silver plate , '' one of them was saying . 
`` Have you seen Lazarev ? '' 
`` I have . '' 
`` Tomorrow , I hear , the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner . '' 
`` Yes , but what luck for Lazarev ! 
Twelve hundred francs ' pension for life . '' 
`` Here 's a cap , lads ! '' 
shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier , donning a shaggy French cap . 
`` It 's a fine thing ! 
First-rate ! '' 
`` Have you heard the password ? '' 
asked one Guards ' officer of another . 
`` The day before yesterday it was ` Napoleon , France , bravoure ' ; yesterday , ` Alexandre , Russie , grandeur . ' 
One day our Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon . 
Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George 's Cross to the bravest of the French Guards . 
It has to be done . 
He must respond in kind . '' 
Boris , too , with his friend Zhilinski , came to see the Preobrazhensk banquet . 
On his way back , he noticed Rostov standing by the corner of a house . 
`` Rostov ! 
How d'you do ? 
We missed one another , '' he said , and could not refrain from asking what was the matter , so strangely dismal and troubled was Rostov 's face . 
`` Nothing , nothing , '' replied Rostov . 
`` You 'll call round ? '' 
`` Yes , I will . '' 
Rostov stood at that corner for a long time , watching the feast from a distance . 
In his mind , a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion . 
Terrible doubts rose in his soul . 
Now he remembered Denisov with his changed expression , his submission , and the whole hospital , with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease . 
So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from . 
Next he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte , with his small white hand , who was now an Emperor , liked and respected by Alexander . 
Then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men ? 
... Then again he thought of Lazarev rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned . 
He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened . 
The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections ; he had to get something to eat before going away . 
He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning . 
There he found so many people , among them officers who , like himself , had come in civilian clothes , that he had difficulty in getting a dinner . 
Two officers of his own division joined him . 
The conversation naturally turned on the peace . 
The officers , his comrades , like most of the army , were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland . 
They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for , as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition . 
Nicholas ate and drank -LRB- chiefly the latter -RRB- in silence . 
He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself . 
The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion . 
He feared to give way to his thoughts , yet could not get rid of them . 
Suddenly , on one of the officers ' saying that it was humiliating to look at the French , Rostov began shouting with uncalled-for wrath , and therefore much to the surprise of the officers : `` How can you judge what 's best ? '' 
he cried , the blood suddenly rushing to his face . 
`` How can you judge the Emperor 's actions ? 
What right have we to argue ? 
We can not comprehend either the Emperor 's or his actions ! '' 
`` But I never said a word about the Emperor ! '' 
said the officer , justifying himself , and unable to understand Rostov 's outburst , except on the supposition that he was drunk . 
But Rostov did not listen to him . 
`` We are not diplomatic officials , we are soldiers and nothing more , '' he went on . 
`` If we are ordered to die , we must die . 
If we 're punished , it means that we have deserved it , it 's not for us to judge . 
If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him , it means that that is the right thing to do . 
If once we begin judging and arguing about everything , nothing sacred will be left ! 
That way we shall be saying there is no God -- nothing ! '' 
shouted Nicholas , banging the table -- very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners , but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts . 
`` Our business is to do our duty , to fight and not to think ! 
That 's all ... '' said he . 
`` And to drink , '' said one of the officers , not wishing to quarrel . 
`` Yes , and to drink , '' assented Nicholas . 
`` Hullo there ! 
Another bottle ! '' 
he shouted . 
In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon , and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting . 
In 1809 the intimacy between `` the world 's two arbiters , '' as Napoleon and Alexander were called , was such that when Napoleon declared war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria , and in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of Alexander 's sisters was spoken of . 
But besides considerations of foreign policy , the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the departments of government . 
Life meanwhile -- real life , with its essential interests of health and sickness , toil and rest , and its intellectual interests in thought , science , poetry , music , love , friendship , hatred , and passions -- went on as usual , independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction . 
Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country . 
All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates -- and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished -- were carried out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty . 
He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked , and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going . 
On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers -- this being one of the first examples of the kind in Russia . 
On other estates the serfs ' compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent . 
A trained midwife was engaged for Bogucharovo at his expense , and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs . 
Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his son , who was still in the care of nurses . 
The other half he spent in `` Bogucharovo Cloister , '' as his father called Prince Andrew 's estate . 
Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to Pierre , he diligently followed all that went on , received many books , and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from Petersburg , the very vortex of life , these people lagged behind himself -- who never left the country -- in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs . 
Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books , Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns , and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations . 
In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son , whose guardian he was . 
Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass , the first leaves on the birches , and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky . 
He was not thinking of anything , but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side . 
They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before . 
They went through the muddy village , past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye , downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge , uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain , past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there , and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road . 
In the forest it was almost hot , no wind could be felt . 
The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless , and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year 's leaves . 
The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter . 
On entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly . 
Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman ; the latter assented . 
But apparently the coachman 's sympathy was not enough for Peter , and he turned on the box toward his master . 
`` How pleasant it is , your excellency ! '' 
he said with a respectful smile . 
`` What ? '' 
`` It 's pleasant , your excellency ! '' 
`` What is he talking about ? '' 
thought Prince Andrew . 
`` Oh , the spring , I suppose , '' he thought as he turned round . 
`` Yes , really everything is green already ... . 
How early ! 
The birches and cherry and alders too are coming out ... . 
But the oaks show no sign yet . 
Ah , here is one oak ! '' 
At the edge of the road stood an oak . 
Probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest , it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they . 
It was an enormous tree , its girth twice as great as a man could embrace , and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred . 
With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically , and its gnarled hands and fingers , it stood an aged , stern , and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees . 
Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest , and this oak , refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine . 
`` Spring , love , happiness ! '' 
this oak seemed to say . 
`` Are you not weary of that stupid , meaningless , constantly repeated fraud ? 
Always the same and always a fraud ? 
There is no spring , no sun , no happiness ! 
Look at those cramped dead firs , ever the same , and at me too , sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown , whether from my back or my sides : as they have grown so I stand , and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies . '' 
As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look at that oak , as if expecting something from it . 
Under the oak , too , were flowers and grass , but it stood among them scowling , rigid , misshapen , and grim as ever . 
`` Yes , the oak is right , a thousand times right , '' thought Prince Andrew . 
`` Let others -- the young -- yield afresh to that fraud , but we know life , our life is finished ! '' 
A whole sequence of new thoughts , hopeless but mournfully pleasant , rose in his soul in connection with that tree . 
During this journey he , as it were , considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion , restful in its hopelessness : that it was not for him to begin anything anew -- but that he must live out his life , content to do no harm , and not disturbing himself or desiring anything . 
Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of which he was trustee . 
This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov , and in the middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him . 
It was now hot spring weather . 
The whole forest was already clothed in green . 
It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe . 
Prince Andrew , depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the Marshal , was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the Rostovs ' house at Otradnoe . 
He heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche . 
Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired , remarkably slim , pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress , with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped . 
The girl was shouting something but , seeing that he was a stranger , ran back laughing without looking at him . 
Suddenly , he did not know why , he felt a pang . 
The day was so beautiful , the sun so bright , everything around so gay , but that slim pretty girl did not know , or wish to know , of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate -- probably foolish - but bright and happy life . 
`` What is she so glad about ? 
What is she thinking of ? 
Not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryazan serfs ' quitrents . 
Of what is she thinking ? 
Why is she so happy ? '' 
Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity . 
In 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just as he had done in former years , that is , entertaining almost the whole province with hunts , theatricals , dinners , and music . 
He was glad to see Prince Andrew , as he was to see any new visitor , and insisted on his staying the night . 
During the dull day , in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors -LRB- the old count 's house was crowded on account of an approaching name day -RRB- , Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Natasha , gay and laughing among the younger members of the company , and asked himself each time , `` What is she thinking about ? 
Why is she so glad ? '' 
That night , alone in new surroundings , he was long unable to sleep . 
He read awhile and then put out his candle , but relit it . 
It was hot in the room , the inside shutters of which were closed . 
He was cross with the stupid old man -LRB- as he called Rostov -RRB- , who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town , and he was vexed with himself for having stayed . 
He got up and went to the window to open it . 
As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight , as if it had long been watching for this , burst into the room . 
He opened the casement . 
The night was fresh , bright , and very still . 
Just before the window was a row of pollard trees , looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other . 
Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush , wet , bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there . 
Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew , to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches , and above it shone the moon , nearly at its full , in a pale , almost starless , spring sky . 
Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky . 
His room was on the first floor . 
Those in the rooms above were also awake . 
He heard female voices overhead . 
`` Just once more , '' said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew recognized at once . 
`` But when are you coming to bed ? '' 
replied another voice . 
`` I wo n't , I ca n't sleep , what 's the use ? 
Come now for the last time . '' 
Two girlish voices sang a musical passage -- the end of some song . 
`` Oh , how lovely ! 
Now go to sleep , and there 's an end of it . '' 
`` You go to sleep , but I ca n't , '' said the first voice , coming nearer to the window . 
She was evidently leaning right out , for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard . 
Everything was stone-still , like the moon and its light and the shadows . 
Prince Andrew , too , dared not stir , for fear of betraying his unintentional presence . 
`` Sonya ! 
Sonya ! '' 
he again heard the first speaker . 
`` Oh , how can you sleep ? 
Only look how glorious it is ! 
Ah , how glorious ! 
Do wake up , Sonya ! '' 
she said almost with tears in her voice . 
`` There never , never was such a lovely night before ! '' 
Sonya made some reluctant reply . 
`` Do just come and see what a moon ! 
... Oh , how lovely ! 
Come here ... . 
Darling , sweetheart , come here ! 
There , you see ? 
I feel like sitting down on my heels , putting my arms round my knees like this , straining tight , as tight as possible , and flying away ! 
Like this ... '' `` Take care , you 'll fall out . '' 
He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya 's disapproving voice : `` It 's past one o'clock . '' 
`` Oh , you only spoil things for me . 
All right , go , go ! '' 
Again all was silent , but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting there . 
From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh . 
`` O God , O God ! 
What does it mean ? '' 
she suddenly exclaimed . 
`` To bed then , if it must be ! '' 
and she slammed the casement . 
`` For her I might as well not exist ! '' 
thought Prince Andrew while he listened to her voice , for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him . 
`` There she is again ! 
As if it were on purpose , '' thought he . 
In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes , contrary to the whole tenor of his life , that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once . 
Next morning , having taken leave of no one but the count , and not waiting for the ladies to appear , Prince Andrew set off for home . 
It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him . 
In the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before , for now all was thick , shady , and dense , and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but , lending themselves to the mood around , were delicately green with fluffy young shoots . 
The whole day had been hot . 
Somewhere a storm was gathering , but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly , sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves . 
The left side of the forest was dark in the shade , the right side glittered in the sunlight , wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze . 
Everything was in blossom , the nightingales trilled , and their voices reverberated now near , now far away . 
`` Yes , here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed , '' thought Prince Andrew . 
`` But where is it ? '' 
he again wondered , gazing at the left side of the road , and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought . 
The old oak , quite transfigured , spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage , stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun . 
Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now . 
Through the hard century-old bark , even where there were no twigs , leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced . 
`` Yes , it is the same oak , '' thought Prince Andrew , and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal . 
All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory . 
Austerlitz with the lofty heavens , his wife 's dead reproachful face , Pierre at the ferry , that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night , and that night itself and the moon , and ... . 
all this rushed suddenly to his mind . 
`` No , life is not over at thirty-one ! '' 
Prince Andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively . 
`` It is not enough for me to know what I have in me -- everyone must know it : Pierre , and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky , everyone must know me , so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it , but so that it may be reflected in them all , and they and I may live in harmony ! '' 
On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision . 
A whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to Petersburg , and even to re-enter the service , kept springing up in his mind . 
He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life , just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head . 
It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life . 
He did not even remember how formerly , on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments , it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now , after the lessons he had had in life , allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love . 
Now reason suggested quite the opposite . 
After that journey to Ryazan he found the country dull ; his former pursuits no longer interested him , and often when sitting alone in his study he got up , went to the mirror , and gazed a long time at his own face . 
Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise , who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame . 
She did not now say those former terrible words to him , but looked simply , merrily , and inquisitively at him . 
And Prince Andrew , crossing his arms behind him , long paced the room , now frowning , now smiling , as he reflected on those irrational , inexpressible thoughts , secret as a crime , which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre , with fame , with the girl at the window , the oak , and woman 's beauty and love . 
And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold , stern , and above all unpleasantly logical . 
`` My dear , '' Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say , `` little Nicholas ca n't go out today , it 's very cold . '' 
`` If it were hot , '' Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister , `` he could go out in his smock , but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes , which were designed for that purpose . 
That is what follows from the fact that it is cold ; and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home , '' he would add with extreme logic , as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him . 
At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries men up . 
Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August , 1809 . 
It was the time when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy . 
That same August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche , injured his leg , and remained three weeks at Peterhof , receiving Speranski every day and no one else . 
At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society -- abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor -- and not merely these but a whole state constitution , intended to change the existing order of government in Russia : legal , administrative , and financial , from the Council of State down to the district tribunals . 
Now those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne , and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates , Czartoryski , Novosiltsev , Kochubey , and Strogonov -- whom he himself in jest had called his Comite de salut public -- were taking shape and being realized . 
Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side , and Arakcheev on the military . 
Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew , as a gentleman of the chamber , presented himself at court and at a levee . 
The Emperor , though he met him twice , did not favor him with a single word . 
It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally , and in the cold , repellent glance the Emperor gave him , he now found further confirmation of this surmise . 
The courtiers explained the Emperor 's neglect of him by His Majesty 's displeasure at Bolkonski 's not having served since 1805 . 
`` I know myself that one can not help one 's sympathies and antipathies , '' thought Prince Andrew , `` so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally , but the project will speak for itself . '' 
He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal , a friend of his father 's . 
The field marshal made an appointment to see him , received him graciously , and promised to inform the Emperor . 
A few days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War , Count Arakcheev . 
On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev 's waiting room at nine in the morning . 
He did not know Arakcheev personally , had never seen him , and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man . 
`` He is Minister of War , a man trusted by the Emperor , and I need not concern myself about his personal qualities : he has been commissioned to consider my project , so he alone can get it adopted , '' thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev 's waiting room . 
During his service , chiefly as an adjutant , Prince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men , and the different types of such rooms were well known to him . 
Count Arakcheev 's anteroom had quite a special character . 
The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility ; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness , covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves , their situation , and the person for whom they were waiting . 
Some walked thoughtfully up and down , others whispered and laughed . 
Prince Andrew heard the nickname `` Sila Andreevich '' and the words , `` Uncle will give it to us hot , '' in reference to Count Arakcheev . 
One general -LRB- an important personage -RRB- , evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long , sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself . 
But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces -- that of fear . 
Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name , but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course . 
After some others had been shown in and out of the minister 's room by the adjutant on duty , an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door . 
This officer 's audience lasted a long time . 
Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door , and the officer -- with pale face and trembling lips -- came out and passed through the waiting room , clutching his head . 
After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty said in a whisper , `` To the right , at the window . '' 
Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist , a long closely cropped head , deep wrinkles , scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose . 
Arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him . 
`` What is your petition ? '' 
asked Arakcheev . 
`` I am not petitioning , your excellency , '' returned Prince Andrew quietly . 
Arakcheev 's eyes turned toward him . 
`` Sit down , '' said he . 
`` Prince Bolkonski ? '' 
`` I am not petitioning about anything . 
His Majesty the Emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me ... '' `` You see , my dear sir , I have read your project , '' interrupted Arakcheev , uttering only the first words amiably and then -- again without looking at Prince Andrew -- relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt . 
`` You are proposing new military laws ? 
There are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones . 
Nowadays everybody designs laws , it is easier writing than doing . '' 
`` I came at His Majesty the Emperor 's wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented , '' said Prince Andrew politely . 
`` I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee . 
I do not approve of it , '' said Arakcheev , rising and taking a paper from his writing table . 
`` Here ! '' 
and he handed it to Prince Andrew . 
Across the paper was scrawled in pencil , without capital letters , misspelled , and without punctuation : `` Unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles of War needlessly deviating . '' 
`` To what committee has the memorandum been referred ? '' 
inquired Prince Andrew . 
`` To the Committee on Army Regulations , and I have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member , but without a salary . '' 
Prince Andrew smiled . 
`` I do n't want one . '' 
`` A member without salary , '' repeated Arakcheev . 
`` I have the honor ... Eh ! 
Call the next one ! 
Who else is there ? '' 
he shouted , bowing to Prince Andrew . 
While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances , particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need . 
In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle , when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future , on which the fate of millions depended , was being shaped . 
From the irritation of the older men , the curiosity of the uninitiated , the reserve of the initiated , the hurry and preoccupation of everyone , and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day , he felt that now , in 1809 , here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation , the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know , but who was supposed to be a man of genius -- Speranski . 
And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea , and Speranski its chief promoter , began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness . 
Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day . 
The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him , the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read , and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal . 
The party of the old and dissatisfied , who censured the innovations , turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms , simply because he was the son of his father . 
The feminine society world welcomed him gladly , because he was rich , distinguished , a good match , and almost a newcomer , with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife . 
Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years , having softened and grown more manly , lost his former affectation , pride , and contemptuous irony , and acquired the serenity that comes with years . 
People talked about him , were interested in him , and wanted to meet him .
