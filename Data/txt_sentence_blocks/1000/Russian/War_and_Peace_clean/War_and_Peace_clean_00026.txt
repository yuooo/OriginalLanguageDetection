Only Natasha and the countess remained in the room . 
Petya was no longer with the family , he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Troitsa . 
The countess , on hearing that Moscow was on fire , began to cry . 
Natasha , pale , with a fixed look , was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father 's words . 
She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant , three houses off . 
`` Oh , how terrible , '' said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened . 
`` I believe the whole of Moscow will burn , there 's an awful glow ! 
Natasha , do look ! 
You can see it from the window , '' she said to her cousin , evidently wishing to distract her mind . 
But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove . 
She had been in this condition of stupor since the morning , when Sonya , to the surprise and annoyance of the countess , had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew 's wound and of his being with their party . 
The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with Sonya . 
Sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now , as if trying to atone for her fault , paid unceasing attention to her cousin . 
`` Look , Natasha , how dreadfully it is burning ! '' 
said she . 
`` What 's burning ? '' 
asked Natasha . 
`` Oh , yes , Moscow . '' 
And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her , she turned her face to the window , looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything , and again settled down in her former attitude . 
`` But you did n't see it ! '' 
`` Yes , really I did , '' Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace . 
Both the countess and Sonya understood that , naturally , neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to Natasha . 
The count returned and lay down behind the partition . 
The countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when Natasha was ill , then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish , and finally kissed her . 
`` You are cold . 
You are trembling all over . 
You 'd better lie down , '' said the countess . 
`` Lie down ? 
All right , I will . 
I 'll lie down at once , '' said Natasha . 
When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party , she had at first asked many questions : Where was he going ? 
How was he wounded ? 
Was it serious ? 
And could she see him ? 
But after she had been told that she could not see him , that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger , she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all , evidently disbelieving what they told her , and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same . 
All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes , and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much , and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving . 
She was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind . 
The countess knew this , but what it might be she did not know , and this alarmed and tormented her . 
`` Natasha , undress , darling ; lie down on my bed . '' 
A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only . 
Madame Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor . 
`` No , Mamma , I will lie down here on the floor , '' Natasha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it . 
Through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly . 
She put her head out into the damp night air , and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame . 
Natasha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning . 
She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage ; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob . 
The countess exchanged a look with Sonya . 
`` Lie down , darling ; lie down , my pet , '' said the countess , softly touching Natasha 's shoulders . 
`` Come , lie down . '' 
`` Oh , yes ... I 'll lie down at once , '' said Natasha , and began hurriedly undressing , tugging at the tapes of her petticoat . 
When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket , she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor , jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front , and began replaiting it . 
Her long , thin , practiced fingers rapidly unplaited , replaited , and tied up her plait . 
Her head moved from side to side from habit , but her eyes , feverishly wide , looked fixedly before her . 
When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door . 
`` Natasha , you 'd better lie in the middle , '' said Sonya . 
`` I 'll stay here , '' muttered Natasha . 
`` Do lie down , '' she added crossly , and buried her face in the pillow . 
The countess , Madame Schoss , and Sonya undressed hastily and lay down . 
The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room . 
But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytishchi a mile and a half away , and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov 's Cossacks had set up across the street , and the adjutant 's unceasing moans could still be heard . 
For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move . 
First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her , then Madame Schoss ' familiar whistling snore and Sonya 's gentle breathing . 
Then the countess called to Natasha . 
Natasha did not answer . 
`` I think she 's asleep , Mamma , '' said Sonya softly . 
After short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied . 
Soon after that Natasha heard her mother 's even breathing . 
Natasha did not move , though her little bare foot , thrust out from under the quilt , was growing cold on the bare floor . 
As if to celebrate a victory over everybody , a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall . 
A cock crowed far off and another replied near by . 
The shouting in the tavern had died down ; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard . 
Natasha sat up . 
`` Sonya , are you asleep ? 
Mamma ? '' 
she whispered . 
No one replied . 
Natasha rose slowly and carefully , crossed herself , and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim , supple , bare feet . 
The boards of the floor creaked . 
Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle . 
It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room : it was her own heart , sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love . 
She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold , damp earthen floor of the passage . 
The cold she felt refreshed her . 
With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man , stepped over him , and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay . 
It was dark in there . 
In the farthest corner , on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying , stood a tallow candle with a long , thick , and smoldering wick . 
From the moment she had been told that of Prince Andrew 's wound and his presence there , Natasha had resolved to see him . 
She did not know why she had to , she knew the meeting would be painful , but felt the more convinced that it was necessary . 
All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night . 
But now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see . 
How was he maimed ? 
What was left of him ? 
Was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant 's ? 
Yes , he was altogether like that . 
In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified . 
When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner , and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders , she imagined a horrible body there , and stood still in terror . 
But an irresistible impulse drew her forward . 
She cautiously took one step and then another , and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage . 
Another man - Timokhin -- was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons , and two others -- the doctor and a valet -- lay on the floor . 
The valet sat up and whispered something . 
Timokhin , kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg , gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise , dressing jacket , and nightcap . 
The valet 's sleepy , frightened exclamation , `` What do you want ? 
What 's the matter ? '' 
made Natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner . 
Horribly unlike a man as that body looked , she must see him . 
She passed the valet , the snuff fell from the candle wick , and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt , and such as she had always seen him . 
He was the same as ever , but the feverish color of his face , his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her , and especially his neck , delicate as a child 's , revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt , gave him a peculiarly innocent , childlike look , such as she had never seen on him before . 
She went up to him and with a swift , flexible , youthful movement dropped on her knees . 
He smiled and held out his hand to her . 
Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodino . 
His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels , which were injured , were in the doctor 's opinion sure to carry him off . 
But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea , and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower . 
He had regained consciousness that morning . 
The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche , but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea . 
The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness . 
When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes . 
Then he opened them and whispered softly : `` And the tea ? '' 
His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor . 
He felt Prince Andrew 's pulse , and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved . 
He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now , he would do so a little later with greater suffering . 
Timokhin , the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew 's regiment , had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him , having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino . 
They were accompanied by a doctor , Prince Andrew 's valet , his coachman , and two orderlies . 
They gave Prince Andrew some tea . 
He drank it eagerly , looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something . 
`` I do n't want any more . 
Is Timokhin here ? '' 
he asked . 
Timokhin crept along the bench to him . 
`` I am here , your excellency . '' 
`` How 's your wound ? '' 
`` Mine , sir ? 
All right . 
But how about you ? '' 
Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something . 
`` Could n't one get a book ? '' 
he asked . 
`` What book ? '' 
`` The Gospels . 
I have n't one . '' 
The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling . 
Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably , and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain . 
The doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and , making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound , began examining that dreadful place . 
The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings , turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony . 
He kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him . 
`` What trouble would it be to you ? '' 
he said . 
`` I have not got one . 
Please get it for me and put it under for a moment , '' he pleaded in a piteous voice . 
The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands . 
`` You fellows have no conscience , '' said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands . 
`` For just one moment I did n't look after you ... It 's such pain , you know , that I wonder how he can bear it . '' 
`` By the Lord Jesus Christ , I thought we had put something under him ! '' 
said the valet . 
The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at Mytishchi . 
After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness , and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him , and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when , at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked , those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness . 
And those thoughts , though now vague and indefinite , again possessed his soul . 
He remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels . 
That was why he asked for a copy of them . 
The uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts , and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night . 
Everybody near him was sleeping . 
A cricket chirped from across the passage ; someone was shouting and singing in the street ; cockroaches rustled on the table , on the icons , and on the walls , and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him , the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom . 
His mind was not in a normal state . 
A healthy man usually thinks of , feels , and remembers innumerable things simultaneously , but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention . 
A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts . 
But Prince Andrew 's mind was not in a normal state in that respect . 
All the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever , but they acted apart from his will . 
Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously . 
At times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor , clearness , and depth it had never reached when he was in health , but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again . 
`` Yes , a new happiness was revealed to me of which man can not be deprived , '' he thought as he lay in the semi-darkness of the quiet hut , gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes . 
`` A happiness lying beyond material forces , outside the material influences that act on man -- a happiness of the soul alone , the happiness of loving . 
Every man can understand it , but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God . 
But how did God enjoin that law ? 
And why was the Son ... ? '' 
And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off , and Prince Andrew heard -LRB- without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality -RRB- a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating `` piti-piti-piti , '' and then `` titi , '' and then again `` piti-piti-piti , '' and `` ti-ti '' once more . 
At the same time he felt that above his face , above the very middle of it , some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters , to the sound of this whispered music . 
He felt that he had to balance carefully -LRB- though it was difficult -RRB- so that this airy structure should not collapse ; but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music -- `` it stretches , stretches , spreading out and stretching , '' said Prince Andrew to himself . 
While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles , he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle , and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face . 
Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure , though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising . 
But besides this there was something else of importance . 
It was something white by the door -- the statue of a sphinx , which also oppressed him . 
`` But perhaps that 's my shirt on the table , '' he thought , `` and that 's my legs , and that is the door , but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out , and ` piti-piti-piti ' and ` ti-ti ' and ` piti-piti-piti ' ... ? 
That 's enough , please leave off ! '' 
Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone . 
And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force . 
`` Yes -- love , '' he thought again quite clearly . 
`` But not love which loves for something , for some quality , for some purpose , or for some reason , but the love which I -- while dying -- first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him . 
I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object . 
Now again I feel that bliss . 
To love one 's neighbors , to love one 's enemies , to love everything , to love God in all His manifestations . 
It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love , but an enemy can only be loved by divine love . 
That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man . 
What has become of him ? 
Is he alive ? 
... `` When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred , but divine love can not change . 
No , neither death nor anything else can destroy it . 
It is the very essence of the soul . 
Yet how many people have I hated in my life ? 
And of them all , I loved and hated none as I did her . '' 
And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha , not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight , but for the first time picturing to himself her soul . 
And he understood her feelings , her sufferings , shame , and remorse . 
He now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her , the cruelty of his rupture with her . 
`` If only it were possible for me to see her once more ! 
Just once , looking into those eyes to say ... '' `` Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom ! '' 
flopped the fly ... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world , a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening . 
In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall , something was still stretching out , and the candle with its red halo was still burning , and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door ; but besides all this something creaked , there was a whiff of fresh air , and a new white sphinx appeared , standing at the door . 
And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very Natasha of whom he had just been thinking . 
`` Oh , how oppressive this continual delirium is , '' thought Prince Andrew , trying to drive that face from his imagination . 
But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer . 
Prince Andrew wished to return that former world of pure thought , but he could not , and delirium drew him back into its domain . 
The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur , something oppressed him and stretched out , and the strange face was before him . 
Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses , he moved a little , and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears , a dimness in his eyes , and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness . 
When he came to himself , Natasha , that same living Natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him , was kneeling before him . 
He realized that it was the real living Natasha , and he was not surprised but quietly happy . 
Natasha , motionless on her knees -LRB- she was unable to stir -RRB- , with frightened eyes riveted on him , was restraining her sobs . 
Her face was pale and rigid . 
Only in the lower part of it something quivered . 
Prince Andrew sighed with relief , smiled , and held out his hand . 
`` You ? '' 
he said . 
`` How fortunate ! '' 
With a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him on her knees and , taking his hand carefully , bent her face over it and began kissing it , just touching it lightly with her lips . 
`` Forgive me ! '' 
she whispered , raising her head and glancing at him . 
`` Forgive me ! '' 
`` I love you , '' said Prince Andrew . 
`` Forgive ... ! '' 
`` Forgive what ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne ! '' 
faltered Natasha in a scarcely audible , broken whisper , and began kissing his hand more rapidly , just touching it with her lips . 
`` I love you more , better than before , '' said Prince Andrew , lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes . 
Those eyes , filled with happy tears , gazed at him timidly , compassionately , and with joyous love . 
Natasha 's thin pale face , with its swollen lips , was more than plain -- it was dreadful . 
But Prince Andrew did not see that , he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful . 
They heard the sound of voices behind them . 
Peter the valet , who was now wide awake , had roused the doctor . 
Timokhin , who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg , had long been watching all that was going on , carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench . 
`` What 's this ? '' 
said the doctor , rising from his bed . 
`` Please go away , madam ! '' 
At that moment a maid sent by the countess , who had noticed her daughter 's absence , knocked at the door . 
Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the room and , returning to her hut , fell sobbing on her bed . 
From that time , during all the rest of the Rostovs ' journey , at every halting place and wherever they spent a night , Natasha never left the wounded Bolkonski , and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man . 
Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die in her daughter 's arms during the journey -- as , judging by what the doctor said , it seemed might easily happen -- she could not oppose Natasha . 
Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed , no one -- least of all Natasha and Prince Andrew -- spoke of this : the unsettled question of life and death , which hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia , shut out all other considerations . 
On the third of September Pierre awoke late . 
His head was aching , the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body , and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before . 
That something shameful was his yesterday 's conversation with Captain Ramballe . 
It was eleven by the clock , but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors . 
Pierre rose , rubbed his eyes , and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table , he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day . 
`` Am I not too late ? '' 
he thought . 
`` No , probably he wo n't make his entry into Moscow before noon . '' 
Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him , but hastened to act . 
After arranging his clothes , he took the pistol and was about to go out . 
But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets . 
It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat . 
He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm . 
Besides , it had been discharged , and he had not had time to reload it . 
`` No matter , dagger will do , '' he said to himself , though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger . 
But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design , but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it , Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the pistol , and hid it under his waistcoat . 
Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head , Pierre went down the corridor , trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain , and passed out into the street . 
The conflagration , at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before , had greatly increased during the night . 
Moscow was on fire in several places . 
The buildings in Carriage Row , across the river , in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy , as well as the barges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov Bridge , were all ablaze . 
Pierre 's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat , where he had long before decided that the deed should should be done . 
The gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up . 
The streets and lanes were deserted . 
The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning . 
Now and then he met Russians with anxious and timid faces , and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp , walking in the middle of the streets . 
Both the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise . 
Besides his height and stoutness , and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure , the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong . 
The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre , unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity , paid no attention to them . 
At the gate of one house three Frenchmen , who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them , stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French . 
Pierre shook his head and went on . 
In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him , but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man 's musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street . 
He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him . 
He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste , like something dreadful and alien to him , for , after the previous night 's experience , he was afraid of losing it . 
But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination . 
And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way , his intention could not now have been carried out , for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the Kremlin , and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kremlin , giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire , to prevent looting , and to reassure the inhabitants . 
But Pierre did not know this ; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him , and was tortured -- as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures -- by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem . 
Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskoy . 
As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser - he even felt the heat of the fire . 
Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses . 
He met more people in the streets and they were more excited . 
But Pierre , though he felt that something unusual was happening around him , did not realize that he was approaching the fire . 
As he was going along a foot path across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzinski 's house on the other , Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him . 
He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head . 
By the side of the path , on the dusty dry grass , all sorts of household goods lay in a heap : featherbeds , a samovar , icons , and trunks . 
On the ground , beside the trunks , sat a thin woman no longer young , with long , prominent upper teeth , and wearing a black cloak and cap . 
This woman , swaying to and fro and muttering something , was choking with sobs . 
Two girls of about ten and twelve , dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks , were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces . 
The youngest child , a boy of about seven , who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own , was crying in his old nurse 's arms . 
A dirty , barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk , and , having undone her pale-colored plait , was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair . 
The woman 's husband , a short , round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official , with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples , with expressionless face was moving the trunks , which were placed one on another , and was dragging some garments from under them . 
As soon as she saw Pierre , the woman almost threw herself at his feet . 
`` Dear people , good Christians , save me , help me , dear friends ... help us , somebody , '' she muttered between her sobs . 
`` My girl ... My daughter ! 
My youngest daughter is left behind . 
She 's burned ! 
Ooh ! 
Was it for this I nursed you ... . 
Ooh ! '' 
`` Do n't , Mary Nikolievna ! '' 
said her husband to her in a low voice , evidently only to justify himself before the stranger . 
`` Sister must have taken her , or else where can she be ? '' 
he added . 
`` Monster ! 
Villain ! '' 
shouted the woman angrily , suddenly ceasing to weep . 
`` You have no heart , you do n't feel for your own child ! 
Another man would have rescued her from the fire . 
But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father ! 
You , honored sir , are a noble man , '' she went on , addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs . 
`` The fire broke out alongside , and blew our way , the maid called out ` Fire ! ' 
and we rushed to collect our things . 
We ran out just as we were ... . 
This is what we have brought away ... . 
The icons , and my dowry bed , all the rest is lost . 
We seized the children . 
But not Katie ! 
Ooh ! 
O Lord ! 
... '' and again she began to sob . 
`` My child , my dear one ! 
Burned , burned ! '' 
`` But where was she left ? '' 
asked Pierre . 
From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her . 
`` Oh , dear sir ! '' 
she cried , seizing him by the legs . 
`` My benefactor , set my heart at ease ... . 
Aniska , go , you horrid girl , show him the way ! '' 
she cried to the maid , angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth . 
`` Show me the way , show me , I. . . 
I 'll do it , '' gasped Pierre rapidly . 
The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk , put up her plait , sighed , and went on her short , bare feet along the path . 
Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon . 
He held his head higher , his eyes shone with the light of life , and with swift steps he followed the maid , overtook her , and came out on the Povarskoy . 
The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke . 
Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud . 
A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration . 
In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him . 
Pierre , accompanied by the maid , was advancing to the spot where the general stood , but the French soldiers stopped him . 
`` On ne passe pas ! '' 
* cried a voice . 
* `` You ca n't pass ! 
`` This way , uncle , '' cried the girl . 
`` We 'll pass through the side street , by the Nikulins ' ! '' 
Pierre turned back , giving a spring now and then to keep up with her . 
She ran across the street , turned down a side street to the left , and , passing three houses , turned into a yard on the right . 
`` It 's here , close by , '' said she and , running across the yard , opened a gate in a wooden fence and , stopping , pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house , which was burning brightly and fiercely . 
One of its sides had fallen in , another was on fire , and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof . 
As Pierre passed through the fence gate , he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped . 
`` Which is it ? 
Which is your house ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Ooh ! '' 
wailed the girl , pointing to the wing . 
`` That 's it , that was our lodging . 
You 've burned to death , our treasure , Katie , my precious little missy ! 
Ooh ! '' 
lamented Aniska , who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings . 
Pierre rushed to the wing , but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end , just below the roof , and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen . 
At first Pierre did not realize what these men , who were dragging something out , were about ; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat , he vaguely understood that looting was going on there , but he had no time to dwell on that idea . 
The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings , the whistle and hiss of the flames , the excited shouts of the people , and the sight of the swaying smoke , now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks , with here and there dense sheaves of flame -LRB- now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls -RRB- , and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion , produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration . 
It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down . 
He felt young , bright , adroit , and resolute . 
He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing , when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him . 
Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest , filled with metal articles . 
Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer . 
`` What does this fellow want ? '' 
shouted one of them referring to Pierre . 
`` There 's a child in that house . 
Have n't you seen a child ? '' 
cried Pierre . 
`` What 's he talking about ? 
Get along ! '' 
said several voices , and one of the soldiers , evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer , moved threateningly toward him . 
`` A child ? '' 
shouted a Frenchman from above . 
`` I did hear something squealing in the garden . 
Perhaps it 's his brat that the fellow is looking for . 
After all , one must be human , you know ... '' `` Where is it ? 
Where ? '' 
said Pierre . 
`` There ! 
There ! '' 
shouted the Frenchman at the window , pointing to the garden at the back of the house . 
`` Wait a bit -- I 'm coming down . '' 
And a minute or two later the Frenchman , a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek , in shirt sleeves , really did jump out of a window on the ground floor , and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden . 
`` Hurry up , you others ! '' 
he called out to his comrades . 
`` It 's getting hot . '' 
When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round , graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat . 
`` There is your child ! 
Oh , a girl , so much the better ! '' 
said the Frenchman . 
`` Good-by , Fatty . 
We must be human , we are all mortal you know ! '' 
and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades . 
Breathless with joy , Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms . 
But seeing a stranger the sickly , scrofulous-looking child , unattractively like her mother , began to yell and run away . 
Pierre , however , seized her and lifted her in his arms . 
She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre 's hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth . 
Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal . 
But he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house . 
It was now , however , impossible to get back the way he had come ; the maid , Aniska , was no longer there , and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet , painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out . 
Having run through different yards and side streets , Pierre got back with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the corner of the Povarskoy . 
He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child , so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses . 
Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings , there were several French soldiers in a variety of clothing . 
Pierre took no notice of them . 
He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else . 
Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly . 
Glowing with the heat and from running , he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth , animation , and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child . 
She had now become quiet and , clinging with her little hands to Pierre 's coat , sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal . 
He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile . 
He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened , sickly little face . 
He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them . 
He walked among the crowd with rapid steps , scanning the various faces he met . 
Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type , wearing a new , cloth-covered , sheepskin coat and new boots , an old woman of similar type , and a young woman . 
That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty , with her sharply outlined , arched , black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft , bright color of her long , beautiful , expressionless face . 
Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space , she , in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head , suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow . 
She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman , and looked from under her long lashes with motionless , large , almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her . 
Evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it . 
Her face struck Pierre and , hurrying along by the fence , he turned several times to look at her . 
When he had reached the fence , still without finding those he sought , he stopped and looked about him . 
With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before , and a group of Russians , both men and women , gathered about him . 
`` Have you lost anyone , my dear fellow ? 
You 're of the gentry yourself , are n't you ? 
Whose child is it ? '' 
they asked him . 
Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children , and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone . 
`` Why , that must be the Anferovs , '' said an old deacon , addressing a pockmarked peasant woman . 
`` Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy ! '' 
he added in his customary bass . 
`` The Anferovs ? 
No , '' said the woman . 
`` They left in the morning . 
That must be either Mary Nikolievna 's or the Ivanovs ' ! '' 
`` He says ' a woman , ' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady , '' remarked a house serf . 
`` Do you know her ? 
She 's thin , with long teeth , '' said Pierre . 
`` That 's Mary Nikolievna ! 
They went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down , '' said the woman , pointing to the French soldiers . 
`` O Lord , have mercy ! '' 
added the deacon . 
`` Go over that way , they 're there . 
It 's she ! 
She kept on lamenting and crying , '' continued the woman . 
`` It 's she . 
Here , this way ! '' 
But Pierre was not listening to the woman . 
He had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away . 
He was looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them . 
One of these , a nimble little man , was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope . 
He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare . 
The other , whose appearance particularly struck Pierre , was a long , lank , round-shouldered , fair-haired man , slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face . 
He wore a woman 's loose gown of frieze , blue trousers , and large torn Hessian boots . 
The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and , saying something , immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots . 
The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her , motionless and silent . 
`` Here , take the child ! '' 
said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman , handing the little girl to her . 
`` Give her back to them , give her back ! '' 
he almost shouted , putting the child , who began screaming , on the ground , and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family . 
The old man was already sitting barefoot . 
The little Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other . 
The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs , but Pierre caught but a glimpse of this , his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile , swaying slowly from side to side , had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck . 
The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude , with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her . 
While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the Frenchman , the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing , and the young woman , clutching at her neck , screamed piercingly . 
`` Let that woman alone ! '' 
exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice , seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside . 
The soldier fell , got up , and ran away . 
But his comrade , throwing down the boots and drawing his sword , moved threateningly toward Pierre . 
`` Voyons , Pas de betises ! '' 
* he cried . 
* `` Look here , no nonsense ! '' 
Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold . 
He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and , before the latter had time to draw his sword , knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists . 
Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around , and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner . 
The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them . 
Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that . 
He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him . 
`` Lieutenant , he has a dagger , '' were the first words Pierre understood . 
`` Ah , a weapon ? '' 
said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre . 
`` All right , you can tell all about it at the court-martial . '' 
Then he turned to Pierre . 
`` Do you speak French ? '' 
Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply . 
His face probably looked very terrible , for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre . 
`` Do you speak French ? '' 
the officer asked again , keeping at a distance from Pierre . 
`` Call the interpreter . '' 
A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks , and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops . 
`` He does not look like a common man , '' said the interpreter , after a searching look at Pierre . 
`` Ah , he looks very much like an incendiary , '' remarked the officer . 
`` And ask him who he is , '' he added . 
`` Who are you ? '' 
asked the interpreter in poor Russian . 
`` You must answer the chief . '' 
`` I will not tell you who I am . 
I am your prisoner -- take me ! '' 
Pierre suddenly replied in French . 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
muttered the officer with a frown . 
`` Well then , march ! '' 
A crowd had collected round the Uhlans . 
Nearest to Pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl , and when the patrol started she moved forward . 
`` Where are they taking you to , you poor dear ? '' 
said she . 
`` And the little girl , the little girl , what am I to do with her if she 's not theirs ? '' 
said the woman . 
`` What does that woman want ? '' 
asked the officer . 
Pierre was as if intoxicated . 
His elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved . 
`` What does she want ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` She is bringing me my daughter whom I have just saved from the flames , '' said he . 
`` Good-by ! '' 
And without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him , he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers . 
The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of Moscow by Durosnel 's order to put a stop to the pillage , and especially to catch the incendiaries who , according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers , were the cause of the conflagrations . 
After marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects : a small shopkeeper , two seminary students , a peasant , and a house serf , besides several looters . 
But of all these various suspected characters , Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all . 
When they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the Zubov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse , Pierre was placed apart under strict guard . 
In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles , between the parties of Rumyantsev , the French , Marya Fedorovna , the Tsarevich , and others , drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones . 
But the calm , luxurious life of Petersburg , concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life , went on in its old way and made it hard , except by a great effort , to realize the danger and the difficult position of the Russian people . 
There were the same receptions and balls , the same French theater , the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual . 
Only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position . 
Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances . 
The Empress Marya , concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage , had given directions that they should all be removed to Kazan , and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up . 
The Empress Elisabeth , however , when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give -- with her characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign , but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg . 
At Anna Pavlovna 's on the twenty-sixth of August , the very day of the battle of Borodino , there was a soiree , the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius . 
It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical , patriotic eloquence . 
Prince Vasili himself , famed for his elocution , was to read it . 
-LRB- He used to read at the Empress ' . -RRB- 
The art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words , quite independently of their meaning , in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur , so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another . 
This reading , as was always the case at Anna Pavlovna 's soirees , had a political significance . 
That evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic temper . 
A good many people had already arrived , but Anna Pavlovna , not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room , did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation . 
The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezukhova . 
She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously , had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament , and was said to be receiving no one , and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way . 
They all knew very well that the enchanting countess ' illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time , and that the Italian 's cure consisted in removing such inconvenience ; but in Anna Pavlovna 's presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it . 
`` They say the poor countess is very ill . 
The doctor says it is angina pectoris . '' 
`` Angina ? 
Oh , that 's a terrible illness ! '' 
`` They say that the rivals are reconciled , thanks to the angina ... '' and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction . 
`` The count is pathetic , they say . 
He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous . '' 
`` Oh , it would be a terrible loss , she is an enchanting woman . '' 
`` You are speaking of the poor countess ? '' 
said Anna Pavlovna , coming up just then . 
`` I sent to ask for news , and hear that she is a little better . 
Oh , she is certainly the most charming woman in the world , '' she went on , with a smile at her own enthusiasm . 
`` We belong to different camps , but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves . 
She is very unfortunate ! '' 
added Anna Pavlovna . 
Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess ' malady , an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies . 
`` Your information maybe better than mine , '' Anna Pavlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man , `` but I know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man . 
He is private physician to the Queen of Spain . '' 
And having thus demolished the young man , Anna Pavlovna turned to another group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians : having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots . 
`` I think it is delightful , '' he said , referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the French by Wittgenstein , `` the hero of Petropol '' as he was then called in Petersburg . 
`` What ? 
What 's that ? '' 
asked Anna Pavlovna , securing silence for the mot , which she had heard before . 
And Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch , which he had himself composed . 
`` The Emperor returns these Austrian banners , '' said Bilibin , `` friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path , '' and his brow became smooth again . 
`` Charming , charming ! '' 
observed Prince Vasili . 
`` The path to Warsaw , perhaps , '' Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly . 
Everybody looked at him , understanding what he meant . 
Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise . 
He knew no more than the others what his words meant . 
During his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty , and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head . 
`` It may turn out very well , '' he thought , `` but if not , they 'll know how to arrange matters . '' 
And really , during the awkward silence that ensued , that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert , and she , smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte , invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin . 
Everyone became silent . 
`` Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor ! '' 
Prince Vasili sternly declaimed , looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary . 
But no one said anything . 
`` Moscow , our ancient capital , the New Jerusalem , receives her Christ '' -- he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her -- `` as a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms , and through the gathering mists , foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule , sings in exultation , ` Hosanna , blessed is he that cometh ! ' '' 
Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice . 
Bilibin attentively examined his nails , and many of those present appeared intimidated , as if asking in what they were to blame . 
Anna Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance , like an old woman muttering the prayer at Communion : `` Let the bold and insolent Goliath ... '' she whispered . 
Prince Vasili continued . 
`` Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors ; humble Faith , the sling of the Russian David , shall suddenly smite his head in his blood-thirsty pride . 
This icon of the Venerable Sergius , the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country 's weal , is offered to Your Imperial Majesty . 
I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence . 
I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just , and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty . '' 
`` What force ! 
What a style ! '' 
was uttered in approval both of reader and of author . 
Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna 's guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days . 
`` You will see , '' said Anna Pavlovna , `` that tomorrow , on the Emperor 's birthday , we shall receive news . 
I have a favorable presentiment ! '' 
Anna Pavlovna 's presentiment was in fact fulfilled . 
Next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor 's birthday , Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from Prince Kutuzov . 
It was Kutuzov 's report , written from Tatarinova on the day of the battle . 
Kutuzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a step , that the French losses were much heavier than ours , and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information . 
It followed that there must have been a victory . 
And at once , without leaving the church , thanks were rendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory . 
Anna Pavlovna 's presentiment was justified , and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city . 
Everyone believed the victory to have been complete , and some even spoke of Napoleon 's having been captured , of his deposition , and of the choice of a new ruler for France . 
It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action . 
General events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident . 
So now the courtiers ' pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor 's birthday as on the fact of the victory itself . 
It was like a successfully arranged surprise . 
Mention was made in Kutuzov 's report of the Russian losses , among which figured the names of Tuchkov , Bagration , and Kutaysov . 
In the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident : Kutaysov 's death . 
Everybody knew him , the Emperor liked him , and he was young and interesting . 
That day everyone met with the words : `` What a wonderful coincidence ! 
Just during the service . 
But what a loss Kutaysov is ! 
How sorry I am ! '' 
`` What did I tell about Kutuzov ? '' 
Prince Vasili now said with a prophet 's pride . 
`` I always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon . '' 
But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious . 
The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the Emperor . 
`` Fancy the Emperor 's position ! '' 
said they , and instead of extolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before , they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor 's anxiety . 
That day Prince Vasili no longer boasted of his protege Kutuzov , but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned . 
Moreover , toward evening , as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy , a terrible piece of news was added . 
Countess Helene Bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention . 
Officially , at large gatherings , everyone said that Countess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris , but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect ; but Helene , tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written -LRB- that wretched , profligate Pierre -RRB- had not replied , had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug , and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her . 
It was said that Prince Vasili and the old count had turned upon the Italian , but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop . 
Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts : the Emperor 's lack of news , the loss of Kutuzov , and the death of Helene . 
On the third day after Kutuzov 's report a country gentleman arrived from Moscow , and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through the whole town . 
This was terrible ! 
What a position for the Emperor to be in ! 
Kutuzov was a traitor , and Prince Vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter 's death said of Kutuzov , whom he had formerly praised -LRB- it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said -RRB- , that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man . 
`` I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a man . '' 
As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it , but the next day the following communication was received from Count Rostopchin : Prince Kutuzov 's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road . 
He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow . 
Sire ! 
Kutuzov 's action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire ! 
Russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors ! 
I shall follow the army . 
I have had everything removed , and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland . 
On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to Kutuzov with the following rescript : Prince Michael Ilarionovich ! 
Since the twenty-ninth of August I have received no communication from you , yet on the first of September I received from the commander in chief of Moscow , via Yaroslavl , the sad news that you , with the army , have decided to abandon Moscow . 
You can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me , and your silence increases my astonishment . 
I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski , to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision . 
Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow , a messenger from Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event . 
This messenger was Michaud , a Frenchman who did not know Russian , but who was quoique etranger , russe de coeur et d'ame , * as he said of himself . 
* Though a foreigner , Russian in heart and soul . 
The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on Stone Island . 
Michaud , who had never seen Moscow before the campaign and who did not know Russian , yet felt deeply moved -LRB- as he wrote -RRB- when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain * with the news of the burning of Moscow , dont les flammes eclairaient sa route . 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- * Our most gracious sovereign . 
* -LSB- 2 -RSB- Whose flames illumined his route . 
Though the source of M. Michaud 's chagrin must have been different from that which caused Russians to grieve , he had such a sad face when shown into the Emperor 's study that the latter at once asked : `` Have you brought me sad news , Colonel ? '' 
`` Very sad , sire , '' replied Michaud , lowering his eyes with a sigh . 
`` The abandonment of Moscow . '' 
`` Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle ? '' 
asked the Emperor quickly , his face suddenly flushing . 
Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted to him , which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow , and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as Moscow , or losing Moscow alone , the field marshal had to choose the latter . 
The Emperor listened in silence , not looking at Michaud . 
`` Has the enemy entered the city ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Yes , sire , and Moscow is now in ashes . 
I left it all in flames , '' replied Michaud in a decided tone , but glancing at the Emperor he was frightened by what he had done . 
The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly , his lower lip trembled , and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes . 
But this lasted only a moment . 
He suddenly frowned , as if blaming himself for his weakness , and raising his head addressed Michaud in a firm voice : `` I see , Colonel , from all that is happening , that Providence requires great sacrifices of us ... I am ready to submit myself in all things to His will ; but tell me , Michaud , how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle ? 
Did you not notice discouragement ? 
... '' Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more , Michaud also grew calm , but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor 's direct and relevant question which required a direct answer . 
`` Sire , will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier ? '' 
he asked to gain time . 
`` Colonel , I always require it , '' replied the Emperor . 
`` Conceal nothing from me , I wish to know absolutely how things are . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
said Michaud with a subtle , scarcely perceptible smile on his lips , having now prepared a well-phrased reply , `` sire , I left the whole army , from its chiefs to the lowest soldier , without exception in desperate and agonized terror ... '' `` How is that ? '' 
the Emperor interrupted him , frowning sternly . 
`` Would misfortune make my Russians lose heart ? 
... Never ! '' 
Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared . 
`` Sire , '' he said , with respectful playfulness , `` they are only afraid lest Your Majesty , in the goodness of your heart , should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace . 
They are burning for the combat , '' declared this representative of the Russian nation , `` and to prove to Your Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are ... '' `` Ah ! '' 
said the Emperor reassured , and with a kindly gleam in his eyes , he patted Michaud on the shoulder . 
`` You set me at ease , Colonel . '' 
He bent his head and was silent for some time . 
`` Well , then , go back to the army , '' he said , drawing himself up to his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture , `` and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire . 
It still offers me more than my enemies suppose , '' said the Emperor growing more and more animated ; `` but should it ever be ordained by Divine Providence , '' he continued , raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion , `` that my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors , then after exhausting all the means at my command , I shall let my beard grow to here '' -LRB- he pointed halfway down his chest -RRB- `` and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants , rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate . '' 
Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes , and went to the further end of his study . 
Having stood there a few moments , he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement . 
The Emperor 's mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger . 
`` Colonel Michaud , do not forget what I say to you here , perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday ... Napoleon or I , '' said the Emperor , touching his breast . 
`` We can no longer both reign together . 
I have learned to know him , and he will not deceive me any more ... '' And the Emperor paused , with a frown . 
When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the Emperor 's eyes , Michaud -- quoique etranger , russe de coeur et d'ame -- at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard -LRB- as he used afterwards to say -RRB- , and gave expression to his own feelings and those of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself to be , in the following words : `` Sire ! '' 
said he , `` Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of Europe ! '' 
With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him . 
It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces , and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland , all Russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves , saving their fatherland , or weeping over its downfall . 
The tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice , patriotic devotion , despair , grief , and the heroism of the Russians . 
But it was not really so . 
It appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had . 
Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed . 
Most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests , and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful . 
Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society , they saw everything upside down , and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish -- like Pierre 's and Mamonov 's regiments which looted Russian villages , and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded , and so on . 
Even those , fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings , who discussed Russia 's position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of . 
In historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable . 
Only unconscious action bears fruit , and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance . 
If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless . 
The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance . 
In Petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow , ladies , and gentlemen in militia uniforms , wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on ; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow , and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French , but they thought about their next pay , their next quarters , of Matreshka the vivandiere , and like matters . 
As the war had caught him in the service , Nicholas Rostov took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country , but did so casually , without any aim at self-sacrifice , and he therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it . 
Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia , he would have said that it was not his business to think about it , that Kutuzov and others were there for that purpose , but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength , that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet , and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years ' time . 
As he looked at the matter in this way , he learned that he was being sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division , not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle , but with the greatest pleasure -- which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood . 
A few days before the battle of Borodino , Nicholas received the necessary money and warrants , and having sent some hussars on in advance , he set out with post horses for Voronezh . 
Only a man who has experienced it -- that is , has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war -- can understand the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the army 's foraging operations , provision trains , and hospitals . 
When - free from soldiers , wagons , and the filthy traces of a camp -- he saw villages with peasants and peasant women , gentlemen 's country houses , fields where cattle were grazing , posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them , he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time . 
What for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women , young and healthy , without a dozen officers making up to each of them ; women , too , who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them . 
In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Voronezh , ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp , and next day , very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long time , went to present himself to the authorities . 
The commander of the militia was a civilian general , an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank . 
He received Nicholas brusquely -LRB- imagining this to be characteristically military -RRB- and questioned him with an important air , as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so . 
Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him . 
From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor . 
The governor was a brisk little man , very simple and affable . 
He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses , recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses , and promised to assist him in every way . 
`` You are Count Ilya Rostov 's son ? 
My wife was a great friend of your mother 's . 
We are at home on Thursdays -- today is Thursday , so please come and see us quite informally , '' said the governor , taking leave of him . 
Immediately on leaving the governor 's , Nicholas hired post horses and , taking his squadron quartermaster with him , drove at a gallop to the landowner , fourteen miles away , who had the stud . 
Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Voronezh and , as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind , everything went well and easily . 
The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor , an old cavalryman , a horse fancier , a sportsman , the possessor of some century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine , who had a snuggery where he smoked , and who owned some splendid horses . 
In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles -- to serve , as he said , as samples of his remounts . 
After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine , Nicholas -- having exchanged kisses with the landowner , with whom he was already on the friendliest terms -- galloped back over abominable roads , in the brightest frame of mind , continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor 's party . 
When he had changed , poured water over his head , and scented himself , Nicholas arrived at the governor 's rather late , but with the phrase `` better late than never '' on his lips . 
It was not a ball , nor had dancing been announced , but everyone knew that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing , and so everyone had come as to a ball . 
Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual , but with this difference , that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow , and as in everything that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable , an `` in for a penny , in for a pound -- who cares ? '' 
spirit , and the inevitable small talk , instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances , now turned on Moscow , the army , and Napoleon . 
The society gathered together at the governor 's was the best in Voronezh . 
There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas ' Moscow acquaintances , but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of St. George , the hussar remount officer , the good-natured and well-bred Count Rostov . 
Among the men was an Italian prisoner , an officer of the French army ; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero . 
The Italian was , as it were , a war trophy . 
Nicholas felt this , it seemed to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light , and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint . 
As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform , diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine , and had uttered the words `` better late than never '' and heard them repeated several times by others , people clustered around him ; all eyes turned on him , and he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the province -- that of a universal favorite : a very pleasant position , and intoxicatingly so after his long privations . 
At posting stations , at inns , and in the landowner 's snuggery , maidservants had been flattered by his notice , and here too at the governor 's party there were -LRB- as it seemed to Nicholas -RRB- an inexhaustible number of pretty young women , married and unmarried , impatiently awaiting his notice . 
The women and girls flirted with him and , from the first day , the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down . 
Among these was the governor 's wife herself , who welcomed Rostov as a near relative and called him `` Nicholas . '' 
Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise , and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility . 
His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all . 
Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening . 
He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form , but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual , something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces . 
All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed , plump and pleasing little blonde , the wife of one of the provincial officials . 
With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men 's wives were created for them , Rostov did not leave the lady 's side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style , as if , without speaking of it , they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together . 
The husband , however , did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov . 
But the latter 's good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas ' good humor . 
Toward the end of the evening , however , as the wife 's face grew more flushed and animated , the husband 's became more and more melancholy and solemn , as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife 's share increased the husband 's diminished . 
Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair , bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face . 
Jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches , diffusing an odor of perfume , and admiring his partner , himself , and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots , Nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in Voronezh . 
`` Which lady ? '' 
`` A charming lady , a divine one . 
Her eyes '' -LRB- Nicholas looked at his partner -RRB- `` are blue , her mouth coral and ivory ; her figure '' -LRB- he glanced at her shoulders -RRB- `` like Diana 's ... '' The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about . 
`` Ah , Nikita Ivanych ! '' 
cried Nicholas , rising politely , and as if wishing Nikita Ivanych to share his joke , he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady . 
The husband smiled gloomily , the wife gaily . 
The governor 's good-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval . 
`` Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you , Nicholas , '' said she , pronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignatyevna was a very important person . 
`` Come , Nicholas ! 
You know you let me call you so ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , Aunt . 
Who is she ? '' 
`` Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva . 
She has heard from her niece how you rescued her ... Can you guess ? '' 
`` I rescued such a lot of them ! '' 
said Nicholas . 
`` Her niece , Princess Bolkonskaya . 
She is here in Voronezh with her aunt . 
Oho ! 
How you blush . 
Why , are ... ? '' 
`` Not a bit ! 
Please do n't , Aunt ! '' 
`` Very well , very well ! 
... Oh , what a fellow you are ! '' 
The governor 's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress , who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town . 
This was Malvintseva , Princess Mary 's aunt on her mother 's side , a rich , childless widow who always lived in Voronezh . 
When Rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game . 
She looked at him and , screwing up her eyes sternly , continued to upbraid the general who had won from her . 
`` Very pleased , mon cher , '' she then said , holding out her hand to Nicholas . 
`` Pray come and see me . '' 
After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father , whom Malvintseva had evidently not liked , and having asked what Nicholas knew of Prince Andrew , who also was evidently no favorite of hers , the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her . 
Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed . 
At the mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear , which he himself did not understand . 
When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing , but the governor 's little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and , saying that she wanted to have a talk with him , led him to her sitting room , from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way . 
`` Do you know , dear boy , '' began the governor 's wife with a serious expression on her kind little face , `` that really would be the match for you : would you like me to arrange it ? '' 
`` Whom do you mean , Aunt ? '' 
asked Nicholas . 
`` I will make a match for you with the princess . 
Catherine Petrovna speaks of Lily , but I say , no -- the princess ! 
Do you want me to do it ? 
I am sure your mother will be grateful to me . 
What a charming girl she is , really ! 
And she is not at all so plain , either . '' 
`` Not at all , '' replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea . 
`` As befits a soldier , Aunt , I do n't force myself on anyone or refuse anything , '' he said before he had time to consider what he was saying . 
`` Well then , remember , this is not a joke ! '' 
`` Of course not ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' the governor 's wife said as if talking to herself . 
`` But , my dear boy , among other things you are too attentive to the other , the blonde . 
One is sorry for the husband , really ... '' `` Oh no , we are good friends with him , '' said Nicholas in the simplicity of his heart ; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else . 
`` But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor 's wife ! '' 
thought Nicholas suddenly at supper . 
`` She will really begin to arrange a match ... and Soyna ... ? '' 
And on taking leave of the governor 's wife , when she again smilingly said to him , `` Well then , remember ! '' 
he drew her aside . 
`` But see here , to tell the truth , Aunt ... '' `` What is it , my dear ? 
Come , let 's sit down here , '' said she . 
Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts -LRB- which he would not have told to his mother , his sister , or his friend -RRB- to this woman who was almost a stranger . 
When he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him , it seemed to him -- as it seems to everyone in such cases -- that it was merely some silly whim that seized him : yet that burst of frankness , together with other trifling events , had immense consequences for him and for all his family . 
`` You see , Aunt , Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress , but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me . '' 
`` Oh yes , I understand , '' said the governor 's wife . 
`` But Princess Bolkonskaya -- that 's another matter . 
I will tell you the truth . 
In the first place I like her very much , I feel drawn to her ; and then , after I met her under such circumstances -- so strangely , the idea often occurred to me : ` This is fate . ' 
Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it ; but I had never happened to meet her before , somehow it had always happened that we did not meet . 
And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her . 
And it must needs happen that I should meet her just when Natasha 's engagement had been broken off ... and then everything ... So you see ... I never told this to anyone and never will , only to you . '' 
The governor 's wife pressed his elbow gratefully . 
`` You know Sonya , my cousin ? 
I love her , and promised to marry her , and will do so ... . 
So you see there can be no question about - '' said Nicholas incoherently and blushing . 
`` My dear boy , what a way to look at it ! 
You know Sonya has nothing and you yourself say your Papa 's affairs are in a very bad way . 
And what about your mother ? 
It would kill her , that 's one thing . 
And what sort of life would it be for Sonya -- if she 's a girl with a heart ? 
Your mother in despair , and you all ruined ... . 
No , my dear , you and Sonya ought to understand that . '' 
Nicholas remained silent . 
It comforted him to hear these arguments . 
`` All the same , Aunt , it is impossible , '' he rejoined with a sigh , after a short pause . 
`` Besides , would the princess have me ? 
And besides , she is now in mourning . 
How can one think of it ! '' 
`` But you do n't suppose I 'm going to get you married at once ? 
There is always a right way of doing things , '' replied the governor 's wife . 
`` What a matchmaker you are , Aunt ... '' said Nicholas , kissing her plump little hand . 
On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov , Princess Mary had found her nephew there with his tutor , and a letter from Prince Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva at Voronezh . 
That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father 's illness , since his death , and especially since her meeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey , anxiety about her brother , settling in a new house , meeting new people , and attending to her nephew 's education . 
She was sad . 
Now , after a month passed in quiet surroundings , she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia . 
She was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother , the only intimate person now remaining to her , was exposed . 
She was worried too about her nephew 's education for which she had always felt herself incompetent , but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace -- a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with Rostov . 
The day after her party the governor 's wife came to see Malvintseva and , after discussing her plan with the aunt , remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was , of course , not to be thought of , all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another . 
Malvintseva expressed approval , and the governor 's wife began to speak of Rostov in Mary 's presence , praising him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary 's name was mentioned . 
But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling -- her mental tranquillity was destroyed , and desires , doubts , self-reproach , and hopes reawoke . 
During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called , Princess Mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him . 
First she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt -- that it would not be proper for her , in her deep mourning , to receive visitors ; then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her ; then it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor 's wife had intentions concerning herself and Rostov -- their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition -- then she told herself that only she , with her sinful nature , could think this of them : they could not forget that situated as she was , while still wearing deep mourning , such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her father 's memory . 
Assuming that she did go down to see him , Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him , and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much . 
More than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him . 
But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that Count Rostov had called , the princess showed no confusion , only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light . 
`` You have met him , Aunt ? '' 
said she in a calm voice , unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural . 
When Rostov entered the room , the princess dropped her eyes for an instant , as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt , and then just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes . 
With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure , held out her slender , delicate hand to him , and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated . 
Mademoiselle Bourienne , who was in the drawing room , looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise . 
Herself a consummate coquette , she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract . 
`` Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it . 
And above all , what tact and grace ! '' 
thought Mademoiselle Bourienne . 
Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment , she would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself . 
From the moment she recognized that dear , loved face , a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will . 
From the time Rostov entered , her face became suddenly transformed . 
It was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate , skillful , artistic work on its sides , that previously seemed dark , coarse , and meaningless , was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty . 
For the first time all that pure , spiritual , inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface . 
All her inward labor , her dissatisfaction with herself , her sufferings , her strivings after goodness , her meekness , love , and self-sacrifice -- all this now shone in those radiant eyes , in her delicate smile , and in every trait of her gentle face . 
Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life . 
He felt that the being before him was quite different from , and better than , anyone he had met before , and above all better than himself . 
Their conversation was very simple and unimportant . 
They spoke of the war , and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it ; they spoke of their last meeting -- Nicholas trying to change the subject -- they talked of the governor 's kind wife , of Nicholas ' relations , and of Princess Mary 's . 
She did not talk about her brother , diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew . 
Evidently she could speak of Russia 's misfortunes with a certain artificiality , but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him . 
Nicholas noticed this , as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary 's character with an observation unusual to him , and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being . 
Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess -LRB- as she did when he was mentioned -RRB- and even when he thought of her , but in her presence he felt quite at ease , and said not at all what he had prepared , but what , quite appropriately , occurred to him at the moment . 
When a pause occurred during his short visit , Nicholas , as is usual when there are children , turned to Prince Andrew 's little son , caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar . 
He took the boy on his knee , played with him , and looked round at Princess Mary . 
With a softened , happy , timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved . 
Nicholas also noticed that look and , as if understanding it , flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness . 
As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society , and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again ; but all the same the governor 's wife went on with her matchmaking , passing on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa , and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary . 
For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop 's house before Mass. . 
Though Rostov told the governeor 's wife that he would not make any declaration to Princess Mary , he promised to go . 
As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right , so now , after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice , and in obedient submission to circumstances , he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where . 
He knew that after his promise to Sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to Princess Mary . 
And he knew that he would never act basely . 
But he also knew -LRB- or rather felt at the bottom of his heart -RRB- that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him , he was not only doing nothing wrong , but was doing something very important -- more important than anything he had ever done in his life . 
After meeting Princess Mary , though the course of his life went on externally as before , all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her . 
But he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society , nor as he had for a long time , and at one time rapturously , thought about Sonya . 
He had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do , that is , as a possible wife , adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life : a white dressing gown , his wife at the tea table , his wife 's carriage , little ones , Mamma and Papa , their relations to her , and so on -- and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure . 
But with Princess Mary , to whom they were trying to get him engaged , he could never picture anything of future married life . 
If he tried , his pictures seemed incongruous and false . 
It made him afraid . 
The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino , of our losses in killed and wounded , and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached Voronezh in the middle of September . 
Princess Mary , having learned of her brother 's wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of him , prepared -LRB- so Nicholas heard , he had not seen her again himself -RRB- to set off in search of Prince Andrew . 
When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the abandonment of Moscow , Rostov was not seized with despair , anger , the desire for vengeance , or any feeling of that kind , but everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome , and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness . 
The conversations he heard seemed to him insincere ; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him . 
He made haste to finish buying the horses , and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster . 
A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving , at which Nicholas was present , was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory . 
He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service , meditating on a great variety of subjects . 
When the service was over the governor 's wife beckoned him to her . 
`` Have you seen the princess ? '' 
she asked , indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side , beyond the choir . 
Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude , timidity , and pity that immediately overcame him . 
Princess Mary , evidently engrossed by her thoughts , was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church . 
Nicholas looked at her face with surprise . 
It was the same face he had seen before , there was the same general expression of refined , inner , spiritual labor , but now it was quite differently lit up . 
There was a pathetic expression of sorrow , prayer , and hope in it . 
As had occurred before when she was present , Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor 's wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church , and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul . 
As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face , lighting up both her sorrow and her joy . 
`` There is one thing I wanted to tell you , Princess , '' said Rostov . 
`` It is that if your brother , Prince Andrew Nikolievich , were not living , it would have been at once announced in the Gazette , as he is a colonel . '' 
The princess looked at him , not grasping what he was saying , but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face . 
`` And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound '' -LRB- the Gazette said it was a shell -RRB- `` either proving fatal at once or being very slight , '' continued Nicholas . 
`` We must hope for the best , and I am sure ... '' Princess Mary interrupted him . 
`` Oh , that would be so dread ... '' she began and , prevented by agitation from finishing , she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and , looking up at him gratefully , went out , following her aunt . 
That evening Nicholas did not go out , but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers . 
When he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed , and for a long time he paced up and down the room , reflecting on his life , a thing he rarely did . 
Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in Smolensk province . 
His having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances , and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match , had drawn his particular attention to her . 
When he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful . 
Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time . 
He was , however , preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her . 
But that day 's encounter in church had , he felt , sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind . 
That pale , sad , refined face , that radiant look , those gentle graceful gestures , and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy . 
In men Rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life -LRB- that was why he did not like Prince Andrew -RRB- and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess , but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction . 
`` She must be a wonderful woman . 
A real angel ! '' 
he said to himself . 
`` Why am I not free ? 
Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya ? '' 
And he involuntarily compared the two : the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other -- a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly . 
He tried to picture what would happen were he free . 
How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife . 
But no , he could not imagine that . 
He felt awed , and no clear picture presented itself to his mind . 
He had long ago pictured to himself a future with Sonya , and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sonya , but it was impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary , because he did not understand her but simply loved her . 
Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them , but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening . 
`` How she prayed ! '' 
he thought . 
`` It was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer . 
Yes , that was the prayer that moves mountains , and I am sure her prayer will be answered . 
Why do n't I pray for what I want ? '' 
he suddenly thought . 
`` What do I want ? 
To be free , released from Sonya ... She was right , '' he thought , remembering what the governor 's wife had said : `` Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya . 
Muddles , grief for Mamma ... business difficulties ... muddles , terrible muddles ! 
Besides , I do n't love her -- not as I should . 
O , God ! 
release me from this dreadful , inextricable position ! '' 
he suddenly began to pray . 
`` Yes , prayer can move mountains , but one must have faith and not pray as Natasha and I used to as children , that the snow might turn into sugar -- and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so . 
No , but I am not praying for trifles now , '' he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner , and folding his hands placed himself before the icon . 
Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time . 
Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and Lavrushka came in with some papers . 
`` Blockhead ! 
Why do you come in without being called ? '' 
cried Nicholas , quickly changing his attitude . 
`` From the governor , '' said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice . 
`` A courier has arrived and there 's a letter for you . '' 
`` Well , all right , thanks . 
You can go ! '' 
Nicholas took the two letters , one of which was from his mother and the other from Sonya . 
He recognized them by the handwriting and opened Sonya 's first . 
He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy . 
`` No , it 's not possible ! '' 
he cried aloud . 
Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it . 
He glanced through it , then read it again , and then again , and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders , stretching out his hands , with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed . 
What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear him had come to pass ; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected , and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he had prayed , but by some ordinary coincidence . 
This unexpected and , as it seemed to Nicholas , quite voluntary letter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape . 
She wrote that the last unfortunate events -- the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs ' Moscow property -- and the countess ' repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya , together with his silence and coldness of late , had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free . 
It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me -LRB- she wrote -RRB- , and my love has no aim but the happiness of those I love ; so , Nicholas , I beg you to consider yourself free , and to be assured that , in spite of everything , no one can love you more than does Your Sonya Both letters were written from Troitsa . 
The other , from the countess , described their last days in Moscow , their departure , the fire , and the destruction of all their property . 
In this letter the countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them ; his state was very critical , but the doctor said there was now more hope . 
Sonya and Natasha were nursing him . 
Next day Nicholas took his mother 's letter and went to see Princess Mary . 
Neither he nor she said a word about what `` Natasha nursing him '' might mean , but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations . 
The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yaroslavl , and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment . 
Sonya 's letter written from Troitsa , which had come as an answer to Nicholas ' prayer , was prompted by this : the thought of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess ' mind more and more . 
She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening , and Sonya 's life in the countess ' house had grown harder and harder , especially after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo . 
The countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya . 
But a few days before they left Moscow , moved and excited by all that was going on , she called Sonya to her and , instead of reproaching and making demands on her , tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with Nicholas . 
`` I shall not be at peace till you promise me this . '' 
Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything , but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her . 
She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up . 
To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya 's habit . 
Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth , and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it . 
But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others , and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world . 
But now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life . 
And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully ; she felt jealous of Natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort , had never needed to sacrifice herself , but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody . 
And for the first time Sonya felt that out of her pure , quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle , virtue , or religion . 
Under the influence of this feeling Sonya , whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive , having answered the countess in vague general terms , avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas , not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever . 
The bustle and terror of the Rostovs ' last days in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya . 
She was glad to find escape from them in practical activity . 
But when she heard of Prince Andrew 's presence in their house , despite her sincere pity for him and for Natasha , she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas . 
She knew that Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him . 
She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another , and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity . 
Despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey , this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered Sonya .
