Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt ; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin . 
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail . 
Aouda was safe ; and Phileas Fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . 
Fix was slightly wounded in the arm . 
But Passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down Aouda 's cheeks . 
All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood . 
From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh . 
As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible . 
The last Sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of Republican River . 
Mr. Fogg , with folded arms , remained motionless . 
He had a serious decision to make . 
Aouda , standing near him , looked at him without speaking , and he understood her look . 
If his servant was a prisoner , ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians ? 
`` I will find him , living or dead , '' said he quietly to Aouda . 
`` Ah , Mr. -- Mr. Fogg ! '' 
cried she , clasping his hands and covering them with tears . 
`` Living , '' added Mr. Fogg , `` if we do not lose a moment . '' 
Phileas Fogg , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom . 
The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at New York , and his bet would be certainly lost . 
But as he thought , `` It is my duty , '' he did not hesitate . 
The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there . 
A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the Sioux attack it . 
`` Sir , '' said Mr. Fogg to the captain , `` three passengers have disappeared . '' 
`` Dead ? '' 
asked the captain . 
`` Dead or prisoners ; that is the uncertainty which must be solved . 
Do you propose to pursue the Sioux ? '' 
`` That 's a serious thing to do , sir , '' returned the captain . 
`` These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas , and I can not leave the fort unprotected . '' 
`` The lives of three men are in question , sir , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
`` Doubtless ; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three ? '' 
`` I do n't know whether you can , sir ; but you ought to do so . '' 
`` Nobody here , '' returned the other , `` has a right to teach me my duty . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Mr. Fogg , coldly . 
`` I will go alone . '' 
`` You , sir ! '' 
cried Fix , coming up ; `` you go alone in pursuit of the Indians ? '' 
`` Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish -- him to whom every one present owes his life ? 
I shall go . '' 
`` No , sir , you shall not go alone , '' cried the captain , touched in spite of himself . 
`` No ! 
you are a brave man . 
Thirty volunteers ! '' 
he added , turning to the soldiers . 
The whole company started forward at once . 
The captain had only to pick his men . 
Thirty were chosen , and an old sergeant placed at their head . 
`` Thanks , captain , '' said Mr. Fogg . 
`` Will you let me go with you ? '' 
asked Fix .
