`` You are going to put to sea ? '' 
`` In an hour . '' 
`` You are bound for -- '' `` Bordeaux . '' 
`` And your cargo ? '' 
`` No freight . 
Going in ballast . '' 
`` Have you any passengers ? '' 
`` No passengers . 
Never have passengers . 
Too much in the way . '' 
`` Is your vessel a swift one ? '' 
`` Between eleven and twelve knots . 
The Henrietta , well known . '' 
`` Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool ? '' 
`` To Liverpool ? 
Why not to China ? '' 
`` I said Liverpool . '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` No ? '' 
`` No . 
I am setting out for Bordeaux , and shall go to Bordeaux . '' 
`` Money is no object ? '' 
`` None . '' 
The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply . 
`` But the owners of the Henrietta -- '' resumed Phileas Fogg . 
`` The owners are myself , '' replied the captain . 
`` The vessel belongs to me . '' 
`` I will freight it for you . '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I will buy it of you . '' 
`` No . '' 
Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment ; but the situation was a grave one . 
It was not at New York as at Hong Kong , nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere . 
Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle . 
Now money failed . 
Still , some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat , unless by balloon -- which would have been venturesome , besides not being capable of being put in practice . 
It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea , for he said to the captain , `` Well , will you carry me to Bordeaux ? '' 
`` No , not if you paid me two hundred dollars . '' 
`` I offer you two thousand . '' 
`` Apiece ? '' 
`` Apiece . '' 
`` And there are four of you ? '' 
`` Four . '' 
Captain Speedy began to scratch his head . 
There were eight thousand dollars to gain , without changing his route ; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers . 
Besides , passenger 's at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers , but valuable merchandise . 
`` I start at nine o'clock , '' said Captain Speedy , simply . 
`` Are you and your party ready ? '' 
`` We will be on board at nine o'clock , '' replied , no less simply , Mr. Fogg . 
It was half-past eight .
