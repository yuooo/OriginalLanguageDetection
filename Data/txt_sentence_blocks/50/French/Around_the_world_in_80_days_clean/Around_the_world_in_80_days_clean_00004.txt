The papers and clubs were full of the affair , and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit ; and the Reform Club was especially agitated , several of its members being Bank officials . 
Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain , for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity . 
But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence ; and , as they placed themselves at the whist-table , they continued to argue the matter . 
Stuart and Flanagan played together , while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner . 
As the game proceeded the conversation ceased , excepting between the rubbers , when it revived again . 
`` I maintain , '' said Stuart , `` that the chances are in favour of the thief , who must be a shrewd fellow . '' 
`` Well , but where can he fly to ? '' 
asked Ralph . 
`` No country is safe for him . '' 
`` Pshaw ! '' 
`` Where could he go , then ? '' 
`` Oh , I do n't know that . 
The world is big enough . '' 
`` It was once , '' said Phileas Fogg , in a low tone . 
`` Cut , sir , '' he added , handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan . 
The discussion fell during the rubber , after which Stuart took up its thread . 
`` What do you mean by ` once ' ? 
Has the world grown smaller ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' returned Ralph . 
`` I agree with Mr. Fogg . 
The world has grown smaller , since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago . 
And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed . '' 
`` And also why the thief can get away more easily . '' 
`` Be so good as to play , Mr. Stuart , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced , and when the hand was finished , said eagerly : `` You have a strange way , Ralph , of proving that the world has grown smaller . 
So , because you can go round it in three months -- '' `` In eighty days , '' interrupted Phileas Fogg . 
`` That is true , gentlemen , '' added John Sullivan . 
`` Only eighty days , now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad , on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway , has been opened . 
Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph : From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi , by rail and steamboats ... 7 days From Suez to Bombay , by steamer ... 13 '' From Bombay to Calcutta , by rail ... 3 '' From Calcutta to Hong Kong , by steamer ... 13 '' From Hong Kong to Yokohama -LRB- Japan -RRB- , by steamer ... 6 '' From Yokohama to San Francisco , by steamer ... 22 '' From San Francisco to New York , by rail ... 7 '' From New York to London , by steamer and rail ... 9 '' -- Total ... 80 days . '' 
`` Yes , in eighty days ! '' 
exclaimed Stuart , who in his excitement made a false deal . 
`` But that does n't take into account bad weather , contrary winds , shipwrecks , railway accidents , and so on . '' 
`` All included , '' returned Phileas Fogg , continuing to play despite the discussion . 
`` But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails , '' replied Stuart ; `` suppose they stop the trains , pillage the luggage-vans , and scalp the passengers ! '' 
`` All included , '' calmly retorted Fogg ; adding , as he threw down the cards , `` Two trumps . '' 
Stuart , whose turn it was to deal , gathered them up , and went on : `` You are right , theoretically , Mr. Fogg , but practically -- '' `` Practically also , Mr. Stuart . '' 
`` I 'd like to see you do it in eighty days . '' 
`` It depends on you . 
Shall we go ? '' 
`` Heaven preserve me ! 
But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey , made under these conditions , is impossible . '' 
`` Quite possible , on the contrary , '' returned Mr. Fogg . 
`` Well , make it , then ! '' 
`` The journey round the world in eighty days ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` I should like nothing better . '' 
`` When ? '' 
`` At once . 
Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense . '' 
`` It 's absurd ! ''
