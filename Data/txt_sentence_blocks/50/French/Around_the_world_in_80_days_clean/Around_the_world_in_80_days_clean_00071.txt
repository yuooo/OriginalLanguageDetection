The anxiety in which , for three days , London society existed , can not be described . 
Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg . 
Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening . 
No news . 
The police were ignorant what had become of the detective , Fix , who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent . 
Bets increased , nevertheless , in number and value . 
Phileas Fogg , like a racehorse , was drawing near his last turning-point . 
The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five ; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour . 
A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the Reform Club . 
Circulation was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on . 
The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch . 
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club . 
John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , the bankers , Andrew Stuart , the engineer , Gauthier Ralph , the director of the Bank of England , and Thomas Flanagan , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously . 
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , Andrew Stuart got up , saying , `` Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired . '' 
`` What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool ? '' 
asked Thomas Flanagan . 
`` At twenty-three minutes past seven , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve . '' 
`` Well , gentlemen , '' resumed Andrew Stuart , `` if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train , he would have got here by this time . 
We can , therefore , regard the bet as won . '' 
`` Wait ; do n't let us be too hasty , '' replied Samuel Fallentin . 
`` You know that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric . 
His punctuality is well known ; he never arrives too soon , or too late ; and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute . '' 
`` Why , '' said Andrew Stuart nervously , `` if I should see him , I should not believe it was he . '' 
`` The fact is , '' resumed Thomas Flanagan , `` Mr. Fogg 's project was absurdly foolish . 
Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur ; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour . '' 
`` Observe , too , '' added John Sullivan , `` that we have received no intelligence from him , though there are telegraphic lines all along is route . '' 
`` He has lost , gentleman , '' said Andrew Stuart , `` he has a hundred times lost ! 
You know , besides , that the China the only steamer he could have taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday . 
I have seen a list of the passengers , and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among them . 
Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him , he can scarcely have reached America . 
I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand . '' 
`` It is clear , '' replied Gauthier Ralph ; `` and we have nothing to do but to present Mr. Fogg 's cheque at Barings to-morrow . '' 
At this moment , the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine . 
`` Five minutes more , '' said Andrew Stuart . 
The five gentlemen looked at each other . 
Their anxiety was becoming intense ; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to Mr. Fallentin 's proposal of a rubber . 
`` I would n't give up my four thousand of the bet , '' said Andrew Stuart , as he took his seat , `` for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine . '' 
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine . 
The players took up their cards , but could not keep their eyes off the clock . 
Certainly , however secure they felt , minutes had never seemed so long to them ! 
`` Seventeen minutes to nine , '' said Thomas Flanagan , as he cut the cards which Ralph handed to him . 
Then there was a moment of silence . 
The great saloon was perfectly quiet ; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard , with now and then a shrill cry . 
The pendulum beat the seconds , which each player eagerly counted , as he listened , with mathematical regularity . 
`` Sixteen minutes to nine ! '' 
said John Sullivan , in a voice which betrayed his emotion . 
One minute more , and the wager would be won . 
Andrew Stuart and his partners suspended their game . 
They left their cards , and counted the seconds . 
At the fortieth second , nothing .
