`` When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal ; then your existence would have been free and happy . 
But now I am ruined . '' 
`` I know it , Mr. Fogg , '' replied Aouda ; `` and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows ? 
-- for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? '' 
`` Madam , you could not remain in India , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you . '' 
`` So , Mr. Fogg , '' resumed Aouda , `` not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? '' 
`` Yes , madam ; but circumstances have been against me . 
Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service . '' 
`` But what will become of you , Mr. Fogg ? '' 
`` As for me , madam , '' replied the gentleman , coldly , `` I have need of nothing . '' 
`` But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ? '' 
`` As I am in the habit of doing . '' 
`` At least , '' said Aouda , `` want should not overtake a man like you . 
Your friends -- '' `` I have no friends , madam . '' 
`` Your relatives -- '' `` I have no longer any relatives . '' 
`` I pity you , then , Mr. Fogg , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs . 
They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience . '' 
`` They say so , madam . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , '' said Aouda , rising and seizing his hand , `` do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ? 
Will you have me for your wife ? '' 
Mr. Fogg , at this , rose in his turn . 
There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips . 
Aouda looked into his face . 
The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him . 
He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look . 
When he opened them again , `` I love you ! '' 
he said , simply . 
`` Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Aouda , pressing his hand to her heart . 
Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately . 
Mr. Fogg still held Aouda 's hand in his own ; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith . 
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson , of Marylebone parish , that evening . 
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile , and said , `` Never too late . '' 
It was five minutes past eight . 
`` Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ? '' 
`` For to-morrow , Monday , '' said Mr. Fogg , turning to Aouda . 
`` Yes ; for to-morrow , Monday , '' she replied . 
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him . 
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG 'S NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON ` CHANGE It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber , a certain James Strand , had been arrested , on the 17th day of December , at Edinburgh . 
Three days before , Phileas Fogg had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police ; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world . 
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager ; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic ; the `` Phileas Fogg bonds '' again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made . 
Phileas Fogg 's name was once more at a premium on ` Change . 
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense . 
Would Phileas Fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes ! 
Where was he at this moment ? 
The 17th of December , the day of James Strand 's arrest , was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg 's departure , and no news of him had been received . 
Was he dead ? 
Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ? 
And would he appear on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon ?
