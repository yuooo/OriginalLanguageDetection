An English criminal , you know , is always better concealed in London than anywhere else . '' 
This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office . 
Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia . 
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . 
But Fix 's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia . 
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer . 
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road . 
She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay . 
Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . 
Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . 
Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . 
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard . 
`` Is this your passport ? '' 
asked he . 
`` No , it 's my master 's . '' 
`` And your master is -- '' `` He stayed on board . '' 
`` But he must go to the consul 's in person , so as to establish his identity . '' 
`` Oh , is that necessary ? '' 
`` Quite indispensable . '' 
`` And where is the consulate ? '' 
`` There , on the corner of the square , '' said Fix , pointing to a house two hundred steps off . 
`` I 'll go and fetch my master , who wo n't be much pleased , however , to be disturbed . '' 
The passenger bowed to Fix , and returned to the steamer . 
WHICH ONCE MORE DEMONSTRATES THE USELESSNESS OF PASSPORTS AS AIDS TO DETECTIVES The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consul 's office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official . 
`` Consul , '' said he , without preamble , `` I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia . '' 
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport . 
`` Well , Mr. Fix , '' replied the consul , `` I shall not be sorry to see the rascal 's face ; but perhaps he wo n't come here -- that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be . 
A robber does n't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him ; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned . '' 
`` If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come . '' 
`` To have his passport visaed ? '' 
`` Yes . 
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues . 
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do ; but I hope you will not visa the passport . '' 
`` Why not ? 
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse . '' 
`` Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London . '' 
`` Ah , that 's your look-out . 
But I can not -- '' The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay . 
The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it . 
The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst Fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room . 
`` You are Mr. Phileas Fogg ? '' 
said the consul , after reading the passport . 
`` I am . '' 
`` And this man is your servant ? '' 
`` He is : a Frenchman , named Passepartout . '' 
`` You are from London ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And you are going -- '' `` To Bombay . '' 
`` Very good , sir . 
You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? ''
