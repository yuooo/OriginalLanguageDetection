A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather ! 
It does n't vary five minutes in the year . 
It 's a perfect chronometer , look you . '' 
`` I see how it is , '' said Fix . 
`` You have kept London time , which is two hours behind that of Suez . 
You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country . '' 
`` I regulate my watch ? 
Never ! '' 
`` Well , then , it will not agree with the sun . '' 
`` So much the worse for the sun , monsieur . 
The sun will be wrong , then ! '' 
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture . 
After a few minutes silence , Fix resumed : `` You left London hastily , then ? '' 
`` I rather think so ! 
Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening , Monsieur Fogg came home from his club , and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off . '' 
`` But where is your master going ? '' 
`` Always straight ahead . 
He is going round the world . '' 
`` Round the world ? '' 
cried Fix . 
`` Yes , and in eighty days ! 
He says it is on a wager ; but , between us , I do n't believe a word of it . 
That would n't be common sense . 
There 's something else in the wind . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Mr. Fogg is a character , is he ? '' 
`` I should say he was . '' 
`` Is he rich ? '' 
`` No doubt , for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him . 
And he does n't spare the money on the way , either : he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time . '' 
`` And you have known your master a long time ? '' 
`` Why , no ; I entered his service the very day we left London . '' 
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . 
The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed Fix in his theory . 
He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in London , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . 
Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez , but was really going on to Bombay . 
`` Is Bombay far from here ? '' 
asked Passepartout . 
`` Pretty far . 
It is a ten days ' voyage by sea . '' 
`` And in what country is Bombay ? '' 
`` India . '' 
`` In Asia ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` The deuce ! 
I was going to tell you there 's one thing that worries me -- my burner ! '' 
`` What burner ? '' 
`` My gas-burner , which I forgot to turn off , and which is at this moment burning at my expense . 
I have calculated , monsieur , that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours , exactly sixpense more than I earn ; and you will understand that the longer our journey -- '' Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout 's trouble about the gas ? 
It is not probable .
