`` I know it , sir , '' replied Phileas Fogg ; `` but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by Suez . '' 
`` Very well , sir . '' 
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal . 
Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant . 
`` Well ? '' 
queried the detective . 
`` Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , '' replied the consul . 
`` Possibly ; but that is not the question . 
Do you think , consul , that this phelgmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ? '' 
`` I concede that ; but then , you know , all descriptions -- '' `` I 'll make certain of it , '' interrupted Fix . 
`` The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master ; besides , he 's a Frenchman , and ca n't help talking . 
Excuse me for a little while , consul . '' 
Fix started off in search of Passepartout . 
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin . 
He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda : `` Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8.45 p.m. `` Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7.20 a.m. `` Left Paris , Thursday , at 8.40 a.m. `` Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6.35 a.m. `` Left Turin , Friday , at 7.20 a.m. `` Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p.m. `` Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p.m. `` Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a.m. `` Total of hours spent , 158 + ; or , in days , six days and a half . '' 
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London -- from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . 
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time . 
On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . 
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics . 
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE , PERHAPS , THAN IS PRUDENT Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything . 
`` Well , my friend , '' said the detective , coming up with him , `` is your passport visaed ? '' 
`` Ah , it 's you , is it , monsieur ? '' 
responded Passepartout . 
`` Thanks , yes , the passport is all right . '' 
`` And you are looking about you ? '' 
`` Yes ; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream . 
So this is Suez ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` In Egypt ? '' 
`` Certainly , in Egypt . '' 
`` And in Africa ? '' 
`` In Africa . '' 
`` In Africa ! '' 
repeated Passepartout . 
`` Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris ; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the Northern and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain ! 
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees ! '' 
`` You are in a great hurry , then ? '' 
`` I am not , but my master is . 
By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts . 
We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag . '' 
`` I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want . '' 
`` Really , monsieur , you are very kind . '' 
And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along . 
`` Above all , '' said he ; `` do n't let me lose the steamer . '' 
`` You have plenty of time ; it 's only twelve o'clock . '' 
Passepartout pulled out his big watch . 
`` Twelve ! '' 
he exclaimed ; `` why , it 's only eight minutes before ten . '' 
`` Your watch is slow . '' 
`` My watch ?
