It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one . 
The train stopped , at eight o'clock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal , where there were several bungalows , and workmen 's cabins . 
The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , `` Passengers will get out here ! '' 
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias . 
Passepartout , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying : `` Monsieur , no more railway ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` I mean to say that the train is n't going on . '' 
The general at once stepped out , while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor . 
`` Where are we ? '' 
asked Sir Francis . 
`` At the hamlet of Kholby . '' 
`` Do we stop here ? '' 
`` Certainly . 
The railway is n't finished . '' 
`` What ! 
not finished ? '' 
`` No . 
There 's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad , where the line begins again . '' 
`` But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout . '' 
`` What would you have , officer ? 
The papers were mistaken . '' 
`` Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta , '' retorted Sir Francis , who was growing warm . 
`` No doubt , '' replied the conductor ; `` but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad . '' 
Sir Francis was furious . 
Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down , and did not dare to look at his master . 
`` Sir Francis , '' said Mr. Fogg quietly , `` we will , if you please , look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad . '' 
`` Mr. Fogg , this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage . '' 
`` No , Sir Francis ; it was foreseen . '' 
`` What ! 
You knew that the way -- '' `` Not at all ; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route . 
Nothing , therefore , is lost . 
I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice . 
A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon , on the 25th . 
This is the 22nd , and we shall reach Calcutta in time . '' 
There was nothing to say to so confident a response . 
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . 
The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . 
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . 
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything . 
`` I shall go afoot , '' said Phileas Fogg . 
Passepartout , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail Indian shoes . 
Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moment 's hesitation , said , `` Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` An elephant ! 
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here . '' 
`` Let 's go and see the elephant , '' replied Mr. Fogg . 
They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question . 
An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure . 
The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .
