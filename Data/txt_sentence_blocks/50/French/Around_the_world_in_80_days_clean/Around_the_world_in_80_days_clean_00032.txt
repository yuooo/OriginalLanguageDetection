Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep . 
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer , porter , gin , and brandy ; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose . 
From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed . 
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots . 
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity ! 
The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws . 
It passed gradually from the rich , to whom it was at first exclusively reserved , to the lower classes , and then its ravages could not be arrested . 
Opium is smoked everywhere , at all times , by men and women , in the Celestial Empire ; and , once accustomed to it , the victims can not dispense with it , except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies . 
A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day ; but he dies in five years . 
It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout , in search of a friendly glass , found themselves . 
Passepartout had no money , but willingly accepted Fix 's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time . 
They ordered two bottles of port , to which the Frenchman did ample justice , whilst Fix observed him with close attention . 
They chatted about the journey , and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them . 
When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic . 
Fix caught him by the arm , and said , `` Wait a moment . '' 
`` What for , Mr. Fix ? '' 
`` I want to have a serious talk with you . '' 
`` A serious talk ! '' 
cried Passepartout , drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass . 
`` Well , we 'll talk about it to-morrow ; I have n't time now . '' 
`` Stay ! 
What I have to say concerns your master . '' 
Passepartout , at this , looked attentively at his companion . 
Fix 's face seemed to have a singular expression . 
He resumed his seat . 
`` What is it that you have to say ? '' 
Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout 's arm , and , lowering his voice , said , `` You have guessed who I am ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
said Passepartout , smiling . 
`` Then I 'm going to tell you everything -- '' `` Now that I know everything , my friend ! 
Ah ! 
that 's very good . 
But go on , go on . 
First , though , let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense . '' 
`` Useless ! '' 
said Fix . 
`` You speak confidently . 
It 's clear that you do n't know how large the sum is . '' 
`` Of course I do , '' returned Passepartout . 
`` Twenty thousand pounds . '' 
`` Fifty-five thousand ! '' 
answered Fix , pressing his companion 's hand . 
`` What ! '' 
cried the Frenchman . 
`` Has Monsieur Fogg dared -- fifty-five thousand pounds ! 
Well , there 's all the more reason for not losing an instant , '' he continued , getting up hastily . 
Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair , and resumed : `` Fifty-five thousand pounds ; and if I succeed , I get two thousand pounds . 
If you 'll help me , I 'll let you have five hundred of them . '' 
`` Help you ? '' 
cried Passepartout , whose eyes were standing wide open .
