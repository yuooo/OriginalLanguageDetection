`` Yes ; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days . '' 
`` Why , what are you saying ? 
Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour , but they must try to put obstacles in his way ! 
I blush for them ! '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery . 
They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets ! '' 
`` That 's just what we count on doing . '' 
`` It 's a conspiracy , then , '' cried Passepartout , who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head , for he drank without perceiving it . 
`` A real conspiracy ! 
And gentlemen , too . 
Bah ! '' 
Fix began to be puzzled . 
`` Members of the Reform Club ! '' 
continued Passepartout . 
`` You must know , Monsieur Fix , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly ! '' 
`` But who do you think I am ? '' 
asked Fix , looking at him intently . 
`` Parbleu ! 
An agent of the members of the Reform Club , sent out here to interrupt my master 's journey . 
But , though I found you out some time ago , I 've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg . '' 
`` He knows nothing , then ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Passepartout , again emptying his glass . 
The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again . 
What should he do ? 
Passepartout 's mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult . 
It was evident that the servant was not the master 's accomplice , as Fix had been inclined to suspect . 
`` Well , '' said the detective to himself , `` as he is not an accomplice , he will help me . '' 
He had no time to lose : Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it . 
`` Listen to me , '' said Fix abruptly . 
`` I am not , as you think , an agent of the members of the Reform Club -- '' `` Bah ! '' 
retorted Passepartout , with an air of raillery . 
`` I am a police detective , sent out here by the London office . '' 
`` You , a detective ? '' 
`` I will prove it . 
Here is my commission . '' 
Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document , the genuineness of which could not be doubted . 
`` Mr. Fogg 's wager , '' resumed Fix , `` is only a pretext , of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes . 
He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity . '' 
`` But why ? '' 
`` Listen . 
On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured . 
Here is his description ; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg . '' 
`` What nonsense ! '' 
cried Passepartout , striking the table with his fist . 
`` My master is the most honourable of men ! '' 
`` How can you tell ? 
You know scarcely anything about him . 
You went into his service the day he came away ; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes . 
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man ! ''
