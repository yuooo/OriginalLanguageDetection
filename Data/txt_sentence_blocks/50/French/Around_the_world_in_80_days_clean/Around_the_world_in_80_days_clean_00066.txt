By all the devils , no ! '' 
`` But I shall be obliged to burn her . '' 
`` Burn the Henrietta ! '' 
`` Yes ; at least the upper part of her . 
The coal has given out . '' 
`` Burn my vessel ! '' 
cried Captain Speedy , who could scarcely pronounce the words . 
`` A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars ! '' 
`` Here are sixty thousand , '' replied Phileas Fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills . 
This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy . 
An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars . 
The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger . 
The Henrietta was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain . 
The bomb would not go off after all . 
Mr. Fogg had taken away the match . 
`` And I shall still have the iron hull , '' said the captain in a softer tone . 
`` The iron hull and the engine . 
Is it agreed ? '' 
`` Agreed . '' 
And Andrew Speedy , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket . 
During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit . 
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft ! 
It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank . 
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr. Fogg said to him , `` Do n't let this astonish you , sir . 
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December . 
I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool -- '' `` And I did well ! '' 
cried Andrew Speedy ; `` for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it ! '' 
He added , more sedately , `` Do you know one thing , Captain -- '' `` Fogg . '' 
`` Captain Fogg , you 've got something of the Yankee about you . '' 
And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr. Fogg said , `` The vessel now belongs to me ? '' 
`` Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts -- all the wood , that is . '' 
`` Very well . 
Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . '' 
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed . 
On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires . 
Passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . 
There was a perfect rage for demolition . 
The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk . 
But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light . 
By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown . 
Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London ; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool , with all steam on . 
And the steam was about to give out altogether ! 
`` Sir , '' said Captain Speedy , who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg 's project , `` I really commiserate you . 
Everything is against you . 
We are only opposite Queenstown . '' 
`` Ah , '' said Mr. Fogg , `` is that place where we see the lights Queenstown ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Can we enter the harbour ? '' 
`` Not under three hours . 
Only at high tide . ''
