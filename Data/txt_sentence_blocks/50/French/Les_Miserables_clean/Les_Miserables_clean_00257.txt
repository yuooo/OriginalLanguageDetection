Jean Valjean , as in the first instance , contented himself with saying , `` Impossible . '' 
Fauchelevent grumbled , more to himself than to Jean Valjean : -- `` There is another thing which bothers me . 
I have said that I would put earth in it . 
When I come to think it over , the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing , it wo n't do , it will get displaced , it will move about . 
The men will bear it . 
You understand , Father Madeleine , the government will notice it . '' 
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving . 
Fauchelevent went on : -- `` How the de -- uce are you going to get out ? 
It must all be done by to-morrow morning . 
It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in . 
The prioress expects you . '' 
Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he , Fauchelevent , was to render to the community . 
That it fell among his duties to take part in their burials , that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery . 
That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed , and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel . 
That the police regulations forbade this , but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused . 
That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased . 
That it was so much the worse for the government . 
That he , Fauchelevent , was to nail up the coffin in the cell , raise the stone in the chapel , and lower the corpse into the vault . 
And that , by way of thanks , the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener , and his niece as a pupil . 
That his brother was M. Madeleine , and that his niece was Cosette . 
That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening , after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery . 
But that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside . 
That that was the first problem . 
And then , that there was another : the empty coffin . '' 
`` What is that empty coffin ? '' 
asked Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent replied : -- `` The coffin of the administration . '' 
`` What coffin ? 
What administration ? '' 
`` A nun dies . 
The municipal doctor comes and says , ` A nun has died . ' 
The government sends a coffin . 
The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker 's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery . 
The undertaker 's men will come and lift the coffin ; there will be nothing in it . '' 
`` Put something in it . '' 
`` A corpse ? 
I have none . '' 
`` No . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` A living person . '' 
`` What person ? '' 
`` Me ! '' 
said Jean Valjean . 
Fauchelevent , who was seated , sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair . 
`` You ! '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter . 
`` You know , Fauchelevent , what you have said : ` Mother Crucifixion is dead . ' 
and I add : ` and Father Madeleine is buried . ' 
`` Ah !
