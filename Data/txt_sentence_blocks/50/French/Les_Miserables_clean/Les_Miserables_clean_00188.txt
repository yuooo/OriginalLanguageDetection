I have only a little lead sword , no longer than that . '' 
The child held up her tiny finger . 
`` And it will not cut ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' said the child ; `` it cuts salad and the heads of flies . '' 
They reached the village . 
Cosette guided the stranger through the streets . 
They passed the bakeshop , but Cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch . 
The man had ceased to ply her with questions , and now preserved a gloomy silence . 
When they had left the church behind them , the man , on perceiving all the open-air booths , asked Cosette : -- `` So there is a fair going on here ? '' 
`` No , sir ; it is Christmas . '' 
As they approached the tavern , Cosette timidly touched his arm : -- `` Monsieur ? '' 
`` What , my child ? '' 
`` We are quite near the house . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Will you let me take my bucket now ? '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me , she will beat me . '' 
The man handed her the bucket . 
An instant later they were at the tavern door . 
THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE 'S HOUSE A POOR MAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll , which was still displayed at the toy-merchant 's ; then she knocked . 
The door opened . 
The Thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand . 
`` Ah ! 
so it 's you , you little wretch ! 
good mercy , but you 've taken your time ! 
The hussy has been amusing herself ! '' 
`` Madame , '' said Cosette , trembling all over , `` here 's a gentleman who wants a lodging . '' 
The Thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace , a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers , and eagerly sought the new-comer with her eyes . 
`` This is the gentleman ? '' 
said she . 
`` Yes , Madame , '' replied the man , raising his hand to his hat . 
Wealthy travellers are not so polite . 
This gesture , and an inspection of the stranger 's costume and baggage , which the Thenardier passed in review with one glance , caused the amiable grimace to vanish , and the gruff mien to reappear . 
She resumed dryly : -- `` Enter , my good man . '' 
The `` good man '' entered . 
The Thenardier cast a second glance at him , paid particular attention to his frock-coat , which was absolutely threadbare , and to his hat , which was a little battered , and , tossing her head , wrinkling her nose , and screwing up her eyes , she consulted her husband , who was still drinking with the carters . 
The husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger , which , backed up by an inflation of the lips , signifies in such cases : A regular beggar . 
Thereupon , the Thenardier exclaimed : -- `` Ah ! 
see here , my good man ; I am very sorry , but I have no room left . '' 
`` Put me where you like , '' said the man ; `` in the attic , in the stable . 
I will pay as though I occupied a room . '' 
`` Forty sous . '' 
`` Forty sous ; agreed . '' 
`` Very well , then ! '' 
`` Forty sous ! '' 
said a carter , in a low tone , to the Thenardier woman ; `` why , the charge is only twenty sous ! '' 
`` It is forty in his case , '' retorted the Thenardier , in the same tone . 
`` I do n't lodge poor folks for less . '' 
`` That 's true , '' added her husband , gently ; `` it ruins a house to have such people in it . '' 
In the meantime , the man , laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench , had seated himself at a table , on which Cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass .
