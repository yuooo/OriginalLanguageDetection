Nevertheless , there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders , and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers : -- `` Who was your leader ? '' 
`` I knew of none and I recognized none . '' 
There was nothing but words , transparent but vague ; sometimes idle reports , rumors , hearsay . 
Other indications cropped up . 
A carpenter , occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction , in the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines : -- The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies . 
And , as a postscript : -- We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere , No. 5 -LSB- bis -RSB- , to the number of five or six thousand , in the house of a gunsmith in that court . 
The section owns no arms . 
What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact , that a few paces further on he picked up another paper , torn like the first , and still more significant , of which we reproduce a facsimile , because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents : -- + ------------------------------------------------------------ + | Q | C | D | E | Learn this list by heart . 
After so doing | | | | | | you will tear it up . 
The men admitted | | | | | | will do the same when you have transmitted | | | | | | their orders to them . 
| | | | | | Health and Fraternity , | | | | | | u og a fe L. | + ------------------------------------------------------------ + It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this find at the time , learned the significance of those four capital letters : quinturions , centurions , decurions , eclaireurs -LSB- scouts -RSB- , and the sense of the letters : u og a fe , which was a date , and meant April 15th , 1832 . 
Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by very characteristic notes . 
Thus : Q. Bannerel . 
8 guns , 83 cartridges . 
A safe man . 
-- C. Boubiere . 
1 pistol , 40 cartridges . 
-- D. Rollet . 
1 foil , 1 pistol , 1 pound of powder . 
-- E. Tessier . 
1 sword , 1 cartridge-box . 
Exact . 
-- Terreur . 
8 guns . 
Brave , etc. . 
Finally , this carpenter found , still in the same enclosure , a third paper on which was written in pencil , but very legibly , this sort of enigmatical list : -- Unite : Blanchard : Arbre-Sec .
