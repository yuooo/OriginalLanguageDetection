It was the Jondrette girl . 
`` Is it you ? '' 
resumed Marius almost harshly , `` still you ! 
What do you want with me ? '' 
She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him . 
She no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning . 
She did not enter , but held back in the darkness of the corridor , where Marius could see her through the half-open door . 
`` Come now , will you answer ? '' 
cried Marius . 
`` What do you want with me ? '' 
She raised her dull eyes , in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely , and said : -- `` Monsieur Marius , you look sad . 
What is the matter with you ? '' 
`` With me ! '' 
said Marius . 
`` Yes , you . '' 
`` There is nothing the matter with me . '' 
`` Yes , there is ! '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I tell you there is ! '' 
`` Let me alone ! '' 
Marius gave the door another push , but she retained her hold on it . 
`` Stop , '' said she , `` you are in the wrong . 
Although you are not rich , you were kind this morning . 
Be so again now . 
You gave me something to eat , now tell me what ails you . 
You are grieved , that is plain . 
I do not want you to be grieved . 
What can be done for it ? 
Can I be of any service ? 
Employ me . 
I do not ask for your secrets , you need not tell them to me , but I may be of use , nevertheless . 
I may be able to help you , since I help my father . 
When it is necessary to carry letters , to go to houses , to inquire from door to door , to find out an address , to follow any one , I am of service . 
Well , you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you , and I will go and speak to the persons ; sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons , that suffices to let them understand matters , and everything comes right . 
Make use of me . '' 
An idea flashed across Marius ' mind . 
What branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling ? 
He drew near to the Jondrette girl . 
`` Listen -- '' he said to her . 
She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes . 
`` Oh yes , do call me thou ! 
I like that better . '' 
`` Well , '' he resumed , `` thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter ! '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Dost thou know their address ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Find it for me . '' 
The Jondrette 's dull eyes had grown joyous , and they now became gloomy . 
`` Is that what you want ? '' 
she demanded .
