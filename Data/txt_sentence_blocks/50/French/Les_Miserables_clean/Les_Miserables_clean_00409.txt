Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about , and see how he is getting on . '' 
One o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras reached the Richefeu smoking-room . 
He pushed open the door , entered , folded his arms , letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders , and gazed at that room filled with tables , men , and smoke . 
A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke , interrupted by another voice . 
It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary . 
Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure , at a marble Saint-Anne table , strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos . 
He was hammering the table with his fist , and this is what Enjolras heard : -- `` Double-six . '' 
`` Fours . '' 
`` The pig ! 
I have no more . '' 
`` You are dead . 
A two . '' 
`` Six . '' 
`` Three . '' 
`` One . '' 
`` It 's my move . '' 
`` Four points . '' 
`` Not much . '' 
`` It 's your turn . '' 
`` I have made an enormous mistake . '' 
`` You are doing well . '' 
`` Fifteen . '' 
`` Seven more . '' 
`` That makes me twenty-two . '' 
-LSB- Thoughtfully , `` Twenty-two ! '' -RSB- 
`` You were n't expecting that double-six . 
If I had placed it at the beginning , the whole play would have been changed . '' 
`` A two again . '' 
`` One . '' 
`` One ! 
Well , five . '' 
`` I have n't any . '' 
`` It was your play , I believe ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Blank . '' 
`` What luck he has ! 
Ah ! 
You are lucky ! 
-LSB- Long revery . -RSB- 
Two . '' 
`` One . '' 
`` Neither five nor one . 
That 's bad for you . '' 
`` Domino . '' 
`` Plague take it ! '' 
THE LARK 'S MEADOW Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set Javert ; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building , bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches , than Marius also glided out of the house . 
It was only nine o'clock in the evening . 
Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac . 
Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter , he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie `` for political reasons '' ; this quarter was one where , at that epoch , insurrection liked to install itself . 
Marius said to Courfeyrac : `` I have come to sleep with you . ''
