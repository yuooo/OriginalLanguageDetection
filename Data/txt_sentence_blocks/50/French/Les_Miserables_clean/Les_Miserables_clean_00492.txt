Sit down , sir . 
Well , you have had a revolution since I had the honor to see you last . 
The Jacobins got the upper hand . 
You must have been delighted . 
Are you not a Republican since you are a Baron ? 
You can make that agree . 
The Republic makes a good sauce for the barony . 
Are you one of those decorated by July ? 
Have you taken the Louvre at all , sir ? 
Quite near here , in the Rue Saint-Antoine , opposite the Rue des Nonamdieres , there is a cannon-ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription : ` July 28th , 1830 . ' 
Go take a look at that . 
It produces a good effect . 
Ah ! 
those friends of yours do pretty things . 
By the way , are n't they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry ? 
So you want to marry ? 
Whom ? 
Can one inquire without indiscretion ? '' 
He paused , and , before Marius had time to answer , he added violently : -- `` Come now , you have a profession ? 
A fortune made ? 
How much do you earn at your trade of lawyer ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' said Marius , with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce . 
`` Nothing ? 
Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that I allow you ? '' 
Marius did not reply . 
M. Gillenormand continued : -- `` Then I understand the girl is rich ? '' 
`` As rich as I am . '' 
`` What ! 
No dowry ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Expectations ? '' 
`` I think not . '' 
`` Utterly naked ! 
What 's the father ? '' 
`` I do n't know . '' 
`` And what 's her name ? '' 
`` Mademoiselle Fauchelevent . '' 
`` Fauchewhat ? '' 
`` Fauchelevent . '' 
`` Pttt ! '' 
ejaculated the old gentleman . 
`` Sir ! '' 
exclaimed Marius . 
M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself : -- `` That 's right , one and twenty years of age , no profession , twelve hundred livres a year , Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of sous ' worth of parsley from the fruiterer . '' 
`` Sir , '' repeated Marius , in the despair at the last hope , which was vanishing , `` I entreat you ! 
I conjure you in the name of Heaven , with clasped hands , sir , I throw myself at your feet , permit me to marry her ! '' 
The old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter , coughing and laughing at the same time . 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! 
ah !
