`` Yes , '' said Fantine ; `` that makes forty francs . '' 
She remained thoughtful , and began her work . 
At the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thenardiers ' letter once more on the staircase . 
On her return , she said to Marguerite , who was at work beside her : -- `` What is a miliary fever ? 
Do you know ? '' 
`` Yes , '' answered the old spinster ; `` it is a disease . '' 
`` Does it require many drugs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
terrible drugs . '' 
`` How does one get it ? '' 
`` It is a malady that one gets without knowing how . '' 
`` Then it attacks children ? '' 
`` Children in particular . '' 
`` Do people die of it ? '' 
`` They may , '' said Marguerite . 
Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase . 
That evening she went out , and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the Rue de Paris , where the inns are situated . 
The next morning , when Marguerite entered Fantine 's room before daylight , -- for they always worked together , and in this manner used only one candle for the two , -- she found Fantine seated on her bed , pale and frozen . 
She had not lain down . 
Her cap had fallen on her knees . 
Her candle had burned all night , and was almost entirely consumed . 
Marguerite halted on the threshold , petrified at this tremendous wastefulness , and exclaimed : -- `` Lord ! 
the candle is all burned out ! 
Something has happened . '' 
Then she looked at Fantine , who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair . 
Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night . 
`` Jesus ! '' 
said Marguerite , `` what is the matter with you , Fantine ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' replied Fantine . 
`` Quite the contrary . 
My child will not die of that frightful malady , for lack of succor . 
I am content . '' 
So saying , she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table . 
`` Ah ! 
Jesus God ! '' 
cried Marguerite . 
`` Why , it is a fortune ! 
Where did you get those louis d'or ? '' 
`` I got them , '' replied Fantine . 
At the same time she smiled . 
The candle illuminated her countenance . 
It was a bloody smile . 
A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips , and she had a black hole in her mouth . 
The two teeth had been extracted . 
She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil . 
After all it was a ruse of the Thenardiers to obtain money . 
Cosette was not ill . 
Fantine threw her mirror out of the window . 
She had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it , next the roof ; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor , and knocks you on the head every instant . 
The poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny , only by bending over more and more .
