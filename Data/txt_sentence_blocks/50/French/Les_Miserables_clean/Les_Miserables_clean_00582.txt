`` No splashing of the wounded , '' he said . 
He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt , but profoundly tranquil tone ; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all . 
`` On the first floor , hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase . 
Have you them ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said Feuilly . 
`` How many ? '' 
`` Two axes and a pole-axe . '' 
`` That is good . 
There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot . 
How many guns are there ? '' 
`` Thirty-four . '' 
`` Eight too many . 
Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand . 
Swords and pistols in your belts . 
Twenty men to the barricade . 
Six ambushed in the attic windows , and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones . 
Let not a single worker remain inactive here . 
Presently , when the drum beats the assault , let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade . 
The first to arrive will have the best places . '' 
These arrangements made , he turned to Javert and said : `` I am not forgetting you . '' 
And , laying a pistol on the table , he added : `` The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy . '' 
`` Here ? '' 
inquired a voice . 
`` No , let us not mix their corpses with our own . 
The little barricade of the Mondetour lane can be scaled . 
It is only four feet high . 
The man is well pinioned . 
He shall be taken thither and put to death . '' 
There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras , it was Javert . 
Here Jean Valjean made his appearance . 
He had been lost among the group of insurgents . 
He stepped forth and said to Enjolras : `` You are the commander ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You thanked me a while ago . '' 
`` In the name of the Republic . 
The barricade has two saviors , Marius Pontmercy and yourself . '' 
`` Do you think that I deserve a recompense ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Well , I request one . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` That I may blow that man 's brains out . '' 
Javert raised his head , saw Jean Valjean , made an almost imperceptible movement , and said : `` That is just . '' 
As for Enjolras , he had begun to re-load his rifle ; he cut his eyes about him : `` No objections . '' 
And he turned to Jean Valjean : `` Take the spy . '' 
Jean Valjean did , in fact , take possession of Javert , by seating himself on the end of the table . 
He seized the pistol , and a faint click announced that he had cocked it . 
Almost at the same moment , a blast of trumpets became audible . 
`` Take care ! '' 
shouted Marius from the top of the barricade . 
Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him , and gazing intently at the insurgents , he said to them : `` You are in no better case than I am . ''
