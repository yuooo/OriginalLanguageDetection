The whole family was in the garret . 
Only , it had been silent in the master 's absence , like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf . 
`` It 's I , '' said he . 
`` Good evening , daddy , '' yelped the girls . 
`` Well ? '' 
said the mother . 
`` All 's going first-rate , '' responded Jondrette , `` but my feet are beastly cold . 
Good ! 
You have dressed up . 
You have done well ! 
You must inspire confidence . '' 
`` All ready to go out . '' 
`` Do n't forget what I told you . 
You will do everything sure ? '' 
`` Rest easy . '' 
`` Because -- '' said Jondrette . 
And he left the phrase unfinished . 
Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table , probably the chisel which he had purchased . 
`` By the way , '' said Jondrette , `` have you been eating here ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the mother . 
`` I got three large potatoes and some salt . 
I took advantage of the fire to cook them . '' 
`` Good , '' returned Jondrette . 
`` To-morrow I will take you out to dine with me . 
We will have a duck and fixings . 
You shall dine like Charles the Tenth ; all is going well ! '' 
Then he added : -- `` The mouse-trap is open . 
The cats are there . '' 
He lowered his voice still further , and said : -- `` Put this in the fire . '' 
Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil , and Jondrette continued : -- `` Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied the mother . 
`` What time is it ? '' 
`` Nearly six . 
The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago . '' 
`` The devil ! '' 
ejaculated Jondrette ; `` the children must go and watch . 
Come you , do you listen here . '' 
A whispering ensued . 
Jondrette 's voice became audible again : -- `` Has old Bougon left ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the mother . 
`` Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor 's room ? '' 
`` He has not been in all day , and you know very well that this is his dinner hour . '' 
`` You are sure ? '' 
`` Sure . '' 
`` All the same , '' said Jondrette , `` there 's no harm in going to see whether he is there . 
Here , my girl , take the candle and go there . '' 
Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed . 
Hardly had he concealed himself , when he perceived a light through the crack of his door . 
`` P'pa , '' cried a voice , `` he is not in here . '' 
He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter .
