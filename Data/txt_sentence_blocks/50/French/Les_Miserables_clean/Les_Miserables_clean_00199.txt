`` Cosette ! '' 
screamed the Thenardier . 
`` In the meantime , '' pursued the man , `` I will pay you what I owe you . 
How much is it ? '' 
He cast a glance on the bill , and could not restrain a start of surprise : -- `` Twenty-three francs ! '' 
He looked at the landlady , and repeated : -- `` Twenty-three francs ? '' 
There was in the enunciation of these words , thus repeated , an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point . 
The Thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock . 
She replied , with assurance : -- `` Good gracious , yes , sir , it is twenty-three francs . '' 
The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table . 
`` Go and get the child , '' said he . 
At that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room , and said : -- `` Monsieur owes twenty-six sous . '' 
`` Twenty-six sous ! '' 
exclaimed his wife . 
`` Twenty sous for the chamber , '' resumed Thenardier , coldly , `` and six sous for his supper . 
As for the child , I must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman . 
Leave us , wife . '' 
Madame Thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent . 
She was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage , uttered not a word in reply , and left the room . 
As soon as they were alone , Thenardier offered the traveller a chair . 
The traveller seated himself ; Thenardier remained standing , and his face assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity . 
`` Sir , '' said he , `` what I have to say to you is this , that I adore that child . '' 
The stranger gazed intently at him . 
`` What child ? '' 
Thenardier continued : -- `` How strange it is , one grows attached . 
What money is that ? 
Take back your hundred-sou piece . 
I adore the child . '' 
`` Whom do you mean ? '' 
demanded the stranger . 
`` Eh ! 
our little Cosette ! 
Are you not intending to take her away from us ? 
Well , I speak frankly ; as true as you are an honest man , I will not consent to it . 
I shall miss that child . 
I saw her first when she was a tiny thing . 
It is true that she costs us money ; it is true that she has her faults ; it is true that we are not rich ; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses ! 
But one must do something for the good God 's sake . 
She has neither father nor mother . 
I have brought her up . 
I have bread enough for her and for myself . 
In truth , I think a great deal of that child . 
You understand , one conceives an affection for a person ; I am a good sort of a beast , I am ; I do not reason ; I love that little girl ; my wife is quick-tempered , but she loves her also . 
You see , she is just the same as our own child . 
I want to keep her to babble about the house . '' 
The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thenardier . 
The latter continued : -- `` Excuse me , sir , but one does not give away one 's child to a passer-by , like that . 
I am right , am I not ? 
Still , I do n't say -- you are rich ; you have the air of a very good man , -- if it were for her happiness . 
But one must find out that .
