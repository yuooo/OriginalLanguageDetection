`` The empty coffin remains . '' 
This produced a pause . 
Fauchelevent meditated . 
The prioress meditated . 
`` What is to be done with that coffin , Father Fauvent ? '' 
`` It will be given to the earth . '' 
`` Empty ? '' 
Another silence . 
Fauchelevent made , with his left hand , that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject . 
`` Reverend Mother , I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church , and no one can enter there but myself , and I will cover the coffin with the pall . '' 
`` Yes , but the bearers , when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave , will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
the de -- ! '' 
exclaimed Fauchelevent . 
The prioress began to make the sign of the cross , and looked fixedly at the gardener . 
The vil stuck fast in his throat . 
He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath . 
`` I will put earth in the coffin , reverend Mother . 
That will produce the effect of a corpse . '' 
`` You are right . 
Earth , that is the same thing as man . 
So you will manage the empty coffin ? '' 
`` I will make that my special business . '' 
The prioress 's face , up to that moment troubled and clouded , grew serene once more . 
She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him . 
Fauchelevent went towards the door . 
As he was on the point of passing out , the prioress raised her voice gently : -- `` I am pleased with you , Father Fauvent ; bring your brother to me to-morrow , after the burial , and tell him to fetch his daughter . '' 
IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ AUSTIN CASTILLEJO The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man ; they do not reach their goal very promptly . 
Moreover , Fauchelevent was in a dilemma . 
He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden . 
Cosette had waked up . 
Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire . 
At the moment when Fauchelevent entered , Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner 's basket on the wall , and saying to her , `` Listen attentively to me , my little Cosette . 
We must go away from this house , but we shall return to it , and we shall be very happy here . 
The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that . 
You will wait for me at a lady 's house . 
I shall come to fetch you . 
Obey , and say nothing , above all things , unless you want Madame Thenardier to get you again ! '' 
Cosette nodded gravely . 
Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the door . 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Everything is arranged , and nothing is , '' said Fauchelevent . 
`` I have permission to bring you in ; but before bringing you in you must be got out . 
That 's where the difficulty lies . 
It is easy enough with the child . '' 
`` You will carry her out ? '' 
`` And she will hold her tongue ? '' 
`` I answer for that . '' 
`` But you , Father Madeleine ? '' 
And , after a silence , fraught with anxiety , Fauchelevent exclaimed : -- `` Why , get out as you came in ! ''
