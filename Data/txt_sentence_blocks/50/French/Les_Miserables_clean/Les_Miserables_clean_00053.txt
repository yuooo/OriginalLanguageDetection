A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean Valjean had sat on the previous evening . 
As he ate his breakfast , Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister , who said nothing , and to Madame Magloire , who was grumbling under her breath , that one really does not need either fork or spoon , even of wood , in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk . 
`` A pretty idea , truly , '' said Madame Magloire to herself , as she went and came , `` to take in a man like that ! 
and to lodge him close to one 's self ! 
And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal ! 
Ah , mon Dieu ! 
it makes one shudder to think of it ! '' 
As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table , there came a knock at the door . 
`` Come in , '' said the Bishop . 
The door opened . 
A singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold . 
Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar . 
The three men were gendarmes ; the other was Jean Valjean . 
A brigadier of gendarmes , who seemed to be in command of the group , was standing near the door . 
He entered and advanced to the Bishop , making a military salute . 
`` Monseigneur -- '' said he . 
At this word , Jean Valjean , who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed , raised his head with an air of stupefaction . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
he murmured . 
`` So he is not the cure ? '' 
`` Silence ! '' 
said the gendarme . 
`` He is Monseigneur the Bishop . '' 
In the meantime , Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted . 
`` Ah ! 
here you are ! '' 
he exclaimed , looking at Jean Valjean . 
`` I am glad to see you . 
Well , but how is this ? 
I gave you the candlesticks too , which are of silver like the rest , and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs . 
Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons ? '' 
Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide , and stared at the venerable Bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of . 
`` Monseigneur , '' said the brigadier of gendarmes , `` so what this man said is true , then ? 
We came across him . 
He was walking like a man who is running away . 
We stopped him to look into the matter . 
He had this silver -- '' `` And he told you , '' interposed the Bishop with a smile , `` that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night ? 
I see how the matter stands . 
And you have brought him back here ? 
It is a mistake . '' 
`` In that case , '' replied the brigadier , `` we can let him go ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' replied the Bishop . 
The gendarmes released Jean Valjean , who recoiled . 
`` Is it true that I am to be released ? '' 
he said , in an almost inarticulate voice , and as though he were talking in his sleep . 
`` Yes , thou art released ; dost thou not understand ? '' 
said one of the gendarmes . 
`` My friend , '' resumed the Bishop , `` before you go , here are your candlesticks . 
Take them . '' 
He stepped to the chimney-piece , took the two silver candlesticks , and brought them to Jean Valjean .
