Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting . 
This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans . 
He resembled them in this sense , that he walked like them . 
For the moment , the swans were swimming , which is their principal talent , and they were superb . 
If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand , they might have gathered the words of this grave man . 
The father was saying to his son : `` The sage lives content with little . 
Look at me , my son . 
I do not love pomp . 
I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones ; I leave that false splendor to badly organized souls . '' 
Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar . 
`` What is that ? '' 
inquired the child . 
The father replied : `` It is the Saturnalia . '' 
All at once , he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green swan-hutch . 
`` There is the beginning , '' said he . 
And , after a pause , he added : `` Anarchy is entering this garden . '' 
In the meanwhile , his son took a bite of his brioche , spit it out , and , suddenly burst out crying . 
`` What are you crying about ? '' 
demanded his father . 
`` I am not hungry any more , '' said the child . 
The father 's smile became more accentuated . 
`` One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake . '' 
`` My cake tires me . 
It is stale . '' 
`` Do n't you want any more of it ? '' 
`` No . '' 
The father pointed to the swans . 
`` Throw it to those palmipeds . '' 
The child hesitated . 
A person may not want any more of his cake ; but that is no reason for giving it away . 
The father went on : `` Be humane . 
You must have compassion on animals . '' 
And , taking the cake from his son , he flung it into the basin . 
The cake fell very near the edge . 
The swans were far away , in the centre of the basin , and busy with some prey . 
They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche . 
The bourgeois , feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted , and moved by this useless shipwreck , entered upon a telegraphic agitation , which finally attracted the attention of the swans . 
They perceived something floating , steered for the edge like ships , as they are , and slowly directed their course toward the brioche , with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures . 
`` The swans -LSB- cygnes -RSB- understand signs -LSB- signes -RSB- , '' said the bourgeois , delighted to make a jest . 
At that moment , the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase . 
This time it was sinister . 
There are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others . 
The one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats , clamors , platoon firing , and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon . 
This coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun . 
The swans had not yet reached the brioche . 
`` Let us return home , '' said the father , `` they are attacking the Tuileries . '' 
He grasped his son 's hand again . 
Then he continued : `` From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg , there is but the distance which separates Royalty from the peerage ; that is not far . 
Shots will soon rain down . '' 
He glanced at the cloud .
