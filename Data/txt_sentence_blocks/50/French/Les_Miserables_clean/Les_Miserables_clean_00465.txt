`` With this rope , '' said Babet . 
`` And fasten it , '' continued Brujon . 
`` To the top of the wall , '' went on Babet . 
`` To the cross-bar of the window , '' added Brujon . 
`` And then ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` There ! '' 
said Guelemer . 
The gamin examined the rope , the flue , the wall , the windows , and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies : -- `` Is that all ! '' 
`` There 's a man up there whom you are to save , '' resumed Montparnasse . 
`` Will you ? '' 
began Brujon again . 
`` Greenhorn ! '' 
replied the lad , as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him . 
And he took off his shoes . 
Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm , set him on the roof of the shanty , whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin 's weight , and handed him the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse 's absence . 
The gamin directed his steps towards the flue , which it was easy to enter , thanks to a large crack which touched the roof . 
At the moment when he was on the point of ascending , Thenardier , who saw life and safety approaching , bent over the edge of the wall ; the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat , upon his livid cheek-bones , his sharp and savage nose , his bristling gray beard , and Gavroche recognized him . 
`` Hullo ! 
it 's my father ! 
Oh , that wo n't hinder . '' 
And taking the rope in his teeth , he resolutely began the ascent . 
He reached the summit of the hut , bestrode the old wall as though it had been a horse . 
and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of the window . 
A moment later , Thenardier was in the street . 
As soon as he touched the pavement , as soon as he found himself out of danger , he was no longer either weary , or chilled or trembling ; the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke , all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more , and stood erect and free , ready to march onward . 
These were this man 's first words : -- `` Now , whom are we to eat ? '' 
It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark , which signifies both to kill , to assassinate , and to plunder . 
To eat , true sense : to devour . 
`` Let 's get well into a corner , '' said Brujon . 
`` Let 's settle it in three words , and part at once . 
There was an affair that promised well in the Rue Plumet , a deserted street , an isolated house , an old rotten gate on a garden , and lone women . '' 
`` Well ! 
why not ? '' 
demanded Thenardier . 
`` Your girl , Eponine , went to see about the matter , '' replied Babet . 
`` And she brought a biscuit to Magnon , '' added Guelemer . 
`` Nothing to be made there . '' 
`` The girl 's no fool , '' said Thenardier . 
`` Still , it must be seen to . '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' said Brujon , `` it must be looked up . '' 
In the meanwhile , none of the men seemed to see Gavroche , who , during this colloquy , had seated himself on one of the fence-posts ; he waited a few moments , thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him , then he put on his shoes again , and said : -- `` Is that all ? 
You do n't want any more , my men ? 
Now you 're out of your scrape . 
I 'm off . 
I must go and get my brats out of bed . '' 
And off he went . 
The five men emerged , one after another , from the enclosure . 
When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets , Babet took Thenardier aside . 
`` Did you take a good look at that young ` un ? ''
