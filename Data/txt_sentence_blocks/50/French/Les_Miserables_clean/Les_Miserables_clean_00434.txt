`` Mother Plutarque ! '' 
thought Gavroche , `` another farcical name . '' 
Mother Plutarque began again , and the old man was forced to accept the conversation : -- `` The landlord is not pleased . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` We owe three quarters rent . '' 
`` In three months , we shall owe him for four quarters . '' 
`` He says that he will turn you out to sleep . '' 
`` I will go . '' 
`` The green-grocer insists on being paid . 
She will no longer leave her fagots . 
What will you warm yourself with this winter ? 
We shall have no wood . '' 
`` There is the sun . '' 
`` The butcher refuses to give credit ; he will not let us have any more meat . '' 
`` That is quite right . 
I do not digest meat well . 
It is too heavy . '' 
`` What shall we have for dinner ? '' 
`` Bread . '' 
`` The baker demands a settlement , and says , ` no money , no bread . ' '' 
`` That is well . '' 
`` What will you eat ? '' 
`` We have apples in the apple-room . '' 
`` But , Monsieur , we ca n't live like that without money . '' 
`` I have none . '' 
The old woman went away , the old man remained alone . 
He fell into thought . 
Gavroche became thoughtful also . 
It was almost dark . 
The first result of Gavroche 's meditation was , that instead of scaling the hedge , he crouched down under it . 
The branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket . 
`` Come , '' exclaimed Gavroche mentally , `` here 's a nook ! '' 
and he curled up in it . 
His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf 's bench . 
He could hear the octogenarian breathe . 
Then , by way of dinner , he tried to sleep . 
It was a cat-nap , with one eye open . 
While he dozed , Gavroche kept on the watch . 
The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth , and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes . 
All at once , in this whitish band , two figures made their appearance . 
One was in front , the other some distance in the rear . 
`` There come two creatures , '' muttered Gavroche . 
The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois , who was bent and thoughtful , dressed more than plainly , and who was walking slowly because of his age , and strolling about in the open evening air . 
The second was straight , firm , slender . 
It regulated its pace by that of the first ; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait , suppleness and agility were discernible . 
This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it , the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant ; the hat was of good shape , the coat black , well cut , probably of fine cloth , and well fitted in at the waist . 
The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace , and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light . 
The profile had a rose in its mouth . 
This second form was well known to Gavroche ; it was Montparnasse . 
He could have told nothing about the other , except that he was a respectable old man .
