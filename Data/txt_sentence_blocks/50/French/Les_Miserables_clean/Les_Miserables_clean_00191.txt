Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper , and who had not the air of being frightfully poor , would have been equivalent to an order . 
But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire , and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will , was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate . 
She retorted with acrimony : -- `` She must work , since she eats . 
I do n't feed her to do nothing . '' 
`` What is she making ? '' 
went on the stranger , in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter 's shoulders . 
The Thenardier deigned to reply : -- `` Stockings , if you please . 
Stockings for my little girls , who have none , so to speak , and who are absolutely barefoot just now . '' 
The man looked at Cosette 's poor little red feet , and continued : -- `` When will she have finished this pair of stockings ? '' 
`` She has at least three or four good days ' work on them still , the lazy creature ! '' 
`` And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them ? '' 
The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him . 
`` Thirty sous at least . '' 
`` Will you sell them for five francs ? '' 
went on the man . 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
exclaimed a carter who was listening , with a loud laugh ; `` five francs ! 
the deuce , I should think so ! 
five balls ! '' 
Thenardier thought it time to strike in . 
`` Yes , sir ; if such is your fancy , you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs . 
We can refuse nothing to travellers . '' 
`` You must pay on the spot , '' said the Thenardier , in her curt and peremptory fashion . 
`` I will buy that pair of stockings , '' replied the man , `` and , '' he added , drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket , and laying it on the table , `` I will pay for them . '' 
Then he turned to Cosette . 
`` Now I own your work ; play , my child . '' 
The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece , that he abandoned his glass and hastened up . 
`` But it 's true ! '' 
he cried , examining it . 
`` A real hind wheel ! 
and not counterfeit ! '' 
Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket . 
The Thenardier had no reply to make . 
She bit her lips , and her face assumed an expression of hatred . 
In the meantime , Cosette was trembling . 
She ventured to ask : -- `` Is it true , Madame ? 
May I play ? '' 
`` Play ! '' 
said the Thenardier , in a terrible voice . 
`` Thanks , Madame , '' said Cosette . 
And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier , her whole little soul thanked the traveller . 
Thenardier had resumed his drinking ; his wife whispered in his ear : -- `` Who can this yellow man be ? '' 
`` I have seen millionaires with coats like that , '' replied Thenardier , in a sovereign manner . 
Cosette had dropped her knitting , but had not left her seat . 
Cosette always moved as little as possible . 
She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her . 
Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on . 
They had just executed a very important operation ; they had just got hold of the cat . 
They had thrown their doll on the ground , and Eponine , who was the elder , was swathing the little cat , in spite of its mewing and its contortions , in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps . 
While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children , whose grace , like the splendor of the butterfly 's wing , vanishes when one essays to fix it fast .
