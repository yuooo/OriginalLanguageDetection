Master Scaufflaire continued : -- `` That it may rain ? '' 
M. Madeleine raised his head and said : -- `` The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morning at half-past four o'clock . '' 
`` Of course , Monsieur le Maire , '' replied Scaufflaire ; then , scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail , he resumed with that careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness : -- `` But this is what I am thinking of now : Monsieur le Maire has not told me where he is going . 
Where is Monsieur le Maire going ? '' 
He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation , but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question . 
`` Are your horse 's forelegs good ? '' 
said M. Madeleine . 
`` Yes , Monsieur le Maire . 
You must hold him in a little when going down hill . 
Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going ? '' 
`` Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o'clock to-morrow morning , '' replied M. Madeleine ; and he took his departure . 
The Fleming remained `` utterly stupid , '' as he himself said some time afterwards . 
The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again ; it was the mayor once more . 
He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air . 
`` Monsieur Scaufflaire , '' said he , `` at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me , -- the one bearing the other ? '' 
`` The one dragging the other , Monsieur le Maire , '' said the Fleming , with a broad smile . 
`` So be it . 
Well ? '' 
`` Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me ? '' 
`` No ; but I wish to guarantee you in any case . 
You shall give me back the sum at my return . 
At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet ? '' 
`` Five hundred francs , Monsieur le Maire . '' 
`` Here it is . '' 
M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table , then left the room ; and this time he did not return . 
Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs . 
Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns . 
The Fleming called his wife , and related the affair to her . 
`` Where the devil could Monsieur le Maire be going ? '' 
They held counsel together . 
`` He is going to Paris , '' said the wife . 
`` I do n't believe it , '' said the husband . 
M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it , and it lay on the chimney-piece . 
The Fleming picked it up and studied it . 
`` Five , six , eight and a half ? 
That must designate the posting relays . '' 
He turned to his wife : -- `` I have found out . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` It is five leagues from here to Hesdin , six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol , eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras . 
He is going to Arras . '' 
Meanwhile , M. Madeleine had returned home . 
He had taken the longest way to return from Master Scaufflaire 's , as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him , and he had wished to avoid it . 
He ascended to his room , and there he shut himself up , which was a very simple act , since he liked to go to bed early . 
Nevertheless , the portress of the factory , who was , at the same time , M. Madeleine 's only servant , noticed that the latter 's light was extinguished at half-past eight , and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home , adding : -- `` Is Monsieur le Maire ill ? 
I thought he had a rather singular air . '' 
This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine 's chamber . 
He paid no heed to the portress 's words , but went to bed and to sleep . 
Towards midnight he woke up with a start ; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head . 
He listened ; it was a footstep pacing back and forth , as though some one were walking in the room above him . 
He listened more attentively , and recognized M. Madeleine 's step .
