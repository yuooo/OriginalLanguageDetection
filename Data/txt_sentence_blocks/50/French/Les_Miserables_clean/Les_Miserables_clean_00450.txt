An instant later , the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more , and he added : -- `` I am making a mistake in the beast ; he 's not a whiting , he 's a serpent . 
Barber , I 'll go and fetch a locksmith , and I 'll have a bell hung to your tail . '' 
This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive . 
As he strode over a gutter , he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the Brocken , and who had a broom in her hand . 
`` Madam , '' said he , `` so you are going out with your horse ? '' 
And thereupon , he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian . 
`` You scamp ! '' 
shouted the furious pedestrian . 
Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl . 
`` Is Monsieur complaining ? '' 
`` Of you ! '' 
ejaculated the man . 
`` The office is closed , '' said Gavroche , `` I do not receive any more complaints . '' 
In the meanwhile , as he went on up the street , he perceived a beggar-girl , thirteen or fourteen years old , and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible , lying thoroughly chilled under a porte-cochere . 
The little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing . 
Growth does play these tricks . 
The petticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent . 
`` Poor girl ! '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` She has n't even trousers . 
Hold on , take this . '' 
And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck , he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl , where the scarf became a shawl once more . 
The child stared at him in astonishment , and received the shawl in silence . 
When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery , the poor man no longer groans over evil , no longer returns thanks for good . 
That done : `` Brrr ! '' 
said Gavroche , who was shivering more than Saint Martin , for the latter retained one-half of his cloak . 
At this brrr ! 
the downpour of rain , redoubled in its spite , became furious . 
The wicked skies punish good deeds . 
`` Ah , come now ! '' 
exclaimed Gavroche , `` what 's the meaning of this ? 
It 's re-raining ! 
Good Heavens , if it goes on like this , I shall stop my subscription . '' 
And he set out on the march once more . 
`` It 's all right , '' he resumed , casting a glance at the beggar-girl , as she coiled up under the shawl , `` she 's got a famous peel . '' 
And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed : -- `` Caught ! '' 
The two children followed close on his heels . 
As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices , which indicate a baker 's shop , for bread is put behind bars like gold , Gavroche turned round : -- `` Ah , by the way , brats , have we dined ? '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the elder , `` we have had nothing to eat since this morning . '' 
`` So you have neither father nor mother ? '' 
resumed Gavroche majestically . 
`` Excuse us , sir , we have a papa and a mamma , but we do n't know where they are . '' 
`` Sometimes that 's better than knowing where they are , '' said Gavroche , who was a thinker . 
`` We have been wandering about these two hours , '' continued the elder , `` we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets , but we have found nothing . '' 
`` I know , '' ejaculated Gavroche , `` it 's the dogs who eat everything . '' 
He went on , after a pause : -- `` Ah ! 
we have lost our authors . 
We do n't know what we have done with them . 
This should not be , gamins . 
It 's stupid to let old people stray off like that .
