With written names ! 
Thrown into a hat ! 
-- '' `` Would you like my hat ? '' 
cried a voice on the threshold . 
All wheeled round . 
It was Javert . 
He had his hat in his hand , and was holding it out to them with a smile . 
ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS At nightfall , Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself between the trees of the Rue de la Barrieredes-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau house , on the other side of the boulevard . 
He had begun operations by opening `` his pockets , '' and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den . 
But he had only `` caged '' Azelma . 
As for Eponine , she was not at her post , she had disappeared , and he had not been able to seize her . 
Then Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon . 
The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him . 
At last , he had grown impatient , and , sure that there was a nest there , sure of being in `` luck , '' having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered , he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot . 
It will be remembered that he had Marius ' pass-key . 
He had arrived just in the nick of time . 
The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight . 
In less than a second , these seven men , horrible to behold , had grouped themselves in an attitude of defence , one with his meat-axe , another with his key , another with his bludgeon , the rest with shears , pincers , and hammers . 
Thenardier had his knife in his fist . 
The Thenardier woman snatched up an enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman . 
Javert put on his hat again , and advanced a couple of paces into the room , with arms folded , his cane under one arm , his sword in its sheath . 
`` Halt there , '' said he . 
`` You shall not go out by the window , you shall go through the door . 
It 's less unhealthy . 
There are seven of you , there are fifteen of us . 
Do n't let 's fall to collaring each other like men of Auvergne . '' 
Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse , and put it in Thenardier 's hand , whispering in the latter 's ear : -- `` It 's Javert . 
I do n't dare fire at that man . 
Do you dare ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
replied Thenardier . 
`` Well , then , fire . '' 
Thenardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert . 
Javert , who was only three paces from him , stared intently at him and contented himself with saying : -- `` Come now , do n't fire . 
You 'll miss fire . '' 
Thenardier pulled the trigger . 
The pistol missed fire . 
`` Did n't I tell you so ! '' 
ejaculated Javert . 
Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert 's feet . 
`` You 're the emperor of the fiends ! 
I surrender . '' 
`` And you ? '' 
Javert asked the rest of the ruffians . 
They replied : -- `` So do we . '' 
Javert began again calmly : -- `` That 's right , that 's good , I said so , you are nice fellows . 
`` I only ask one thing , '' said Bigrenaille , `` and that is , that I may not be denied tobacco while I am in confinement . '' 
`` Granted , '' said Javert . 
And turning round and calling behind him : -- `` Come in now ! '' 
A squad of policemen , sword in hand , and agents armed with bludgeons and cudgels , rushed in at Javert 's summons .
