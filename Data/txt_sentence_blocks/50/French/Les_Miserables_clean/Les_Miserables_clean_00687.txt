`` I know that secret as well as the others , '' said Marius . 
The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle . 
`` Monsieur le Baron , say ten thousand francs and I will speak . '' 
`` I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me . 
I know what you wish to say to me . '' 
A fresh flash gleamed in the man 's eye . 
He exclaimed : `` But I must dine to-day , nevertheless . 
It is an extraordinary secret , I tell you . 
Monsieur le Baron , I will speak . 
I speak . 
Give me twenty francs . '' 
Marius gazed intently at him : `` I know your extraordinary secret , just as I knew Jean Valjean 's name , just as I know your name . '' 
`` My name ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That is not difficult , Monsieur le Baron . 
I had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you . 
Thenard . '' '' 
-- Dier . '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` Thenardier . '' 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
In danger the porcupine bristles up , the beetle feigns death , the old guard forms in a square ; this man burst into laughter . 
Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip . 
Marius continued : `` You are also Jondrette the workman , Fabantou the comedian , Genflot the poet , Don Alvares the Spaniard , and Mistress Balizard . '' 
`` Mistress what ? '' 
`` And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil . '' 
`` A pot-house ! 
Never . '' 
`` And I tell you that your name is Thenardier . '' 
`` I deny it . '' 
`` And that you are a rascal . 
Here . '' 
And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face . 
`` Thanks ! 
Pardon me ! 
five hundred francs ! 
Monsieur le Baron ! '' 
And the man , overcome , bowed , seized the note and examined it . 
`` Five hundred francs ! '' 
he began again , taken aback . 
And he stammered in a low voice : `` An honest rustler . '' 
-LSB- 69 -RSB- -LSB- 69 -RSB- Un fafiot serieux . 
Fafiot is the slang term for a bank-bill , derived from its rustling noise . 
Then brusquely : `` Well , so be it ! '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` Let us put ourselves at our ease . '' 
And with the agility of a monkey , flinging back his hair , tearing off his spectacles , and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made , and which the reader has also met with on another page of this book , he took off his face as the man takes off his hat . 
His eye lighted up ; his uneven brow , with hollows in some places and bumps in others , hideously wrinkled at the top , was laid bare , his nose had become as sharp as a beak ; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared . 
`` Monsieur le Baron is infallible , '' he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared , `` I am Thenardier . '' 
And he straightened up his crooked back .
