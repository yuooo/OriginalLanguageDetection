The sittings generally close at six o'clock . '' 
When they arrived on the grand square , however , the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up , in the front of a vast and gloomy building . 
`` Upon my word , sir , you are in luck ; you have arrived in season . 
Do you see those four windows ? 
That is the Court of Assizes . 
There is light there , so they are not through . 
The matter must have been greatly protracted , and they are holding an evening session . 
Do you take an interest in this affair ? 
Is it a criminal case ? 
Are you a witness ? '' 
He replied : -- `` I have not come on any business ; I only wish to speak to one of the lawyers . '' 
`` That is different , '' said the bourgeois . 
`` Stop , sir ; here is the door where the sentry stands . 
You have only to ascend the grand staircase . '' 
He conformed to the bourgeois 's directions , and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people , and where groups , intermingled with lawyers in their gowns , were whispering together here and there . 
It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black , murmuring together in low voices , on the threshold of the halls of justice . 
It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words . 
Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result . 
All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices . 
This spacious hall , illuminated by a single lamp , was the old hall of the episcopal palace , and served as the large hall of the palace of justice . 
A double-leaved door , which was closed at that moment , separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting . 
The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met . 
`` What stage have they reached , sir ? '' 
he asked . 
`` It is finished , '' said the lawyer . 
`` Finished ! '' 
This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round . 
`` Excuse me sir ; perhaps you are a relative ? '' 
`` No ; I know no one here . 
Has judgment been pronounced ? '' 
`` Of course . 
Nothing else was possible . '' 
`` To penal servitude ? '' 
`` For life . '' 
He continued , in a voice so weak that it was barely audible : -- `` Then his identity was established ? '' 
`` What identity ? '' 
replied the lawyer . 
`` There was no identity to be established . 
The matter was very simple . 
The woman had murdered her child ; the infanticide was proved ; the jury threw out the question of premeditation , and she was condemned for life . '' 
`` So it was a woman ? '' 
said he . 
`` Why , certainly . 
The Limosin woman . 
Of what are you speaking ? '' 
`` Nothing . 
But since it is all over , how comes it that the hall is still lighted ? '' 
`` For another case , which was begun about two hours ago . 
`` What other case ? '' 
`` Oh !
