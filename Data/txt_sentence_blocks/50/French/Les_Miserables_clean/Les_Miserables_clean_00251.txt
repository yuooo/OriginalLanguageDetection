`` No . '' 
`` Did you not hear the bell ? '' 
`` Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` I can hardly distinguish my own signal . '' 
`` She died at daybreak . '' 
`` And then , the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning . '' 
`` It was Mother Crucifixion . 
A blessed woman . '' 
The prioress paused , moved her lips , as though in mental prayer , and resumed : -- `` Three years ago , Madame de Bethune , a Jansenist , turned orthodox , merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , now I hear the knell , reverend Mother . '' 
`` The mothers have taken her to the dead-room , which opens on the church . '' 
`` I know . '' 
`` No other man than you can or must enter that chamber . 
See to that . 
A fine sight it would be , to see a man enter the dead-room ! '' 
`` More often ! '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` More often ! '' 
`` What do you say ? '' 
`` I say more often . '' 
`` More often than what ? '' 
`` Reverend Mother , I did not say more often than what , I said more often . '' 
`` I do n't understand you . 
Why do you say more often ? '' 
`` In order to speak like you , reverend Mother . '' 
`` But I did not say ` more often . ' '' 
At that moment , nine o'clock struck . 
`` At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours , praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar , '' said the prioress . 
`` Amen , '' said Fauchelevent . 
The clock struck opportunely . 
It cut `` more often '' short . 
It is probable , that had it not been for this , the prioress and Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein . 
Fauchelevent mopped his forehead . 
The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur , probably sacred , then raised her voice : -- `` In her lifetime , Mother Crucifixion made converts ; after her death , she will perform miracles . '' 
`` She will ! '' 
replied Father Fauchelevent , falling into step , and striving not to flinch again . 
`` Father Fauvent , the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion . 
No doubt , it is not granted to every one to die , like Cardinal de Berulle , while saying the holy mass , and to breathe forth their souls to God , while pronouncing these words : Hanc igitur oblationem . 
But without attaining to such happiness , Mother Crucifixion 's death was very precious . 
She retained her consciousness to the very last moment . 
She spoke to us , then she spoke to the angels . 
She gave us her last commands . 
If you had a little more faith , and if you could have been in her cell , she would have cured your leg merely by touching it . 
She smiled . 
We felt that she was regaining her life in God . 
There was something of paradise in that death . '' 
Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing . 
`` Amen , '' said he .
