That said , he restored order in the netting , pushed the two children gently down on the bed , pressed their knees , in order to stretch them out at full length , and exclaimed : -- `` Since the good God is lighting his candle , I can blow out mine . 
Now , babes , now , my young humans , you must shut your peepers . 
It 's very bad not to sleep . 
It 'll make you swallow the strainer , or , as they say , in fashionable society , stink in the gullet . 
Wrap yourself up well in the hide ! 
I 'm going to put out the light . 
Are you ready ? '' 
`` Yes , '' murmured the elder , `` I 'm all right . 
I seem to have feathers under my head . '' 
`` People do n't say ` head , ' '' cried Gavroche , `` they say ` nut ' . '' 
The two children nestled close to each other , Gavroche finished arranging them on the mat , drew the blanket up to their very ears , then repeated , for the third time , his injunction in the hieratical tongue : -- `` Shut your peepers ! '' 
And he snuffed out his tiny light . 
Hardly had the light been extinguished , when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay . 
It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound , as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire . 
This was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries . 
The little five-year-old boy , on hearing this hubbub overhead , and chilled with terror , jogged his brother 's elbow ; but the elder brother had already shut his peepers , as Gavroche had ordered . 
Then the little one , who could no longer control his terror , questioned Gavroche , but in a very low tone , and with bated breath : -- `` Sir ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche , who had just closed his eyes . 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` It 's the rats , '' replied Gavroche . 
And he laid his head down on the mat again . 
The rats , in fact , who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant , and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned , had been held in awe by the flame of the candle , so long as it had been lighted ; but as soon as the cavern , which was the same as their city , had returned to darkness , scenting what the good story-teller Perrault calls `` fresh meat , '' they had hurled themselves in throngs on Gavroche 's tent , had climbed to the top of it , and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap . 
Still the little one could not sleep . 
`` Sir ? '' 
he began again . 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` What are rats ? '' 
`` They are mice . '' 
This explanation reassured the child a little . 
He had seen white mice in the course of his life , and he was not afraid of them . 
Nevertheless , he lifted up his voice once more . 
`` Sir ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
said Gavroche again . 
`` Why do n't you have a cat ? '' 
`` I did have one , '' replied Gavroche , `` I brought one here , but they ate her . '' 
This second explanation undid the work of the first , and the little fellow began to tremble again . 
The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time : -- `` Monsieur ? '' 
`` Hey ? '' 
`` Who was it that was eaten ? '' 
`` The cat . '' 
`` And who ate the cat ? '' 
`` The rats . '' 
`` The mice ? '' 
`` Yes , the rats . '' 
The child , in consternation , dismayed at the thought of mice which ate cats , pursued : -- `` Sir , would those mice eat us ? '' 
`` Would n't they just ! '' 
ejaculated Gavroche .
