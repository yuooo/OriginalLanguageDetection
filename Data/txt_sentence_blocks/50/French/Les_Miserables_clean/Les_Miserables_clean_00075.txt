She was still young ; she was barely thirty . 
If this crouching woman had stood upright , her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs , might have frightened the traveller at the outset , troubled her confidence , and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish . 
A person who is seated instead of standing erect -- destinies hang upon such a thing as that . 
The traveller told her story , with slight modifications . 
That she was a working-woman ; that her husband was dead ; that her work in Paris had failed her , and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere , in her own native parts ; that she had left Paris that morning on foot ; that , as she was carrying her child , and felt fatigued , she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it ; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot ; that the little one had walked a little , but not much , because she was so young , and that she had been obliged to take her up , and the jewel had fallen asleep . 
At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss , which woke her . 
The child opened her eyes , great blue eyes like her mother 's , and looked at -- what ? 
Nothing ; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children , which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue . 
One would say that they feel themselves to be angels , and that they know us to be men . 
Then the child began to laugh ; and although the mother held fast to her , she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run . 
All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing , stopped short , and put out her tongue , in sign of admiration . 
Mother Thenardier released her daughters , made them descend from the swing , and said : -- `` Now amuse yourselves , all three of you . '' 
Children become acquainted quickly at that age , and at the expiration of a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer at making holes in the ground , which was an immense pleasure . 
The new-comer was very gay ; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child ; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel , and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly . 
The grave-digger 's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child . 
The two women pursued their chat . 
`` What is your little one 's name ? '' 
`` Cosette . '' 
For Cosette , read Euphrasie . 
The child 's name was Euphrasie . 
But out of Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into Pepita , and Francoise into Sillette . 
It is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists . 
We have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon . 
`` How old is she ? '' 
`` She is going on three . '' 
`` That is the age of my eldest . '' 
In the meantime , the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness ; an event had happened ; a big worm had emerged from the ground , and they were afraid ; and they were in ecstasies over it . 
Their radiant brows touched each other ; one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole . 
`` How easily children get acquainted at once ! '' 
exclaimed Mother Thenardier ; `` one would swear that they were three sisters ! '' 
This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for . 
She seized the Thenardier 's hand , looked at her fixedly , and said : -- `` Will you keep my child for me ? '' 
The Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal . 
Cosette 's mother continued : -- `` You see , I can not take my daughter to the country . 
My work will not permit it . 
With a child one can find no situation . 
People are ridiculous in the country . 
It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn . 
When I caught sight of your little ones , so pretty , so clean , and so happy , it overwhelmed me . 
I said : ` Here is a good mother . 
That is just the thing ; that will make three sisters . ' 
And then , it will not be long before I return . 
Will you keep my child for me ? '' 
`` I must see about it , '' replied the Thenardier . 
`` I will give you six francs a month . '' 
Here a man 's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop : -- `` Not for less than seven francs . 
And six months paid in advance . '' 
`` Six times seven makes forty-two , '' said the Thenardier . 
`` I will give it , '' said the mother . 
`` And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses , '' added the man 's voice .
