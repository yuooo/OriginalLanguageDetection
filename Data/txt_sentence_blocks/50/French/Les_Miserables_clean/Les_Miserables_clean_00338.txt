The porter raised his head and said : -- `` Are you a police spy , sir ? '' 
Marius went off quite abashed , but delighted . 
He was getting on . 
`` Good , '' thought he , `` I know that her name is Ursule , that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income , and that she lives there , on the third floor , in the Rue de l'Ouest . '' 
On the following day , M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the Luxembourg ; they went away while it was still broad daylight . 
Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest , as he had taken up the habit of doing . 
On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter pass in first , then paused , before crossing the threshold , and stared intently at Marius . 
On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg . 
Marius waited for them all day in vain . 
At nightfall , he went to the Rue de l'Ouest , and saw a light in the windows of the third story . 
He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished . 
The next day , no one at the Luxembourg . 
Marius waited all day , then went and did sentinel duty under their windows . 
This carried him on to ten o'clock in the evening . 
His dinner took care of itself . 
Fever nourishes the sick man , and love the lover . 
He spent a week in this manner . 
M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the Luxembourg . 
Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures ; he dared not watch the porte cochere during the day ; he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows . 
At times he saw shadows flit across them , and his heart began to beat . 
On the eighth day , when he arrived under the windows , there was no light in them . 
`` Hello ! '' 
he said , `` the lamp is not lighted yet . 
But it is dark . 
Can they have gone out ? '' 
He waited until ten o'clock . 
Until midnight . 
Until one in the morning . 
Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story , and no one entered the house . 
He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind . 
On the morrow , -- for he only existed from morrow to morrow , there was , so to speak , no to-day for him , -- on the morrow , he found no one at the Luxembourg ; he had expected this . 
At dusk , he went to the house . 
No light in the windows ; the shades were drawn ; the third floor was totally dark . 
Marius rapped at the porte cochere , entered , and said to the porter : -- `` The gentleman on the third floor ? '' 
`` Has moved away , '' replied the porter . 
Marius reeled and said feebly : -- `` How long ago ? '' 
`` Yesterday . '' 
`` Where is he living now ? '' 
`` I do n't know anything about it . '' 
`` So he has not left his new address ? '' 
`` No . '' 
And the porter , raising his eyes , recognized Marius . 
`` Come ! 
So it 's you ! '' 
said he ; `` but you are decidedly a spy then ? '' 
BOOK SEVENTH . 
-- PATRON MINETTE MINES AND MINERS Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance , a third lower floor . 
The social soil is everywhere undermined , sometimes for good , sometimes for evil . 
These works are superposed one upon the other . 
There are superior mines and inferior mines .
