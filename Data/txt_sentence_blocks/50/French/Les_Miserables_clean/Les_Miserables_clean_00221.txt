Dieu-Jesus ! 
Did you fall from heaven ? 
There is no trouble about that : if ever you do fall , it will be from there . 
And what a state you are in ! 
You have no cravat ; you have no hat ; you have no coat ! 
Do you know , you would have frightened any one who did not know you ? 
No coat ! 
Lord God ! 
Are the saints going mad nowadays ? 
But how did you get in here ? '' 
His words tumbled over each other . 
The goodman talked with a rustic volubility , in which there was nothing alarming . 
All this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness . 
`` Who are you ? 
and what house is this ? '' 
demanded Jean Valjean . 
`` Ah ! 
pardieu , this is too much ! '' 
exclaimed the old man . 
`` I am the person for whom you got the place here , and this house is the one where you had me placed . 
What ! 
You do n't recognize me ? '' 
`` No , '' said Jean Valjean ; `` and how happens it that you know me ? '' 
`` You saved my life , '' said the man . 
He turned . 
A ray of moonlight outlined his profile , and Jean Valjean recognized old Fauchelevent . 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Jean Valjean , `` so it is you ? 
Yes , I recollect you . '' 
`` That is very lucky , '' said the old man , in a reproachful tone . 
`` And what are you doing here ? '' 
resumed Jean Valjean . 
`` Why , I am covering my melons , of course ! '' 
In fact , at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him , old Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed . 
During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them . 
It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean . 
He continued : -- `` I said to myself , ` The moon is bright : it is going to freeze . 
What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats ? ' 
And , '' he added , looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile , -- `` pardieu ! 
you ought to have done the same ! 
But how do you come here ? '' 
Jean Valjean , finding himself known to this man , at least only under the name of Madeleine , thenceforth advanced only with caution . 
He multiplied his questions . 
Strange to say , their roles seemed to be reversed . 
It was he , the intruder , who interrogated . 
`` And what is this bell which you wear on your knee ? '' 
`` This , '' replied Fauchelevent , `` is so that I may be avoided . '' 
`` What ! 
so that you may be avoided ? '' 
Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air .
