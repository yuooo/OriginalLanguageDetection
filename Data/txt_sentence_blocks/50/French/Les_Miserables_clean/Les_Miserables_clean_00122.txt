`` I have none . '' 
`` What ! 
not even a spring-cart ? 
I am not hard to please , as you see . '' 
`` We live in a poor country . 
There is , in truth , '' added the wheelwright , `` an old calash under the shed yonder , which belongs to a bourgeois of the town , who gave it to me to take care of , and who only uses it on the thirty-sixth of the month -- never , that is to say . 
I might let that to you , for what matters it to me ? 
But the bourgeois must not see it pass -- and then , it is a calash ; it would require two horses . '' 
`` I will take two post-horses . '' 
`` Where is Monsieur going ? '' 
`` To Arras . '' 
`` And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day ? '' 
`` Yes , of course . '' 
`` By taking two post-horses ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock to-morrow morning ? '' 
`` Certainly not . '' 
`` There is one thing to be said about that , you see , by taking post-horses -- Monsieur has his passport ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , by taking post-horses , Monsieur can not reach Arras before to-morrow . 
We are on a cross-road . 
The relays are badly served , the horses are in the fields . 
The season for ploughing is just beginning ; heavy teams are required , and horses are seized upon everywhere , from the post as well as elsewhere . 
Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay . 
And , then , they drive at a walk . 
There are many hills to ascend . '' 
`` Come then , I will go on horseback . 
Unharness the cabriolet . 
Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood . '' 
`` Without doubt . 
But will this horse bear the saddle ? '' 
`` That is true ; you remind me of that ; he will not bear it . '' 
`` Then -- '' `` But I can surely hire a horse in the village ? '' 
`` A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts . 
You would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you . 
But you will not find one for sale nor to let , for five hundred francs , or for a thousand . '' 
`` What am I to do ? '' 
`` The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man , and set out on your journey to-morrow . '' 
`` To-morrow will be too late . '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras ? 
When will it pass ? '' 
`` To-night . 
Both the posts pass at night ; the one going as well as the one coming . '' 
`` What ! 
It will take you a day to mend this wheel ? '' 
`` A day , and a good long one . '' 
`` If you set two men to work ? ''
