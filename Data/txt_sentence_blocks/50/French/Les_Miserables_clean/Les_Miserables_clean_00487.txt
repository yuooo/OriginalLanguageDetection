`` If we go away , do you go too ! 
I will tell you where ! 
Come and join me wherever I am . '' 
Marius was now a thoroughly roused man . 
He had fallen back into reality . 
He cried to Cosette : -- `` Go away with you ! 
Are you mad ? 
Why , I should have to have money , and I have none ! 
Go to England ? 
But I am in debt now , I owe , I do n't know how much , more than ten louis to Courfeyrac , one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted ! 
I have an old hat which is not worth three francs , I have a coat which lacks buttons in front , my shirt is all ragged , my elbows are torn , my boots let in the water ; for the last six weeks I have not thought about it , and I have not told you about it . 
You only see me at night , and you give me your love ; if you were to see me in the daytime , you would give me a sou ! 
Go to England ! 
Eh ! 
I have n't enough to pay for a passport ! '' 
He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand , erect , his brow pressed close to the bark , feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin , nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples , and there he stood motionless , on the point of falling , like the statue of despair . 
He remained a long time thus . 
One could remain for eternity in such abysses . 
At last he turned round . 
He heard behind him a faint stifled noise , which was sweet yet sad . 
It was Cosette sobbing . 
She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he meditated . 
He came to her , fell at her knees , and slowly prostrating himself , he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe , and kissed it . 
She let him have his way in silence . 
There are moments when a woman accepts , like a sombre and resigned goddess , the religion of love . 
`` Do not weep , '' he said . 
She murmured : -- `` Not when I may be going away , and you can not come ! '' 
He went on : -- `` Do you love me ? '' 
She replied , sobbing , by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid tears : -- `` I adore you ! '' 
He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress : -- `` Do not weep . 
Tell me , will you do this for me , and cease to weep ? '' 
`` Do you love me ? '' 
said she . 
He took her hand . 
`` Cosette , I have never given my word of honor to any one , because my word of honor terrifies me . 
I feel that my father is by my side . 
Well , I give you my most sacred word of honor , that if you go away I shall die . '' 
In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil , that Cosette trembled . 
She felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by . 
The shock made her cease weeping . 
`` Now , listen , '' said he , `` do not expect me to-morrow . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow . '' 
`` Oh ! 
Why ? '' 
`` You will see . '' 
`` A day without seeing you ! 
But that is impossible ! '' 
`` Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives , perhaps . '' 
And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside : -- `` He is a man who never changes his habits , and he has never received any one except in the evening . ''
