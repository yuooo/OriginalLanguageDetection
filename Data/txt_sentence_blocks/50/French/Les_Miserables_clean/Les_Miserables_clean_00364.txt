`` I tell you that it is she . 
You will see . '' 
At this absolute assertion , the Jondrette woman raised her large , red , blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression . 
At that moment , she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband . 
She was a sow with the look of a tigress . 
`` What ! '' 
she resumed , `` that horrible , beautiful young lady , who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity , -- she is that beggar brat ! 
Oh ! 
I should like to kick her stomach in for her ! '' 
She sprang off of the bed , and remained standing for a moment , her hair in disorder , her nostrils dilating , her mouth half open , her fists clenched and drawn back . 
Then she fell back on the bed once more . 
The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female . 
After a silence lasting several minutes , he approached the female Jondrette , and halted in front of her , with folded arms , as he had done a moment before : -- `` And shall I tell you another thing ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
she asked . 
He answered in a low , curt voice : -- `` My fortune is made . '' 
The woman stared at him with the look that signifies : `` Is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad ? '' 
He went on : -- `` Thunder ! 
It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire , - die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread ! 
I have had enough of misery ! 
my share and other people 's share ! 
I am not joking any longer , I do n't find it comic any more , I 've had enough of puns , good God ! 
no more farces , Eternal Father ! 
I want to eat till I am full , I want to drink my fill ! 
to gormandize ! 
to sleep ! 
to do nothing ! 
I want to have my turn , so I do , come now ! 
before I die ! 
I want to be a bit of a millionnaire ! '' 
He took a turn round the hovel , and added : -- `` Like other people . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
asked the woman . 
He shook his head , winked , screwed up one eye , and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration : -- `` What do I mean by that ? 
Listen ! '' 
`` Hush ! '' 
muttered the woman , `` not so loud ! 
These are matters which must not be overheard . '' 
`` Bah ! 
Who 's here ? 
Our neighbor ? 
I saw him go out a little while ago . 
Besides , he does n't listen , the big booby . 
And I tell you that I saw him go out . '' 
Nevertheless , by a sort of instinct , Jondrette lowered his voice , although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words . 
One favorable circumstance , which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard . 
This is what Marius heard : -- `` Listen carefully . 
The Croesus is caught , or as good as caught ! 
That 's all settled already . 
Everything is arranged .
