And you wo n't live with us ! 
And you wo n't have my chamber ! 
What have I done to you ? 
Has anything happened ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Well then ? '' 
`` Everything is as usual . '' 
`` Why do you change your name ? '' 
`` You have changed yours , surely . '' 
He smiled again with the same smile as before and added : `` Since you are Madame Pontmercy , I certainly can be Monsieur Jean . '' 
`` I do n't understand anything about it . 
All this is idiotic . 
I shall ask permission of my husband for you to be ` Monsieur Jean . ' 
I hope that he will not consent to it . 
You cause me a great deal of pain . 
One does have freaks , but one does not cause one 's little Cosette grief . 
That is wrong . 
You have no right to be wicked , you who are so good . '' 
He made no reply . 
She seized his hands with vivacity , and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement , she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin , which is a gesture of profound tenderness . 
`` Oh ! '' 
she said to him , `` be good ! '' 
And she went on : `` This is what I call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father . '' 
He loosed her hands . 
`` You no longer need a father , you have a husband . '' 
Cosette became angry . 
`` I no longer need a father ! 
One really does not know what to say to things like that , which are not common sense ! '' 
`` If Toussaint were here , '' resumed Jean Valjean , like a person who is driven to seek authorities , and who clutches at every branch , `` she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own . 
There is nothing new in this . 
I always have loved my black corner . '' 
`` But it is cold here . 
One can not see distinctly . 
It is abominable , that it is , to wish to be Monsieur Jean ! 
I will not have you say ` you ' to me . 
`` Just now , as I was coming hither , '' replied Jean Valjean , `` I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis . 
It was at a cabinet-maker 's . 
If I were a pretty woman , I would treat myself to that bit of furniture . 
A very neat toilet table in the reigning style . 
What you call rosewood , I think . 
It is inlaid . 
The mirror is quite large . 
There are drawers . 
It is pretty . '' 
`` Hou ! 
the villainous bear ! '' 
replied Cosette . 
And with supreme grace , setting her teeth and drawing back her lips , she blew at Jean Valjean . 
She was a Grace copying a cat . 
`` I am furious , '' she resumed .
