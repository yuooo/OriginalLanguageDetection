`` I can not receive you , sir , '' said he . 
The man half rose . 
`` What ! 
Are you afraid that I will not pay you ? 
Do you want me to pay you in advance ? 
I have money , I tell you . '' 
`` It is not that . '' 
`` What then ? '' 
`` You have money -- '' `` Yes , '' said the man . 
`` And I , '' said the host , `` have no room . '' 
The man resumed tranquilly , `` Put me in the stable . '' 
`` I can not . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` The horses take up all the space . '' 
`` Very well ! '' 
retorted the man ; `` a corner of the loft then , a truss of straw . 
We will see about that after dinner . '' 
`` I can not give you any dinner . '' 
This declaration , made in a measured but firm tone , struck the stranger as grave . 
He rose . 
`` Ah ! 
bah ! 
But I am dying of hunger . 
I have been walking since sunrise . 
I have travelled twelve leagues . 
I pay . 
I wish to eat . '' 
`` I have nothing , '' said the landlord . 
The man burst out laughing , and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves : `` Nothing ! 
and all that ? '' 
`` All that is engaged . '' 
`` By whom ? '' 
`` By messieurs the wagoners . '' 
`` How many are there of them ? '' 
`` Twelve . '' 
`` There is enough food there for twenty . '' 
`` They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance . '' 
The man seated himself again , and said , without raising his voice , `` I am at an inn ; I am hungry , and I shall remain . '' 
Then the host bent down to his ear , and said in a tone which made him start , `` Go away ! '' 
At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff ; he turned quickly round , and as he opened his mouth to reply , the host gazed steadily at him and added , still in a low voice : `` Stop ! 
there 's enough of that sort of talk . 
Do you want me to tell you your name ? 
Your name is Jean Valjean . 
Now do you want me to tell you who you are ? 
When I saw you come in I suspected something ; I sent to the town-hall , and this was the reply that was sent to me . 
Can you read ? '' 
So saying , he held out to the stranger , fully unfolded , the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall , and from the town-hall to the inn . 
The man cast a glance upon it . 
The landlord resumed after a pause . 
`` I am in the habit of being polite to every one .
