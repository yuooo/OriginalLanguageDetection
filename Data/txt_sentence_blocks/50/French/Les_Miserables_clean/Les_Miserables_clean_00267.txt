Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless . 
Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh : -- `` He is dead ! '' 
And , drawing himself up , and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders , he cried : -- `` And this is the way I save his life ! '' 
Then the poor man fell to sobbing . 
He soliloquized the while , for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural . 
Powerful emotion often talks aloud . 
`` It is Father Mestienne 's fault . 
Why did that fool die ? 
What need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it ? 
It is he who has killed M. Madeleine . 
Father Madeleine ! 
He is in the coffin . 
It is quite handy . 
All is over . 
Now , is there any sense in these things ? 
Ah ! 
my God ! 
he is dead ! 
Well ! 
and his little girl , what am I to do with her ? 
What will the fruit-seller say ? 
The idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this ! 
When I think how he put himself under that cart ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Pardine ! 
He was suffocated , I said so . 
He would n't believe me . 
Well ! 
Here 's a pretty trick to play ! 
He is dead , that good man , the very best man out of all the good God 's good folks ! 
And his little girl ! 
Ah ! 
In the first place , I wo n't go back there myself . 
I shall stay here . 
After having done such a thing as that ! 
What 's the use of being two old men , if we are two old fools ! 
But , in the first place , how did he manage to enter the convent ? 
That was the beginning of it all . 
One should not do such things . 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Father Madeleine ! 
Madeleine ! 
Monsieur Madeleine ! 
Monsieur le Maire ! 
He does not hear me . 
Now get out of this scrape if you can ! '' 
And he tore his hair . 
A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance .
