Thenardier , raising his right hand to a level with his forehead , formed with it a shade , then he brought his eyelashes together , by screwing up his eyes , a motion which , in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth , characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man . 
He did not succeed . 
Jean Valjean , as we have just stated , had his back turned to the light , and he was , moreover , so disfigured , so bemired , so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full noonday . 
On the contrary , illuminated by the light from the grating , a cellar light , it is true , livid , yet precise in its lividness , Thenardier , as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it , immediately `` leaped into '' Jean Valjean 's eyes . 
This inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men . 
The encounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled and Thenardier unmasked . 
Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thenardier did not recognize him . 
They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom , as though taking each other 's measure . 
Thenardier was the first to break the silence . 
`` How are you going to manage to get out ? '' 
Jean Valjean made no reply . 
Thenardier continued : `` It 's impossible to pick the lock of that gate . 
But still you must get out of this . '' 
`` That is true , '' said Jean Valjean . 
`` Well , half shares then . '' 
`` What do you mean by that ? '' 
`` You have killed that man ; that 's all right . 
I have the key . '' 
Thenardier pointed to Marius . 
He went on : `` I do n't know you , but I want to help you . 
You must be a friend . '' 
Jean Valjean began to comprehend . 
Thenardier took him for an assassin . 
Thenardier resumed : `` Listen , comrade . 
You did n't kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets . 
Give me my half . 
I 'll open the door for you . '' 
And half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key , he added : `` Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made ? 
Look here . '' 
Jean Valjean `` remained stupid '' -- the expression belongs to the elder Corneille -- to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real . 
It was providence appearing in horrible guise , and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of Thenardier . 
Thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse , drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean . 
`` Hold on , '' said he , `` I 'll give you the rope to boot . '' 
`` What is the rope for ? '' 
`` You will need a stone also , but you can find one outside . 
There 's a heap of rubbish . '' 
`` What am I to do with a stone ? '' 
`` Idiot , you 'll want to sling that stiff into the river , you 'll need a stone and a rope , otherwise it would float on the water . '' 
Jean Valjean took the rope . 
There is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way . 
Thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him . 
`` Ah , see here , comrade , how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder ? 
I have n't dared to risk myself in it . 
Phew ! 
you do n't smell good . '' 
After a pause he added : `` I 'm asking you questions , but you 're perfectly right not to answer . 
It 's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate . 
And then , when you do n't talk at all , you run no risk of talking too loud . 
That 's no matter , as I ca n't see your face and as I do n't know your name , you are wrong in supposing that I do n't know who you are and what you want . 
I twig .
