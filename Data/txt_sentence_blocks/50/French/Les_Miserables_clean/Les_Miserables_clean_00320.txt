`` Have you trinkets ? '' 
`` A watch . '' 
`` Silver ? '' 
`` Gold ; here it is . '' 
`` I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of trousers . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
`` You will then have only a pair of trousers , a waistcoat , a hat and a coat . '' 
`` And my boots . '' 
`` What ! 
you will not go barefoot ? 
What opulence ! '' 
`` That will be enough . '' 
`` I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch . '' 
`` That is good . '' 
`` No ; it is not good . 
What will you do after that ? '' 
`` Whatever is necessary . 
Anything honest , that is to say . '' 
`` Do you know English ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` Do you know German ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` So much the worse . '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Because one of my friends , a publisher , is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia , for which you might have translated English or German articles . 
It is badly paid work , but one can live by it . '' 
`` I will learn English and German . '' 
`` And in the meanwhile ? '' 
`` In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch . '' 
The clothes-dealer was sent for . 
He paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments . 
They went to the watchmaker 's . 
He bought the watch for forty-five francs . 
`` That is not bad , '' said Marius to Courfeyrac , on their return to the hotel , `` with my fifteen francs , that makes eighty . '' 
`` And the hotel bill ? '' 
observed Courfeyrac . 
`` Hello , I had forgotten that , '' said Marius . 
The landlord presented his bill , which had to be paid on the spot . 
It amounted to seventy francs . 
`` I have ten francs left , '' said Marius . 
`` The deuce , '' exclaimed Courfeyrac , `` you will eat up five francs while you are learning English , and five while learning German . 
That will be swallowing a tongue very fast , or a hundred sous very slowly . '' 
In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand , a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties , had finally hunted up Marius ' abode . 
One morning , on his return from the law-school , Marius found a letter from his aunt , and the sixty pistoles , that is to say , six hundred francs in gold , in a sealed box . 
Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt , with a respectful letter , in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs . 
At that moment , he had three francs left . 
His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him . 
Besides , had he not said : `` Let me never hear the name of that blood-drinker again ! '' 
Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques , as he did not wish to run in debt there .
