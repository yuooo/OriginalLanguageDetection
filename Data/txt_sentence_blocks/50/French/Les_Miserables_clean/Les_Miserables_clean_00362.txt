`` Yes . '' 
`` Do you know them ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` That is to say , '' she resumed quickly , `` you do not know her , but you wish to know her . '' 
This them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it . 
`` Well , can you do it ? '' 
said Marius . 
`` You shall have the beautiful lady 's address . '' 
There was still a shade in the words `` the beautiful lady '' which troubled Marius . 
He resumed : -- `` Never mind , after all , the address of the father and daughter . 
Their address , indeed ! '' 
She gazed fixedly at him . 
`` What will you give me ? '' 
`` Anything you like . '' 
`` Anything I like ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` You shall have the address . '' 
She dropped her head ; then , with a brusque movement , she pulled to the door , which closed behind her . 
Marius found himself alone . 
He dropped into a chair , with his head and both elbows on his bed , absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp , and as though a prey to vertigo . 
All that had taken place since the morning , the appearance of the angel , her disappearance , what that creature had just said to him , a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair , -- this was what filled his brain confusedly . 
All at once he was violently aroused from his revery . 
He heard the shrill , hard voice of Jondrette utter these words , which were fraught with a strange interest for him : -- `` I tell you that I am sure of it , and that I recognized him . '' 
Of whom was Jondrette speaking ? 
Whom had he recognized ? 
M. Leblanc ? 
The father of `` his Ursule '' ? 
What ! 
Did Jondrette know him ? 
Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him ? 
Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved , who that young girl was ? 
Who her father was ? 
Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled ? 
Was the veil about to be rent ? 
Ah ! 
Heavens ! 
He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode , and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall . 
Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette 's hovel . 
THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC 'S FIVE-FRANC PIECE Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered , except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets . 
Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds . 
Jondrette had evidently just returned . 
He still had the breathlessness of out of doors . 
His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace , the elder engaged in dressing the younger 's wounded hand . 
His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace , with a face indicative of astonishment . 
Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides . 
His eyes were extraordinary . 
The woman , who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband , turned to say : -- `` What , really ? 
You are sure ? '' 
`` Sure ! 
Eight years have passed !
