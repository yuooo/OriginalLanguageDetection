`` What name ? '' 
`` Marius Pontmercy . '' 
`` The wicked fellow ! '' 
exclaimed his aunt . 
`` Ah ! 
your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself . 
To think that he is to pass the night in a diligence ! '' 
`` Just as I am going to do . '' 
`` But you -- it is your duty ; in his case , it is wildness . '' 
`` Bosh ! '' 
said Theodule . 
Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder , -- an idea struck her . 
If she had been a man , she would have slapped her brow . 
She apostrophized Theodule : -- `` Are you aware whether your cousin knows you ? '' 
`` No . 
I have seen him ; but he has never deigned to notice me . '' 
`` So you are going to travel together ? '' 
`` He in the imperial , I in the coupe . '' 
`` Where does this diligence run ? '' 
`` To Andelys . '' 
`` Then that is where Marius is going ? '' 
`` Unless , like myself , he should stop on the way . 
I get down at Vernon , in order to take the branch coach for Gaillon . 
I know nothing of Marius ' plan of travel . '' 
`` Marius ! 
what an ugly name ! 
what possessed them to name him Marius ? 
While you , at least , are called Theodule . '' 
`` I would rather be called Alfred , '' said the officer . 
`` Listen , Theodule . '' 
`` I am listening , aunt . '' 
`` Pay attention . '' 
`` I am paying attention . '' 
`` You understand ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Well , Marius absents himself ! '' 
`` Eh ! 
eh ! '' 
`` He travels . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
`` He spends the night out . '' 
`` Oh ! 
oh ! '' 
`` We should like to know what there is behind all this . '' 
Theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze : -- `` Some petticoat or other . '' 
And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty , he added : -- `` A lass . '' 
`` That is evident , '' exclaimed his aunt , who thought she heard M. Gillenormand speaking , and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette , accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew . 
She resumed : -- `` Do us a favor . 
Follow Marius a little .
