`` The mayor . '' 
`` Bah ! 
M. Madeleine ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` His name was not Madeleine at all ; he had a frightful name , Bejean , Bojean , Boujean . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Good God ! '' 
`` He has been arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
`` In prison , in the city prison , while waiting to be transferred . '' 
`` Until he is transferred ! '' 
`` He is to be transferred ! '' 
`` Where is he to be taken ? '' 
`` He will be tried at the Assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago . '' 
`` Well ! 
I suspected as much . 
That man was too good , too perfect , too affected . 
He refused the cross ; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across . 
I always thought there was some evil history back of all that . '' 
The `` drawing-rooms '' particularly abounded in remarks of this nature . 
One old lady , a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc , made the following remark , the depth of which it is impossible to fathom : -- `` I am not sorry . 
It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists ! '' 
It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanished from M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory . 
The old portress who had served him was among the number . 
On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge , still in a thorough fright , and absorbed in sad reflections . 
The factory had been closed all day , the carriage gate was bolted , the street was deserted . 
There was no one in the house but the two nuns , Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice , who were watching beside the body of Fantine . 
Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home , the good portress rose mechanically , took from a drawer the key of M. Madeleine 's chamber , and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters ; then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it , and set the candlestick on one side , as though she was expecting him . 
Then she sat down again on her chair , and became absorbed in thought once more . 
The poor , good old woman bad done all this without being conscious of it . 
It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from her revery , and exclaimed , `` Hold ! 
My good God Jesus ! 
And I hung his key on the nail ! '' 
At that moment the small window in the lodge opened , a hand passed through , seized the key and the candlestick , and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there . 
The portress raised her eyes , and stood there with gaping mouth , and a shriek which she confined to her throat . 
She knew that hand , that arm , the sleeve of that coat . 
It was M. Madeleine . 
It was several seconds before she could speak ; she had a seizure , as she said herself , when she related the adventure afterwards . 
`` Good God , Monsieur le Maire , '' she cried at last , `` I thought you were -- '' She stopped ; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning . 
Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire to her . 
He finished her thought . 
`` In prison , '' said he . 
`` I was there ; I broke a bar of one of the windows ; I let myself drop from the top of a roof , and here I am . 
I am going up to my room ; go and find Sister Simplice for me . 
She is with that poor woman , no doubt . '' 
The old woman obeyed in all haste . 
He gave her no orders ; he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself . 
No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates . 
He had , and always carried about him , a pass-key which opened a little side-door ; but he must have been searched , and his latch-key must have been taken from him .
