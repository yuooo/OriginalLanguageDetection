The proof of it is , that on emerging from the sewer , he was arrested . 
Do you know , sir , that that man did all this ? 
And he had no recompense to expect . 
What was I ? 
An insurgent . 
What was I ? 
One of the conquered . 
Oh ! 
if Cosette 's six hundred thousand francs were mine ... '' `` They are yours , '' interrupted Jean Valjean . 
`` Well , '' resumed Marius , `` I would give them all to find that man once more . '' 
Jean Valjean remained silent . 
THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY , 1833 The night of the 16th to the 17th of February , 1833 , was a blessed night . 
Above its shadows heaven stood open . 
It was the wedding night of Marius and Cosette . 
The day had been adorable . 
It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather , a fairy spectacle , with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of the bridal pair , a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door ; but it had been sweet and smiling . 
The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day . 
France had not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off one 's wife , of fleeing , on coming out of church , of hiding oneself with shame from one 's happiness , and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song of Songs . 
People had not yet grasped to the full the chastity , exquisiteness , and decency of jolting their paradise in a posting-chaise , of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs , of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn , and of leaving behind them , in a commonplace chamber , at so much a night , the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tete-a-tete of the conductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn . 
In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living , the mayor and his scarf , the priest and his chasuble , the law and God no longer suffice ; they must be eked out by the Postilion de Lonjumeau ; a blue waistcoat turned up with red , and with bell buttons , a plaque like a vantbrace , knee-breeches of green leather , oaths to the Norman horses with their tails knotted up , false galloons , varnished hat , long powdered locks , an enormous whip and tall boots . 
France does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English nobility , and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes , in memory of Churchill , afterwards Marlborough , or Malbrouck , who was assailed on his wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck . 
Old shoes and slippers do not , as yet , form a part of our nuptial celebrations ; but patience , as good taste continues to spread , we shall come to that . 
In 1833 , a hundred years ago , marriage was not conducted at a full trot . 
Strange to say , at that epoch , people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival , that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity , that gayety , even in excess , provided it be honest , and decent , does happiness no harm , and that , in short , it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring , should begin at home , and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness . 
And people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes . 
The marriage took place , therefore , in accordance with this now superannuated fashion , at M. Gillenormand 's house . 
Natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is , the banns to publish , the papers to be drawn up , the mayoralty , and the church produce some complication . 
They could not get ready before the 16th of February . 
Now , we note this detail , for the pure satisfaction of being exact , it chanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday . 
Hesitations , scruples , particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand . 
`` Shrove Tuesday ! '' 
exclaimed the grandfather , `` so much the better . 
There is a proverb : '' ` Mariage un Mardi gras N'aura point enfants ingrats . ' 
-LSB- 66 -RSB- -LSB- 66 -RSB- `` A Shrove-Tuesday marriage will have no ungrateful children . '' 
Let us proceed . 
Here goes for the 16th ! 
Do you want to delay , Marius ? '' 
`` No , certainly not ! '' 
replied the lover . 
`` Let us marry , then , '' cried the grandfather . 
Accordingly , the marriage took place on the 16th , notwithstanding the public merrymaking . 
It rained that day , but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness , which lovers see , even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella . 
On the preceding evening , Jean Valjean handed to Marius , in the presence of M. Gillenormand , the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs . 
As the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property , the papers had been simple . 
Henceforth , Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean ; Cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of lady 's maid . 
As for Jean Valjean , a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house had been furnished expressly for him , and Cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner : `` Father , I entreat you , '' that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it . 
A few days before that fixed on for the marriage , an accident happened to Jean Valjean ; he crushed the thumb of his right hand . 
This was not a serious matter ; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it , nor to dress it , nor even to see his hurt , not even Cosette . 
Nevertheless , this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage , and to carry his arm in a sling , and had prevented his signing . 
M. Gillenormand , in his capacity of Cosette 's supervising-guardian , had supplied his place .
