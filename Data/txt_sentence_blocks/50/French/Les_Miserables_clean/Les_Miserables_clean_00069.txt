Let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes . 
I propose a toast to mirth ; be merry . 
Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating ! 
Indigestion and the digest . 
Let Justinian be the male , and Feasting , the female ! 
Joy in the depths ! 
Live , O creation ! 
The world is a great diamond . 
I am happy . 
The birds are astonishing . 
What a festival everywhere ! 
The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou . 
Summer , I salute thee ! 
O Luxembourg ! 
O Georgics of the Rue Madame , and of the Allee de l'Observatoire ! 
O pensive infantry soldiers ! 
O all those charming nurses who , while they guard the children , amuse themselves ! 
The pampas of America would please me if I had not the arcades of the Odeon . 
My soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas . 
All is beautiful . 
The flies buzz in the sun . 
The sun has sneezed out the humming bird . 
Embrace me , Fantine ! '' 
He made a mistake and embraced Favourite . 
THE DEATH OF A HORSE `` The dinners are better at Edon 's than at Bombarda 's , '' exclaimed Zephine . 
`` I prefer Bombarda to Edon , '' declared Blachevelle . 
`` There is more luxury . 
It is more Asiatic . 
Look at the room downstairs ; there are mirrors -LSB- glaces -RSB- on the walls . '' 
`` I prefer them -LSB- glaces , ices -RSB- on my plate , '' said Favourite . 
Blachevelle persisted : -- `` Look at the knives . 
The handles are of silver at Bombarda 's and of bone at Edon 's . 
Now , silver is more valuable than bone . '' 
`` Except for those who have a silver chin , '' observed Tholomyes . 
He was looking at the dome of the Invalides , which was visible from Bombarda 's windows . 
A pause ensued . 
`` Tholomyes , '' exclaimed Fameuil , `` Listolier and I were having a discussion just now . '' 
`` A discussion is a good thing , '' replied Tholomyes ; `` a quarrel is better . '' 
`` We were disputing about philosophy . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Which do you prefer , Descartes or Spinoza ? '' 
`` Desaugiers , '' said Tholomyes . 
This decree pronounced , he took a drink , and went on : -- `` I consent to live . 
All is not at an end on earth since we can still talk nonsense . 
For that I return thanks to the immortal gods . 
We lie . 
One lies , but one laughs . 
One affirms , but one doubts . 
The unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism . 
That is fine .
