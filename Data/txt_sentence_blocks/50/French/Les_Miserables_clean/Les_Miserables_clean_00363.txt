But I recognize him ! 
Ah ! 
I recognize him . 
I knew him at once ! 
What ! 
Did n't it force itself on you ? '' 
`` No . '' 
`` But I told you : ` Pay attention ! ' 
Why , it is his figure , it is his face , only older , -- there are people who do not grow old , I do n't know how they manage it , -- it is the very sound of his voice . 
He is better dressed , that is all ! 
Ah ! 
you mysterious old devil , I 've got you , that I have ! '' 
He paused , and said to his daughters : -- `` Get out of here , you ! 
-- It 's queer that it did n't strike you ! '' 
They arose to obey . 
The mother stammered : -- `` With her injured hand . '' 
`` The air will do it good , '' said Jondrette . 
`` Be off . '' 
It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply . 
The two girls departed . 
At the moment when they were about to pass through the door , the father detained the elder by the arm , and said to her with a peculiar accent : -- `` You will be here at five o'clock precisely . 
Both of you . 
I shall need you . '' 
Marius redoubled his attention . 
On being left alone with his wife , Jondrette began to pace the room again , and made the tour of it two or three times in silence . 
Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman 's chemise which he wore into his trousers . 
All at once , he turned to the female Jondrette , folded his arms and exclaimed : -- `` And would you like to have me tell you something ? 
The young lady -- '' `` Well , what ? '' 
retorted his wife , `` the young lady ? '' 
Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking . 
He listened with ardent anxiety . 
His whole life was in his ears . 
But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper . 
Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud : -- `` It is she ! '' 
`` That one ? '' 
said his wife . 
`` That very one , '' said the husband . 
No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother 's words . 
Surprise , rage , hate , wrath , were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation . 
The pronunciation of a few words , the name , no doubt , which her husband had whispered in her ear , had sufficed to rouse this huge , somnolent woman , and from being repulsive she became terrible . 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
she cried . 
`` When I think that my daughters are going barefoot , and have not a gown to their backs ! 
What ! 
A satin pelisse , a velvet bonnet , boots , and everything ; more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes ! 
so that one would think she was a lady ! 
No , you are mistaken ! 
Why , in the first place , the other was hideous , and this one is not so bad-looking ! 
She really is not bad-looking ! 
It ca n't be she ! ''
