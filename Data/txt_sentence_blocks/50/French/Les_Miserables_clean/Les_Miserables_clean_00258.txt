good , you can laugh , you are not speaking seriously . '' 
`` Very seriously , I must get out of this place . '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` l have told you to find a basket , and a cover for me also , '' `` Well ? '' 
`` The basket will be of pine , and the cover a black cloth . '' 
`` In the first place , it will be a white cloth . 
Nuns are buried in white . '' 
`` Let it be a white cloth , then . '' 
`` You are not like other men , Father Madeleine . '' 
To behold such devices , which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys , spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him , and mingle with what he called the `` petty course of life in the convent , '' caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by . 
Jean Valjean went on : -- `` The problem is to get out of here without being seen . 
This offers the means . 
But give me some information , in the first place . 
How is it managed ? 
Where is this coffin ? '' 
`` The empty one ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Down stairs , in what is called the dead-room . 
It stands on two trestles , under the pall . '' 
`` How long is the coffin ? '' 
`` Six feet . '' 
`` What is this dead-room ? '' 
`` It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden , which is closed on the outside by a shutter , and two doors ; one leads into the convent , the other into the church . '' 
`` What church ? '' 
`` The church in the street , the church which any one can enter . '' 
`` Have you the keys to those two doors ? '' 
`` No ; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent ; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church . '' 
`` When does the porter open that door ? '' 
`` Only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter , when they come to get the coffin . 
When the coffin has been taken out , the door is closed again . '' 
`` Who nails up the coffin ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Who spreads the pall over it ? '' 
`` I do . '' 
`` Are you alone ? '' 
`` Not another man , except the police doctor , can enter the dead-room . 
That is even written on the wall . '' 
`` Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep ? '' 
`` No . 
But I could hide you in a small , dark nook which opens on the dead-room , where I keep my tools to use for burials , and of which I have the key . '' 
`` At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow ? '' 
`` About three o'clock in the afternoon . 
The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall . 
It is not very near . '' 
`` I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the morning . 
And how about food ? 
I shall be hungry . '' 
`` I will bring you something . '' 
`` You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock . '' 
Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints .
