`` What are they going to bring us ? '' 
said Zephine . 
`` It will certainly be something pretty , '' said Dahlia . 
`` For my part , '' said Favourite , `` I want it to be of gold . '' 
Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake , which they could see through the branches of the large trees , and which diverted them greatly . 
It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences . 
Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the Champs-Elysees . 
The majority followed the quay and went through the Passy Barrier . 
From moment to moment , some huge vehicle , painted yellow and black , heavily loaded , noisily harnessed , rendered shapeless by trunks , tarpaulins , and valises , full of heads which immediately disappeared , rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge , with dust for smoke , and an air of fury , grinding the pavements , changing all the paving-stones into steels . 
This uproar delighted the young girls . 
Favourite exclaimed : -- `` What a row ! 
One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away . '' 
It chanced that one of these vehicles , which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms , halted for a moment , then set out again at a gallop . 
This surprised Fantine . 
`` That 's odd ! '' 
said she . 
`` I thought the diligence never stopped . '' 
Favourite shrugged her shoulders . 
`` This Fantine is surprising . 
I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity . 
She is dazzled by the simplest things . 
Suppose a case : I am a traveller ; I say to the diligence , ` I will go on in advance ; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass . ' 
The diligence passes , sees me , halts , and takes me . 
That is done every day . 
You do not know life , my dear . '' 
In this manner a certain time elapsed . 
All at once Favourite made a movement , like a person who is just waking up . 
`` Well , '' said she , `` and the surprise ? '' 
`` Yes , by the way , '' joined in Dahlia , `` the famous surprise ? '' 
`` They are a very long time about it ! '' 
said Fantine . 
As Fantine concluded this sigh , the waiter who had served them at dinner entered . 
He held in his hand something which resembled a letter . 
`` What is that ? '' 
demanded Favourite . 
The waiter replied : -- `` It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies . '' 
`` Why did you not bring it at once ? '' 
`` Because , '' said the waiter , `` the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour . '' 
Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter 's hand . 
It was , in fact , a letter . 
`` Stop ! '' 
said she ; `` there is no address ; but this is what is written on it -- '' `` THIS IS THE SURPRISE . '' 
She tore the letter open hastily , opened it , and read -LSB- she knew how to read -RSB- : -- `` OUR BELOVED : -- `` You must know that we have parents . 
Parents -- you do not know much about such things . 
They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code , which is puerile and honest . 
Now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for us . 
Being virtuous , we obey them . 
At the hour when you read this , five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas . 
We are pulling up our stakes , as Bossuet says . 
We are going ; we are gone .
