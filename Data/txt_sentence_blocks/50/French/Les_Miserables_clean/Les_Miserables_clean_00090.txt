She said , `` When I get rich , I will have my Cosette with me ; '' and she laughed . 
Her cough did not leave her , and she had sweats on her back . 
One day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms : `` Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood . 
A miliary fever , they call it . 
Expensive drugs are required . 
This is ruining us , and we can no longer pay for them . 
If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out , the little one will be dead . '' 
She burst out laughing , and said to her old neighbor : `` Ah ! 
they are good ! 
Forty francs ! 
the idea ! 
That makes two napoleons ! 
Where do they think I am to get them ? 
These peasants are stupid , truly . '' 
Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more . 
Then she descended the stairs and emerged , running and leaping and still laughing . 
Some one met her and said to her , `` What makes you so gay ? '' 
She replied : `` A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me . 
They demand forty francs of me . 
So much for you , you peasants ! '' 
As she crossed the square , she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape , upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red , who was holding forth . 
He was a quack dentist on his rounds , who was offering to the public full sets of teeth , opiates , powders and elixirs . 
Fantine mingled in the group , and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue , which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people . 
The tooth-puller espied the lovely , laughing girl , and suddenly exclaimed : `` You have beautiful teeth , you girl there , who are laughing ; if you want to sell me your palettes , I will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them . '' 
`` What are my palettes ? '' 
asked Fantine . 
`` The palettes , '' replied the dental professor , `` are the front teeth , the two upper ones . '' 
`` How horrible ! '' 
exclaimed Fantine . 
`` Two napoleons ! '' 
grumbled a toothless old woman who was present . 
`` Here 's a lucky girl ! '' 
Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her : `` Reflect , my beauty ! 
two napoleons ; they may prove of service . 
If your heart bids you , come this evening to the inn of the Tillac d'Argent ; you will find me there . '' 
Fantine returned home . 
She was furious , and related the occurrence to her good neighbor Marguerite : `` Can you understand such a thing ? 
Is he not an abominable man ? 
How can they allow such people to go about the country ! 
Pull out my two front teeth ! 
Why , I should be horrible ! 
My hair will grow again , but my teeth ! 
Ah ! 
what a monster of a man ! 
I should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story ! 
He told me that he should be at the Tillac d'Argent this evening . '' 
`` And what did he offer ? '' 
asked Marguerite . 
`` Two napoleons . '' 
`` That makes forty francs . ''
