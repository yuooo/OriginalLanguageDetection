As he spoke thus , he did not advance a single step ; he hurled at Jean Valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook , and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him . 
It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously . 
At Javert 's exclamation , Fantine opened her eyes once more . 
But the mayor was there ; what had she to fear ? 
Javert advanced to the middle of the room , and cried : -- `` See here now ! 
Art thou coming ? '' 
The unhappy woman glanced about her . 
No one was present excepting the nun and the mayor . 
To whom could that abject use of `` thou '' be addressed ? 
To her only . 
She shuddered . 
Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing , a thing so unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums of fever . 
She beheld Javert , the police spy , seize the mayor by the collar ; she saw the mayor bow his head . 
It seemed to her that the world was coming to an end . 
Javert had , in fact , grasped Jean Valjean by the collar . 
`` Monsieur le Maire ! '' 
shrieked Fantine . 
Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums . 
`` There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here ! '' 
Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat . 
He said : -- `` Javert -- '' Javert interrupted him : `` Call me Mr. Inspector . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said Jean Valjean , `` I should like to say a word to you in private . '' 
`` Aloud ! 
Say it aloud ! '' 
replied Javert ; `` people are in the habit of talking aloud to me . '' 
Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone : -- `` I have a request to make of you -- '' `` I tell you to speak loud . '' 
`` But you alone should hear it -- '' `` What difference does that make to me ? 
I shall not listen . '' 
Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low voice : -- `` Grant me three days ' grace ! 
three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman . 
I will pay whatever is necessary . 
You shall accompany me if you choose . '' 
`` You are making sport of me ! '' 
cried Javert . 
`` Come now , I did not think you such a fool ! 
You ask me to give you three days in which to run away ! 
You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature 's child ! 
Ah ! 
Ah ! 
That 's good ! 
That 's really capital ! '' 
Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling . 
`` My child ! '' 
she cried , `` to go and fetch my child ! 
She is not here , then ! 
Answer me , sister ; where is Cosette ? 
I want my child ! 
Monsieur Madeleine ! 
Monsieur le Maire ! '' 
Javert stamped his foot .
