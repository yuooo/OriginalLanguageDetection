said Gavroche . 
He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution , then he crawled in after them , pulled the stones together , and closed the opening hermetically again . 
All three had stretched out on the mat . 
Gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand . 
`` Now , '' said he , `` go to sleep ! 
I 'm going to suppress the candelabra . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche , pointing to the netting , `` what 's that for ? '' 
`` That , '' answered Gavroche gravely , `` is for the rats . 
Go to sleep ! '' 
Nevertheless , he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures , and he continued : -- `` It 's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes . 
It 's used for fierce animals . 
There 's a whole shopful of them there . 
All you 've got to do is to climb over a wall , crawl through a window , and pass through a door . 
You can get as much as you want . '' 
As he spoke , he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket , and the little one murmured : -- `` Oh ! 
how good that is ! 
It 's warm ! '' 
Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket . 
`` That 's from the Jardin des Plantes , too , '' said he . 
`` I took that from the monkeys . '' 
And , pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying , a very thick and admirably made mat , he added : -- `` That belonged to the giraffe . '' 
After a pause he went on : -- `` The beasts had all these things . 
I took them away from them . 
It did n't trouble them . 
I told them : ` It 's for the elephant . ' '' 
He paused , and then resumed : -- `` You crawl over the walls and you do n't care a straw for the government . 
So there now ! '' 
The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid and ingenious being , a vagabond like themselves , isolated like themselves , frail like themselves , who had something admirable and all-powerful about him , who seemed supernatural to them , and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank , mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles . 
`` Monsieur , '' ventured the elder timidly , `` you are not afraid of the police , then ? '' 
Gavroche contented himself with replying : -- `` Brat ! 
Nobody says ` police , ' they say ` bobbies . ' '' 
The smaller had his eyes wide open , but he said nothing . 
As he was on the edge of the mat , the elder being in the middle , Gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done , and heightened the mat under his head with old rags , in such a way as to form a pillow for the child . 
Then he turned to the elder : -- `` Hey ! 
We 're jolly comfortable here , ai n't we ? '' 
`` Ah , yes ! '' 
replied the elder , gazing at Gavroche with the expression of a saved angel . 
The two poor little children who had been soaked through , began to grow warm once more . 
`` Ah , by the way , '' continued Gavroche , `` what were you bawling about ? '' 
And pointing out the little one to his brother : -- `` A mite like that , I 've nothing to say about , but the idea of a big fellow like you crying ! 
It 's idiotic ; you looked like a calf . '' 
`` Gracious , replied the child , `` we have no lodging . '' 
`` Bother ! '' 
retorted Gavroche , `` you do n't say ` lodgings , ' you say ` crib . ' '' 
`` And then , we were afraid of being alone like that at night . '' 
`` You do n't say ` night , ' you say ` darkmans . ' '' 
`` Thank you , sir , '' said the child . 
`` Listen , '' went on Gavroche , `` you must never bawl again over anything . 
I 'll take care of you . 
You shall see what fun we 'll have .
