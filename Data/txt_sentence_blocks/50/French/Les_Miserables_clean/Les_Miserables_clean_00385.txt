Thenardier continued : -- `` Come instantly -- '' He paused : -- `` You address her as thou , do you not ? '' 
`` Who ? '' 
asked M. Leblanc . 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
cried Thenardier , `` the little one , the Lark . '' 
M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion : -- `` I do not know what you mean . '' 
`` Go on , nevertheless , '' ejaculated Thenardier , and he continued to dictate : -- `` Come immediately , I am in absolute need of thee . 
The person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me . 
I am waiting for thee . 
Come with confidence . '' 
M. Leblanc had written the whole of this . 
Thenardier resumed : -- `` Ah ! 
erase ` come with confidence ' ; that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be , and that distrust is possible . '' 
M. Leblanc erased the three words . 
`` Now , '' pursued Thenardier , `` sign it . 
What 's your name ? '' 
The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded : -- `` For whom is this letter ? '' 
`` You know well , '' retorted Thenardier , `` for the little one I just told you so . '' 
It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question . 
He said `` the Lark , '' he said `` the little one , '' but he did not pronounce her name -- the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices . 
To mention the name was to deliver the whole `` affair '' into their hands , and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing . 
He went on : -- `` Sign . 
What is your name ? '' 
`` Urbain Fabre , '' said the prisoner . 
Thenardier , with the movement of a cat , dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc . 
He looked for the mark on it , and held it close to the candle . 
`` U. F. That 's it . 
Urbain Fabre . 
Well , sign it U. F. '' The prisoner signed . 
`` As two hands are required to fold the letter , give it to me , I will fold it . '' 
That done , Thenardier resumed : -- `` Address it , ` Mademoiselle Fabre , ' at your house . 
I know that you live a long distance from here , near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas , because you go to mass there every day , but I do n't know in what street . 
I see that you understand your situation . 
As you have not lied about your name , you will not lie about your address . 
Write it yourself . '' 
The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment , then he took the pen and wrote : -- `` Mademoiselle Fabre , at M. Urbain Fabre 's , Rue Saint-Dominique-D'Enfer , No. 17 . '' 
Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion . 
`` Wife ! '' 
he cried . 
The Thenardier woman hastened to him . 
`` Here 's the letter . 
You know what you have to do . 
There is a carriage at the door . 
Set out at once , and return ditto . '' 
And addressing the man with the meat-axe : -- `` Since you have taken off your nose-screen , accompany the mistress . 
You will get up behind the fiacre . 
You know where you left the team ? '' 
`` Yes , '' said the man . 
And depositing his axe in a corner , he followed Madame Thenardier . 
As they set off , Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door , and shouted into the corridor : -- `` Above all things , do n't lose the letter !
