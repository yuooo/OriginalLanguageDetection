Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled , and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation : `` This is too much ! '' 
-- and this interrogation : `` But where is it that he goes ? '' 
She espied some adventure of the heart , more or less illicit , a woman in the shadow , a rendezvous , a mystery , and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair . 
Tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal ; sainted souls do not detest this . 
There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry . 
So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history . 
In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont , she took refuge in her talents , and set about scalloping , with one layer of cotton after another , one of those embroideries of the Empire and the Restoration , in which there are numerous cart-wheels . 
The work was clumsy , the worker cross . 
She had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened . 
Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose . 
Lieutenant Theodule stood before her , making the regulation salute . 
She uttered a cry of delight . 
One may be old , one may be a prude , one may be pious , one may be an aunt , but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one 's chamber . 
`` You here , Theodule ! '' 
she exclaimed . 
`` On my way through town , aunt . '' 
`` Embrace me . '' 
`` Here goes ! '' 
said Theodule . 
And he kissed her . 
Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and opened it . 
`` You will remain with us a week at least ? '' 
`` I leave this very evening , aunt . '' 
`` It is not possible ! '' 
`` Mathematically ! '' 
`` Remain , my little Theodule , I beseech you . '' 
`` My heart says ` yes , ' but my orders say ` no . ' 
The matter is simple . 
They are changing our garrison ; we have been at Melun , we are being transferred to Gaillon . 
It is necessary to pass through Paris in order to get from the old post to the new one . 
I said : ` I am going to see my aunt . ' '' 
`` Here is something for your trouble . '' 
And she put ten louis into his hand . 
`` For my pleasure , you mean to say , my dear aunt . '' 
Theodule kissed her again , and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform . 
`` Are you making the journey on horseback , with your regiment ? '' 
she asked him . 
`` No , aunt . 
I wanted to see you . 
I have special permission . 
My servant is taking my horse ; I am travelling by diligence . 
And , by the way , I want to ask you something . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so , too ? '' 
`` How do you know that ? '' 
said his aunt , suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity . 
`` On my arrival , I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial . 
I saw his name on the card . ''
