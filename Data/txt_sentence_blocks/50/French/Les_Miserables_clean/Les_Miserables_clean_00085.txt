`` It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour , '' said Madeleine to the peasants , who were staring at him . 
`` We must ! '' 
`` But it will be too late then ! 
Do n't you see that the cart is sinking ? '' 
`` Well ! '' 
`` Listen , '' resumed Madeleine ; `` there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back . 
Only half a minute , and the poor man can be taken out . 
Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart ? 
There are five louis d'or to be earned ! '' 
Not a man in the group stirred . 
`` Ten louis , '' said Madeleine . 
The persons present dropped their eyes . 
One of them muttered : `` A man would need to be devilish strong . 
And then he runs the risk of getting crushed ! '' 
`` Come , '' began Madeleine again , `` twenty louis . '' 
The same silence . 
`` It is not the will which is lacking , '' said a voice . 
M. Madeleine turned round , and recognized Javert . 
He had not noticed him on his arrival . 
Javert went on : -- `` It is strength . 
One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back . '' 
Then , gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine , he went on , emphasizing every word that he uttered : -- `` Monsieur Madeleine , I have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask . '' 
Madeleine shuddered . 
Javert added , with an air of indifference , but without removing his eyes from Madeleine : -- `` He was a convict . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Madeleine . 
`` In the galleys at Toulon . '' 
Madeleine turned pale . 
Meanwhile , the cart continued to sink slowly . 
Father Fauchelevent rattled in the throat , and shrieked : -- `` I am strangling ! 
My ribs are breaking ! 
a screw ! 
something ! 
Ah ! '' 
Madeleine glanced about him . 
`` Is there , then , no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man ? '' 
No one stirred . 
Javert resumed : -- `` I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw , and he was that convict . '' 
`` Ah ! 
It is crushing me ! '' 
cried the old man . 
Madeleine raised his head , met Javert 's falcon eye still fixed upon him , looked at the motionless peasants , and smiled sadly . 
Then , without saying a word , he fell on his knees , and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry , he was underneath the vehicle . 
A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued . 
They beheld Madeleine , almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight , make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together . 
They shouted to him , `` Father Madeleine , come out ! '' 
Old Fauchelevent himself said to him , `` Monsieur Madeleine , go away ! 
You see that I am fated to die ! 
Leave me ! 
You will get yourself crushed also ! ''
