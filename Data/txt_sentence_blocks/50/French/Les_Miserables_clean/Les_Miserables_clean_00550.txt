`` Truly , '' said he , `` so it was n't to keep me from breaking the lanterns ? '' 
`` Break whatever you please . '' 
`` You 're a fine man , '' said Gavroche . 
And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets . 
His confidence having increased , he added : -- `` Do you belong in this street ? '' 
`` Yes , why ? '' 
`` Can you tell me where No. 7 is ? '' 
`` What do you want with No. 7 ? '' 
Here the child paused , he feared that he had said too much ; he thrust his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with replying : -- `` Ah ! 
Here it is . '' 
An idea flashed through Jean Valjean 's mind . 
Anguish does have these gleams . 
He said to the lad : -- `` Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting ? '' 
`` You ? '' 
said Gavroche . 
`` You are not a woman . '' 
`` The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette , is it not ? '' 
`` Cosette , '' muttered Gavroche . 
`` Yes , I believe that is the queer name . '' 
`` Well , '' resumed Jean Valjean , `` I am the person to whom you are to deliver the letter . 
Give it here . '' 
`` In that case , you must know that I was sent from the barricade . '' 
`` Of course , '' said Jean Valjean . 
Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folded in four . 
Then he made the military salute . 
`` Respect for despatches , '' said he . 
`` It comes from the Provisional Government . '' 
`` Give it to me , '' said Jean Valjean . 
Gavroche held the paper elevated above his head . 
`` Do n't go and fancy it 's a love letter . 
It is for a woman , but it 's for the people . 
We men fight and we respect the fair sex . 
We are not as they are in fine society , where there are lions who send chickens -LSB- 55 -RSB- to camels . '' 
-LSB- 55 -RSB- Love letters . 
`` Give it to me . '' 
`` After all , '' continued Gavroche , `` you have the air of an honest man . '' 
`` Give it to me quick . '' 
`` Catch hold of it . '' 
And he handed the paper to Jean Valjean . 
`` And make haste , Monsieur What 's - your-name , for Mamselle Cosette is waiting . '' 
Gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark . 
Jean Valjean began again : -- `` Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent ? '' 
`` There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called brioches -LSB- blunders -RSB- . 
This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie , and I 'm going back there . 
Good evening , citizen . '' 
That said , Gavroche took himself off , or , to describe it more exactly , fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird . 
He plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it , with the rigid rapidity of a projectile ; the alley of l'Homme Arme became silent and solitary once more ; in a twinkling , that strange child , who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream , had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses , and was lost there , like smoke in the dark ; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished , had there not taken place , a few minutes after his disappearance , a startling shiver of glass , and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois . 
It was Gavroche upon his way through the Rue du Chaume . 
WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius ' letter . 
He groped his way up the stairs , as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey , opened and shut his door softly , listened to see whether he could hear any noise , -- made sure that , to all appearances , Cosette and Toussaint were asleep , and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark , so greatly did his hand tremble .
