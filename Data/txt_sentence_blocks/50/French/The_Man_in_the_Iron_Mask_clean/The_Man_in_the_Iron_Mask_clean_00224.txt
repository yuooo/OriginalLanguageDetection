`` Who comes with the king ? 
How is Madame ? 
How is the queen ? '' 
`` Better , monsieur . '' 
`` Has she been ill , then ? '' 
`` Monsieur , since the last chagrin she suffered , her majesty has been unwell . '' 
`` What chagrin ? 
You need not fancy your news is old . 
I have but just returned . '' 
`` It appears that the queen , a little neglected since the death of her mother-in-law , complained to the king , who answered her , - ` Do I not sleep at home every night , madame ? 
What more do you expect ? ' '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , - `` poor woman ! 
She must heartily hate Mademoiselle de la Valliere . '' 
`` Oh , no ! 
not Mademoiselle de la Valliere , '' replied the falconer . 
`` Who then - '' The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this conversation . 
It summoned the dogs and the hawks . 
The falconer and his companions set off immediately , leaving D'Artagnan alone in the midst of the suspended sentence . 
The king appeared at a distance , surrounded by ladies and horsemen . 
All the troop advanced in beautiful order , at a foot 's pace , the horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses . 
There was an animation in the scene , a mirage of light , of which nothing now can give an idea , unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric spectacle . 
D'Artagnan , with an eye a little , just a little , dimmed by age , distinguished behind the group three carriages . 
The first was intended for the queen ; it was empty . 
D'Artagnan , who did not see Mademoiselle de la Valliere by the king 's side , on looking about for her , saw her in the second carriage . 
She was alone with two of her women , who seemed as dull as their mistress . 
On the left hand of the king , upon a high-spirited horse , restrained by a bold and skillful hand , shone a lady of most dazzling beauty . 
The king smiled upon her , and she smiled upon the king . 
Loud laughter followed every word she uttered . 
`` I must know that woman , '' thought the musketeer ; `` who can she be ? '' 
And he stooped towards his friend , the falconer , to whom he addressed the question he had put to himself . 
The falconer was about to reply , when the king , perceiving D'Artagnan , `` Ah , comte ! '' 
said he , `` you are amongst us once more then ! 
Why have I not seen you ? '' 
`` Sire , '' replied the captain , `` because your majesty was asleep when I arrived , and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning . '' 
`` Still the same , '' said Louis , in a loud voice , denoting satisfaction . 
`` Take some rest , comte ; I command you to do so . 
You will dine with me to - day . '' 
A murmur of admiration surrounded D'Artagnan like a caress . 
Every one was eager to salute him . 
Dining with the king was an honor his majesty was not so prodigal of as Henry IV . 
had been . 
The king passed a few steps in advance , and D'Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh group , among whom shone Colbert . 
`` Good-day , Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said the minister , with marked affability , `` have you had a pleasant journey ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , '' said D'Artagnan , bowing to the neck of his horse . 
`` I heard the king invite you to his table for this evening , '' continued the minister ; `` you will meet an old friend there . '' 
`` An old friend of mine ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , plunging painfully into the dark waves of the past , which had swallowed up for him so many friendships and so many hatreds . 
`` M. le Duc d'Almeda , who is arrived this morning from Spain . '' 
`` The Duc d'Almeda ? ''
