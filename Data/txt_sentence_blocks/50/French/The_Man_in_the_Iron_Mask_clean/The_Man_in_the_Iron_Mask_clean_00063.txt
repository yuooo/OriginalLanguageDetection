`` Very good , sire , '' replied the captain , whose glance had for a long time past analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance . 
He gave the necessary order at the door ; but , returning to the king , he said , `` Is there something fresh the matter , your majesty ? '' 
`` How many men have you here ? '' 
inquired the king , without making any other reply to the question addressed to him . 
`` What for , sire ? '' 
`` How many men have you , I say ? '' 
repeated the king , stamping upon the ground with his foot . 
`` I have the musketeers . '' 
`` Well ; and what others ? '' 
`` Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss . '' 
`` How many men will be required to - '' `` To do what , sire ? '' 
replied the musketeer , opening his large , calm eyes . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan fell back a step . 
`` To arrest M. Fouquet ! '' 
he burst forth . 
`` Are you going to tell me that it is impossible ? '' 
exclaimed the king , in tones of cold , vindictive passion . 
`` I never say that anything is impossible , '' replied D'Artagnan , wounded to the quick . 
`` Very well ; do it , then . '' 
D'Artagnan turned on his heel , and made his way towards the door ; it was but a short distance , and he cleared it in half a dozen paces ; when he reached it he suddenly paused , and said , `` Your majesty will forgive me , but , in order to effect this arrest , I should like written directions . '' 
`` For what purpose - and since when has the king 's word been insufficient for you ? '' 
`` Because the word of a king , when it springs from a feeling of anger , may possibly change when the feeling changes . '' 
`` A truce to set phrases , monsieur ; you have another thought besides that ? '' 
`` Oh , I , at least , have certain thoughts and ideas , which , unfortunately , others have not , '' D'Artagnan replied , impertinently . 
The king , in the tempest of his wrath , hesitated , and drew back in the face of D'Artagnan 's frank courage , just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider . 
`` What is your thought ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` This , sire , '' replied D'Artagnan : `` you cause a man to be arrested when you are still under his roof ; and passion is alone the cause of that . 
When your anger shall have passed , you will regret what you have done ; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature . 
If that , however , should fail to be a reparation , it will at least show us that the king was wrong to lose his temper . '' 
`` Wrong to lose his temper ! '' 
cried the king , in a loud , passionate voice . 
`` Did not my father , my grandfathers , too , before me , lose their temper at times , in Heaven 's name ? '' 
`` The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their temper except when under the protection of their own palace . '' 
`` The king is master wherever he may be . '' 
`` That is a flattering , complimentary phrase which can not proceed from any one but M. Colbert ; but it happens not to be the truth . 
The king is at home in every man 's house when he has driven its owner out of it . '' 
The king bit his lips , but said nothing . 
`` Can it be possible ? '' 
said D'Artagnan ; `` here is a man who is positively ruining himself in order to please you , and you wish to have him arrested ! 
Mordioux ! 
Sire , if my name was Fouquet , and people treated me in that manner , I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of fireworks and other things , and I would set fire to them , and send myself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky . 
But it is all the same ; it is your wish , and it shall be done . '' 
`` Go , '' said the king ; `` but have you men enough ? '' 
`` Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me ? 
Arrest M. Fouquet ! 
why , that is so easy that a very child might do it ! 
It is like drinking a glass of wormwood ; one makes an ugly face , and that is all . '' 
`` If he defends himself ? ''
