D'Artagnan bit his mustache . 
`` If it were true , '' said he , `` that I had brought hither in a boat and with a carriage a masked prisoner , nothing proves that this prisoner must be a prince - a prince of the house of France . '' 
`` Ask Aramis such riddles , '' replied Athos , coolly . 
`` Aramis , '' cried the musketeer , quite at a stand . 
`` Have you seen Aramis ? '' 
`` After his discomfiture at Vaux , yes ; I have seen Aramis , a fugitive , pursued , bewildered , ruined ; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the plate . '' 
D'Artagnan 's head sunk on his breast in some confusion . 
`` This is the way , '' said he , `` in which God turns to nothing that which men call wisdom ! 
A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered fragments ! 
Athos , cursed be the chance which has brought you face to face with me in this affair ! 
for now - '' `` Well , '' said Athos , with his customary mild severity , `` is your secret lost because I know it ? 
Consult your memory , my friend . 
Have I not borne secrets heavier than this ? '' 
`` You have never borne one so dangerous , '' replied D'Artagnan , in a tone of sadness . 
`` I have something like a sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die , and die unhappily . '' 
`` The will of God be done ! '' 
said Athos , `` but here is your governor . '' 
D'Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts . 
The governor , suspicious and hard , behaved towards D'Artagnan with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness . 
With respect to the travelers , he contented himself with offering good cheer , and never taking his eye from them . 
Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by sudden attacks , or to catch them off their guard ; but neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage . 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable , if the governor did not believe it to be quite true . 
They rose from the table to repose awhile . 
`` What is this man 's name ? 
I do n't like the looks of him , '' said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish . 
`` De Saint-Mars , '' replied the captain . 
`` He is , then , I suppose , the prince 's jailer ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
how can I tell ? 
I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , not you ! '' 
`` My friend , I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a desert . 
He would like to carry it away , but he can not ; he would like to leave it , but he dares not . 
The king will not dare to recall me , for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do ; he regrets not having me near him , from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person as myself . 
But it will happen as it may please God . '' 
`` But , '' observed Raoul , `` your not being certain proves that your situation here is provisional , and you will return to Paris ? '' 
`` Ask these gentlemen , '' interrupted the governor , `` what was their purpose in coming to Saint-Marguerite ? '' 
`` They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte - Honnorat which is considered curious ; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the island . '' 
`` That is quite at their service , as well as yours , '' replied Saint-Mars . 
D'Artagnan politely thanked him . 
`` When will they depart ? '' 
added the governor . 
`` To-morrow , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
M. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds , and left D'Artagnan alone with the pretended Spaniards . 
`` Oh ! '' 
exclaimed the musketeer , `` here is a life and a society that suits me very little . 
I command this man , and he bores me , mordioux ! 
Come , let us have a shot or two at the rabbits ; the walk will be beautiful , and not fatiguing . 
The whole island is but a league and a half in length , with the breadth of a league ; a real park .
