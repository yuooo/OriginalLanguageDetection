Louis held up the massive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use . 
`` Sire , '' said Fouquet , in a voice trembling with emotion , `` do you not recognize the most faithful of your friends ? '' 
`` A friend - you ! '' 
repeated Louis , gnashing his teeth in a manner which betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance . 
`` The most respectful of your servants , '' added Fouquet , throwing himself on his knees . 
The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp . 
Fouquet approached him , kissed his knees , and took him in his arms with inconceivable tenderness . 
`` My king , my child , '' he said , `` how you must have suffered ! '' 
Louis , recalled to himself by the change of situation , looked at himself , and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel , ashamed of his conduct , and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was shown towards him , drew back . 
Fouquet did not understand this movement ; he did not perceive that the king 's feeling of pride would never forgive him for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness . 
`` Come , sire , '' he said , `` you are free . '' 
`` Free ? '' 
repeated the king . 
`` Oh ! 
you set me at liberty , then , after having dared to lift up your hand against me . '' 
`` You do not believe that ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet , indignantly ; `` you can not believe me to be guilty of such an act . '' 
And rapidly , warmly even , he related the whole particulars of the intrigue , the details of which are already known to the reader . 
While the recital continued , Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind ; and when it was finished , the magnitude of the danger he had run struck him far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin brother . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , suddenly to Fouquet , `` this double birth is a falsehood ; it is impossible - you can not have been the dupe of it . '' 
`` Sire ! '' 
`` It is impossible , I tell you , that the honor , the virtue of my mother can be suspected , and my first minister has not yet done justice on the criminals ! '' 
`` Reflect , sire , before you are hurried away by anger , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` The birth of your brother - '' `` I have only one brother - and that is Monsieur . 
You know it as well as myself . 
There is a plot , I tell you , beginning with the governor of the Bastile . '' 
`` Be careful , sire , for this man has been deceived as every one else has by the prince 's likeness to yourself . '' 
`` Likeness ? 
Absurd ! '' 
`` This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty , to be able to deceive every one 's eye , '' Fouquet persisted . 
`` Ridiculous ! '' 
`` Do not say so , sire ; those who had prepared everything in order to face and deceive your ministers , your mother , your officers of state , the members of your family , must be quite confident of the resemblance between you . '' 
`` But where are these persons , then ? '' 
murmured the king . 
`` At Vaux . '' 
`` At Vaux ! 
and you suffer them to remain there ! '' 
`` My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty 's release . 
I have accomplished that duty ; and now , whatever your majesty may command , shall be done . 
I await your orders . '' 
Louis reflected for a few moments . 
`` Muster all the troops in Paris , '' he said . 
`` All the necessary orders are given for that purpose , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` You have given orders ! '' 
exclaimed the king . 
`` For that purpose , yes , sire ; your majesty will be at the head of ten thousand men in less than an hour . '' 
The only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet 's hand with such an expression of feeling , that it was very easy to perceive how strongly he had , until that remark , maintained his suspicions of the minister , notwithstanding the latter 's intervention . 
`` And with these troops , '' he said , `` we shall go at once and besiege in your house the rebels who by this time will have established and intrenched themselves therein . '' 
`` I should be surprised if that were the case , '' replied Fouquet . 
`` Why ? ''
