`` At all events , you would not be able to burn the gardens , and that is the finest feature of the place . '' 
`` And yet , '' resumed Fouquet , thoughtfully , `` what was I saying ? 
Great heavens ! 
burn Vaux ! 
destroy my palace ! 
But Vaux is not mine ; these wonderful creations are , it is true , the property , as far as sense of enjoyment goes , of the man who has paid for them ; but as far as duration is concerned , they belong to those who created them . 
Vaux belongs to Lebrun , to Lenotre , to Pelisson , to Levau , to La Fontaine , to Moliere ; Vaux belongs to posterity , in fact . 
You see , Monsieur d'Artagnan , that my very house has ceased to be my own . '' 
`` That is all well and good , '' said D'Artagnan ; `` the idea is agreeable enough , and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it . 
That idea , indeed , makes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether ; and I now fail to recognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur . 
If you are ruined , monsieur , look at the affair manfully , for you too , mordioux ! 
belong to posterity , and have no right to lessen yourself in any way . 
Stay a moment ; look at me , I who seem to exercise in some degree a kind of superiority over you , because I am arresting you ; fate , which distributes their different parts to the comedians of this world , accorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than yours has been . 
I am one of those who think that the parts which kings and powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth than the parts of beggars or lackeys . 
It is far better on the stage - on the stage , I mean , of another theater than the theater of this world - it is far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language , than to walk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes , or to get one 's backbone gently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick . 
In one word , you have been a prodigal with money , you have ordered and been obeyed - have been steeped to the lips in enjoyment ; while I have dragged my tether after me , have been commanded and have obeyed , and have drudged my life away . 
Well , although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you , monseigneur , I do declare to you , that the recollection of what I have done serves me as a spur , and prevents me from bowing my old head too soon . 
I shall remain unto the very end a trooper ; and when my turn comes , I shall fall perfectly straight , all in a heap , still alive , after having selected my place beforehand . 
Do as I do , Monsieur Fouquet , you will not find yourself the worse for it ; a fall happens only once in a lifetime to men like yourself , and the chief thing is , to take it gracefully when the chance presents itself . 
There is a Latin proverb - the words have escaped me , but I remember the sense of it very well , for I have thought over it more than once - which says , ` The end crowns the work ! ' '' 
Fouquet rose from his seat , passed his arm round D'Artagnan 's neck , and clasped him in a close embrace , whilst with the other hand he pressed his hand . 
`` An excellent homily , '' he said , after a moment 's pause . 
`` A soldier 's , monseigneur . '' 
`` You have a regard for me , in telling me all that . '' 
`` Perhaps . '' 
Fouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more , and then , a moment after , he said : `` Where can M. d'Herblay be ? 
I dare not ask you to send for him . '' 
`` You would not ask me , because I would not do it , Monsieur Fouquet . 
People would learn it , and Aramis , who is not mixed up with the affair , might possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace . '' 
`` I will wait here till daylight , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Yes ; that is best . '' 
`` What shall we do when daylight comes ? '' 
`` I know nothing at all about it , monseigneur . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , will you do me a favor ? '' 
`` Most willingly . '' 
`` You guard me , I remain ; you are acting in the full discharge of your duty , I suppose ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good , then ; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like ; and I infinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed to the compliment . 
`` But , forget that you are Monsieur d'Artagnan , captain of the musketeers ; forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet , surintendant of the finances ; and let us talk about my affairs . '' 
`` That is rather a delicate subject . '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` Yes ; but , for your sake , Monsieur Fouquet , I will do what may almost be regarded as an impossibility . '' 
`` Thank you . 
What did the king say to you ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` Ah ! 
is that the way you talk ? '' 
`` The deuce ! '' 
`` What do you think of my situation ? ''
