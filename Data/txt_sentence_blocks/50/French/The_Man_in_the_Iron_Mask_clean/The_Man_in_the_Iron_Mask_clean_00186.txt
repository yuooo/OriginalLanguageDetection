cried Aramis , `` come here ! 
come here ! '' 
Yves ran towards him , letting fall the cylinder which he was about to place under the boat when the bishop 's call interrupted him . 
`` What is the meaning of this hunt , skipper ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Eh ! 
monseigneur , I can not understand it , '' replied the Breton . 
`` It is not at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt . 
No , and yet the dogs - '' `` Unless they have escaped from the kennel . '' 
`` No , '' said Goenne , `` they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria 's hounds . '' 
`` In common prudence , '' said Aramis , `` let us go back into the grotto ; the voices evidently draw nearer , we shall soon know what we have to trust to . '' 
They re-entered , but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the darkness , when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress resounded through the cavern , and breathless , rapid , terrified , a fox passed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives , leaped over the boat and disappeared , leaving behind its sour scent , which was perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave . 
`` The fox ! '' 
cried the Bretons , with the glad surprise of born hunters . 
`` Accursed mischance ! '' 
cried the bishop , `` our retreat is discovered . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
said Porthos ; `` are you afraid of a fox ? '' 
`` Eh ! 
my friend , what do you mean by that ? 
why do you specify the fox ? 
It is not the fox alone . 
Pardieu ! 
But do n't you know , Porthos , that after the foxes come hounds , and after hounds men ? '' 
Porthos hung his head . 
As though to confirm the words of Aramis , they heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail . 
Six foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath , with mingling yelps of triumph . 
`` There are the dogs , plain enough ! '' 
said Aramis , posted on the look-out behind a chink in the rocks ; `` now , who are the huntsmen ? '' 
`` If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria 's , '' replied the sailor , `` he will leave the dogs to hunt the grotto , for he knows them , and will not enter in himself , being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side ; it is there he will wait for him . '' 
`` It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting , '' replied Aramis , turning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance . 
`` Who is it , then ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Look ! '' 
Porthos applied his eye to the slit , and saw at the summit of a hillock a dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs , shouting , `` Taiaut ! 
taiaut ! '' 
`` The guards ! '' 
said he . 
`` Yes , my friend , the king 's guards . '' 
`` The king 's guards ! 
do you say , monseigneur ? '' 
cried the Bretons , growing pale in turn . 
`` With Biscarrat at their head , mounted upon my gray horse , '' continued Aramis . 
The hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche , and the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries . 
`` Ah ! 
the devil ! '' 
said Aramis , resuming all his coolness at the sight of this certain , inevitable danger . 
`` I am perfectly satisfied we are lost , but we have , at least , one chance left . 
If the guards who follow their hounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto , there is no help for us , for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat . 
The dogs must not go out of the cavern .
