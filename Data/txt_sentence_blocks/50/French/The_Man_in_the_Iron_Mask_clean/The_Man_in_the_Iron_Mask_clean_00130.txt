`` Yes , there is a bark in the creek , which is prudently seeking shelter here ; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all -- it has run aground . '' 
`` Yes , yes , I see it . '' 
`` It is the carriage , which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner . '' 
`` Well ! '' 
said Athos , `` if you take my advice , D'Artagnan , you will burn that carriage , in order that no vestige of it may remain , without which the fishermen of Antibes , who have believed they had to do with the devil , will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man . '' 
`` Your advice is good , Athos , and I will this night have it carried out , or rather , I will carry it out myself ; but let us go in , for the rain falls heavily , and the lightning is terrific . '' 
As they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key , they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by the prisoner . 
Upon a sign from D'Artagnan , they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase . 
`` What is it ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` You will see . 
Look . 
The prisoner is returning from chapel . '' 
And they saw , by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky , they saw pass gravely , at six paces behind the governor , a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of polished steel , soldered to a helmet of the same nature , which altogether enveloped the whole of his head . 
The fire of the heavens cast red reflections on the polished surface , and these reflections , flying off capriciously , seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate , instead of imprecations . 
In the middle of the gallery , the prisoner stopped for a moment , to contemplate the infinite horizon , to respire the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest , to drink in thirstily the hot rain , and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan . 
`` Come on , monsieur , '' said Saint-Mars , sharply , to the prisoner , for he already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls . 
`` Monsieur , come on ! '' 
`` Say monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , from his corner , with a voice so solemn and terrible , that the governor trembled from head to foot . 
Athos insisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty . 
The prisoner turned round . 
`` Who spoke ? '' 
asked Saint-Mars . 
`` It was I , '' replied D'Artagnan , showing himself promptly . 
`` You know that is the order . '' 
`` Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur , '' said the prisoner in his turn , in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul ; `` call me ACCURSED ! '' 
He passed on , and the iron door croaked after him . 
`` There goes a truly unfortunate man ! '' 
murmured the musketeer in a hollow whisper , pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince . 
: Promises . 
Scarcely had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends , when one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him . 
The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea , and which appeared so eager to gain the port , came to Sainte-Marguerite with an important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers . 
On opening it , D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king : `` I should think , '' said Louis XIV. , `` you will have completed the execution of my orders , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; return , then , immediately to Paris , and join me at the Louvre . '' 
`` There is the end of my exile ! '' 
cried the musketeer with joy ; `` God be praised , I am no longer a jailer ! '' 
And he showed the letter to Athos . 
`` So , then , you must leave us ? '' 
replied the latter , in a melancholy tone . 
`` Yes , but to meet again , dear friend , seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone with M. de Beaufort , and will prefer his father going back in company with M. d'Artagnan , to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere ; will you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Certainly , '' stammered the latter , with an expression of tender regret . 
`` No , no , my friend , '' interrupted Athos , `` I will never quit Raoul till the day his vessel disappears on the horizon . 
As long as he remains in France he shall not be separated from me . '' 
`` As you please , dear friend ; but we will , at least , leave Sainte - Marguerite together ; take advantage of the bark that will convey me back to Antibes . '' 
`` With all my heart ; we can not too soon be at a distance from this fort , and from the spectacle that shocked us so just now . '' 
The three friends quitted the little isle , after paying their respects to the governor , and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took their farewell of the white walls of the fort . 
D'Artagnan parted from his friend that same night , after having seen fire set to the carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars , according to the advice the captain had given him . 
Before getting on horseback , and after leaving the arms of Athos : `` My friends , '' said he , `` you bear too much resemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post . 
Something warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank . 
Will you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a hundred good muskets ?
