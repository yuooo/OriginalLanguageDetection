Philippe did not even deign to reply . 
He gazed earnestly at the bishop , as if to ask him if it were possible for a man to waver after having once made up his mind . 
`` Such looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men 's character , '' said Aramis , bowing over Philippe 's hand ; `` you will be great , monseigneur , I will answer for that . '' 
`` Let us resume our conversation . 
I wished to discuss two points with you ; in the first place the dangers , or the obstacles we may meet with . 
That point is decided . 
The other is the conditions you intend imposing on me . 
It is your turn to speak , M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` The conditions , monseigneur ? '' 
`` Doubtless . 
You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop me , and you will not do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no interest in this affair . 
Therefore , without subterfuge or hesitation , tell me the truth - '' `` I will do so , monseigneur . 
Once a king - '' `` When will that be ? '' 
`` To-morrow evening - I mean in the night . '' 
`` Explain yourself . '' 
`` When I shall have asked your highness a question . '' 
`` Do so . '' 
`` I sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to deliver some closely written notes , carefully drawn up , which will thoroughly acquaint your highness with the different persons who compose and will compose your court . '' 
`` I perused those notes . '' 
`` Attentively ? '' 
`` I know them by heart . '' 
`` And understand them ? 
Pardon me , but I may venture to ask that question of a poor , abandoned captive of the Bastile ? 
In a week 's time it will not be requisite to further question a mind like yours . 
You will then be in full possession of liberty and power . '' 
`` Interrogate me , then , and I will be a scholar representing his lesson to his master . '' 
`` We will begin with your family , monseigneur . '' 
`` My mother , Anne of Austria ! 
all her sorrows , her painful malady . 
Oh ! 
I know her - I know her . '' 
`` Your second brother ? '' 
asked Aramis , bowing . 
`` To these notes , '' replied the prince , `` you have added portraits so faithfully painted , that I am able to recognize the persons whose characters , manners , and history you have so carefully portrayed . 
Monsieur , my brother , is a fine , dark young man , with a pale face ; he does not love his wife , Henrietta , whom I , Louis XIV. , loved a little , and still flirt with , even although she made me weep on the day she wished to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from her service in disgrace . '' 
`` You will have to be careful with regard to the watchfulness of the latter , '' said Aramis ; `` she is sincerely attached to the actual king . 
The eyes of a woman who loves are not easily deceived . '' 
`` She is fair , has blue eyes , whose affectionate gaze reveals her identity . 
She halts slightly in her gait ; she writes a letter every day , to which I have to send an answer by M. de Saint-Aignan . '' 
`` Do you know the latter ? '' 
`` As if I saw him , and I know the last verses he composed for me , as well as those I composed in answer to his . '' 
`` Very good . 
Do you know your ministers ? '' 
`` Colbert , an ugly , dark-browed man , but intelligent enough , his hair covering his forehead , a large , heavy , full head ; the mortal enemy of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` As for the latter , we need not disturb ourselves about him . '' 
`` No ; because necessarily you will not require me to exile him , I suppose ? '' 
Aramis , struck with admiration at the remark , said , `` You will become very great , monseigneur . '' 
`` You see , '' added the prince , `` that I know my lesson by heart , and with Heaven 's assistance , and yours afterwards , I shall seldom go wrong . '' 
`` You have still an awkward pair of eyes to deal with , monseigneur . '' 
`` Yes , the captain of the musketeers , M. d'Artagnan , your friend . ''
