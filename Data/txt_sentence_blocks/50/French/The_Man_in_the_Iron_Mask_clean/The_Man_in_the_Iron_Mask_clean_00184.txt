`` Monsieur de Biscarrat , '' said the bishop of Vannes , with a singular accent of nobility and courtesy , `` Monsieur de Biscarrat , be kind enough to resume your liberty . '' 
`` I am very willing to do so , monsieur ; but - '' `` That would render us a service , for when announcing to the king 's lieutenant the submission of the islanders , you will perhaps obtain some grace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has been effected . '' 
`` Grace ! '' 
replied Porthos with flashing eyes , `` what is the meaning of that word ? '' 
Aramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly , as he had been accustomed to do in the days of their youth , when he wanted to warn Porthos that he had committed , or was about to commit , a blunder . 
Porthos understood him , and was silent immediately . 
`` I will go , messieurs , '' replied Biscarrat , a little surprised likewise at the word `` grace '' pronounced by the haughty musketeer , of and to whom , but a few minutes before , he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic exploits with which his father had delighted him . 
`` Go , then , Monsieur Biscarrat , '' said Aramis , bowing to him , `` and at parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude . '' 
`` But you , messieurs , you whom I think it an honor to call my friends , since you have been willing to accept that title , what will become of you in the meantime ? '' 
replied the officer , very much agitated at taking leave of the two ancient adversaries of his father . 
`` We will wait here . '' 
`` But , mon Dieu ! 
- the order is precise and formal . '' 
`` I am bishop of Vannes , Monsieur de Biscarrat ; and they no more shoot a bishop than they hang a gentleman . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , monsieur - yes , monseigneur , '' replied Biscarrat ; `` it is true , you are right , there is still that chance for you . 
Then , I will depart , I will repair to the commander of the expedition , the king 's lieutenant . 
Adieu ! 
then , messieurs , or rather , to meet again , I hope . '' 
The worthy officer , jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis , departed in the direction of the sound of cannon , which , by surging the crowd into the fort , had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their prisoner . 
Aramis watched the departure , and when left alone with Porthos : `` Well , do you comprehend ? '' 
said he . 
`` Ma foi ! 
no . '' 
`` Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here ? '' 
`` No ; he is a brave fellow . '' 
`` Yes ; but the grotto of Locmaria - is it necessary all the world should know it ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
that is true , that is true ; I comprehend . 
We are going to escape by the cavern . '' 
`` If you please , '' cried Aramis , gayly . 
`` Forward , friend Porthos ; our boat awaits us . 
King Louis has not caught us - yet . '' 
: The Grotto of Locmaria . 
The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it . 
Besides , night was advancing ; midnight had struck at the fort . 
Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms . 
They walked , then , across the heath , which stretched between the mole and the cavern , listening to every noise , in order better to avoid an ambush . 
From time to time , on the road which they had carefully left on their left , passed fugitives coming from the interior , at the news of the landing of the royal troops . 
Aramis and Porthos , concealed behind some projecting mass of rock , collected the words that escaped from the poor people , who fled , trembling , carrying with them their most valuable effects , and tried , whilst listening to their complaints , to gather something from them for their own interest . 
At length , after a rapid race , frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages , they reached the deep grottoes , in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season . 
`` My good friend , '' said Porthos , panting vigorously , `` we have arrived , it seems . 
But I thought you spoke of three men , three servants , who were to accompany us . 
I do n't see them - where are they ? '' 
`` Why should you see them , Porthos ? '' 
replied Aramis . 
`` They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern , and , no doubt , are resting , having accomplished their rough and difficult task . '' 
Aramis stopped Porthos , who was preparing to enter the cavern . 
`` Will you allow me , my friend , '' said he to the giant , `` to pass in first ? 
I know the signal I have given to these men ; who , not hearing it , would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark . ''
