And what is this poor prince doing ? '' 
`` Ask me , rather , what has he done . '' 
`` Yes , yes . '' 
`` He was brought up in the country , and then thrown into a fortress which goes by the name of the Bastile . '' 
`` Is it possible ? '' 
cried the surintendant , clasping his hands . 
`` The one was the most fortunate of men : the other the most unhappy and miserable of all living beings . '' 
`` Does his mother not know this ? '' 
`` Anne of Austria knows it all . '' 
`` And the king ? '' 
`` Knows absolutely nothing . '' 
`` So much the better , '' said Fouquet . 
This remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis ; he looked at Fouquet with the most anxious expression of countenance . 
`` I beg your pardon ; I interrupted you , '' said Fouquet . 
`` I was saying , '' resumed Aramis , `` that this poor prince was the unhappiest of human beings , when Heaven , whose thoughts are over all His creatures , undertook to come to his assistance . '' 
`` Oh ! 
in what way ? 
Tell me . '' 
`` You will see . 
The reigning king - I say the reigning king - you can guess very well why ? '' 
`` No . 
Why ? '' 
`` Because both of them , being legitimate princes , ought to have been kings . 
Is not that your opinion ? '' 
`` It is , certainly . '' 
`` Unreservedly ? '' 
`` Most unreservedly ; twins are one person in two bodies . '' 
`` I am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should have pronounced such an opinion . 
It is agreed , then , that each of them possessed equal rights , is it not ? '' 
`` Incontestably ! 
but , gracious heavens , what an extraordinary circumstance ! '' 
`` We are not at the end of it yet . 
- Patience . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I shall find ` patience ' enough . '' 
`` Heaven wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger , or a supporter , or vindicator , if you prefer it . 
It happened that the reigning king , the usurper - you are quite of my opinion , I believe , that it is an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy , and selfishly to assume the right over , an inheritance to which a man has only half a right ? '' 
`` Yes , usurpation is the word . '' 
`` In that case , I continue . 
It was Heaven 's will that the usurper should possess , in the person of his first minister , a man of great talent , of large and generous nature . '' 
`` Well , well , '' said Fouquet , `` I understand you ; you have relied upon me to repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis XIV . 
You have thought well ; I will help you . 
I thank you , D'Herblay , I thank you . '' 
`` Oh , no , it is not that at all ; you have not allowed me to finish , '' said Aramis , perfectly unmoved . 
`` I will not say another word , then . '' 
`` M. Fouquet , I was observing , the minister of the reigning sovereign , was suddenly taken into the greatest aversion , and menaced with the ruin of his fortune , loss of liberty , loss of life even , by intrigue and personal hatred , to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear . 
But Heaven permits -LRB- still , however , out of consideration for the unhappy prince who had been sacrificed -RRB- that M. Fouquet should in his turn have a devoted friend who knew this state secret , and felt that he possessed strength and courage enough to divulge this secret , after having had the strength to carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years . 
`` Go no farther , '' said Fouquet , full of generous feelings . 
`` I understand you , and can guess everything now . 
You went to see the king when the intelligence of my arrest reached you ; you implored him , he refused to listen to you ; then you threatened him with that secret , threatened to reveal it , and Louis XIV. , alarmed at the risk of its betrayal , granted to the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous intercession .
