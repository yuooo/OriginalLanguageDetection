This change , this sudden elevation , this mute approbation of the king , gave the musketeer matter for profound reflection . 
He bowed civilly to Colbert , who did not take his eyes off him . 
The king , when he saw they were reconciled , dismissed them . 
They left the room together . 
As soon as they were out of the cabinet , the new minister , stopping the captain , said : `` Is it possible , M. d'Artagnan , that with such an eye as yours , you did not , at the first glance , at the first impression , discover what sort of man I am ? '' 
`` Monsieur Colbert , '' replied the musketeer , `` a ray of the sun in our eyes prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame . 
The man in power radiates , you know ; and since you are there , why should you continue to persecute him who had just fallen into disgrace , and fallen from such a height ? '' 
`` I , monsieur ! '' 
said Colbert ; `` oh , monsieur ! 
I would never persecute him . 
I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone , because I am ambitious , and , above all , because I have the most entire confidence in my own merit ; because I know that all the gold of this country will ebb and flow beneath my eyes , and I love to look at the king 's gold ; because , if I live thirty years , in thirty years not a denir of it will remain in my hands ; because , with that gold , I will build granaries , castles , cities , and harbors ; because I will create a marine , I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most distant people ; because I will create libraries and academies ; because I will make France the first country in the world , and the wealthiest . 
These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet , who prevented my acting . 
And then , when I shall be great and strong , when France is great and strong , in my turn , then , will I cry , ` Mercy ' ! '' 
`` Mercy , did you say ? 
then ask his liberty of the king . 
The king is only crushing him on your account . '' 
Colbert again raised his head . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you know that is not so , and that the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet ; it is not for me to teach you that . '' 
`` But the king will grow tired ; he will forget . '' 
`` The king never forgets , M. d'Artagnan . 
Hark ! 
the king calls . 
He is going to issue an order . 
I have not influenced him , have I ? 
Listen . '' 
The king , in fact , was calling his secretaries . 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' said he . 
`` I am here , sire . '' 
`` Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan , to form a guard for M. Fouquet . '' 
D'Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks . 
`` And from Angers , '' continued the king , `` they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile , in Paris . '' 
`` You were right , '' said the captain to the minister . 
`` Saint-Aignan , '' continued the king , `` you will have any one shot who shall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet , during the journey . '' 
`` But myself , sire , '' said the duke . 
`` You , monsieur , you will only speak to him in the presence of the musketeers . '' 
The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission . 
D'Artagnan was about to retire likewise ; but the king stopped him . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` you will go immediately , and take possession of the isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . 
Alone ? '' 
`` You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay , in case the place should be contumacious . '' 
A murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers . 
`` That shall be done , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` I saw the place in my infancy , '' resumed the king , `` and I do not wish to see it again . 
You have heard me ? 
Go , monsieur , and do not return without the keys . '' 
Colbert went up to D'Artagnan . 
`` A commission which , if you carry it out well , '' said he , `` will be worth a marechal 's baton to you . '' 
`` Why do you employ the words , ` if you carry it out well ' ? '' 
`` Because it is difficult . ''
