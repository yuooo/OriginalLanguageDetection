And he accompanied the words with a sign , which seemed to say , `` Agree , and dismiss them . '' 
It appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to D'Artagnan 's , for the tailor bowed in assent , and turning round upon Porthos , said , `` Go and get measured on the other side . '' 
Porthos colored in a formidable manner . 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming , and addressing Moliere , said to him , in an undertone , `` You see before you , my dear monsieur , a man who considers himself disgraced , if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him ; study this type for me , Master Aristophanes , and profit by it . '' 
Moliere had no need of encouragement , and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , '' he said , `` if you will come with me , I will make them take your measure without touching you . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos , `` how do you make that out , my friend ? '' 
`` I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your dress . 
It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of quality , who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch them . 
We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured , a process which , as I think , wounds the natural dignity of a man ; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these - '' `` Corboeuf ! 
I believe I am too ! '' 
`` Well , that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence , and you shall have the benefit of our invention . '' 
`` But how in the world can it be done ? '' 
asked Porthos , delighted . 
`` Monsieur , '' said Moliere , bowing , `` if you will deign to follow me , you will see . '' 
Aramis observed this scene with all his eyes . 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan 's liveliness that he would leave with Porthos , so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun . 
But , clear-sighted as he was , Aramis deceived himself . 
Porthos and Moliere left together : D'Artagnan remained with Percerin . 
Why ? 
From curiosity , doubtless ; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis . 
As Moliere and Porthos disappeared , D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes , a proceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him . 
`` A dress for you , also , is it not , my friend ? '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` No , '' said he . 
`` You will go to Vaux , however ? '' 
`` I shall go , but without a new dress . 
You forget , dear D'Artagnan , that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every fete . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
said the musketeer , laughing , `` and do we write no more poems now , either ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
D'Artagnan , '' exclaimed Aramis , `` I have long ago given up all such tomfoolery . '' 
`` True , '' repeated D'Artagnan , only half convinced . 
As for Percerin , he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades . 
`` Do n't you perceive , '' said Aramis , smiling , `` that we are greatly boring this good gentleman , my dear D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
murmured the musketeer , aside ; `` that is , I am boring you , my friend . '' 
Then aloud , `` Well , then , let us leave ; I have no further business here , and if you are as disengaged as I , Aramis - '' `` No , not I - I wished - '' `` Ah ! 
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin ? 
Why did you not tell me so at once ? '' 
`` Something particular , certainly , '' repeated Aramis , `` but not for you , D'Artagnan . 
But , at the same time , I hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not hear it . '' 
`` Oh , no , no ! 
I am going , '' said D'Artagnan , imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity ; for Aramis 's annoyance , well dissembled as it was , had not a whit escaped him ; and he knew that , in that impenetrable mind , every thing , even the most apparently trivial , was designed to some end ; an unknown one , but an end that , from the knowledge he had of his friend 's character , the musketeer felt must be important . 
On his part , Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion , and pressed him . 
`` Stay , by all means , '' he said , `` this is what it is . '' 
Then turning towards the tailor , `` My dear Percerin , '' said he , - `` I am even very happy that you are here , D'Artagnan . '' 
`` Oh , indeed , '' exclaimed the Gascon , for the third time , even less deceived this time than before .
