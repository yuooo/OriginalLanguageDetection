`` Ah ! 
in what respect ? '' 
`` You have friends in Belle-Isle , Monsieur d'Artagnan ; and it is not an easy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to obtain success . '' 
D'Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought , whilst Colbert returned to the king . 
A quarter of an hour after , the captain received the written order from the king , to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle , in case of resistance , with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or refugees , and an injunction not to allow one to escape . 
`` Colbert was right , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` for me the baton of a marechal of France will cost the lives of my two friends . 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds , and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings . 
I will show them that hand so plainly , that they will have quite time enough to see it . 
Poor Porthos ! 
Poor Aramis ! 
No ; my fortune should shall not cost your wings a feather . '' 
Having thus determined , D'Artagnan assembled the royal army , embarked it at Paimboeuf , and set sail , without the loss of an unnecessary minute . 
: Belle-Ile-en-Mer . 
At the extremity of the mole , against which the furious sea beats at the evening tide , two men , holding each other by the arm , were conversing in an animated and expansive tone , without the possibility of any other human being hearing their words , borne away , as they were , one by one , by the gusts of wind , with the white foam swept from the crests of the waves . 
The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned ocean , like a gigantic crucible . 
From time to time , one of these men , turning towards the east , cast an anxious , inquiring look over the sea . 
The other , interrogating the features of his companion , seemed to seek for information in his looks . 
Then , both silent , busied with dismal thoughts , they resumed their walk . 
Every one has already perceived that these two men were our proscribed heroes , Porthos and Aramis , who had taken refuge in Belle-Isle , since the ruin of their hopes , since the discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d'Herblay . 
`` If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary , my dear Aramis , '' repeated Porthos , inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he charged his massive chest , `` It is of no use , Aramis . 
The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary circumstance . 
There has been no storm at sea ; the weather has been constantly calm , not even the lightest gale ; and even if we had had a tempest , all our boats would not have foundered . 
I repeat , it is strange . 
This complete disappearance astonishes me , I tell you . '' 
`` True , '' murmured Aramis . 
`` You are right , friend Porthos ; it is true , there is something strange in it . '' 
`` And further , '' added Porthos , whose ideas the assent of the bishop of Vannes seemed to enlarge ; `` and , further , do you not observe that if the boats have perished , not a single plank has washed ashore ? '' 
`` I have remarked it as well as yourself . '' 
`` And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in the whole island , and which I sent in search of the others - '' Aramis here interrupted his companion by a cry , and by so sudden a movement , that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied . 
`` What do you say , Porthos ? 
What ! 
- You have sent the two boats - '' `` In search of the others ! 
Yes , to be sure I have , '' replied Porthos , calmly . 
`` Unhappy man ! 
What have you done ? 
Then we are indeed lost , '' cried the bishop . 
`` Lost ! 
- what did you say ? '' 
exclaimed the terrified Porthos . 
`` How lost , Aramis ? 
How are we lost ? '' 
Aramis bit his lips . 
`` Nothing ! 
nothing ! 
Your pardon , I meant to say - '' `` What ? '' 
`` That if we were inclined - if we took a fancy to make an excursion by sea , we could not . '' 
`` Very good ! 
and why should that vex you ? 
A precious pleasure , ma foi ! 
For my part , I do n't regret it at all .
