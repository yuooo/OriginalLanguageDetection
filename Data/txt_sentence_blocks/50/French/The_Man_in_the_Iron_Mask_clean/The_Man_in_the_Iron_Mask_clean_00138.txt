said he ; and D'Artagnan bowed . 
Louis walked about his cabinet with hasty steps . 
`` Were you at Antibes , '' said he , `` when Monsieur de Beaufort came there ? '' 
`` No , sire ; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
which was followed by a fresh silence . 
`` Whom did you see there ? '' 
`` A great many persons , '' said D'Artagnan , coolly . 
The king perceived he was unwilling to speak . 
`` I have sent for you , monsieur le capitaine , to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at Nantes . '' 
`` At Nantes ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` In Bretagne . '' 
`` Yes , sire , it is in Bretagne . 
Will you majesty make so long a journey as to Nantes ? '' 
`` The States are assembled there , '' replied the king . 
`` I have two demands to make of them : I wish to be there . '' 
`` When shall I set out ? '' 
said the captain . 
`` This evening - to-morrow - to-morrow evening ; for you must stand in need of rest . '' 
`` I have rested , sire . '' 
`` That is well . 
Then between this and to-morrow evening , when you please . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave ; but , perceiving the king very much embarrassed , `` Will you majesty , '' said he , stepping two paces forward , `` take the court with you ? '' 
`` Certainly I shall . '' 
`` Then you majesty will , doubtless , want the musketeers ? '' 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain . 
`` Take a brigade of them , '' replied Louis . 
`` Is that all ? 
Has your majesty no other orders to give me ? '' 
`` No - ah - yes . '' 
`` I am all attention , sire . '' 
`` At the castle of Nantes , which I hear is very ill arranged , you will adopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the principal dignitaries I shall take with me . '' 
`` Of the principal ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` For instance , at the door of M. de Lyonne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And that of M. Letellier ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Of M. de Brienne ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And of monsieur le surintendant ? '' 
`` Without doubt . '' 
`` Very well , sire . 
By to-morrow I shall have set out . '' 
`` Oh , yes ; but one more word , Monsieur d'Artagnan . 
At Nantes you will meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres , captain of the guards . 
Be sure that your musketeers are placed before his guards arrive . 
Precedence always belongs to the first comer . '' 
`` Yes , sire . ''
