He asked to be conducted to M. d'Herblay . 
Two soldiers , at a signal from a sergeant , marched him between them , and escorted him . 
Aramis was upon the quay . 
The envoy presented himself before the bishop of Vannes . 
The darkness was almost absolute , notwithstanding the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following Aramis in his rounds . 
`` Well , Jonathan , from whom do you come ? '' 
`` Monseigneur , from those who captured me . '' 
`` Who captured you ? '' 
`` You know , monseigneur , we set out in search of our comrades ? '' 
`` Yes ; and afterwards ? '' 
`` Well ! 
monseigneur , within a short league we were captured by a chasse maree belonging to the king . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Of which king ? '' 
cried Porthos . 
Jonathan started . 
`` Speak ! '' 
continued the bishop . 
`` We were captured , monseigneur , and joined to those who had been taken yesterday morning . '' 
`` What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` Monsieur , to prevent us from telling you , '' replied Jonathan . 
Porthos was again at a loss to comprehend . 
`` And they have released you to-day ? '' 
asked he . 
`` That I might tell you they have captured us , monsieur . '' 
`` Trouble upon trouble , '' thought honest Porthos . 
During this time Aramis was reflecting . 
`` Humph ! '' 
said he , `` then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the coasts ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Who commands it ? '' 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers . '' 
`` D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan ! '' 
exclaimed Porthos . 
`` I believe that is the name . '' 
`` And did he give you this letter ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Bring the torches nearer . '' 
`` It is his writing , '' said Porthos . 
Aramis eagerly read the following lines : `` Order of the king to take Belle-Isle ; or to put the garrison to the sword , if they resist ; order to make prisoners of all the men of the garrison ; signed , D'ARTAGNAN , who , the day before yesterday , arrested M. Fouquet , for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile . '' 
Aramis turned pale , and crushed the paper in his hands . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked Porthos . 
`` Nothing , my friend , nothing . '' 
`` Tell me , Jonathan ? '' 
`` Monseigneur ? '' 
`` Did you speak to M. d'Artagnan ? ''
