`` And will you tell me what you read therein , monseigneur ? '' 
asked Aramis , deeply interested . 
`` Quite enough , monsieur , to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank , and that Perronnette , without being a lady of quality , was far better than a servant ; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born , since the queen , Anne of Austria , and Mazarin , the prime minister , commended me so earnestly to their care . '' 
Here the young man paused , quite overcome . 
`` And what happened ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` It happened , monsieur , '' answered he , `` that the workmen they had summoned found nothing in the well , after the closest search ; that my governor perceived that the brink was all watery ; that I was not so dried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments were moist ; and , lastly , that I was seized with a violent fever , owing to the chill and the excitement of my discovery , an attack of delirium supervening , during which I related the whole adventure ; so that , guided by my avowal , my governor found the pieces of the queen 's letter inside the bolster where I had concealed them . '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
said Aramis , `` now I understand . '' 
`` Beyond this , all is conjecture . 
Doubtless the unfortunate lady and gentleman , not daring to keep the occurrence secret , wrote of all this to the queen and sent back the torn letter . '' 
`` After which , '' said Aramis , `` you were arrested and removed to the Bastile . '' 
`` As you see . '' 
`` Your two attendants disappeared ? '' 
`` Alas ! '' 
`` Let us not take up our time with the dead , but see what can be done with the living . 
You told me you were resigned . '' 
`` I repeat it . '' 
`` Without any desire for freedom ? '' 
`` As I told you . '' 
`` Without ambition , sorrow , or thought ? '' 
The young man made no answer . 
`` Well , '' asked Aramis , `` why are you silent ? '' 
`` I think I have spoken enough , '' answered the prisoner , `` and that now it is your turn . 
I am weary . '' 
Aramis gathered himself up , and a shade of deep solemnity spread itself over his countenance . 
It was evident that he had reached the crisis in the part he had come to the prison to play . 
`` One question , '' said Aramis . 
`` What is it ? 
speak . '' 
`` In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor mirrors ? '' 
`` What are those two words , and what is their meaning ? '' 
asked the young man ; `` I have no sort of knowledge of them . '' 
`` They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects ; so that , for instance , you may see in them your own lineaments , as you see mine now , with the naked eye . '' 
`` No ; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house , '' answered the young man . 
Aramis looked round him . 
`` Nor is there anything of the kind here , either , '' he said ; `` they have again taken the same precaution . '' 
`` To what end ? '' 
`` You will know directly . 
Now , you have told me that you were instructed in mathematics , astronomy , fencing , and riding ; but you have not said a word about history . '' 
`` My tutor sometimes related to me the principal deeds of the king , St. Louis , King Francis I. , and King Henry IV . '' 
`` Is that all ? '' 
`` Very nearly . '' 
`` This also was done by design , then ; just as they deprived you of mirrors , which reflect the present , so they left you in ignorance of history , which reflects the past . 
Since your imprisonment , books have been forbidden you ; so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts , by means of which you would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion of your recollections and your hopes . '' 
`` It is true , '' said the young man . 
`` Listen , then ; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France during the last twenty-three or twenty-four years ; that is , from the probable date of your birth ; in a word , from the time that interests you . '' 
`` Say on . '' 
And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude . 
`` Do you know who was the son of Henry IV . ? ''
