`` Not I , certainly , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` but I believe it was M. Colbert . '' 
Colbert , having heard his name pronounced , said , `` What was M. d'Artagnan good enough to say ? '' 
`` I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king 's progress , so that he might taste the vin de Brie . 
Was I right ? '' 
`` Quite so , monsieur . '' 
`` In that case , then , it was you whom the king called some name or other . '' 
`` What name ? '' 
`` I hardly know ; but wait a moment - idiot , I think it was - no , no , it was fool or dolt . 
Yes ; his majesty said that the man who had thought of the vin de Melun was something of the sort . '' 
D'Artagnan , after this broadside , quietly caressed his mustache ; M. Colbert 's large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever . 
D'Artagnan , seeing how ugly anger made him , did not stop half-way . 
The orator still went on with his speech , while the king 's color was visibly increasing . 
`` Mordioux ! '' 
said the musketeer , coolly , `` the king is going to have an attack of determination of blood to the head . 
Where the deuce did you get hold of that idea , Monsieur Colbert ? 
You have no luck . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' said the financier , drawing himself up , `` my zeal for the king 's service inspired me with the idea . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` Monsieur , Melun is a city , an excellent city , which pays well , and which it would be imprudent to displease . '' 
`` There , now ! 
I , who do not pretend to be a financier , saw only one idea in your idea . '' 
`` What was that , monsieur ? '' 
`` That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet , who is making himself quite giddy on his donjons yonder , in waiting for us . '' 
This was a home-stroke , hard enough in all conscience . 
Colbert was completely thrown out of the saddle by it , and retired , thoroughly discomfited . 
Fortunately , the speech was now at an end ; the king drank the wine which was presented to him , and then every one resumed the progress through the city . 
The king bit his lips in anger , for the evening was closing in , and all hope of a walk with La Valliere was at an end . 
In order that the whole of the king 's household should enter Vaux , four hours at least were necessary , owing to the different arrangements . 
The king , therefore , who was boiling with impatience , hurried forward as much as possible , in order to reach it before nightfall . 
But , at the moment he was setting off again , other and fresh difficulties arose . 
`` Is not the king going to sleep at Melun ? '' 
said Colbert , in a low tone of voice , to D'Artagnan . 
M. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day , to address himself in that manner to the chief of the musketeers ; for the latter guessed that the king 's intention was very far from that of remaining where he was . 
D'Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and strongly accompanied ; and desired that his majesty would not enter except with all the escort . 
On the other hand , he felt that these delays would irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure . 
In what way could he possibly reconcile these difficulties ? 
D'Artagnan took up Colbert 's remark , and determined to repeated it to the king . 
`` Sire , '' he said , `` M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not intend to sleep at Melun . '' 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
What for ? '' 
exclaimed Louis XIV . 
`` Sleep at Melun ! 
Who , in Heaven 's name , can have thought of such a thing , when M. Fouquet is expecting us this evening ? '' 
`` It was simply , '' replied Colbert , quickly , `` the fear of causing your majesty the least delay ; for , according to established etiquette , you can not enter any place , with the exception of your own royal residences , until the soldiers ' quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster , and the garrison properly distributed . '' 
D'Artagnan listened with the greatest attention , biting his mustache to conceal his vexation ; and the queens were not less interested . 
They were fatigued , and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any farther ; more especially , in order to prevent the king walking about in the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court , for , if etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms , the ladies of honor , as soon as they had performed the services required of them , had no restrictions placed upon them , but were at liberty to walk about as they pleased . 
It will easily be conjectured that all these rival interests , gathering together in vapors , necessarily produced clouds , and that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest . 
The king had no mustache to gnaw , and therefore kept biting the handle of his whip instead , with ill-concealed impatience . 
How could he get out of it ? 
D'Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible , and Colbert as sulky as he could .
