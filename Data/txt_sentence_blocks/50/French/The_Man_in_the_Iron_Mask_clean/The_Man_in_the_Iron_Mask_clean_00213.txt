monsieur le comte , no subterfuges ; you are a good Christian ? '' 
`` I hope so , '' said Athos . 
`` Is it your wish to kill yourself ? '' 
`` Never , doctor . '' 
`` Well ! 
monsieur , you are in a fair way of doing so . 
Thus to remain is suicide . 
Get well ! 
monsieur le comte , get well ! '' 
`` Of what ? 
Find the disease first . 
For my part , I never knew myself better ; never did the sky appear more blue to me ; never did I take more care of my flowers . '' 
`` You have a hidden grief . '' 
`` Concealed ! 
- not at all ; the absence of my son , doctor ; that is my malady , and I do not conceal it . '' 
`` Monsieur le comte , your son lives , he is strong , he has all the future before him - the future of men of merit , of his race ; live for him - '' `` But I do live , doctor ; oh ! 
be satisfied of that , '' added he , with a melancholy smile ; `` for as long as Raoul lives , it will be plainly known , for as long as he lives , I shall live . '' 
`` What do you say ? '' 
`` A very simple thing . 
At this moment , doctor , I leave life suspended within me . 
A forgetful , dissipated , indifferent life would be beyond my strength , now I have no longer Raoul with me . 
You do not ask the lamp to burn when the match has not illumed the flame ; do not ask me to live amidst noise and merriment . 
I vegetate , I prepare myself , I wait . 
Look , doctor ; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at the ports , where they were waiting to embark ; lying down , indifferent , half on one element , half on the other ; they were neither at the place where the sea was going to carry them , nor at the place the earth was going to lose them ; baggage prepared , minds on the stretch , arms stacked - they waited . 
I repeat it , the word is the one which paints my present life . 
Lying down like the soldiers , my ear on the stretch for the report that may reach me , I wish to be ready to set out at the first summons . 
Who will make me that summons ? 
life or death ? 
God or Raoul ? 
My baggage is packed , my soul is prepared , I await the signal - I wait , doctor , I wait ! '' 
The doctor knew the temper of that mind ; he appreciated the strength of that body ; he reflected for the moment , told himself that words were useless , remedies absurd , and left the chateau , exhorting Athos 's servants not to quit him for a moment . 
The doctor being gone , Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at having been disturbed . 
He did not even desire that all letters that came should be brought to him directly . 
He knew very well that every distraction which should arise would be a joy , a hope , which his servants would have paid with their blood to procure him . 
Sleep had become rare . 
By intense thinking , Athos forgot himself , for a few hours at most , in a reverie most profound , more obscure than other people would have called a dream . 
The momentary repose which this forgetfulness thus gave the body , still further fatigued the soul , for Athos lived a double life during these wanderings of his understanding . 
One night , he dreamt that Raoul was dressing himself in a tent , to go upon an expedition commanded by M. de Beaufort in person . 
The young man was sad ; he clasped his cuirass slowly , and slowly he girded on his sword . 
`` What is the matter ? '' 
asked his father , tenderly . 
`` What afflicts me is the death of Porthos , ever so dear a friend , '' replied Raoul . 
`` I suffer here the grief you soon will feel at home . '' 
And the vision disappeared with the slumber of Athos . 
At daybreak one of his servants entered his master 's apartment , and gave him a letter which came from Spain . 
`` The writing of Aramis , '' thought the comte ; and he read . 
`` Porthos is dead ! '' 
cried he , after the first lines . 
`` Oh ! 
Raoul , Raoul !
