`` Game for a woman ! '' 
said she . 
`` Is not the queen a woman ? 
If she wishes M. d'Herblay arrested , she has her reasons . 
Besides , is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
never mind that , '' said Colbert . 
`` This man shall be spared , if he is not the enemy of the king . 
Is that displeasing to you ? '' 
`` I say nothing . '' 
`` Yes - you wish to see him in prison , in the Bastile , for instance . '' 
`` I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of Belle-Isle . '' 
`` I will speak to the king about it ; he will clear up the point . '' 
`` And whilst waiting for that enlightenment , Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes will have escaped . 
I would do so . '' 
`` Escaped ! 
he ! 
and whither should he escape ? 
Europe is ours , in will , if not in fact . '' 
`` He will always find an asylum , monsieur . 
It is evident you know nothing of the man you have to do with . 
You do not know D'Herblay ; you do not know Aramis . 
He was one of those four musketeers who , under the late king , made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble , and who , during the regency , gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin . '' 
`` But , madame , what can he do , unless he has a kingdom to back him ? '' 
`` He has one , monsieur . '' 
`` A kingdom , he ! 
what , Monsieur d'Herblay ? '' 
`` I repeat to you , monsieur , that if he wants a kingdom , he either has it or will have it . '' 
`` Well , as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape , madame , I promise you he shall not escape . '' 
`` Belle-Isle is fortified , M. Colbert , and fortified by him . '' 
`` If Belle-Isle were also defended by him , Belle-Isle is not impregnable ; and if Monsieur l'Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle , well , madame , the place shall be besieged , and he will be taken . '' 
`` You may be very certain , monsieur , that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily , and you will be magnificently rewarded ; but what shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man ? '' 
`` That when once taken , he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape . '' 
`` Very well , Monsieur Colbert , and we may say , that , dating from this instant , we have formed a solid alliance , that is , you and I , and that I am absolutely at your service . '' 
`` It is I , madame , who place myself at yours . 
This Chevalier d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy , is he not ? '' 
`` Much more . '' 
`` A secret ambassador ? '' 
`` Higher still . '' 
`` Stop - King Phillip III . 
of Spain is a bigot . 
He is , perhaps , the confessor of Phillip III . '' 
`` You must go higher even than that . '' 
`` Mordieu ! '' 
cried Colbert , who forgot himself so far as to swear in the presence of this great lady , of this old friend of the queen-mother . 
`` He must then be the general of the Jesuits . '' 
`` I believe you have guessed it at last , '' replied the duchesse . 
`` Ah ! 
then , madame , this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him ; and we must make haste , too . '' 
`` Such was my opinion , monsieur , but I did not dare to give it you . ''
