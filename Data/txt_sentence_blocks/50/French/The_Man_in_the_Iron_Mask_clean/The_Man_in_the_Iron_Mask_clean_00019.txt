The poor fellows had enough to do , and did their best , to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their master , leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence ; and when wounded pride , or disappointed expectation , brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke , he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter . 
The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture . 
Our captain of musketeers , a man of sure and rapid observation , took it all in at a glance ; and having run over the groups , his eye rested on a man in front of him . 
This man , seated upon a stool , scarcely showed his head above the counter that sheltered him . 
He was about forty years of age , with a melancholy aspect , pale face , and soft luminous eyes . 
He was looking at D'Artagnan and the rest , with his chin resting upon his hand , like a calm and inquiring amateur . 
Only on perceiving , and doubtless recognizing , our captain , he pulled his hat down over his eyes . 
It was this action , perhaps , that attracted D'Artagnan 's attention . 
If so , the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely different from what he had desired . 
In other respects his costume was plain , and his hair evenly cut enough for customers , who were not close observers , to take him for a mere tailor 's apprentice , perched behind the board , and carefully stitching cloth or velvet . 
Nevertheless , this man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his fingers . 
D'Artagnan was not deceived , - not he ; and he saw at once that if this man was working at anything , it certainly was not at velvet . 
`` Eh ! '' 
said he , addressing this man , `` and so you have become a tailor 's boy , Monsieur Moliere ! '' 
`` Hush , M. d'Artagnan ! '' 
replied the man , softly , `` you will make them recognize me . '' 
`` Well , and what harm ? '' 
`` The fact is , there is no harm , but - '' `` You were going to say there is no good in doing it either , is it not so ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
no ; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures . '' 
`` Go on - go on , Monsieur Moliere . 
I quite understand the interest you take in the plates - I will not disturb your studies . '' 
`` Thank you . '' 
`` But on one condition ; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is . '' 
`` Oh ! 
willingly ; in his own room . 
Only - '' `` Only that one ca n't enter it ? '' 
`` Unapproachable . '' 
`` For everybody ? '' 
`` Everybody . 
He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my observations , and then he went away . '' 
`` Well , my dear Monsieur Moliere , but you will go and tell him I am here . '' 
`` I ! '' 
exclaimed Moliere , in the tone of a courageous dog , from which you snatch the bone it has legitimately gained ; `` I disturb myself ! 
Ah ! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan , how hard you are upon me ! '' 
`` If you do n't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here , my dear Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan , in a low tone , `` I warn you of one thing : that I wo n't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me . '' 
Moliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture , `` This gentleman , is it not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
Moliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds and hearts of men . 
The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one , for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber . 
: The Patterns . 
During all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away , leaving at every angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace , as the waves leave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands , when they retire with the ebbing tide . 
In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared , making another sign to D'Artagnan from under the hangings . 
The latter hurried after him , with Porthos in the rear , and after threading a labyrinth of corridors , introduced him to M. Percerin 's room . 
The old man , with his sleeves turned up , was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered brocade , so as the better to exhibit its luster . 
Perceiving D'Artagnan , he put the silk aside , and came to meet him , by no means radiant with joy , and by no means courteous , but , take it altogether , in a tolerably civil manner . 
`` The captain of the king 's musketeers will excuse me , I am sure , for I am engaged . '' 
`` Eh ! 
yes , on the king 's costumes ; I know that , my dear Monsieur Percerin .
