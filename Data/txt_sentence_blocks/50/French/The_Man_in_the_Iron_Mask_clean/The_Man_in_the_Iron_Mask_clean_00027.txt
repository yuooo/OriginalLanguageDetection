A little , ' I replied , bending a little in my hands , ` but I could hold out for an hour or so longer . ' '' 
` No , no , I will not allow it ; the willing fellows will make it a duty to support your arms , as of old , men supported those of the prophet . ' '' 
` Very good , ' I answered . '' 
` That will not be humiliating to you ? ' '' 
` My friend , ' said I , ` there is , I think , a great difference between being supported and being measured . ' '' 
`` The distinction is full of the soundest sense , '' interrupted D'Artagnan . 
`` Then , '' continued Porthos , `` he made a sign : two lads approached ; one supported my left arm , while the other , with infinite address , supported my right . '' '' 
` Another , my man , ' cried he . 
A third approached . 
` Support monsieur by the waist , ' said he . 
The garcon complied . '' 
`` So that you were at rest ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Perfectly ; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass . '' 
`` Poquelin , my friend . '' 
`` Poquelin - you are right . 
Stay , decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere . '' 
`` Yes ; and then it was over , was n't it ? '' 
`` During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror . '' '' 
'T was delicate in him . '' 
`` I much like the plan ; it is respectful , and keeps every one in his place . '' 
`` And there it ended ? '' 
`` Without a soul having touched me , my friend . '' 
`` Except the three garcons who supported you . '' 
`` Doubtless ; but I have , I think , already explained to you the difference there is between supporting and measuring . '' '' 
'T is true , '' answered D'Artagnan ; who said afterwards to himself , `` I ` faith , I greatly deceive myself , or I have been the means of a good windfall to that rascal Moliere , and we shall assuredly see the scene hit off to the life in some comedy or other . '' 
Porthos smiled . 
`` What are you laughing at ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan . 
`` Must I confess ? 
Well , I was laughing over my good fortune . '' 
`` Oh , that is true ; I do n't know a happier man than you . 
But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you ? ' 
`` Well , my dear fellow , congratulate me . '' 
`` I desire nothing better . '' 
`` It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that manner . '' 
`` Are you so sure of it ? ' 
`` Nearly so . 
Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere and the other garcons showed me the fact . '' 
`` Well , my friend , that does not surprise me from Moliere , '' said D'Artagnan . 
`` Voliere , my friend . '' 
`` Oh , no , no , indeed ! 
I am very willing to leave you to go on saying Voliere ; but , as for me , I shall continued to say Moliere . 
Well , this , I was saying , does not surprise me , coming from Moliere , who is a very ingenious fellow , and inspired you with this grand idea . '' 
`` It will be of great use to him by and by , I am sure . '' 
`` Wo n't it be of use to him , indeed ? 
I believe you , it will , and that in the highest degree ; - for you see my friend Moliere is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons , comtes , and marquises - according to their measure . '' 
On this observation , neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss , D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin 's house and rejoined their carriages , wherein we will leave them , in order to look after Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande . 
: The Bee-Hive , the Bees , and the Honey . 
The bishop of Vannes , much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin 's , returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor .
