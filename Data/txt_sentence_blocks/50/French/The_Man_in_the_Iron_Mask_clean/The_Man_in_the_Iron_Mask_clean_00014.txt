`` Alas ! 
I doubt it , though . '' 
`` Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there ! '' 
`` Ah ! '' 
cried Porthos , tearing out a lock of hair in his despair . 
`` Eh ! 
good heavens , are you ill ? '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf ! 
It is n't that . '' 
`` But what is it , then ? '' '' 
'T is that I have no clothes ! '' 
D'Artagnan stood petrified . 
`` No clothes ! 
Porthos , no clothes ! '' 
he cried , `` when I see at least fifty suits on the floor . '' 
`` Fifty , truly ; but not one which fits me ! '' 
`` What ? 
not one that fits you ? 
But are you not measured , then , when you give an order ? '' 
`` To be sure he is , '' answered Mouston ; `` but unfortunately I have gotten stouter ! '' 
`` What ! 
you stouter ! '' 
`` So much so that I am now bigger than the baron . 
Would you believe it , monsieur ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
it seems to me that is quite evident . '' 
`` Do you see , stupid ? '' 
said Porthos , `` that is quite evident ! '' 
`` Be still , my dear Porthos , '' resumed D'Artagnan , becoming slightly impatient , `` I do n't understand why your clothes should not fit you , because Mouston has grown stouter . '' 
`` I am going to explain it , '' said Porthos . 
`` You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony , who had always seven wild boars kept roasting , each cooked up to a different point ; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it . 
Well , then , I resolved , as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week , I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion . '' 
`` Capitally reasoned , Porthos - only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims . 
Without counting the time lost in being measured , the fashions are always changing . '' 
`` That is exactly the point , '' said Porthos , `` in regard to which I flattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device . '' 
`` Tell me what it is ; for I do n't doubt your genius . '' 
`` You remember what Mouston once was , then ? '' 
`` Yes ; when he used to call himself Mousqueton . '' 
`` And you remember , too , the period when he began to grow fatter ? '' 
`` No , not exactly . 
I beg your pardon , my good Mouston . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you are not in fault , monsieur , '' said Mouston , graciously . 
`` You were in Paris , and as for us , we were at Pierrefonds . '' 
`` Well , well , my dear Porthos ; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat . 
Is that what you wished to say ? '' 
`` Yes , my friend ; and I greatly rejoice over the period . '' 
`` Indeed , I believe you do , '' exclaimed D'Artagnan . 
`` You understand , '' continued Porthos , `` what a world of trouble it spared for me . ''
