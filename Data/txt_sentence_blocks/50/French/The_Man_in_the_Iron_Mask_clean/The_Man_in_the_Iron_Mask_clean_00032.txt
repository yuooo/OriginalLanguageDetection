I am in a hurry . '' 
`` I shall dine here , '' said Loret . 
`` M. de Gourville has promised me some craw-fish . '' 
`` He has promised me some whitings . 
Find a rhyme for that , La Fontaine . '' 
Aramis went out laughing , as only he could laugh , and Moliere followed him . 
They were at the bottom of the stairs , when La Fontaine opened the door , and shouted out : `` He has promised us some whitings , In return for these our writings . '' 
The shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis opened the door of the study . 
As to Moliere , he had undertaken to order the horses , while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the superintendent . 
`` Oh , how they are laughing there ! '' 
said Fouquet , with a sigh . 
`` Do you not laugh , monseigneur ? '' 
`` I laugh no longer now , M. d'Herblay . 
The fete is approaching ; money is departing . '' 
`` Have I not told you that was my business ? '' 
`` Yes , you promised me millions . '' 
`` You shall have them the day after the king 's entree into Vaux . '' 
Fouquet looked closely at Aramis , and passed the back of his icy hand across his moistened brow . 
Aramis perceived that the superintendent either doubted him , or felt he was powerless to obtain the money . 
How could Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop , ex-abbe , ex-musketeer , could find any ? 
`` Why doubt me ? '' 
said Aramis . 
Fouquet smiled and shook his head . 
`` Man of little faith ! '' 
added the bishop . 
`` My dear M. d'Herblay , '' answered Fouquet , `` if I fall - '' `` Well ; if you ` fall ' ? '' 
`` I shall , at least , fall from such a height , that I shall shatter myself in falling . '' 
Then giving himself a shake , as though to escape from himself , `` Whence came you , '' said he , `` my friend ? '' 
`` From Paris - from Percerin . '' 
`` And what have you been doing at Percerin 's , for I suppose you attach no great importance to our poets ' dresses ? '' 
`` No ; I went to prepare a surprise . '' 
`` Surprise ? '' 
`` Yes ; which you are going to give to the king . '' 
`` And will it cost much ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun . '' 
`` A painting ? 
- Ah ! 
all the better ! 
And what is this painting to represent ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; then at the same time , whatever you may say or think of it , I went to see the dresses for our poets . '' 
`` Bah ! 
and they will be rich and elegant ? '' 
`` Splendid ! 
There will be few great monseigneurs with so good . 
People will see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and those of friendship . '' 
`` Ever generous and grateful , dear prelate . '' 
`` In your school . '' 
Fouquet grasped his hand . 
`` And where are you going ? ''
