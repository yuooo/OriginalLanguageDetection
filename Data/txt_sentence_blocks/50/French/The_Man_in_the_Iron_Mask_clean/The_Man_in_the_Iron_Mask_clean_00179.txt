: The Ancestors of Porthos . 
When D'Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos , the latter returned to the principal fort , in order to converse with greater liberty . 
Porthos , still thoughtful , was a restraint on Aramis , whose mind had never felt itself more free . 
`` Dear Porthos , '' said he , suddenly , `` I will explain D'Artagnan 's idea to you . '' 
`` What idea , Aramis ? '' 
`` An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours . '' 
`` Ah ! 
indeed ! '' 
said Porthos , much astonished . 
`` Let us hear it . '' 
`` Did you remark , in the scene our friend had with the officer , that certain orders constrained him with regard to us ? '' 
`` Yes , I did notice that . '' 
`` Well ! 
D'Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king , and during the confusion that will result from his absence , we will get away , or rather you will get away , Porthos , if there is possibility of flight for only one . '' 
Here Porthos shook his head and replied : `` We will escape together , Aramis , or we will stay together . '' 
`` Thine is a right , a generous heart , '' said Aramis , `` only your melancholy uneasiness affects me . '' 
`` I am not uneasy , '' said Porthos . 
`` Then you are angry with me . '' 
`` I am not angry with you . '' 
`` Then why , my friend , do you put on such a dismal countenance ? '' 
`` I will tell you ; I am making my will . '' 
And while saying these words , the good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis . 
`` Your will ! '' 
cried the bishop . 
`` What , then ! 
do you think yourself lost ? '' 
`` I feel fatigued . 
It is the first time , and there is a custom in our family . '' 
`` What is it , my friend ? '' 
`` My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
said Aramis ; `` then your grandfather must have been Samson himself . '' 
`` No ; his name was Antoine . 
Well ! 
he was about my age , when , setting out one day for the chase , he felt his legs weak , the man who had never known what weakness was before . '' 
`` What was the meaning of that fatigue , my friend ? '' 
`` Nothing good , as you will see ; for having set out , complaining still of weakness of the legs , he met a wild boar , which made head against him ; he missed him with his arquebuse , and was ripped up by the beast and died immediately . '' 
`` There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself , dear Porthos . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you will see . 
My father was as strong again as I am . 
He was a rough soldier , under Henry III . 
and Henry IV. ; his name was not Antoine , but Gaspard , the same as M. de Coligny . 
Always on horseback , he had never known what lassitude was . 
One evening , as he rose from table , his legs failed him . '' 
`` He had supped heartily , perhaps , '' said Aramis , `` and that was why he staggered . '' 
`` Bah ! 
A friend of M. de Bassompierre , nonsense ! 
No , no , he was astonished at this lassitude , and said to my mother , who laughed at him , ` Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar , as the late M. du Vallon , my father did ? ' '' 
`` Well ? ''
