`` I say I shall never be aught but an ass , '' answered La Fontaine , with a heavy sigh and swimming eyes . 
`` Yes , my friend , '' he added , with increasing grief , `` it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner . '' 
`` Oh , 't is wrong to say so . '' 
`` Nay , I am a poor creature ! '' 
`` Who said so ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
't was Pelisson ; did you not , Pelisson ? '' 
Pelisson , again absorbed in his work , took good care not to answer . 
`` But if Pelisson said you were so , '' cried Moliere , `` Pelisson has seriously offended you . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
I advise you , as you are a gentleman , not to leave an insult like that unpunished . '' 
`` What ! '' 
exclaimed La Fontaine . 
`` Did you ever fight ? '' 
`` Once only , with a lieutenant in the light horse . '' 
`` What wrong had he done you ? '' 
`` It seems he ran away with my wife . '' 
`` Ah , ah ! '' 
said Moliere , becoming slightly pale ; but as , at La Fontaine 's declaration , the others had turned round , Moliere kept upon his lips the rallying smile which had so nearly died away , and continuing to make La Fontaine speak - `` And what was the result of the duel ? '' 
`` The result was , that on the ground my opponent disarmed me , and then made an apology , promising never again to set foot in my house . '' 
`` And you considered yourself satisfied ? '' 
said Moliere . 
`` Not at all ! 
on the contrary , I picked up my sword . ' 
I beg your pardon , monsieur , ' I said , ' I have not fought you because you were my wife 's friend , but because I was told I ought to fight . 
So , as I have never known any peace save since you made her acquaintance , do me the pleasure to continue your visits as heretofore , or morbleu ! 
let us set to again . ' 
And so , '' continued La Fontaine , `` he was compelled to resume his friendship with madame , and I continue to be the happiest of husbands . '' 
All burst out laughing . 
Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes . 
Why ? 
Perhaps to wipe away a tear , perhaps to smother a sigh . 
Alas ! 
we know that Moliere was a moralist , but he was not a philosopher . '' 
'T is all one , '' he said , returning to the topic of the conversation , `` Pelisson has insulted you . '' 
`` Ah , truly ! 
I had already forgotten it . '' 
`` And I am going to challenge him on your behalf . '' 
`` Well , you can do so , if you think it indispensable . '' 
`` I do think it indispensable , and I am going to - '' `` Stay , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` I want your advice . '' 
`` Upon what ? 
this insult ? '' 
`` No ; tell me really now whether lumiere does not rhyme with orniere . '' 
`` I should make them rhyme . '' 
`` Ah ! 
I knew you would . '' 
`` And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time . '' 
`` A hundred thousand ! '' 
cried La Fontaine .
