Percerin never moved . 
Aramis roused him violently , by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was engaged . 
`` My dear Percerin , '' said he , `` I have , near hand , M. Lebrun , one of M. Fouquet 's painters . '' 
`` Ah , very good , '' thought D'Artagnan ; `` but why Lebrun ? '' 
Aramis looked at D'Artagnan , who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark Antony . 
`` And you wish that I should make him a dress , similar to those of the Epicureans ? '' 
answered Percerin . 
And while saying this , in an absent manner , the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade . 
`` An Epicurean 's dress ? '' 
asked D'Artagnan , in a tone of inquiry . 
`` I see , '' said Aramis , with a most engaging smile , `` it is written that our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening . 
Yes , friend , you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet 's Epicureans , have you not ? '' 
`` Undoubtedly . 
Is it not a kind of poetical society , of which La Fontaine , Loret , Pelisson , and Moliere are members , and which holds its sittings at Saint-Mande ? '' 
`` Exactly so . 
Well , we are going to put our poets in uniform , and enroll them in a regiment for the king . '' 
`` Oh , very well , I understand ; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king . 
Be at ease ; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun , I will not mention it . '' 
`` Always agreeable , my friend . 
No , Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it ; the secret which concerns him is far more important than the other . '' 
`` Then , if it is so important as all that , I prefer not to know it , '' said D'Artagnan , making a show of departure . 
`` Come in , M. Lebrun , come in , '' said Aramis , opening a side-door with his right hand , and holding back D'Artagnan with his left . 
`` I ` faith , I too , am quite in the dark , '' quoth Percerin . 
Aramis took an `` opportunity , '' as is said in theatrical matters . 
`` My dear M. de Percerin , '' Aramis continued , `` you are making five dresses for the king , are you not ? 
One in brocade ; one in hunting-cloth ; one in velvet ; one in satin ; and one in Florentine stuffs . '' 
`` Yes ; but how - do you know all that , monseigneur ? '' 
said Percerin , astounded . 
`` It is all very simple , my dear monsieur ; there will be a hunt , a banquet , concert , promenade and reception ; these five kinds of dress are required by etiquette . '' 
`` You know everything , monseigneur ! '' 
`` And a thing or two in addition , '' muttered D'Artagnan . 
`` But , '' cried the tailor , in triumph , `` what you do not know , monseigneur -- prince of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king , Mademoiselle de la Valliere , and myself do know , is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments , and the cut , the ensemble , the finish of it all ! '' 
`` Well , '' said Aramis , `` that is precisely what I have come to ask you , dear Percerin . '' 
`` Ah , bah ! '' 
exclaimed the tailor , terrified , though Aramis had pronounced these words in his softest and most honeyed tones . 
The request appeared , on reflection , so exaggerated , so ridiculous , so monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself , then aloud , and finished with a shout . 
D'Artagnan followed his example , not because he found the matter so `` very funny , '' but in order not to allow Aramis to cool . 
`` At the outset , I appear to be hazarding an absurd question , do I not ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` But D'Artagnan , who is incarnate wisdom itself , will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this . '' 
`` Let us see , '' said the attentive musketeer ; perceiving with his wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now , and that the hour of battle was approaching . 
`` Let us see , '' said Percerin , incredulously . 
`` Why , now , '' continued Aramis , `` does M. Fouquet give the king a fete ? 
- Is it not to please him ? '' 
`` Assuredly , '' said Percerin . 
D'Artagnan nodded assent . 
`` By delicate attentions ? 
by some happy device ? 
by a succession of surprises , like that of which we were talking ? 
- the enrolment of our Epicureans . ''
