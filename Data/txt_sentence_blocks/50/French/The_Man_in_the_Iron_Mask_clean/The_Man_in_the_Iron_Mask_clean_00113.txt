`` Yes , mademoiselle . '' 
`` I will go and ask him to come up here , presently , after I have spoken to you . '' 
`` Do so , mademoiselle . '' 
`` Are you angry with me ? '' 
Raoul looked at her for a moment , then , casting down his eyes , `` Yes , '' said he . 
`` You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture , do you not ? '' 
`` Rupture ! '' 
said he , with bitterness . 
`` Oh ! 
mademoiselle , there can be no rupture where there has been no love . '' 
`` You are in error , '' replied Montalais ; `` Louise did love you . '' 
Raoul started . 
`` Not with love , I know ; but she liked you , and you ought to have married her before you set out for London . '' 
Raoul broke into a sinister laugh , which made Montalais shudder . 
`` You tell me that very much at your ease , mademoiselle . 
Do people marry whom they like ? 
You forget that the king then kept for himself as his mistress her of whom we are speaking . '' 
`` Listen , '' said the young woman , pressing the hands of Raoul in her own , `` you were wrong in every way ; a man of your age ought never to leave a woman of hers alone . '' 
`` There is no longer any faith in the world , then , '' said Raoul . 
`` No , vicomte , '' said Montalais , quietly . 
`` Nevertheless , let me tell you that , if , instead of loving Louise coldly and philosophically , you had endeavored to awaken her to love - '' `` Enough , I pray you , mademoiselle , '' said Raoul . 
`` I feel as though you are all , of both sexes , of a different age from me . 
You can laugh , and you can banter agreeably . 
I , mademoiselle , I loved Mademoiselle de - '' Raoul could not pronounce her name , - `` I loved her well ! 
I put my faith in her - now I am quits by loving her no longer . '' 
`` Oh , vicomte ! '' 
said Montalais , pointing to his reflection in a looking - glass . 
`` I know what you mean , mademoiselle ; I am much altered , am I not ? 
Well ! 
Do you know why ? 
Because my face is the mirror of my heart , the outer surface changed to match the mind within . '' 
`` You are consoled , then ? '' 
said Montalais , sharply . 
`` No , I shall never be consoled . '' 
`` I do n't understand you , M. de Bragelonne . '' 
`` I care but little for that . 
I do not quite understand myself . '' 
`` You have not even tried to speak to Louise ? '' 
`` Who ! 
I ? '' 
exclaimed the young man , with eyes flashing fire ; `` I ! 
- Why do you not advise me to marry her ? 
Perhaps the king would consent now . '' 
And he rose from his chair full of anger . 
`` I see , '' said Montalais , `` that you are not cured , and that Louise has one enemy the more . '' 
`` One enemy the more ! '' 
`` Yes ; favorites are but little beloved at the court of France . '' 
`` Oh ! 
while she has her lover to protect her , is not that enough ? 
She has chosen him of such a quality that her enemies can not prevail against her . ''
