`` I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea . '' 
`` Cautious , why so ? '' 
`` Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become a troublesome witness , and you wish to get rid of him . '' 
`` What ! 
in making him a duke ? '' 
`` Certainly ; you would assuredly kill him , for he would die from joy , and the secret would die with him . '' 
`` Good heavens ! '' 
`` Yes , '' said Aramis , phlegmatically ; `` I should lose a very good friend . '' 
At this moment , and in the middle of this idle conversation , under the light tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride at their mutual success , Aramis heard something which made him prick up his ears . 
`` What is that ? '' 
said Philippe . 
`` The dawn , sire . '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Well , before you retired to bed last night , you probably decided to do something this morning at break of day . '' 
`` Yes , I told my captain of the musketeers , '' replied the young man hurriedly , `` that I should expect him . '' 
`` If you told him that , he will certainly be here , for he is a most punctual man . '' 
`` I hear a step in the vestibule . '' 
`` It must be he . '' 
`` Come , let us begin the attack , '' said the young king resolutely . 
`` Be cautious for Heaven 's sake . 
To begin the attack , and with D'Artagnan , would be madness . 
D'Artagnan knows nothing , he has seen nothing ; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree , but if he comes into this room the first this morning , he will be sure to detect something of what has taken place , and which he would imagine it his business to occupy himself about . 
Before we allow D'Artagnan to penetrate into this room , we must air the room thoroughly , or introduce so many people into it , that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different persons . '' 
`` But how can I send him away , since I have given him a rendezvous ? '' 
observed the prince , impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an antagonist . 
`` I will take care of that , '' replied the bishop , `` and in order to begin , I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man . '' 
`` He , too , is striking a blow , for I hear him at the door , '' added the prince , hurriedly . 
And , in fact , a knock at the door was heard at that moment . 
Aramis was not mistaken ; for it was indeed D'Artagnan who adopted that mode of announcing himself . 
We have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet , but the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep , and as soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices of the superintendent 's room , D'Artagnan rose from his armchair , arranged his sword , brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve , like a private soldier getting ready for inspection . 
`` Are you going out ? '' 
said Fouquet . 
`` Yes , monseigneur . 
And you ? '' 
`` I shall remain . '' 
`` You pledge your word ? '' 
`` Certainly . '' 
`` Very good . 
Besides , my only reason for going out is to try and get that reply , - you know what I mean ? '' 
`` That sentence , you mean - '' `` Stay , I have something of the old Roman in me . 
This morning , when I got up , I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the aiguillettes , and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off . 
That is an infallible sign . '' 
`` Of prosperity ? '' 
`` Yes , be sure of it ; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to my back , it always signified a punishment from M. de Treville , or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin . 
Every time my sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt , it always predicted some disagreeable commission or another for me to execute , and I have had showers of them all my life through . 
Every time , too , my sword danced about in its sheath , a duel , fortunate in its result , was sure to follow : whenever it dangled about the calves of my legs , it signified a slight wound ; every time it fell completely out of the scabbard , I was booked , and made up my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle , with two or three months under surgical bandages into the bargain . '' 
`` I did not know your sword kept you so well informed , '' said Fouquet , with a faint smile , which showed how he was struggling against his own weakness . 
`` Is your sword bewitched , or under the influence of some imperial charm ? '' 
`` Why , you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own body . 
I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them by feeling something the matter with their legs , or a throbbing of their temples .
