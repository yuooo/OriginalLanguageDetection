He called him , at the same time saying in a low voice to Aramis , `` We may talk openly with D'Artagnan , I suppose ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
certainly , '' replied the ambassador . 
`` We were saying , M. d'Almeda and I , '' said Colbert , `` that a conflict with the United Provinces would mean a maritime war . '' 
`` That 's evident enough , '' replied the musketeer . 
`` And what do you think of it , Monsieur d'Artagnan ? '' 
`` I think that to carry on such a war successfully , you must have very large land forces . '' 
`` What did you say ? '' 
said Colbert , thinking he had ill understood him . 
`` Why such a large land army ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Because the king will be beaten by sea if he has not the English with him , and that when beaten by sea , he will soon be invaded , either by the Dutch in his ports , or by the Spaniards by land . '' 
`` And Spain neutral ? '' 
asked Aramis . 
`` Neutral as long as the king shall prove stronger , '' rejoined D'Artagnan . 
Colbert admired that sagacity which never touched a question without enlightening it thoroughly . 
Aramis smiled , as he had long known that in diplomacy D'Artagnan acknowledged no superior . 
Colbert , who , like all proud men , dwelt upon his fantasy with a certainty of success , resumed the subject , `` Who told you , M. d'Artagnan , that the king had no navy ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
I take no heed of these details , '' replied the captain . 
`` I am but an indifferent sailor . 
Like all nervous people , I hate the sea ; and yet I have an idea that , with ships , France being a seaport with two hundred exits , we might have sailors . '' 
Colbert drew from his pocket a little oblong book divided into two columns . 
On the first were the names of vessels , on the other the figures recapitulating the number of cannon and men requisite to equip these ships . 
`` I have had the same idea as you , '' said he to D'Artagnan , `` and I have had an account drawn up of the vessels we have altogether - thirty-five ships . '' 
`` Thirty-five ships ! 
impossible ! '' 
cried D'Artagnan . 
`` Something like two thousand pieces of cannon , '' said Colbert . 
`` That is what the king possesses at this moment . 
Of five and thirty vessels we can make three squadrons , but I must have five . '' 
`` Five ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` They will be afloat before the end of the year , gentlemen ; the king will have fifty ship of the line . 
We may venture on a contest with them , may we not ? '' 
`` To build vessels , '' said D'Artagnan , `` is difficult , but possible . 
As to arming them , how is that to be done ? 
In France there are neither foundries nor military docks . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
replied Colbert , in a bantering tone , `` I have planned all that this year and a half past , did you not know it ? 
Do you know M. d'Imfreville ? '' 
`` D'Imfreville ? '' 
replied D'Artagnan ; `` no . '' 
`` He is a man I have discovered ; he has a specialty ; he is a man of genius - he knows how to set men to work . 
It is he who has cast cannon and cut the woods of Bourgogne . 
And then , monsieur l'ambassadeur , you may not believe what I am going to tell you , but I have a still further idea . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! '' 
said Aramis , civilly , `` I always believe you . '' 
`` Calculating upon the character of the Dutch , our allies , I said to myself , ` They are merchants , they are friendly with the king ; they will be happy to sell to the king what they fabricate for themselves ; then the more we buy ' - Ah ! 
I must add this : I have Forant - do you know Forant , D'Artagnan ? ''
