`` Oh ! 
I have no fear on that score . 
One word more : do you think I am maneuvering for him as I ought ? '' 
`` The evil being committed , yes ; for the king would not pardon him , and you have , whatever may be said , always a supporter in M. Fouquet , who will not abandon you , he being himself compromised , notwithstanding his heroic action . '' 
`` You are right . 
And that is why , instead of gaining the sea at once , which would proclaim my fear and guilt , that is why I remain upon French ground . 
But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be , English , Spanish , or Roman ; all will depend , with me , on the standard I shall think proper to unfurl . '' 
`` How so ? '' 
`` It was I who fortified Belle-Isle ; and , so long as I defend it , nobody can take Belle-Isle from me . 
And then , as you have said just now , M. Fouquet is there . 
Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature of M. Fouquet . '' 
`` That is true . 
Nevertheless , be prudent . 
The king is both cunning and strong . '' 
Aramis smiled . 
`` I again recommend Porthos to you , '' repeated the count , with a sort of cold persistence . 
`` Whatever becomes of me , count , '' replied Aramis , in the same tone , `` our brother Porthos will fare as I do - or better . '' 
Athos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis , and turned to embrace Porthos with emotion . 
`` I was born lucky , was I not ? '' 
murmured the latter , transported with happiness , as he folded his cloak round him . 
`` Come , my dear friend , '' said Aramis . 
Raoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses . 
The group was already divided . 
Athos saw his two friends on the point of departure , and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed upon his heart . 
`` It is strange , '' thought he , `` whence comes the inclination I feel to embrace Porthos once more ? '' 
At that moment Porthos turned round , and he came towards his old friend with open arms . 
This last endearment was tender as in youth , as in times when hearts were warm - life happy . 
And then Porthos mounted his horse . 
Aramis came back once more to throw his arms round the neck of Athos . 
The latter watched them along the high - road , elongated by the shade , in their white cloaks . 
Like phantoms they seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth , and it was not in the mist , but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared . 
At the end of the perspective , both seemed to have given a spring with their feet , which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land . 
Then Athos , with a very heavy heart , returned towards the house , saying to Bragelonne , `` Raoul , I do n't know what it is that has just told me that I have seen those two for the last time . '' 
`` It does not astonish me , monsieur , that you should have such a thought , '' replied the young man , `` for I have at this moment the same , and think also that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d'Herblay again . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you , '' replied the count , `` you speak like a man rendered sad by a different cause ; you see everything in black ; you are young , and if you chance never to see those old friends again , it will because they no longer exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass . 
But I - '' Raoul shook his head sadly , and leaned upon the shoulder of the count , without either of them finding another word in their hearts , which were ready to overflow . 
All at once a noise of horses and voices , from the extremity of the road to Blois , attracted their attention that way . 
Flambeaux-bearers shook their torches merrily among the trees of their route , and turned round , from time to time , to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them . 
These flames , this noise , this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned horses , formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the melancholy and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of Aramis and Porthos . 
Athos went towards the house ; but he had hardly reached the parterre , when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze ; all the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road . 
A cry was heard of `` M. le Duc de Beaufort '' - and Athos sprang towards the door of his house . 
But the duke had already alighted from his horse , and was looking around him . 
`` I am here , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Ah ! 
good evening , dear count , '' said the prince , with that frank cordiality which won him so many hearts . 
`` Is it too late for a friend ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear prince , come in ! '' 
said the count .
