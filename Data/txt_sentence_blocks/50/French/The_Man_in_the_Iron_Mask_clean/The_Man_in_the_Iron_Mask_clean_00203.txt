Then these men were seen to be in motion , and as in the good old times of Louis XIII . 
and M. de Treville , groups were formed , and staircases were filled ; vague murmurs , issuing from the court below , came rolling to the upper stories , like the distant moaning of the waves . 
M. de Gesvres became uneasy . 
He looked at his guards , who , after being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks , began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence . 
D'Artagnan was certainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres , the captain of the guards . 
As soon as he entered , he seated himself on the ledge of a window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without the least emotion . 
No step of the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him . 
He foresaw the very moment the explosion would take place ; and we know that his previsions were in general correct . 
`` It would be very whimsical , '' thought he , `` if , this evening , my praetorians should make me king of France . 
How I should laugh ! '' 
But , at the height , all was stopped . 
Guards , musketeers , officers , soldiers , murmurs , uneasiness , dispersed , vanished , died away ; there was an end of menace and sedition . 
One word had calmed the waves . 
The king had desired Brienne to say , `` Hush , messieurs ! 
you disturb the king . '' 
D'Artagnan sighed . 
`` All is over ! '' 
said he ; `` the musketeers of the present day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII . 
All is over ! '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king , '' proclaimed an usher . 
: King Louis XIV . 
The king was seated in his cabinet , with his back turned towards the door of entrance . 
In front of him was a mirror , in which , while turning over his papers , he could see at a glance those who came in . 
He did not take any notice of the entrance of D'Artagnan , but spread above his letters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate . 
D'Artagnan understood this by-play , and kept in the background ; so that at the end of a minute the king , who heard nothing , and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye , was obliged to cry , `` Is not M. d'Artagnan there ? '' 
`` I am here , sire , '' replied the musketeer , advancing . 
`` Well , monsieur , '' said the king , fixing his pellucid eyes on D'Artagnan , `` what have you to say to me ? '' 
`` I , sire ! '' 
replied the latter , who watched the first blow of his adversary to make a good retort ; `` I have nothing to say to your majesty , unless it be that you have caused me to be arrested , and here I am . '' 
The king was going to reply that he had not had D'Artagnan arrested , but any such sentence appeared too much like an excuse , and he was silent . 
D'Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence . 
`` Monsieur , '' at length resumed the king , `` what did I charge you to go and do at Belle-Isle ? 
Tell me , if you please . '' 
The king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain . 
Here D'Artagnan was fortunate ; the king seemed to place the game in his hands . 
`` I believe , '' replied he , `` that your majesty does me the honor to ask what I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish ? '' 
`` Yes , monsieur . '' 
`` Well ! 
sire , I know nothing about it ; it is not of me that question should be asked , but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds , to whom have been given innumerable orders of all kinds , whilst to me , head of the expedition , nothing precise was said or stated in any form whatever . '' 
The king was hurt : he showed it by his reply . 
`` Monsieur , '' said he , `` orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful . '' 
`` And , therefore , I have been astonished , sire , '' retorted the musketeer , `` that a captain like myself , who ranks with a marechal of France , should have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors , good to make spies of , possibly , but not at all fit to conduct a warlike expedition . 
It was upon this subject I came to demand an explanation of your majesty , when I found the door closed against me , which , the final insult offered to a brave man , has led me to quit your majesty 's service . '' 
`` Monsieur , '' replied the king , `` you still believe that you are living in an age when kings were , as you complain of having been , under the orders and at the discretion of their inferiors . 
You seem to forget that a king owes an account of his actions to none but God . '' 
`` I forget nothing , sire , '' said the musketeer , wounded by this lesson . 
`` Besides , I do not see in what an honest man , when he asks of his king how he has ill-served him , offends him . '' 
`` You have ill-served me , monsieur , by siding with my enemies against me . '' 
`` Who are your enemies , sire ? '' 
`` The men I sent you to fight . ''
