Colbert , in his warmth , forgot himself ; he called the captain simply D'Artagnan , as the king did . 
But the captain only smiled at it . 
`` No , '' replied he , `` I do not know him . '' 
`` That is another man I have discovered , with a genius for buying . 
This Forant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls , 200,000 pounds of powder , twelve cargoes of Northern timber , matches , grenades , pitch , tar - I know not what ! 
with a saving of seven per cent upon what all those articles would cost me fabricated in France . '' 
`` That is a capital and quaint idea , '' replied D'Artagnan , `` to have Dutch cannon-balls cast which will return to the Dutch . '' 
`` Is it not , with loss , too ? '' 
And Colbert laughed aloud . 
He was delighted with his own joke . 
`` Still further , '' added he , `` these same Dutch are building for the king , at this moment , six vessels after the model of the best of their name . 
Destouches - Ah ! 
perhaps you do n't know Destouches ? '' 
`` No , monsieur . '' 
`` He is a man who has a sure glance to discern , when a ship is launched , what are the defects and qualities of that ship - that is valuable , observe ! 
Nature is truly whimsical . 
Well , this Destouches appeared to me to be a man likely to prove useful in marine affairs , and he is superintending the construction of six vessels of seventy-eight guns , which the Provinces are building for his majesty . 
It results from this , my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan , that the king , if he wished to quarrel with the Provinces , would have a very pretty fleet . 
Now , you know better than anybody else if the land army is efficient . '' 
D'Artagnan and Aramis looked at each other , wondering at the mysterious labors this man had undertaken in so short a time . 
Colbert understood them , and was touched by this best of flatteries . 
`` If we , in France , were ignorant of what was going on , '' said D'Artagnan , `` out of France still less must be known . '' 
`` That is why I told monsieur l'ambassadeur , '' said Colbert , `` that , Spain promising its neutrality , England helping us - '' `` If England assists you , '' said Aramis , `` I promise the neutrality of Spain . '' 
`` I take you at your word , '' Colbert hastened to reply with his blunt bonhomie . 
`` And , a propos of Spain , you have not the ` Golden Fleece , ' Monsieur d'Almeda . 
I heard the king say the other day that he should like to see you wear the grand cordon of St. Michael . '' 
Aramis bowed . 
`` Oh ! '' 
thought D'Artagnan , `` and Porthos is no longer here ! 
What ells of ribbons would there be for him in these largesses ! 
Dear Porthos ! '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' resumed Colbert , `` between us two , you will have , I wager , an inclination to lead your musketeers into Holland . 
Can you swim ? '' 
And he laughed like a man in high good humor . 
`` Like an eel , '' replied D'Artagnan . 
`` Ah ! 
but there are some bitter passages of canals and marshes yonder , Monsieur d'Artagnan , and the best swimmers are sometimes drowned there . '' 
`` It is my profession to die for his majesty , '' said the musketeer . 
`` Only , as it is seldom in war that much water is met with without a little fire , I declare to you beforehand , that I will do my best to choose fire . 
I am getting old ; water freezes me - but fire warms , Monsieur Colbert . '' 
And D'Artagnan looked so handsome still in quasi-juvenile strength as he pronounced these words , that Colbert , in his turn , could not help admiring him . 
D'Artagnan perceived the effect he had produced . 
He remembered that the best tradesman is he who fixes a high price upon his goods , when they are valuable . 
He prepared his price in advance . 
`` So , then , '' said Colbert , `` we go into Holland ? '' 
`` Yes , '' replied D'Artagnan ; `` only - '' `` Only ? '' 
said M. Colbert . 
`` Only , '' repeated D'Artagnan , `` there lurks in everything the question of interest , the question of self-love . 
It is a very fine title , that of captain of the musketeers ; but observe this : we have now the king 's guards and the military household of the king . 
A captain of musketeers ought to command all that , and then he would absorb a hundred thousand livres a year for expenses . ''
