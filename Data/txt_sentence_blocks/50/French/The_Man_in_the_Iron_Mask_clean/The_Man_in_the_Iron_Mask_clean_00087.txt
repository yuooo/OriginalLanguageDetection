`` Have you thought , '' continued Fouquet , becoming animated with that strength of talent which in a few seconds originates , and matures the conception of a plan , and with that largeness of view which foresees all consequences , and embraces every result at a glance - `` have you thought that we must assemble the nobility , the clergy , and the third estate of the realm ; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign , to disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father , to sacrifice the life , the honor of a woman , Anne of Austria , the life and peace of mind and heart of another woman , Maria Theresa ; and suppose that it were all done , if we were to succeed in doing it - '' `` I do not understand you , '' continued Aramis , coldly . 
`` There is not a single syllable of sense in all you have just said . '' 
`` What ! '' 
said the superintendent , surprised , `` a man like you refuse to view the practical bearing of the case ! 
Do you confine yourself to the childish delight of a political illusion , and neglect the chances of its being carried into execution ; in other words , the reality itself , is it possible ? '' 
`` My friend , '' said Aramis , emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful familiarity , `` what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for another ? '' 
`` Heaven ! '' 
exclaimed Fouquet - `` Heaven gives directions to its agent , who seizes upon the doomed victim , hurries him away , and seats the triumphant rival on the empty throne . 
But you forget that this agent is called death . 
Oh ! 
Monsieur d'Herblay , in Heaven 's name , tell me if you have had the idea - '' `` There is no question of that , monseigneur ; you are going beyond the object in view . 
Who spoke of Louis XIV . 
's death ? 
who spoke of adopting the example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution of its decrees ? 
No , I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its purposes without confusion or disturbance , without exciting comment or remark , without difficulty or exertion ; and that men , inspired by Heaven , succeed like Heaven itself , in all their undertakings , in all they attempt , in all they do . '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` I mean , my friend , '' returned Aramis , with the same intonation on the word friend that he had applied to it the first time - `` I mean that if there has been any confusion , scandal , and even effort in the substitution of the prisoner for the king , I defy you to prove it . '' 
`` What ! '' 
cried Fouquet , whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped his temples , `` what do you say ? '' 
`` Go to the king 's apartment , '' continued Aramis , tranquilly , `` and you who know the mystery , I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the Bastile is lying in his brother 's bed . '' 
`` But the king , '' stammered Fouquet , seized with horror at the intelligence . 
`` What king ? '' 
said Aramis , in his gentlest tone ; `` the one who hates you , or the one who likes you ? '' 
`` The king - of - yesterday . '' 
`` The king of yesterday ! 
be quite easy on that score ; he has gone to take the place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years . '' 
`` Great God ! 
And who took him there ? '' 
`` I. '' `` You ? '' 
`` Yes , and in the simplest way . 
I carried him away last night . 
While he was descending into midnight , the other was ascending into day . 
I do not think there has been any disturbance whatever . 
A flash of lightning without thunder awakens nobody . '' 
Fouquet uttered a thick , smothered cry , as if he had been struck by some invisible blow , and clasping his head between his clenched hands , he murmured : `` You did that ? '' 
`` Cleverly enough , too ; what do you think of it ? '' 
`` You dethroned the king ? 
imprisoned him , too ? '' 
`` Yes , that has been done . '' 
`` And such an action was committed here , at Vaux ? '' 
`` Yes , here , at Vaux , in the Chamber of Morpheus . 
It would almost seem that it had been built in anticipation of such an act . '' 
`` And at what time did it occur ? '' 
`` Last night , between twelve and one o'clock . '' 
Fouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon Aramis ; he restrained himself . 
`` At Vaux ; under my roof ! '' 
he said , in a half-strangled voice . 
`` I believe so ! 
for it is still your house , and it is likely to continue so , since M. Colbert can not rob you of it now . '' 
`` It was under my roof , then , monsieur , that you committed this crime ? ''
