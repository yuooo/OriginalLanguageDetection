`` Two old friends ! '' 
said the duke , shaking honest Grimaud 's shoulder after a vigorous fashion ; which was followed by another still more profound and delighted bow from Grimaud . 
`` But what is this , count , only one glass ? '' 
`` I should not think of drinking with your highness , unless your highness permitted me , '' replied Athos , with noble humility . 
`` Cordieu ! 
you were right to bring only one glass , we will both drink out of it , like two brothers in arms . 
Begin , count . '' 
`` Do me the honor , '' said Athos , gently putting back the glass . 
`` You are a charming friend , '' replied the Duc de Beaufort , who drank , and passed the goblet to his companion . 
`` But that is not all , '' continued he , `` I am still thirsty , and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man who stands here . 
I carry good luck with me , vicomte , '' said he to Raoul ; `` wish for something while drinking out of my glass , and may the black plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass ! '' 
He held the goblet to Raoul , who hastily moistened his lips , and replied with the same promptitude : `` I have wished for something , monseigneur . '' 
His eyes sparkled with a gloomy fire , and the blood mounted to his cheeks ; he terrified Athos , if only with his smile . 
`` And what have you wished for ? '' 
replied the duke , sinking back into his fauteuil , whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud , and with the other gave him a purse . 
`` Will you promise me , monseigneur , to grant me what I wish for ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
That is agreed upon . '' 
`` I wished , monsieur le duc , to go with you to Gigelli . '' 
Athos became pale , and was unable to conceal his agitation . 
The duke looked at his friend , as if desirous to assist him to parry this unexpected blow . 
`` That is difficult , my dear vicomte , very difficult , '' added he , in a lower tone of voice . 
`` Pardon me , monseigneur , I have been indiscreet , '' replied Raoul , in a firm voice ; `` but as you yourself invited me to wish - '' `` To wish to leave me ? '' 
said Athos . 
`` Oh ! 
monsieur - can you imagine - '' `` Well , mordieu ! '' 
cried the duke , `` the young vicomte is right ! 
What can he do here ? 
He will go moldy with grief . '' 
Raoul blushed , and the excitable prince continued : `` War is a distraction : we gain everything by it ; we can only lose one thing by it - life - then so much the worse ! '' 
`` That is to say , memory , '' said Raoul , eagerly ; `` and that is to say , so much the better ! '' 
He repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open the window ; which was , doubtless , to conceal his emotion . 
Raoul sprang towards the comte , but the latter had already overcome his emotion , and turned to the lights with a serene and impassible countenance . 
`` Well , come , '' said the duke , `` let us see ! 
Shall he go , or shall he not ? 
If he goes , comte , he shall be my aide-de-camp , my son . '' 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Raoul , bending his knee . 
`` Monseigneur ! '' 
cried Athos , taking the hand of the duke ; `` Raoul shall do just as he likes . '' 
`` Oh ! 
no , monsieur , just as you like , '' interrupted the young man . 
`` Par la corbleu ! '' 
said the prince in his turn , `` it is neither the comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way , it is I. I will take him away . 
The marine offers a superb fortune , my friend . '' 
Raoul smiled again so sadly , that this time Athos felt his heart penetrated by it , and replied to him by a severe look . 
Raoul comprehended it all ; he recovered his calmness , and was so guarded , that not another word escaped him . 
The duke at length rose , on observing the advanced hour , and said , with animation , `` I am in great haste , but if I am told I have lost time in talking with a friend , I will reply I have gained - on the balance - a most excellent recruit . '' 
`` Pardon me , monsieur le duc , '' interrupted Raoul , `` do not tell the king so , for it is not the king I wish to serve . '' 
`` Eh !
