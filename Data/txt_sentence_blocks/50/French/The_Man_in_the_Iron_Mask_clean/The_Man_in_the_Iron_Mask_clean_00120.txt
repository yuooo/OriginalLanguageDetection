`` Come hither , comte ; come hither , vicomte . '' 
Athos tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate . 
`` Ah ! 
step over , step over ! '' 
said the duke , offering a full glass to Athos . 
The latter drank it ; Raoul scarcely moistened his lips . 
`` Here is your commission , '' said the prince to Raoul . 
`` I had prepared it , reckoning upon you . 
You will go before me as far as Antibes . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Here is the order . '' 
And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order . 
`` Do you know anything of the sea ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; I have traveled with M. le Prince . '' 
`` That is well . 
All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to form an escort and carry my provisions . 
The army must be prepared to embark in a fortnight at the very latest . '' 
`` That shall be done , monseigneur . '' 
`` The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles along the coast ; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may want for me . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur le duc . '' 
`` And you are an active man , and will work freely , you will spend much money . '' 
`` I hope not , monseigneur . '' 
`` But I am sure you will . 
My intendant has prepared the orders of a thousand livres , drawn upon the cities of the south ; he will give you a hundred of them . 
Now , dear vicomte , be gone . '' 
Athos interrupted the prince . 
`` Keep your money , monseigneur ; war is to be waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead . '' 
`` I wish to try the contrary , '' replied the duke ; `` and then you are acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition - plenty of noise , plenty of fire , and , if so it must be , I shall disappear in the smoke . '' 
Having spoken thus , M. de Beaufort began to laugh ; but his mirth was not reciprocated by Athos and Raoul . 
He perceived this at once . 
`` Ah , '' said he , with the courteous egotism of his rank and age , `` you are such people as a man should not see after dinner ; you are cold , stiff , and dry when I am all fire , suppleness , and wine . 
No , devil take me ! 
I should always see you fasting , vicomte , and you , comte , if you wear such a face as that , you shall see me no more . '' 
He said this , pressing the hand of Athos , who replied with a smile , `` Monseigneur , do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty of money . 
I predict that within a month you will be dry , stiff , and cold , in presence of your strong-box , and that then , having Raoul at your elbow , fasting , you will be surprised to see him gay , animated , and generous , because he will have some new crowns to offer you . '' 
`` God grant it may be so ! '' 
cried the delighted duke . 
`` Comte , stay with me ! '' 
`` No , I shall go with Raoul ; the mission with which you charge him is a troublesome and difficult one . 
Alone it would be too much for him to execute . 
You do not observe , monseigneur , you have given him command of the first order . '' 
`` Bah ! '' 
`` And in your naval arrangements , too . '' 
`` That may be true . 
But one finds that such fine young fellows as your son generally do all that is required of them . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and intelligence , so much real bravery , as in Raoul ; but if he failed to arrange your embarkation , you would only meet the fate that you deserve . '' 
`` Humph ! 
you are scolding me , then . '' 
`` Monseigneur , to provision a fleet , to assemble a flotilla , to enroll your maritime force , would take an admiral a year . 
Raoul is a cavalry officer , and you allow him a fortnight ! ''
