`` Then , this good M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Yes - Moliere - you are right . 
You will see now , my dear friend , that I shall recollect his name quite well . 
This excellent M. Moliere set to work tracing out lines on the mirror , with a piece of Spanish chalk , following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders , all the while expounding this maxim , which I thought admirable : ` It is advisable that a dress should not incommode its wearer . ' '' 
`` In reality , '' said D'Artagnan , `` that is an excellent maxim , which is , unfortunately , seldom carried out in practice . '' 
`` That is why I found it all the more astonishing , when he expatiated upon it . '' 
`` Ah ! 
he expatiated ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! '' 
`` Let me hear his theory . '' '' 
` Seeing that , ' he continued , ` one may , in awkward circumstances , or in a troublesome position , have one 's doublet on one 's shoulder , and not desire to take one 's doublet off - ' '' `` True , '' said D'Artagnan . '' 
` And so , ' continued M. Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Moliere , yes . 
` And so , ' went on M. Moliere , ` you want to draw your sword , monsieur , and you have your doublet on your back . 
What do you do ? ' '' ' 
I take it off , ' I answered . '' 
` Well , no , ' he replied . '' 
` How no ? ' '' ' 
I say that the dress should be so well made , that it will in no way encumber you , even in drawing your sword . ' '' 
` Ah , ah ! ' '' 
` Throw yourself on guard , ' pursued he . 
`` I did it with such wondrous firmness , that two panes of glass burst out of the window . '' '' 
Tis nothing , nothing , ' said he . 
` Keep your position . ' 
`` I raised my left arm in the air , the forearm gracefully bent , the ruffle drooping , and my wrist curved , while my right arm , half extended , securely covered my wrist with the elbow , and my breast with the wrist . '' 
`` Yes , '' said D'Artagnan , '' 't is the true guard - the academic guard . '' 
`` You have said the very word , dear friend . 
In the meanwhile , Voliere - '' `` Moliere . '' 
`` Hold ! 
I should certainly , after all , prefer to call him - what did you say his other name was ? '' 
`` Poquelin . '' 
`` I prefer to call him Poquelin . '' 
`` And how will you remember this name better than the other ? '' 
`` You understand , he calls himself Poquelin , does he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard . '' 
`` Good . '' 
`` And change Coc into Poc , nard into lin ; and instead of Coquenard I shall have Poquelin . '' '' 
'T is wonderful , '' cried D'Artagnan , astounded . 
`` Go on , my friend , I am listening to you with admiration . '' 
`` This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass . '' 
`` I beg your pardon - Poquelin . '' 
`` What did I say , then ? '' 
`` You said Coquelin . '' 
`` Ah ! 
true . 
This Poquelin , then , sketched my arm on the glass ; but he took his time over it ; he kept looking at me a good deal . 
The fact is , that I must have been looking particularly handsome . '' '' 
` Does it weary you ? ' 
he asked . '' '
