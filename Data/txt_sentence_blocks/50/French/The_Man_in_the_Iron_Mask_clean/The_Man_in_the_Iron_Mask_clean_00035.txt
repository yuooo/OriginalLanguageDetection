But I do more than love M. de la Fere , dear Baisemeaux ; I venerate him . '' 
`` Well , for my part , though 't is singular , '' said the governor , `` I prefer M. d'Artagnan to him . 
There is a man for you , who drinks long and well ! 
That kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts . '' 
`` Baisemeaux , make me tipsy to-night ; let us have a merry time of it as of old , and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart , I promise you , you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your glass . '' 
`` Bravo ! '' 
said Baisemeaux , and he poured out a great glass of wine and drank it off at a draught , trembling with joy at the idea of being , by hook or by crook , in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor . 
While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was noting the sounds in the great court . 
A courier came in about eight o'clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle , and , although the courier made a great noise , Baisemeaux heard nothing . 
`` The devil take him , '' said Aramis . 
`` What ! 
who ? '' 
asked Baisemeaux . 
`` I hope 't is neither the wine you drank nor he who is the cause of your drinking it . '' 
`` No ; it is a horse , who is making noise enough in the court for a whole squadron . '' 
`` Pooh ! 
some courier or other , '' replied the governor , redoubling his attention to the passing bottle . 
`` Yes ; and may the devil take him , and so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more . 
Hurrah ! 
hurrah ! '' 
`` You forget me , Baisemeaux ! 
my glass is empty , '' said Aramis , lifting his dazzling Venetian goblet . 
`` Upon my honor , you delight me . 
Francois , wine ! '' 
Francois entered . 
`` Wine , fellow ! 
and better . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , yes ; but a courier has just arrived . '' 
`` Let him go to the devil , I say . '' 
`` Yes , monsieur , but - '' `` Let him leave his news at the office ; we will see to it to-morrow . 
To - morrow , there will be time to-morrow ; there will be daylight , '' said Baisemeaux , chanting the words . 
`` Ah , monsieur , '' grumbled the soldier Francois , in spite of himself , `` monsieur . '' 
`` Take care , '' said Aramis , `` take care ! '' 
`` Of what ? 
dear M. d'Herblay , '' said Baisemeaux , half intoxicated . 
`` The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is sometimes an order . '' 
`` Nearly always . '' 
`` Do not orders issue from the ministers ? '' 
`` Yes , undoubtedly ; but - '' `` And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the king ? '' 
`` Perhaps you are right . 
Nevertheless , 't is very tiresome when you are sitting before a good table , tete-a-tete with a friend - Ah ! 
I beg your pardon , monsieur ; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper , and that I speak to a future cardinal . '' 
`` Let us pass over that , dear Baisemeaux , and return to our soldier , to Francois . '' 
`` Well , and what has Francois done ? '' 
`` He has demurred ! '' 
`` He was wrong , then ? '' 
`` However , he has demurred , you see ; 't is because there is something extraordinary in this matter . 
It is very possible that it was not Francois who was wrong in demurring , but you , who are in the wrong in not listening to him . '' 
`` Wrong ? 
I to be wrong before Francois ?
