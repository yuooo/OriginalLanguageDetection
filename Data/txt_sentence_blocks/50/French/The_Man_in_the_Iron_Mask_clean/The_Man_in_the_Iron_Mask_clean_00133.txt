`` My dear Raoul , your words do me good . 
They prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come . '' 
`` I shall only act for you , monsieur . '' 
`` Raoul , what I have never hitherto done with respect to you , I will henceforward do . 
I will be your friend , not your father . 
We will live in expanding ourselves , instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners , when you come back . 
And that will be soon , will it not ? '' 
`` Certainly , monsieur , for such an expedition can not last long . '' 
`` Soon , then , Raoul , soon , instead of living moderately on my income , I will give you the capital of my estates . 
It will suffice for launching you into the world till my death ; and you will give me , I hope , before that time , the consolation of not seeing my race extinct . '' 
`` I will do all you may command , '' said Raoul , much agitated . 
`` It is not necessary , Raoul , that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into too hazardous enterprises . 
You have gone through your ordeal ; you are known to be a true man under fire . 
Remember that war with Arabs is a war of snares , ambuscades , and assassinations . '' 
`` So it is said , monsieur . '' 
`` There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade . 
It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of foresight . 
Often , indeed , he who falls in one meets with but little pity . 
Those who are not pitied , Raoul , have died to little purpose . 
Still further , the conqueror laughs , and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults . 
Do you clearly understand what I am saying to you , Raoul ? 
God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters . '' 
`` I am naturally prudent , monsieur , and I have very good fortune , '' said Raoul , with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father ; `` for , '' the young man hastened to add , `` in twenty combats through which I have been , I have only received one scratch . '' 
`` There is in addition , '' said Athos , `` the climate to be dreaded : that is an ugly end , to die of fever ! 
King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague , rather than the fever . '' 
`` Oh , monsieur ! 
with sobriety , with reasonable exercise - '' `` I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France . 
You , as his aide - de-camp , will be charged with expediting them , and will be sure not to forget me . '' 
`` No , monsieur , '' said Raoul , almost choked with emotion . 
`` Besides , Raoul , as you are a good Christian , and I am one also , we ought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian angels . 
Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you , on any occasion , you will think of me at once . '' 
`` First and at once ! 
Oh ! 
yes , monsieur . '' 
`` And will call upon me ? '' 
`` Instantly . '' 
`` You dream of me sometimes , do you not , Raoul ? '' 
`` Every night , monsieur . 
During my early youth I saw you in my dreams , calm and mild , with one hand stretched out over my head , and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - formerly . '' 
`` We love each other too dearly , '' said the comte , `` that from this moment , in which we separate , a portion of both our souls should not travel with one and the other of us , and should not dwell wherever we may dwell . 
Whenever you may be sad , Raoul , I feel that my heart will be dissolved in sadness ; and when you smile on thinking of me , be assured you will send me , from however remote a distance , a vital scintillation of your joy . '' 
`` I will not promise you to be joyous , '' replied the young man ; `` but you may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you , not one hour , I swear , unless I shall be dead . '' 
Athos could contain himself no longer ; he threw his arm round the neck of his son , and held him embraced with all the power of his heart . 
The moon began to be now eclipsed by twilight ; a golden band surrounded the horizon , announcing the approach of the day . 
Athos threw his cloak over the shoulders of Raoul , and led him back to the city , where burdens and porters were already in motion , like a vast ant-hill . 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting , they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards , as if in indecision or ashamed to be seen . 
It was Grimaud , who in his anxiety had tracked his master , and was there awaiting him . 
`` Oh ! 
my good Grimaud , '' cried Raoul , `` what do you want ? 
You are come to tell us it is time to be gone , have you not ? ''
