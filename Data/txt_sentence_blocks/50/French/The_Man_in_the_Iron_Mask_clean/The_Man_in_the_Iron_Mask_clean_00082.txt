`` I am going with you , '' said the bishop . 
`` Where to ? '' 
`` To M. Fouquet ; I wish to be a witness of his delight . '' 
`` Ah ! 
Aramis , how you puzzled me just now ! '' 
said D'Artagnan again . 
`` But you understand now , I suppose ? '' 
`` Of course I understand , '' he said aloud ; but added in a low tone to himself , almost hissing the words between his teeth , `` No , no , I do not understand yet . 
But it is all the same , for here is the order for it . '' 
And then he added , `` I will lead the way , monseigneur , '' and he conducted Aramis to Fouquet 's apartments . 
: The King 's Friend . 
Fouquet was waiting with anxiety ; he had already sent away many of his servants and friends , who , anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary receptions , had called at his door to inquire after him . 
Preserving the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair above his head , he only asked them , as he did every one , indeed , who came to the door , where Aramis was . 
When he saw D'Artagnan return , and when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him , he could hardly restrain his delight ; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness . 
The mere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest . 
The prelate was silent and grave ; D'Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of events . 
`` Well , captain , so you have brought M. d'Herblay to me . '' 
`` And something better still , monseigneur . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` Liberty . '' 
`` I am free ! '' 
`` Yes ; by the king 's order . '' 
Fouquet resumed his usual serenity , that he might interrogate Aramis with a look . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , you can thank M. l'eveque de Vannes , '' pursued D'Artagnan , `` for it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the king . '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Fouquet , more humiliated at the service than grateful at its success . 
`` But you , '' continued D'Artagnan , addressing Aramis - `` you , who have become M. Fouquet 's protector and patron , can you not do something for me ? '' 
`` Anything in the wide world you like , my friend , '' replied the bishop , in his calmest tones . 
`` One thing only , then , and I shall be perfectly satisfied . 
How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king , you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life ? '' 
`` From a friend such as you are , '' said Aramis , `` I can not conceal anything . '' 
`` Ah ! 
very good , tell me , then . '' 
`` Very well . 
You think that I have seen the king only twice , whilst the fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times ; only we have kept it very secret , that is all . '' 
And without trying to remove the color which at this revelation made D'Artagnan 's face flush scarlet , Aramis turned towards M. Fouquet , who was as much surprised as the musketeer . 
`` Monseigneur , '' he resumed , `` the king desires me to inform you that he is more than ever your friend , and that your beautiful fete , so generously offered by you on his behalf , has touched him to the very heart . '' 
And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner , that the latter , incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so prodigious a character , remained incapable of uttering a single syllable , and equally incapable of thought or movement . 
D'Artagnan fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to each other , and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door , when he feels his presence is an inconvenience for others ; but his eager curiosity , spurred on by so many mysteries , counseled him to remain . 
Aramis thereupon turned towards him , and said , in a quiet tone , `` You will not forget , my friend , the king 's order respecting those whom he intends to receive this morning on rising . '' 
These words were clear enough , and the musketeer understood them ; he therefore bowed to Fouquet , and then to Aramis , - to the latter with a slight admixture of ironical respect , - and disappeared . 
No sooner had he left , than Fouquet , whose impatience had hardly been able to wait for that moment , darted towards the door to close it , and then returning to the bishop , he said , `` My dear D'Herblay , I think it now high time you should explain all that has passed , for , in plain and honest truth , I do not understand anything . '' 
`` We will explain all that to you , '' said Aramis , sitting down , and making Fouquet sit down also . 
`` Where shall I begin ? '' 
`` With this first of all . 
Why does the king set me at liberty ? '' 
`` You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you arrested . '' 
`` Since my arrest , I have had time to think over it , and my idea is that it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy . 
My fete put M. Colbert out of temper , and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint against me ; Belle-Isle , for instance . ''
