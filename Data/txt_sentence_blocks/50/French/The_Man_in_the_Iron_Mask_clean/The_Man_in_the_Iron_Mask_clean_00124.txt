cried the captain to the soldiers . 
`` I was sure I could not be mistaken ! '' 
`` What is the meaning of this ? '' 
asked Athos . 
`` What ! 
were we to be shot without warning ? '' 
`` It was I who was going to shoot you , and if the governor missed you , I should not have missed you , my dear friends . 
How fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim , instead of firing at the instant I raise my weapon ! 
I thought I recognized you . 
Ah ! 
my dear friends , how fortunate ! '' 
And D'Artagnan wiped his brow , for he had run fast , and emotion with him was not feigned . 
`` How ! '' 
said Athos . 
`` And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of the fortress ? '' 
`` In person . '' 
`` And why did he fire at us ? 
What have we done to him ? '' 
`` Pardieu ! 
You received what the prisoner threw to you ? '' 
`` That is true . '' 
`` That plate - the prisoner has written something on it , has he not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` Good heavens ! 
I was afraid he had . '' 
And D'Artagnan , with all the marks of mortal disquietude , seized the plate , to read the inscription . 
When he had read it , a fearful pallor spread across his countenance . 
`` Oh ! 
good heavens ! '' 
repeated he . 
`` Silence ! 
- Here is the governor . '' 
`` And what will he do to us ? 
Is it our fault ? '' 
`` It is true , then ? '' 
said Athos , in a subdued voice . 
`` It is true ? '' 
`` Silence ! 
I tell you - silence ! 
If he only believes you can read ; if he only suspects you have understood ; I love you , my dear friends , I would willingly be killed for you , but - '' `` But - '' said Athos and Raoul . 
`` But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from death . 
Silence , then ! 
Silence again ! '' 
The governor came up , having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge . 
`` Well ! '' 
said he to D'Artagnan , `` what stops us ? '' 
`` You are Spaniards - you do not understand a word of French , '' said the captain , eagerly , to his friends in a low voice . 
`` Well ! '' 
replied he , addressing the governor , `` I was right ; these gentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres , last year ; they do n't know a word of French . '' 
`` Ah ! ''
