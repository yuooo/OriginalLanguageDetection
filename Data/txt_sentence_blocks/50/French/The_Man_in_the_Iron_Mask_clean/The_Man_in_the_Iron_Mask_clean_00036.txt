that seems rather hard . '' 
`` Pardon me , merely an irregularity . 
But I thought it my duty to make an observation which I deem important . '' 
`` Oh ! 
perhaps you are right , '' stammered Baisemeaux . 
`` The king 's order is sacred ; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper , I repeat that the devil - '' `` If you had said as much to the great cardinal - hem ! 
my dear Baisemeaux , and if his order had any importance . '' 
`` I do it that I may not disturb a bishop . 
Mordioux ! 
am I not , then , excusable ? '' 
`` Do not forget , Baisemeaux , that I have worn the soldier 's coat , and I am accustomed to obedience everywhere . '' 
`` You wish , then - '' `` I wish that you would do your duty , my friend ; yes , at least before this soldier . '' '' 
'T is mathematically true , '' exclaimed Baisemeaux . 
Francois still waited : `` Let them send this order of the king 's up to me , '' he repeated , recovering himself . 
And he added in a low tone , `` Do you know what it is ? 
I will tell you something about as interesting as this . 
` Beware of fire near the powder magazine ; ' or , ` Look close after such and such a one , who is clever at escaping , ' Ah ! 
if you only knew , monseigneur , how many times I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest , deepest slumber , by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me , or rather , bring me a slip of paper containing these words : ` Monsieur de Baisemeaux , what news ? ' 
'T is clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile . 
They would know better ; they have never considered the thickness of my walls , the vigilance of my officers , the number of rounds we go . 
But , indeed , what can you expect , monseigneur ? 
It is their business to write and torment me when I am at rest , and to trouble me when I am happy , '' added Baisemeaux , bowing to Aramis . 
`` Then let them do their business . '' 
`` And do you do yours , '' added the bishop , smiling . 
Francois re-entered ; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister 's order . 
He slowly undid it , and as slowly read it . 
Aramis pretended to be drinking , so as to be able to watch his host through the glass . 
Then , Baisemeaux , having read it : `` What was I just saying ? '' 
he exclaimed . 
`` What is it ? '' 
asked the bishop . 
`` An order of release ! 
There , now ; excellent news indeed to disturb us ! '' 
`` Excellent news for him whom it concerns , you will at least agree , my dear governor ! '' 
`` And at eight o'clock in the evening ! '' 
`` It is charitable ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
charity is all very well , but it is for that fellow who says he is so weary and tired , but not for me who am amusing myself , '' said Baisemeaux , exasperated . 
`` Will you lose by him , then ? 
And is the prisoner who is to be set at liberty a good payer ? '' 
`` Oh , yes , indeed ! 
a miserable , five-franc rat ! '' 
`` Let me see it , '' asked M. d'Herblay . 
`` It is no indiscretion ? '' 
`` By no means ; read it . '' 
`` There is ` Urgent , ' on the paper ; you have seen that , I suppose ? '' 
`` Oh , admirable ! 
` Urgent ! ' 
- a man who has been there ten years ! 
It is urgent to set him free to-day , this very evening , at eight o'clock !
