he cried . 
`` How impossible ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Give me a glimpse of this impossibility . '' '' 
'T is impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour . 
Where can he go to , a man so unacquainted with Paris ? '' 
`` He will find a place wherever he can . '' 
`` You see , now , one might as well set a blind man free ! '' 
`` I have a carriage , and will take him wherever he wishes . '' 
`` You have an answer for everything . 
Francois , tell monsieur le major to go and open the cell of M. Seldon , No. 3 , Bertaudiere . '' 
`` Seldon ! '' 
exclaimed Aramis , very naturally . 
`` You said Seldon , I think ? '' 
`` I said Seldon , of course . 
'T is the name of the man they set free . '' 
`` Oh ! 
you mean to say Marchiali ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` Marchiali ? 
oh ! 
yes , indeed . 
No , no , Seldon . '' 
`` I think you are making a mistake , Monsieur Baisemeaux . '' 
`` I have read the order . '' 
`` And I also . '' 
`` And I saw ` Seldon ' in letters as large as that , '' and Baisemeaux held up his finger . 
`` And I read ` Marchiali ' in characters as large as this , '' said Aramis , also holding up two fingers . 
`` To the proof ; let us throw a light on the matter , '' said Baisemeaux , confident he was right . 
`` There is the paper , you have only to read it . '' 
`` I read ` Marchiali , ' '' returned Aramis , spreading out the paper . 
`` Look . '' 
Baisemeaux looked , and his arms dropped suddenly . 
`` Yes , yes , '' he said , quite overwhelmed ; `` yes , Marchiali . 
'T is plainly written Marchiali ! 
Quite true ! '' 
`` Ah ! 
- '' `` How ? 
the man of whom we have talked so much ? 
The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of ? '' 
`` There is ` Marchiali , ' '' repeated the inflexible Aramis . 
`` I must own it , monseigneur . 
But I understand nothing about it . '' 
`` You believe your eyes , at any rate . '' 
`` To tell me very plainly there is ` Marchiali . ' '' 
`` And in a good handwriting , too . '' '' 
'T is a wonder ! 
I still see this order and the name of Seldon , Irishman . 
I see it . 
Ah !
