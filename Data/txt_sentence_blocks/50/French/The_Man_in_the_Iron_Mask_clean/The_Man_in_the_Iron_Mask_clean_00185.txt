`` Go on , then , Aramis ; go on - go first ; you impersonate wisdom and foresight ; go . 
Ah ! 
there is that fatigue again , of which I spoke to you . 
It has just seized me afresh . '' 
Aramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto , and bowing his head , he penetrated into the interior of the cavern , imitating the cry of the owl . 
A little plaintive cooing , a scarcely distinct echo , replied from the depths of the cave . 
Aramis pursued his way cautiously , and soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered , within ten paces of him . 
`` Are you there , Yves ? '' 
said the bishop . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; Goenne is here likewise . 
His son accompanies us . '' 
`` That is well . 
Are all things ready ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` Go to the entrance of the grottoes , my good Yves , and you will there find the Seigneur de Pierrefonds , who is resting after the fatigue of our journey . 
And if he should happen not to be able to walk , lift him up , and bring him hither to me . '' 
The three men obeyed . 
But the recommendation given to his servants was superfluous . 
Porthos , refreshed , had already commenced the descent , and his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities , formed and supported by columns of porphyry and granite . 
As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had rejoined the bishop , the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were furnished , and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again as ever . 
`` Let us inspect the boat , '' said Aramis , `` and satisfy ourselves at once what it will hold . '' 
`` Do not go too near with the light , '' said the patron Yves ; `` for as you desired me , monseigneur , I have placed under the bench of the poop , in the coffer you know of , the barrel of powder , and the musket-charges that you sent me from the fort . '' 
`` Very well , '' said Aramis ; and , taking the lantern himself , he examined minutely all parts of the canoe , with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger . 
The canoe was long , light , drawing little water , thin of keel ; in short , one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle ; a little high in its sides , solid upon the water , very manageable , furnished with planks which , in uncertain weather , formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide , so as to protect the rowers . 
In two well-closed coffers , placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop , Aramis found bread , biscuit , dried fruits , a quarter of bacon , a good provision of water in leathern bottles ; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit the coast , and would be able to revictual , if necessity commanded . 
The arms , eight muskets , and as many horse-pistols , were in good condition , and all loaded . 
There were additional oars , in case of accident , and that little sail called trinquet , which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row , and is so useful when the breeze is slack . 
When Aramis had seen to all these things , and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection , `` Let us consult Porthos , '' said he , `` to know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto , following the descent and the shade of the cavern , or whether it be better , in the open air , to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes , leveling the road of the little beach , which is but twenty feet high , and gives , at high tide , three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom . '' 
`` It must be as you please , monseigneur , '' replied the skipper Yves , respectfully ; `` but I do n't believe that by the slope of the cavern , and in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat , the road will be so convenient as the open air . 
I know the beach well , and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden ; the interior of the grotto , on the contrary , is rough ; without reckoning , monseigneur , that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea , and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it . '' 
`` I have made my calculation , '' said the bishop , `` and I am certain it will pass . '' 
`` So be it ; I wish it may , monseigneur , '' continued Yves ; `` but your highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench , there is an enormous stone to be lifted - that under which the fox always passes , and which closes the trench like a door . '' 
`` It can be raised , '' said Porthos ; `` that is nothing . '' 
`` Oh ! 
I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men , '' replied Yves ; `` but that is giving him a great deal of trouble . '' 
`` I think the skipper may be right , '' said Aramis ; `` let us try the open-air passage . '' 
`` The more so , monseigneur , '' continued the fisherman , `` that we should not be able to embark before day , it will require so much labor , and that as soon as daylight appears , a good vedette placed outside the grotto would be necessary , indispensable even , to watch the maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us . '' 
`` Yes , yes , Yves , your reasons are good ; we will go by the beach . '' 
And the three robust Bretons went to the boat , and were beginning to place their rollers underneath it to put it in motion , when the distant barking of dogs was heard , proceeding from the interior of the island . 
Aramis darted out of the grotto , followed by Porthos . 
Dawn just tinted with purple and white the waves and plain ; through the dim light , melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles , and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering fields of buckwheat . 
In a quarter of an hour it would be clear daylight ; the wakened birds announced it to all nature . 
The barkings which had been heard , which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat , and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern , now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league of the grotto . 
`` It is a pack of hounds , '' said Porthos ; `` the dogs are on a scent . '' 
`` Who can be hunting at such a moment as this ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` And this way , particularly , '' continued Porthos , `` where they might expect the army of the royalists . '' 
`` The noise comes nearer . 
Yes , you are right , Porthos , the dogs are on a scent . 
But , Yves ! ''
