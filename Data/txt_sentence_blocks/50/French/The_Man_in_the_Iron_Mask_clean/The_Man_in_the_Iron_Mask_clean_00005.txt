`` Yes . '' 
`` Do you know who this lady was ? '' 
The light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner 's eyes . 
`` I am aware that she was one of the ladies of the court , '' he said . 
`` You remember that lady well , do you not ? '' 
`` Oh , my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head , '' said the young prisoner . 
`` I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five years old . 
I saw her once with you , and with the lady dressed in black . 
I have seen her twice since then with the same person . 
These four people , with my master , and old Perronnette , my jailer , and the governor of the prison , are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken , and , indeed , almost the only persons I have ever seen . '' 
`` Then you were in prison ? '' 
`` If I am a prisoner here , then I was comparatively free , although in a very narrow sense - a house I never quitted , a garden surrounded with walls I could not climb , these constituted my residence , but you know it , as you have been there . 
In a word , being accustomed to live within these bounds , I never cared to leave them . 
And so you will understand , monsieur , that having never seen anything of the world , I have nothing left to care for ; and therefore , if you relate anything , you will be obliged to explain each item to me as you go along . '' 
`` And I will do so , '' said Aramis , bowing ; `` for it is my duty , monseigneur . '' 
`` Well , then , begin by telling me who was my tutor . '' 
`` A worthy and , above all , an honorable gentleman , monseigneur ; fit guide for both body and soul . 
Had you ever any reason to complain of him ? '' 
`` Oh , no ; quite the contrary . 
But this gentleman of yours often used to tell me that my father and mother were dead . 
Did he deceive me , or did he speak the truth ? '' 
`` He was compelled to comply with the orders given him . '' 
`` Then he lied ? '' 
`` In one respect . 
Your father is dead . '' 
`` And my mother ? '' 
`` She is dead for you . '' 
`` But then she lives for others , does she not ? '' 
`` Yes . '' 
`` And I - and I , then '' -LRB- the young man looked sharply at Aramis -RRB- `` am compelled to live in the obscurity of a prison ? '' 
`` Alas ! 
I fear so . '' 
`` And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation of a great secret ? '' 
`` Certainly , a very great secret . '' 
`` My enemy must indeed be powerful , to be able to shut up in the Bastile a child such as I then was . '' 
`` He is . '' 
`` More powerful than my mother , then ? '' 
`` And why do you ask that ? '' 
`` Because my mother would have taken my part . '' 
Aramis hesitated . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; more powerful than your mother . '' 
`` Seeing , then , that my nurse and preceptor were carried off , and that I , also , was separated from them - either they were , or I am , very dangerous to my enemy ? '' 
`` Yes ; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself , by causing the nurse and preceptor to disappear , '' answered Aramis , quietly . 
`` Disappear ! '' 
cried the prisoner , `` how did they disappear ? '' 
`` In a very sure way , '' answered Aramis - `` they are dead . '' 
The young man turned pale , and passed his hand tremblingly over his face . 
`` Poison ? '' 
he asked . 
`` Poison . ''
