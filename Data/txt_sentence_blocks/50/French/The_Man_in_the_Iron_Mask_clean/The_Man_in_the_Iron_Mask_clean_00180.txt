said Aramis . 
`` Well , having this weakness , my father insisted upon going down into the garden , instead of going to bed ; his foot slipped on the first stair , the staircase was steep ; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed . 
The hinge gashed his temple ; and he was stretched out dead upon the spot . '' 
Aramis raised his eyes to his friend : `` These are two extraordinary circumstances , '' said he ; `` let us not infer that there may succeed a third . 
It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious , my brave Porthos . 
Besides , when were your legs known to fail ? 
Never have you stood so firm , so haughtily ; why , you could carry a house on your shoulders . '' 
`` At this moment , '' said Porthos , `` I feel myself pretty active ; but at times I vacillate ; I sink ; and lately this phenomenon , as you say , has occurred four times . 
I will not say this frightens me , but it annoys me . 
Life is an agreeable thing . 
I have money ; I have fine estates ; I have horses that I love ; I have also friends that I love : D'Artagnan , Athos , Raoul , and you . '' 
The admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship . 
Aramis pressed his hand : `` We will still live many years , '' said he , `` to preserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men . 
Trust yourself to me , my friend ; we have no reply from D'Artagnan , that is a good sign . 
He must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the seas . 
On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria , which you know , where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes . '' 
`` Yes , and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way . '' 
`` Precisely . 
In case of misfortunes , a bark is to be concealed for us in that cavern ; indeed , it must be there by this time . 
We will wait for a favorable moment , and during the night we will go to sea ! '' 
`` That is a grand idea . 
What shall we gain by it ? '' 
`` We shall gain this - nobody knows that grotto , or rather its issue , except ourselves and two or three hunters of the island ; we shall gain this - that if the island is occupied , the scouts , seeing no bark upon the shore , will never imagine we can escape , and will cease to watch . '' 
`` I understand . '' 
`` Well ! 
that weakness in the legs ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
better , much , just now . '' 
`` You see , then , plainly , that everything conspires to give us quietude and hope . 
D'Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free . 
No royal fleet or descent to be dreaded . 
Vive Dieu ! 
Porthos , we have still half a century of magnificent adventure before us , and if I once touch Spanish ground , I swear to you , '' added the bishop with terrible energy , `` that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be . '' 
`` We live by hope , '' said Porthos , enlivened by the warmth of his companion . 
All at once a cry resounded in their ears : `` To arms ! 
to arms ! '' 
This cry , repeated by a hundred throats , piercing the chamber where the two friends were conversing , carried surprise to one , and uneasiness to the other . 
Aramis opened the window ; he saw a crowd of people running with flambeaux . 
Women were seeking places of safety , the armed population were hastening to their posts . 
`` The fleet ! 
the fleet ! '' 
cried a soldier , who recognized Aramis . 
`` The fleet ? '' 
repeated the latter . 
`` Within half cannon-shot , '' continued the soldier . 
`` To arms ! '' 
cried Aramis . 
`` To arms ! '' 
repeated Porthos , formidably . 
And both rushed forth towards the mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries .
