This sweat - bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe , as the gore of Abel frightened Cain . 
`` I am face to face with my destiny , '' said Philippe , his eyes on fire , and his face a livid white . 
`` Is it likely to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy ? 
Though I am compelled to follow out , at every moment , the sovereign power and authority I have usurped , shall I cease to listen to the scruples of my heart ? 
Yes ! 
the king has lain on this bed ; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this pillow ; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief : and yet , I hesitate to throw myself on the bed , or to press in my hand the handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother 's arms . 
Away with such weakness ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , who asserts that a man 's action should be always one degree above his thoughts ; let me imitate M. d'Herblay , whose thoughts are of and for himself alone , who regards himself as a man of honor , so long as he injures or betrays his enemies only . 
I , I alone , should have occupied this bed , if Louis XIV . 
had not , owing to my mother 's criminal abandonment , stood in my way ; and this handkerchief , embroidered with the arms of France , would in right and justice belong to me alone , if , as M. d'Herblay observes , I had been left my royal cradle . 
Philippe , son of France , take your place on that bed ; Philippe , sole king of France , resume the blazonry that is yours ! 
Philippe , sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII. , your father , show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who , at this moment , has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to submit to . '' 
With these words , Philippe , notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling , and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will , threw himself on the royal bed , and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis XIV . 
had lain , while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother 's tears . 
With his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow , Philippe perceived above him the crown of France , suspended , as we have stated , by angels with outspread golden wings . 
A man may be ambitious of lying in a lion 's den , but can hardly hope to sleep there quietly . 
Philippe listened attentively to every sound ; his heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror and misfortune ; but confident in his own strength , which was confirmed by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination , he waited until some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself . 
He hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him , like those phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle . 
But nothing approached . 
Silence , that mortal enemy of restless hearts , and of ambitious minds , shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night the future king of France , who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen crown . 
Towards the morning a shadow , rather than a body , glided into the royal chamber ; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any surprise . 
`` Well , M. d'Herblay ? '' 
`` Well , sire , all is accomplished . '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Exactly as we expected . '' 
`` Did he resist ? '' 
`` Terribly ! 
tears and entreaties . '' 
`` And then ? '' 
`` A perfect stupor . '' 
`` But at last ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
at last , a complete victory , and absolute silence . '' 
`` Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` The resemblance , however - '' `` Was the cause of the success . '' 
`` But the prisoner can not fail to explain himself . 
Think well of that . 
I have myself been able to do as much as that , on former occasion . '' 
`` I have already provided for every chance . 
In a few days , sooner if necessary , we will take the captive out of his prison , and will send him out of the country , to a place of exile so remote - '' `` People can return from their exile , Monsieur d'Herblay . '' 
`` To a place of exile so distant , I was going to say , that human strength and the duration of human life would not be enough for his return . '' 
Once more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the young king . 
`` And M. du Vallon ? '' 
asked Philippe in order to change the conversation . 
`` He will be presented to you to-day , and confidentially will congratulate you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run . '' 
`` What is to be done with him ? '' 
`` With M. du Vallon ? '' 
`` Yes ; confer a dukedom on him , I suppose . '' 
`` A dukedom , '' replied Aramis , smiling in a significant manner . 
`` Why do you laugh , Monsieur d'Herblay ? ''
