Baisemeaux gave him a pen . 
`` And a sheet of white paper , '' added Aramis . 
Baisemeaux handed him some paper . 
`` Now , I - I , also - I , here present - incontestably , I - am going to write an order to which I am certain you will give credence , incredulous as you are ! '' 
Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner . 
It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop 's , but just now so playful and gay , had become funereal and sad ; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of a mortuary chapel , the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood . 
Aramis took a pen and wrote . 
Baisemeaux , in terror , read over his shoulder . 
`` A. M. D. G. , '' wrote the bishop ; and he drew a cross under these four letters , which signify ad majorem Dei gloriam , `` to the greater glory of God ; '' and thus he continued : `` It is our pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun , governor , for the king , of the castle of the Bastile , be held by him good and effectual , and be immediately carried into operation . '' 
-LRB- Signed -RRB- D'HERBLAY `` General of the Order , by the grace of God . '' 
Baisemeaux was so profoundly astonished , that his features remained contracted , his lips parted , and his eyes fixed . 
He did not move an inch , nor articulate a sound . 
Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth , which was fluttering to its death about the candles . 
Aramis , without even deigning to look at the man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition , drew from his pocket a small case of black wax ; he sealed the letter , and stamped it with a seal suspended at his breast , beneath his doublet , and when the operation was concluded , presented - still in silence - the missive to M. de Baisemeaux . 
The latter , whose hands trembled in a manner to excite pity , turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter . 
A last gleam of feeling played over his features , and he fell , as if thunder-struck , on a chair . 
`` Come , come , '' said Aramis , after a long silence , during which the governor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses , `` do not lead me to believe , dear Baisemeaux , that the presence of the general of the order is as terrible as His , and that men die merely from having seen Him . 
Take courage , rouse yourself ; give me your hand - obey . '' 
Baisemeaux , reassured , if not satisfied , obeyed , kissed Aramis 's hand , and rose . 
`` Immediately ? '' 
he murmured . 
`` Oh , there is no pressing haste , my host ; take your place again , and do the honors over this beautiful dessert . '' 
`` Monseigneur , I shall never recover such a shock as this ; I who have laughed , who have jested with you ! 
I who have dared to treat you on a footing of equality ! '' 
`` Say nothing about it , old comrade , '' replied the bishop , who perceived how strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it ; `` say nothing about it . 
Let us each live in our own way ; to you , my protection and my friendship ; to me , your obedience . 
Having exactly fulfilled these two requirements , let us live happily . '' 
Baisemeaux reflected ; he perceived , at a glance , the consequence of this withdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order ; and , putting in the scale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general , did not consider it of any value . 
Aramis divined this . 
`` My dear Baisemeaux , '' said he , `` you are a simpleton . 
Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to think for you . '' 
And at another gesture he made , Baisemeaux bowed again . 
`` How shall I set about it ? '' 
he said . 
`` What is the process for releasing a prisoner ? '' 
`` I have the regulations . '' 
`` Well , then , follow the regulations , my friend . '' 
`` I go with my major to the prisoner 's room , and conduct him , if he is a personage of importance . '' 
`` But this Marchiali is not an important personage , '' said Aramis carelessly . 
`` I do n't know , '' answered the governor , as if he would have said , `` It is for you to instruct me . '' 
`` Then if you do n't know it , I am right ; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards one of obscure station . '' 
`` Good ; the regulations so provide . 
They are to the effect that the turnkey , or one of the lower officials , shall bring the prisoner before the governor , in the office . '' 
`` Well , 't is very wise , that ; and then ? '' 
`` Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his imprisonment , his clothes and papers , if the minister 's orders have not otherwise dictated . '' 
`` What was the minister 's order as to this Marchiali ? '' 
`` Nothing ; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels , without papers , and almost without clothes . '' 
`` See how simple , then , all is . 
Indeed , Baisemeaux , you make a mountain of everything . 
Remain here , and make them bring the prisoner to the governor 's house . ''
