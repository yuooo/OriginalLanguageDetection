`` Aramis ! '' 
`` No , no , Porthos , I conjure you , let me act . 
No false generosity ! 
No inopportune devotedness ! 
You knew nothing of my projects . 
You have done nothing of yourself . 
With me it is different . 
I alone am the author of this plot . 
I stood in need of my inseparable companion ; I called upon you , and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device , ` All for one , one for all . ' 
My crime is that I was an egotist . '' 
`` Now , that is a word I like , '' said Porthos ; `` and seeing that you have acted entirely for yourself , it is impossible for me to blame you . 
It is natural . '' 
And upon this sublime reflection , Porthos pressed his friend 's hand cordially . 
In presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul , Aramis felt his own littleness . 
It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before real superiority of heart , which is more imposing than brilliancy of mind . 
He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend . 
`` Now , '' said Porthos , `` that we have come to an explanation , now that I am perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV. , I think , my friend , it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of all this . '' 
`` D'Artagnan , my good Porthos , D'Artagnan is coming , and will detail it to you in all its circumstances ; but , excuse me , I am deeply grieved , I am bowed down with mental anguish , and I have need of all my presence of mind , all my powers of reflection , to extricate you from the false position in which I have so imprudently involved you ; but nothing can be more clear , nothing more plain , than your position , henceforth . 
The king Louis XIV . 
has no longer now but one enemy : that enemy is myself , myself alone . 
I have made you a prisoner , you have followed me , to-day I liberate you , you fly back to your prince . 
You can perceive , Porthos , there is not one difficulty in all this . '' 
`` Do you think so ? '' 
said Porthos . 
`` I am quite sure of it . '' 
`` Then why , '' said the admirable good sense of Porthos , `` then why , if we are in such an easy position , why , my friend , do we prepare cannon , muskets , and engines of all sorts ? 
It seems to me it would be much more simple to say to Captain d'Artagnan : ` My dear friend , we have been mistaken ; that error is to be repaired ; open the door to us , let us pass through , and we will say good-bye . ' '' 
`` Ah ! 
that ! '' 
said Aramis , shaking his head . 
`` Why do you say ` that ' ? 
Do you not approve of my plan , my friend ? '' 
`` I see a difficulty in it . '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` The hypothesis that D'Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us to defend ourselves . '' 
`` What ! 
defend ourselves against D'Artagnan ? 
Folly ! 
Against the good D'Artagnan ! '' 
Aramis once more replied by shaking his head . 
`` Porthos , '' at length said he , `` if I have had the matches lighted and the guns pointed , if I have had the signal of alarm sounded , if I have called every man to his post upon the ramparts , those good ramparts of Belle - Isle which you have so well fortified , it was not for nothing . 
Wait to judge ; or rather , no , do not wait - '' `` What can I do ? '' 
`` If I knew , my friend , I would have told you . '' 
`` But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves : - a boat , and away for France - where - '' `` My dear friend , '' said Aramis , smiling with a strong shade of sadness , `` do not let us reason like children ; let us be men in council and in execution . 
- But , hark ! 
I hear a hail for landing at the port . 
Attention , Porthos , serious attention ! '' 
`` It is D'Artagnan , no doubt , '' said Porthos , in a voice of thunder , approaching the parapet . 
`` Yes , it is I , '' replied the captain of the musketeers , running lightly up the steps of the mole , and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which his two friends waited for him . 
As soon as he came towards them , Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D'Artagnan , treading apparently in his very steps .
