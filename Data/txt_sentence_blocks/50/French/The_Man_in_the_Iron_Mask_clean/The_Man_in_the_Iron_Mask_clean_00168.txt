What I regret is certainly not the more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle : what I regret , Aramis , is Pierrefonds ; Bracieux ; le Vallon ; beautiful France ! 
Here , we are not in France , my dear friend ; we are - I know not where . 
Oh ! 
I tell you , in full sincerity of soul , and your affection will excuse my frankness , but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle . 
No ; in good truth , I am not happy ! '' 
Aramis breathed a long , but stifled sigh . 
`` Dear friend , '' replied he : `` that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago . 
If you had not sent them away , we would have departed . '' '' 
` Departed ! ' 
And the orders , Aramis ? '' 
`` What orders ? '' 
`` Parbleu ! 
Why , the orders you have been constantly , in and out of season , repeating to me - that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper . 
You know very well ! '' 
`` That is true ! '' 
murmured Aramis again . 
`` You see , then , plainly , my friend , that we could not depart ; and that the sending away of the boats in search of the others can not prove prejudicial to us in the very least . '' 
Aramis was silent ; and his vague glances , luminous as that of an albatross , hovered for a long time over the sea , interrogating space , seeking to pierce the very horizon . 
`` With all that , Aramis , '' continued Porthos , who adhered to his idea , and that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it , - `` with all that , you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these unfortunate boats . 
I am assailed by cries and complaints whichever way I go . 
The children cry to see the desolation of the women , as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers . 
What do you suppose , my friend , and how ought I to answer them ? '' 
`` Think all you like , my good Porthos , and say nothing . '' 
This reply did not satisfy Porthos at all . 
He turned away grumbling something in ill-humor . 
Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer . 
`` Do you remember , '' said he , in a melancholy tone , kneading the two hands of the giant between his own with affectionate cordiality , `` do you remember , my friend , that in the glorious days of youth - do you remember , Porthos , when we were all strong and valiant - we , and the other two - if we had then had an inclination to return to France , do you think this sheet of salt water would have stopped us ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` but six leagues . '' 
`` If you had seen me get astride of a plank , would you have remained on land , Porthos ? '' 
`` No , pardieu ! 
No , Aramis . 
But , nowadays , what sort of a plank should we want , my friend ! 
I , in particular . '' 
And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast a profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh . 
`` And do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little , and that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling - of your episcopal palace , at Vannes ? 
Come , confess . '' 
`` No , '' replied Aramis , without daring to look at Porthos . 
`` Let us stay where we are , then , '' said his friend , with a sigh , which , in spite of the efforts he made to restrain it , escaped his echoing breast . 
`` Let us remain ! 
- let us remain ! 
And yet , '' added he , `` and yet , if we seriously wished , but that decidedly - if we had a fixed idea , one firmly taken , to return to France , and there were not boats - '' `` Have you remarked another thing , my friend - that is , since the disappearance of our barks , during the last two days ' absence of fishermen , not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the isle ? '' 
`` Yes , certainly ! 
you are right . 
I , too , have remarked it , and the observation was the more naturally made , for , before the last two fatal days , barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps . '' 
`` I must inquire , '' said Aramis , suddenly , and with great agitation . 
`` And then , if we had a raft constructed - '' `` But there are some canoes , my friend ; shall I board one ? '' 
`` A canoe ! 
- a canoe ! 
Can you think of such a thing , Porthos ?
