Your grief , my friend , was so well worthy of respect . 
It was my duty to treat it gently . 
To have informed you of this misfortune , which I knew would pain you so greatly , D'Artagnan , would have been , in your eyes , to have triumphed over you . 
Yes , I knew that M. du Vallon had buried himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria ; I knew that M. d'Herblay had taken one of my vessels with its crew , and had compelled it to convey him to Bayonne . 
But I was willing you should learn these matters in a direct manner , in order that you might be convinced my friends are with me respected and sacred ; that always in me the man will sacrifice himself to subjects , whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men to majesty and power . '' 
`` But , sire , how could you know ? '' 
`` How do you yourself know , D'Artagnan ? '' 
`` By this letter , sire , which M. d'Herblay , free and out of danger , writes me from Bayonne . '' 
`` Look here , '' said the king , drawing from a casket placed upon the table closet to the seat upon which D'Artagnan was leaning , `` here is a letter copied exactly from that of M. d'Herblay . 
Here is the very letter , which Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours . 
I am well served , you may perceive . '' 
`` Yes , sire , '' murmured the musketeer , `` you were the only man whose star was equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two friends . 
You have used your power , sire , you will not abuse it , will you ? '' 
`` D'Artagnan , '' said the king , with a smile beaming with kindness , `` I could have M. d'Herblay carried off from the territories of the king of Spain , and brought here , alive , to inflict justice upon him . 
But , D'Artagnan , be assured I will not yield to this first and natural impulse . 
He is free - let him continue free . '' 
`` Oh , sire ! 
you will not always remain so clement , so noble , so generous as you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d'Herblay ; you will have about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness . '' 
`` No , D'Artagnan , you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging me to pursue rigorous measures . 
The advice to spare M. d'Herblay comes from Colbert himself . '' 
`` Oh , sire ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , extremely surprised . 
`` As for you , '' continued the king , with a kindness very uncommon to him , `` I have several pieces of good news to announce to you ; but you shall know them , my dear captain , the moment I have made my accounts all straight . 
I have said that I wish to make , and would make , your fortune ; that promise will soon become reality . '' 
`` A thousand times thanks , sire ! 
I can wait . 
But I implore you , whilst I go and practice patience , that your majesty will deign to notice those poor people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber , and come humbly to lay a petition at your feet . '' 
`` Who are they ? '' 
`` Enemies of your majesty . '' 
The king raised his head . 
`` Friends of M. Fouquet , '' added D'Artagnan . 
`` Their names ? '' 
`` M. Gourville , M. Pelisson , and a poet , M. Jean de la Fontaine . '' 
The king took a moment to reflect . 
`` What do they want ? '' 
`` I do not know . '' 
`` How do they appear ? '' 
`` In great affliction . '' 
`` What do they say ? '' 
`` Nothing . '' 
`` What do they do ? '' 
`` They weep . '' 
`` Let them come in , '' said the king , with a serious brow . 
D'Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel , raised the tapestry which closed the entrance to the royal chamber , and directing his voice to the adjoining room , cried , `` Enter . '' 
The three men D'Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of the cabinet in which were the king and his captain . 
A profound silence prevailed in their passage . 
The courtiers , at the approach of the friends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances , drew back , as if fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune . 
D'Artagnan , with a quick step , came forward to take by the hand the unhappy men who stood trembling at the door of the cabinet ; he led them in front of the king 's fauteuil , who , having placed himself in the embrasure of a window , awaited the moment of presentation , and was preparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic reception . 
The first of the friends of Fouquet 's to advance was Pelisson . 
He did not weep , but his tears were only restrained that the king might better hear his voice and prayer .
