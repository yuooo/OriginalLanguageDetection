`` You asked me the same question the first time you saw me , '' returned the prisoner . 
`` And then , as now you evaded giving me an answer . '' 
`` And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you ? '' 
`` Because this time I am your confessor . '' 
`` Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed , explain to me in what a crime consists . 
For as my conscience does not accuse me , I aver that I am not a criminal . '' 
`` We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth , not alone for having ourselves committed crimes , but because we know that crimes have been committed . '' 
The prisoner manifested the deepest attention . 
`` Yes , I understand you , '' he said , after a pause ; `` yes , you are right , monsieur ; it is very possible that , in such a light , I am a criminal in the eyes of the great of the earth . '' 
`` Ah ! 
then you know something , '' said Aramis , who thought he had pierced not merely through a defect in the harness , but through the joints of it . 
`` No , I am not aware of anything , '' replied the young man ; `` but sometimes I think - and I say to myself - '' `` What do you say to yourself ? '' 
`` That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad or I should divine a great deal . '' 
`` And then - and then ? '' 
said Aramis , impatiently . 
`` Then I leave off . '' 
`` You leave off ? '' 
`` Yes ; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy ; I feel ennui overtaking me ; I wish - '' `` What ? '' 
`` I do n't know ; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things which I do not possess , when I am so happy with what I have . '' 
`` You are afraid of death ? '' 
said Aramis , with a slight uneasiness . 
`` Yes , '' said the young man , smiling . 
Aramis felt the chill of that smile , and shuddered . 
`` Oh , as you fear death , you know more about matters than you say , '' he cried . 
`` And you , '' returned the prisoner , `` who bade me to ask to see you ; you , who , when I did ask to see you , came here promising a world of confidence ; how is it that , nevertheless , it is you who are silent , leaving it for me to speak ? 
Since , then , we both wear masks , either let us both retain them or put them aside together . '' 
Aramis felt the force and justice of the remark , saying to himself , `` This is no ordinary man ; I must be cautious . 
- Are you ambitious ? '' 
said he suddenly to the prisoner , aloud , without preparing him for the alteration . 
`` What do you mean by ambitious ? '' 
replied the youth . 
`` Ambition , '' replied Aramis , `` is the feeling which prompts a man to desire more - much more - than he possesses . '' 
`` I said that I was contented , monsieur ; but , perhaps , I deceive myself . 
I am ignorant of the nature of ambition ; but it is not impossible I may have some . 
Tell me your mind ; that is all I ask . '' 
`` An ambitious man , '' said Aramis , `` is one who covets that which is beyond his station . '' 
`` I covet nothing beyond my station , '' said the young man , with an assurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes tremble . 
He was silent . 
But to look at the kindling eye , the knitted brow , and the reflective attitude of the captive , it was evident that he expected something more than silence , - a silence which Aramis now broke . 
`` You lied the first time I saw you , '' said he . 
`` Lied ! '' 
cried the young man , starting up on his couch , with such a tone in his voice , and such a lightning in his eyes , that Aramis recoiled , in spite of himself . 
`` I should say , '' returned Aramis , bowing , `` you concealed from me what you knew of your infancy . '' 
`` A man 's secrets are his own , monsieur , '' retorted the prisoner , `` and not at the mercy of the first chance-comer . '' 
`` True , '' said Aramis , bowing still lower than before , '' 't is true ; pardon me , but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer ? 
I beseech you to reply , monseigneur . '' 
This title slightly disturbed the prisoner ; but nevertheless he did not appear astonished that it was given him . 
`` I do not know you , monsieur , '' said he . 
`` Oh , but if I dared , I would take your hand and kiss it ! '' 
The young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand ; but the light which beamed in his eyes faded away , and he coldly and distrustfully withdrew his hand again .
