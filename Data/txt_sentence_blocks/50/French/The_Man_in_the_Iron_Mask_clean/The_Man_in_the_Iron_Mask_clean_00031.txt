cried Loret . 
`` The nymph of Vaux ! 
thank you , La Fontaine ; you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper . '' 
`` Well , if you can rhyme so well , La Fontaine , '' said Pelisson , `` tell me now in what way you would begin my prologue ? '' 
`` I should say , for instance , ` Oh ! 
nymph , who - ' After ` who ' I should place a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative ; and should go on thus : ` this grot profound . ' '' 
`` But the verb , the verb ? '' 
asked Pelisson . 
`` To admire the greatest king of all kings round , '' continued La Fontaine . 
`` But the verb , the verb , '' obstinately insisted Pelisson . 
`` This second person singular of the present indicative ? '' 
`` Well , then ; quittest : `` Oh , nymph , who quittest now this grot profound , To admire the greatest king of all kings round . '' 
`` You would not put ` who quittest , ' would you ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' '' 
` Quittest , ' after ` you who ' ? '' 
`` Ah ! 
my dear fellow , '' exclaimed La Fontaine , `` you are a shocking pedant ! '' 
`` Without counting , '' said Moliere , `` that the second verse , ` king of all kings round , ' is very weak , my dear La Fontaine . '' 
`` Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature , - a shuffler , as you said . '' 
`` I never said so . '' 
`` Then , as Loret said . '' 
`` And it was not Loret either ; it was Pelisson . '' 
`` Well , Pelisson was right a hundred times over . 
But what annoys me more than anything , my dear Moliere , is , that I fear we shall not have our Epicurean dresses . '' 
`` You expected yours , then , for the fete ? '' 
`` Yes , for the fete , and then for after the fete . 
My housekeeper told me that my own is rather faded . '' 
`` Diable ! 
your housekeeper is right ; rather more than faded . '' 
`` Ah , you see , '' resumed La Fontaine , `` the fact is , I left it on the floor in my room , and my cat - '' `` Well , your cat - '' `` She made her nest upon it , which has rather changed its color . '' 
Moliere burst out laughing ; Pelisson and Loret followed his example . 
At this juncture , the bishop of Vannes appeared , with a roll of plans and parchments under his arm . 
As if the angel of death had chilled all gay and sprightly fancies - as if that wan form had scared away the Graces to whom Xenocrates sacrificed - silence immediately reigned through the study , and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen . 
Aramis distributed the notes of invitation , and thanked them in the name of M. Fouquet . 
`` The superintendent , '' he said , `` being kept to his room by business , could not come and see them , but begged them to send him some of the fruits of their day 's work , to enable him to forget the fatigue of his labor in the night . '' 
At these words , all settled down to work . 
La Fontaine placed himself at a table , and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white vellum ; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue ; Moliere contributed fifty fresh verses , with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him ; Loret , an article on the marvelous fetes he predicted ; and Aramis , laden with his booty like the king of the bees , that great black drone , decked with purple and gold , re-entered his apartment , silent and busy . 
But before departing , `` Remember , gentlemen , '' said he , `` we leave to-morrow evening . '' 
`` In that case , I must give notice at home , '' said Moliere . 
`` Yes ; poor Moliere ! '' 
said Loret , smiling ; `` he loves his home . '' '' 
` He loves , ' yes , '' replied Moliere , with his sad , sweet smile . '' 
` He loves , ' that does not mean , they love him . '' 
`` As for me , '' said La Fontaine , `` they love me at Chateau Thierry , I am very sure . '' 
Aramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance . 
`` Will any one go with me ? '' 
he asked . 
`` I am going by Paris , after having passed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet . 
I offer my carriage . '' 
`` Good , '' said Moliere , `` I accept it .
