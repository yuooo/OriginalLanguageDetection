You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand , and you did not employ him , you did not enrich him ! ' '' 
`` You overwhelm me , '' said the captain . 
`` I esteem you greatly . '' 
`` There exists another man , then , who does not think as M. Colbert thinks , '' said the surintendant . 
`` How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination ! 
He is worse than fever ! '' 
`` Oh ! 
I have good cause , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Judge for yourself . '' 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters , and the hypocritical persecution of Colbert . 
`` Is not this a clear sign of my ruin ? '' 
D'Artagnan became very serious . 
`` That is true , '' he said . 
`` Yes ; it has an unsavory odor , as M. de Treville used to say . '' 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look . 
`` Am I not clearly designated in that , captain ? 
Is not the king bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris , where I have so many creatures , and to possess himself of Belle-Isle ? '' 
`` Where M. d'Herblay is , '' added D'Artagnan . 
Fouquet raised his head . 
`` As for me , monseigneur , '' continued D'Artagnan , `` I can assure you the king has said nothing to me against you . '' 
`` Indeed ! '' 
`` The king commanded me to set out for Nantes , it is true ; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres . '' 
`` My friend . '' 
`` To M. de Gesvres , yes , monseigneur , '' continued the musketeer , whose eye s did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his lips . 
`` The king , moreover , commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers , which is apparently superfluous , as the country is quite quiet . '' 
`` A brigade ! '' 
said Fouquet , raising himself upon his elbow . 
`` Ninety-six horsemen , yes , monseigneur . 
The same number as were employed in arresting MM . 
de Chalais , de Cinq-Mars , and Montmorency . '' 
Fouquet pricked up his ears at these words , pronounced without apparent value . 
`` And what else ? '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
nothing but insignificant orders ; such as guarding the castle , guarding every lodging , allowing none of M. de Gesvres 's guards to occupy a single post . '' 
`` And as to myself , '' cried Fouquet , `` what orders had you ? '' 
`` As to you , monseigneur ? 
- not the smallest word . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , my safety , my honor , perhaps my life are at stake . 
You would not deceive me ? '' 
`` I ? 
- to what end ? 
Are you threatened ? 
Only there really is an order with respect to carriages and boats - '' `` An order ? '' 
`` Yes ; but it can not concern you - a simple measure of police . '' 
`` What is it , captain ? 
- what is it ? '' 
`` To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes , without a pass , signed by the king . '' 
`` Great God ! 
but - '' D'Artagnan began to laugh .
