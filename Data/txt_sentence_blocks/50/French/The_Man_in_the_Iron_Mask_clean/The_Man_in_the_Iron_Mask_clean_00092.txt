I wish , therefore , to seem to believe in your assumption of ignorance . '' 
`` I entreat you , monseigneur - '' `` That will do . 
Lead me to the prisoner . '' 
`` To Marchiali ? '' 
`` Who is Marchiali ? '' 
`` The prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d'Herblay . '' 
`` He is called Marchiali ? '' 
said the superintendent , his conviction somewhat shaken by Baisemeaux 's cool manner . 
`` Yes , monseigneur ; that is the name under which he was inscribed here . '' 
Fouquet looked steadily at Baisemeaux , as if he would read his very heart ; and perceived , with that clear-sightedness most men possess who are accustomed to the exercise of power , that the man was speaking with perfect sincerity . 
Besides , in observing his face for a few moments , he could not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant . 
`` It is the prisoner , '' said the superintendent to him , `` whom M. d'Herblay carried away the day before yesterday ? '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` And whom he brought back this morning ? '' 
added Fouquet , quickly : for he understood immediately the mechanism of Aramis 's plan . 
`` Precisely , monseigneur . '' 
`` And his name is Marchiali , you say ? '' 
`` Yes , Marchiali . 
If monseigneur has come here to remove him , so much the better , for I was going to write about him . '' 
`` What has he done , then ? '' 
`` Ever since this morning he has annoyed me extremely . 
He has had such terrible fits of passion , as almost to make me believe that he would bring the Bastile itself down about our ears . '' 
`` I will soon relieve you of his possession , '' said Fouquet . 
`` Ah ! 
so much the better . '' 
`` Conduct me to his prison . '' 
`` Will monseigneur give me the order ? '' 
`` What order ? '' 
`` An order from the king . '' 
`` Wait until I sign you one . '' 
`` That will not be sufficient , monseigneur . 
I must have an order from the king . '' 
Fouquet assumed an irritated expression . 
`` As you are so scrupulous , '' he said , `` with regard to allowing prisoners to leave , show me the order by which this one was set at liberty . '' 
Baisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon . 
`` Very good , '' said Fouquet ; `` but Seldon is not Marchiali . '' 
`` But Marchiali is not at liberty , monseigneur ; he is here . '' 
`` But you said that M. d'Herblay carried him away and brought him back again . '' 
`` I did not say so . '' 
`` So surely did you say it , that I almost seem to hear it now . '' 
`` It was a slip of my tongue , then , monseigneur . '' 
`` Take care , M. Baisemeaux , take care . '' 
`` I have nothing to fear , monseigneur ; I am acting according to the very strictest regulation . '' 
`` Do you dare to say so ? '' 
`` I would say so in the presence of one of the apostles . 
M. d'Herblay brought me an order to set Seldon at liberty . 
Seldon is free . '' 
`` I tell you that Marchiali has left the Bastile . '' 
`` You must prove that , monseigneur . '' 
`` Let me see him . ''
