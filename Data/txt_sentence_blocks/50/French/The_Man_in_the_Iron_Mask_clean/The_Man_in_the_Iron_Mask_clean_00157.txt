If I remain a moment longer , I shall most likely faint . 
I request your majesty 's permission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes . '' 
`` Indeed , you are in a shiver ; it is painful to behold ! 
Come , Monsieur Fouquet , begone ! 
I will send to inquire after you . '' 
`` Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness . 
In an hour I shall be better . '' 
`` I will call some one to reconduct you , '' said the king . 
`` As you please , sire ; I would gladly take the arm of any one . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan ! '' 
cried the king , ringing his little bell . 
`` Oh , sire , '' interrupted Fouquet , laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold , `` would you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings ? 
An equivocal honor that , sire ! 
A simple footman , I beg . '' 
`` And why , M. Fouquet ? 
M. d'Artagnan conducts me often , and extremely well ! '' 
`` Yes , but when he conducts you , sire , it is to obey you ; whilst me - '' `` Go on ! '' 
`` If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the musketeers , it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested . '' 
`` Arrested ! '' 
replied the king , who became paler than Fouquet himself , - `` arrested ! 
oh ! '' 
`` And why should they not say so ? '' 
continued Fouquet , still laughing ; `` and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it . '' 
This sally disconcerted the monarch . 
Fouquet was skillful enough , or fortunate enough , to make Louis XIV . 
recoil before the appearance of the deed he meditated . 
M. d'Artagnan , when he appeared , received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant . 
`` Quite unnecessary , '' said the latter ; `` sword for sword ; I prefer Gourville , who is waiting for me below . 
But that will not prevent me enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan . 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle , he is so good a judge of fortifications . '' 
D'Artagnan bowed , without at all comprehending what was going on . 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment , affecting all the slowness of a man who walks with difficulty . 
When once out of the castle , `` I am saved ! '' 
said he . 
`` Oh ! 
yes , disloyal king , you shall see Belle-Isle , but it shall be when I am no longer there . '' 
He disappeared , leaving D'Artagnan with the king . 
`` Captain , '' said the king , `` you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` He is going to his lodgings again . 
You will go with him . '' 
`` Yes , sire . '' 
`` You will arrest him in my name , and will shut him up in a carriage . '' 
`` In a carriage . 
Well , sire ? '' 
`` In such a fashion that he may not , on the road , either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may meet . '' 
`` That will be rather difficult , sire . '' 
`` Not at all . '' 
`` Pardon me , sire , I can not stifle M. Fouquet , and if he asks for liberty to breathe , I can not prevent him by closing both the windows and the blinds . 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible . ''
