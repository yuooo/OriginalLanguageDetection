`` Oh , monsieur ! '' 
`` Your movement , monseigneur , arises from an excellent disposition . 
I thank you . 
Be well assured , I aspire to more than gratitude ! 
I am convinced that , when arrived at the summit , you will judge me still more worthy to be your friend ; and then , monseigneur , we two will do such great deeds , that ages hereafter shall long speak of them . '' 
`` Tell me plainly , monsieur - tell me without disguise - what I am to-day , and what you aim at my being to-morrow . '' 
`` You are the son of King Louis XIII. , brother of Louis XIV. , natural and legitimate heir to the throne of France . 
In keeping you near him , as Monsieur has been kept - Monsieur , your younger brother - the king reserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign . 
The doctors only could dispute his legitimacy . 
But the doctors always prefer the king who is to the king who is not . 
Providence has willed that you should be persecuted ; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of France . 
You had , then , a right to reign , seeing that it is disputed ; you had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed ; and you possess royal blood , since no one has dared to shed yours , as that of your servants has been shed . 
Now see , then , what this Providence , which you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you , has done for you . 
It has given you the features , figure , age , and voice of your brother ; and the very causes of your persecution are about to become those of your triumphant restoration . 
To-morrow , after to-morrow - from the very first , regal phantom , living shade of Louis XIV. , you will sit upon his throne , whence the will of Heaven , confided in execution to the arm of man , will have hurled him , without hope of return . '' 
`` I understand , '' said the prince , `` my brother 's blood will not be shed , then . '' 
`` You will be sole arbiter of his fate . '' 
`` The secret of which they made an evil use against me ? '' 
`` You will employ it against him . 
What did he do to conceal it ? 
He concealed you . 
Living image of himself , you will defeat the conspiracy of Mazarin and Anne of Austria . 
You , my prince , will have the same interest in concealing him , who will , as a prisoner , resemble you , as you will resemble him as a king . '' 
`` I fall back on what I was saying to you . 
Who will guard him ? '' 
`` Who guarded you ? '' 
`` You know this secret - you have made use of it with regard to myself . 
Who else knows it ? '' 
`` The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse . '' 
`` What will they do ? '' 
`` Nothing , if you choose . '' 
`` How is that ? '' 
`` How can they recognize you , if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize you ? '' '' 
'T is true ; but there are grave difficulties . '' 
`` State them , prince . '' 
`` My brother is married ; I can not take my brother 's wife . '' 
`` I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce ; it is in the interest of your new policy ; it is human morality . 
All that is really noble and really useful in this world will find its account therein . '' 
`` The imprisoned king will speak . '' 
`` To whom do you think he will speak - to the walls ? '' 
`` You mean , by walls , the men in whom you put confidence . '' 
`` If need be , yes . 
And besides , your royal highness - '' `` Besides ? '' 
`` I was going to say , that the designs of Providence do not stop on such a fair road . 
Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results , like a geometrical calculation . 
The king , in prison , will not be for you the cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned . 
His soul is naturally proud and impatient ; it is , moreover , disarmed and enfeebled , by being accustomed to honors , and by the license of supreme power . 
The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in the geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to your royal highness should be your ascension to the throne , and the destruction of him who is hurtful to you , has also determined that the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings . 
Therefore , his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony . 
Put into prison as a private individual , left alone with your doubts , deprived of everything , you have exhibited the most sublime , enduring principle of life in withstanding all this .
