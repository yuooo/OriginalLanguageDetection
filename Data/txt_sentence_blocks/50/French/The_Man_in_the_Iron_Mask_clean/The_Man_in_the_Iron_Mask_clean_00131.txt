The king will not refuse me , and I will take you with me . '' 
`` Monsieur d'Artagnan , '' replied Raoul , pressing his hand with emotion , `` thanks for that offer , which would give us more than we wish , either monsieur le comte or I. I , who am young , stand in need of labor of mind and fatigue of body ; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose . 
You are his best friend . 
I recommend him to your care . 
In watching over him , you are holding both our souls in your hands . '' 
`` I must go ; my horse is all in a fret , '' said D'Artagnan , with whom the most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in conversation . 
`` Come , comte , how many days longer has Raoul to stay here ? '' 
`` Three days at most . '' 
`` And how long will it take you to reach home ? '' 
`` Oh ! 
a considerable time , '' replied Athos . 
`` I shall not like the idea of being separated too quickly from Raoul . 
Time will travel too fast of itself to require me to aid it by distance . 
I shall only make half - stages . '' 
`` And why so , my friend ? 
Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly ; and hostelry life does not become a man like you . '' 
`` My friend , I came hither on post-horses ; but I wish to purchase two animals of a superior kind . 
Now , to take them home fresh , it would not be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day . '' 
`` Where is Grimaud ? '' 
`` He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul 's appointments ; and I have left him to sleep . '' 
`` That is , never to come back again , '' D'Artagnan suffered to escape him . 
`` Till we meet again , then , dear Athos - and if you are diligent , I shall embrace you the sooner . '' 
So saying , he put his foot in the stirrup , which Raoul held . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said the young man , embracing him . 
`` Farewell ! '' 
said D'Artagnan , as he got into his saddle . 
His horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends . 
This scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos , near the gates of Antibes , whither D'Artagnan , after his supper , had ordered his horses to be brought . 
The road began to branch off there , white and undulating in the vapors of the night . 
The horse eagerly respired the salt , sharp perfume of the marshes . 
D'Artagnan put him to a trot ; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house . 
All at once they heard the rapid approach of a horse 's steps , and first believed it to be one of those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in a road . 
But it was really the return of the horseman . 
They uttered a cry of joyous surprise ; and the captain , springing to the ground like a young man , seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and Raoul . 
He held them long embraced thus , without speaking a word , or suffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him . 
Then , as rapidly as he had come back , he set off again , with a sharp application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse . 
`` Alas ! '' 
said the comte , in a low voice , `` alas ! 
alas ! '' 
`` An evil omen ! '' 
on his side , said D'Artagnan to himself , making up for lost time . 
`` I could not smile upon them . 
An evil omen ! '' 
The next day Grimaud was on foot again . 
The service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished . 
The flotilla , sent to Toulon by the exertions of Raoul , had set out , dragging after it in little nutshells , almost invisible , the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in requisition for the service of the fleet . 
The time , so short , which remained for father and son to live together , appeared to go by with double rapidity , like some swift stream that flows towards eternity . 
Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon , which began to be filled with the noise of carriages , with the noise of arms , the noise of neighing horses . 
The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches ; the drummers signalized their strength ; the streets were overflowing with soldiers , servants , and tradespeople .
