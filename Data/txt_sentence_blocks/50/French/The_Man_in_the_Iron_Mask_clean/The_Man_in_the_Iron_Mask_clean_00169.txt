A canoe to be upset in . 
No , no , '' said the bishop of Vannes ; `` it is not our trade to ride upon the waves . 
We will wait , we will wait . '' 
And Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation . 
Porthos , who grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his friend - Porthos , who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of the sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his companion 's continual convulsive starts - Porthos stopped him . 
`` Let us sit down upon this rock , '' said he . 
`` Place yourself there , close to me , Aramis , and I conjure you , for the last time , to explain to me in a manner I can comprehend - explain to me what we are doing here . '' 
`` Porthos , '' said Aramis , much embarrassed . 
`` I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king . 
That is a fact , that I understand . 
Well - '' `` Yes ? '' 
said Aramis . 
`` I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to the English . 
I understand that , too . '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into Belle-Isle to take direction of the works , and the command of ten companies levied and paid by M. Fouquet , or rather the ten companies of his son-in-law . 
All that is plain . '' 
Aramis rose in a state of great impatience . 
He might be said to be a lion importuned by a gnat . 
Porthos held him by the arm . 
`` But what I can not understand , what , in spite of all the efforts of my mind , and all my reflections , I can not comprehend , and never shall comprehend , is , that instead of sending us troops , instead of sending us reinforcements of men , munitions , provisions , they leave us without boats , they leave Belle - Isle without arrivals , without help ; it is that instead of establishing with us a correspondence , whether by signals , or written or verbal communications , all relations with the shore are intercepted . 
Tell me , Aramis , answer me , or rather , before answering me , will you allow me to tell you what I have thought ? 
Will you hear what my idea is , the plan I have conceived ? '' 
The bishop raised his head . 
`` Well ! 
Aramis , '' continued Porthos , `` I have dreamed , I have imagined that an event has taken place in France . 
I dreamt of M. Fouquet all the night , of lifeless fish , of broken eggs , of chambers badly furnished , meanly kept . 
Villainous dreams , my dear D'Herblay ; very unlucky , such dreams ! '' 
`` Porthos , what is that yonder ? '' 
interrupted Aramis , rising suddenly , and pointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the water . 
`` A bark ! '' 
said Porthos ; `` yes , it is a bark ! 
Ah ! 
we shall have some news at last . '' 
`` There are two ! '' 
cried the bishop , on discovering another mast ; `` two ! 
three ! 
four ! '' 
`` Five ! '' 
said Porthos , in his turn . 
`` Six ! 
seven ! 
Ah ! 
mon Dieu ! 
mon Dieu ! 
it is a fleet ! '' 
`` Our boats returning , probably , '' said Aramis , very uneasily , in spite of the assurance he affected . 
`` They are very large for fishing-boats , '' observed Porthos , `` and do you not remark , my friend , that they come from the Loire ? '' 
`` They come from the Loire - yes - '' `` And look ! 
everybody here sees them as well as ourselves ; look , women and children are beginning to crowd the jetty . ''
