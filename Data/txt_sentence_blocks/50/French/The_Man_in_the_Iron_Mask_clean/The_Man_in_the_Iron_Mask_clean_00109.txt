`` Yes , you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes . '' 
`` Ay , but you aided me in that , my master ; and , a propos , I turn this way and that , without seeing my old friend , M. Vaugrimaud . 
How is he ? '' 
`` M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness 's most respectful servant , '' said Athos , smiling . 
`` I have a hundred pistoles here for him , which I bring as a legacy . 
My will is made , count . '' 
`` Ah ! 
monseigneur ! 
monseigneur ! '' 
`` And you may understand that if Grimaud 's name were to appear in my will - '' The duke began to laugh ; then addressing Raoul , who , from the commencement of this conversation , had sunk into a profound reverie , `` Young man , '' said he , `` I know there is to be found here a certain De Vouvray wine , and I believe - '' Raoul left the room precipitately to order the wine . 
In the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos . 
`` What do you mean to do with him ? '' 
asked he . 
`` Nothing at present , monseigneur . '' 
`` Ah ! 
yes , I know ; since the passion of the king for La Valliere . '' 
`` Yes , monseigneur . '' 
`` That is all true , then , is it ? 
I think I know her , that little La Valliere . 
She is not particularly handsome , if I remember right ? '' 
`` No , monseigneur , '' said Athos . 
`` Do you know whom she reminds me of ? '' 
`` Does she remind your highness of any one ? '' 
`` She reminds me of a very agreeable girl , whose mother lived in the Halles . '' 
`` Ah ! 
ah ! '' 
said Athos , smiling . 
`` Oh ! 
the good old times , '' added M. de Beaufort . 
`` Yes , La Valliere reminds me of that girl . '' 
`` Who had a son , had she not ? '' 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- `` I believe she had , '' replied the duke , with careless naivete and a complaisant forgetfulness , of which no words could translate the tone and the vocal expression . 
`` Now , here is poor Raoul , who is your son , I believe . '' 
`` Yes , he is my son , monseigneur . '' 
`` And the poor lad has been cut out by the king , and he frets . '' 
`` Still better , monseigneur , he abstains . '' 
`` You are going to let the boy rust in idleness ; it is a mistake . 
Come , give him to me . '' 
`` My wish is to keep him at home , monseigneur . 
I have no longer anything in the world but him , and as long as he likes to remain - '' `` Well , well , '' replied the duke . 
`` I could , nevertheless , have soon put matters to rights again . 
I assure you , I think he has in him the stuff of which marechals of France are made ; I have seen more than one produced from less likely rough material . '' 
`` That is very possible , monseigneur ; but it is the king who makes marechals of France , and Raoul will never accept anything of the king . '' 
Raoul interrupted this conversation by his return . 
He preceded Grimaud , whose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle of the duke 's favorite wine . 
On seeing his old protege , the duke uttered an exclamation of pleasure . 
`` Grimaud ! 
Good evening , Grimaud ! '' 
said he ; `` how goes it ? '' 
The servant bowed profoundly , as much gratified as his noble interlocutor .
